        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Boston issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's ban on Harvard University enrolling international students, following a lawsuit by the university. The lawsuit was filed after the Department of Homeland Security revoked Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students under the F-1 visa program, citing alleged tolerance of "anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators." Judge Allison Burroughs stated that Harvard demonstrated it would suffer immediate and irreparable injury if the ban were not halted, affecting over 7,000 current visa holders, including Princess Elisabeth of Belgium. The lawsuit argues the ban is a violation of the First Amendment and Due Process Clause, retaliating against Harvard for rejecting government control over its governance and curriculum.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields retreated from recent highs as President Trump escalated trade tensions by proposing a 50% tariff on the European Union and a 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured outside the U.S. These announcements triggered a sell-off in the stock market, prompting investors to seek safety in bonds. Peter Boockvar of Bleakley Financial Group noted that capitalism functions best when left alone, free from top-down interventions. This week's bond market volatility was initially driven by concerns over Trump's budget bill and Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating due to the growing budget deficit.</p>

He praised Tom Cruise's dedication to performing his own stunts and noted that the film serves as the culmination of previous films in the series. Saxon approached the character as the same person, aged by 30 years, rather than creating someone completely new.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has extended the block on the Trump administration's plans to sharply reduce jobs and reorganize major federal agencies under the so-called DOGE effort, an initiative backed by Elon Musk. The preliminary injunction halts further reductions in force and reorganization of the executive branch for the duration of the lawsuit. Judge Susan Illston emphasized that while presidents can set policy priorities, Congress is responsible for creating and funding federal agencies, and agencies cannot disregard Congressional mandates through large-scale reorganizations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House Republican tax bill, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," does not include an extension of the enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium tax credits, which are set to expire at the end of the year. This omission is significant as the bill proposes other changes to the ACA marketplace. Without the extension, nearly all subsidized ACA enrollees can expect their monthly premiums to increase, potentially making health insurance less affordable. For example, a family of four making $85,000 could face an additional $313 in premiums for coverage in 2026 and a $900 increase in their out-of-pocket maximum.</p>

          <p>Ukraine and Russia began exchanging 1,000 prisoners of war, the largest swap since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed the return of 390 people in the initial phase of the exchange, facilitated by a recent meeting in Turkey. Ukrainian authorities estimate that over 8,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been captured by Russia since the invasion. The exchange provided hope for families waiting for their loved ones, some of whom have been in captivity since 2022.</p>

          <p>Facing pressure from President Trump to increase defense spending, NATO allies are exploring a plan to broaden the definition of what qualifies as security-related expenditures. The proposal involves a target of military spending at 3.5% of GDP, plus another 1.5% for nontraditional "defense-related" spending, such as infrastructure improvements and cybersecurity. This approach aims to meet Trump's demands while addressing broader security needs and acknowledging the need for increased investment in hard military power.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy has reversed its decision to remove 381 books from the Naval Academy's libraries after a review using the Pentagon's standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) titles. The new review identified approximately 20 books that need to be removed pending a future review by a Department of Defense panel. The initial ban included titles such as "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" and "How to Be an Antiracist." The reversal aligns with a Trump executive order to eliminate DEI programs, with the Pentagon issuing standardized search terms for compliance.</p>
