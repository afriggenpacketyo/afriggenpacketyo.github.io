          <p>As leaders from the world's largest advanced economies convene for the G7 summit in Canada, the primary concerns revolve around ongoing trade instability and geopolitical tensions, particularly in Ukraine and the Middle East. Uncertainty stems from the White House's economic and foreign policies, prompting allies to question whether President Trump aligns with them on crucial geopolitical issues. With potential trade wars looming and existing tariffs in place, the summit aims to navigate these challenges, though a consensus may be difficult to achieve. The host country, Canada, has abandoned the traditional joint communique to avoid repeating the acrimonious conclusion of the 2018 summit. </p>

The efficiency of electric trains in converting stored energy into motion is significantly higher than that of cars or planes, contributing to climate goals.

          <p>Assisted stretching is gaining popularity, with studios like StretchLab offering personalized sessions to improve flexibility and mobility. Stretch therapists, or "flexologists," focus on stretching muscles and fascia, but do not diagnose or treat injuries. Assisted stretching can help increase range of motion, stimulate blood flow, and alleviate stress, but it is not a cure-all and should be combined with other forms of exercise. While assisted stretching can be beneficial, consistency is key, and the sports medicine community has questions about the overall benefits of stretching. </p>
