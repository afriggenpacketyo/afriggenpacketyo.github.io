          <p>Paleontologists have unveiled a more complete picture of *Spicomellus*, the world's oldest known ankylosaur, which lived 165 million years ago. Newly discovered fossils from Morocco show the herbivorous dinosaur had long, bony spikes fused directly onto its ribs, a feature never before seen in any other vertebrate. This finding challenges previous theories about the evolution of ankylosaurs, which were thought to have developed their heavy armor later in response to large predators. Researchers have dubbed the uniquely armored creature the "punk rocker" of its time.</p>

          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, has been reelected in a landslide victory, four years after he says white officials locked him out of town hall. In 2020, Braxton won by default as the only candidate but was prevented from serving, leading to a federal lawsuit. The subsequent settlement mandated the town's first formal election in decades, as leadership had previously been passed down by appointment. This election marks a significant moment for the majority-Black town, restoring democratic governance after a prolonged legal battle.</p>

The couple, joined by Travis's brother Jason, watched their alma mater, the University of Cincinnati Bearcats.

          <p>After a decade focused on smaller tours featuring his original music, "Weird Al" Yankovic is returning to his classic format of large-scale shows filled with song parodies, costumes, and elaborate staging. Yankovic explains that he stepped away from parodies partly because the decline of a musical "monoculture" made hit songs less obvious targets, and he wanted to prove his versatility. His new "Bigger & Weirder" tour embraces the full spectacle his fans expect, featuring an expanded band to replicate the layered sounds of his famous parodies of artists from Michael Jackson to Nirvana.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz held a joint cabinet meeting aimed at repairing and strengthening the Franco-German relationship after years of strained ties. The leaders discussed pressing European challenges, including the war in Ukraine, defense cooperation, and energy policy. They announced progress on resolving a dispute over nuclear power and reaffirmed commitment to joint military projects like a new battle tank and fighter jet. Despite the warm display of unity, fundamental differences in national interests and Macron's domestic political instability cast uncertainty over the long-term impact of the agreements.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Japan, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for stable and amicable relations between India and China, stating that collaboration between the two Asian powers is crucial for a multipolar world. This signal of warming ties with Beijing comes as a notable shift, given India's recent efforts to position itself as a strategic counterweight to China in the Indo-Pacific region. Modi's comments suggest a potential recalibration of New Delhi's foreign policy, even as it remains cautious of China's military expansion and navigates a complex relationship with the United States.</p>

          <p>An immigrant from Uganda shares a poignant reflection on the emotional experience of his son's first day of kindergarten in a well-resourced American public school. He contrasts his son's welcoming classroom with his own first school day in a rural Ugandan church with a dirt floor and no windows. The author, who was orphaned by the AIDS epidemic and later adopted by an American family, expresses profound gratitude for the opportunities now available to his child. The article is a moving meditation on sacrifice, generational progress, and the universal hope for children's futures.</p>

          <p>Indie pop artist Tei Shi has released her fourth studio album, "Make believe I make believe," an intimate project that emerged from a creative retreat in British Columbia. The Canadian Colombian singer, Valerie Teicher Barbosa, self-released the album after departing her former record label, giving her greater artistic control. The new record expands on her multicultural identity, blending dream-pop with Latin influences she dubs "Canadianatón" and gritty neo-perreo sounds. Tei Shi also announced an upcoming North American headline tour, which is set to begin in Los Angeles in late September.</p>

          <p>An article outlines several ways for seniors to access their home equity without refinancing their existing mortgages, which is particularly relevant in a high-interest-rate environment. The primary options discussed are reverse mortgages, which are exclusive to homeowners aged 62 and older and do not require monthly repayments. Other methods include home equity loans, which offer a lump sum at a fixed interest rate, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which provide a flexible credit line with variable rates. Each option presents different benefits and risks for seniors looking to leverage their home's value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing number of large, historic family ranches are being listed for sale for the first time in generations as heirs disagree on their future or prefer to cash out. High-end ranch brokers report a surge in inventory of these legacy properties, which are in high demand from wealthy buyers seeking privacy and a connection to nature, partly fueled by the "Yellowstone" effect. These multi-generational properties often command premium prices due to their vast acreage and locations adjacent to protected public lands, though they can also present unique challenges for new owners.

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 people from Venezuela. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's ruling, finding that the Department of Homeland Security likely overstepped its authority in ending the protections. The court noted that the TPS statute was designed by Congress to be predictable and insulated from politics. The decision provides a temporary reprieve for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who have been permitted to live and work in the U.S. due to the ongoing crisis in their home country.</p>

          <p>California's governor and legislative leaders have announced a compromise deal with Uber and Lyft that will allow rideshare drivers to unionize while maintaining their status as independent contractors. The agreement advances a bill that permits drivers to bargain collectively for pay and working conditions. In exchange, a second bill sponsored by the companies will also move forward, which significantly reduces their insurance coverage requirements for accidents involving uninsured or underinsured motorists. This marks a major development in the long-running battle between labor unions and gig economy companies over worker classification and rights.</p>
