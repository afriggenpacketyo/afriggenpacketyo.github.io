          <p>President Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow to advance efforts for a ceasefire in Ukraine. The visit comes ahead of an August 8 deadline set by Trump, who has threatened further economic sanctions if Russia does not agree to halt its attacks. The diplomatic push is supported by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who confirmed coordinating positions with President Trump. The Kremlin has expressed openness to continued dialogue, stating that a political and diplomatic solution remains its preferred option to resolve the conflict.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia is leading a significant diplomatic effort to gain international recognition for a Palestinian state, framing it as a necessary step toward Middle East peace. This initiative, co-chaired with France, has resulted in the "New York Declaration," which outlines a phased path to a two-state solution and calls on Hamas to disarm. The move is seen as both a way to enhance regional stability, which is crucial for Saudi Arabia's economic diversification plans, and to reassert its leadership in the Arab world. While gaining traction with some Western nations, the initiative faces opposition from Israel and the United States.</p>

          <p>The increasing use of generative AI like ChatGPT for academic work is forcing students, educators, and traditional edtech companies to adapt. OpenAI and Google have launched new study-focused AI tools, prompting platforms like Chegg and Macmillan Learning to integrate AI into their own services while emphasizing guided, long-term learning. While many students embrace AI for tasks like outlining essays, some express concern about over-reliance and potential negative impacts on critical thinking. In response, some professors are reverting to in-class or handwritten assignments to ensure genuine student engagement and prevent plagiarism.</p>

          <p>After several postponements, Shakira delivered a high-energy spectacle at her Los Angeles concert, part of her "Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran" (Women No Longer Cry) tour. The show featured elaborate production, constant choreography, and numerous costume changes, highlighting her physical stamina and performance skills. While the concert was visually impressive, some critics noted that sound issues in the venue made it difficult to appreciate her vocal performance. The setlist was dominated by her more recent commercial pop and reggaeton hits, focusing heavily on themes of female empowerment and resilience following personal heartbreak, a strategy that has resonated strongly with her fanbase.</p>

          <p>Mining and commodity giant Glencore has decided to maintain its primary stock market listing in London, concluding a review that considered a move to New York. The company stated that shifting its listing would not be value-accretive for shareholders at this time, providing a significant boost to the London Stock Exchange. The decision came as Glencore reported a first-half net loss of $655 million amid lower commodity prices and global economic uncertainty. While many firms have left London for higher valuations in the U.S., Glencore's choice avoids potential tax implications and forced share sales by some investors.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated boxing rematch between British rivals Chris Eubank Jr. and Conor Benn is set for November 15 at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The announcement follows their thrilling first fight in April, which Eubank won by unanimous decision. A previously scheduled rematch for September fell through, but organizers have now confirmed the new date, driven by promoter Turki Alalshikh. The first bout, which took place 35 years after their fathers famously fought, captured significant public attention. Organizers and fans are now eager to see if the second encounter can recapture the same level of intrigue and excitement.</p>

          <h2>HSBC Expected to Maintain Highest Dividend Yield Among Greater China Banks, Say Analysts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 04:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JPMorgan analysts project that HSBC will continue to offer the highest dividend yield among banks in the Greater China region, estimating a shareholder return of 9 to 11 percent this year. The bank recently announced a second-quarter dividend and a $3 billion share buy-back program. Analysts believe these returns are secure, as HSBC holds a significant capital buffer that can absorb potential impairments from its stake in China's Bank of Communications (Bocom). JPMorgan has raised its price target for HSBC's stock, anticipating its shares could reach HK$122 by the end of 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. artificial intelligence leader OpenAI has launched two new open-source AI models, GPT-OSS-120b and GPT-OSS-20b, in a significant move seen as a challenge to China's growing influence in the open-source AI community. This marks a return to OpenAI's origins, as its last open model was released in 2019. The launch comes as Chinese open-source models, such as Alibaba's Qwen family, have been gaining global popularity. While analysts note that China still leads in the sheer number of available open models, OpenAI's new high-performance offerings are expected to intensify competition in the sector.</p>

          <p>China's campaign to resolve local government debt has achieved its first major success, with the Inner Mongolia autonomous region officially exiting a national watchlist of high-risk debt areas. The region was one of 12 province-level jurisdictions flagged by Beijing for unsustainable debt levels. Local authorities have been directed to consolidate this progress and continue debt resolution efforts. This development signals a potential turning point in China's broader effort to manage the systemic financial risks posed by the debt-fueled, infrastructure-heavy growth model that has been prevalent among its local governments for years.

          <p>China is increasing its focus on importing coffee from top African producing nations like Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Uganda as part of a strategy to secure new supply chains. This push is driven by a combination of a booming coffee culture in China, zero-tariff policies for least-developed African countries, and a desire to diversify supplies amid global trade uncertainties. Chinese companies, such as the rapidly expanding Cotti Coffee, are signing deals to procure large quantities of beans and invest in local processing facilities. This trend represents a significant new market for African coffee exporters.</p>

With the pair having won 11 of the first 14 races, Brown acknowledges that tension will likely grow but believes the communication and mutual respect within the team will prevent a destructive rivalry. He stated that while he expects them to "swap paint again at some point," he is positive they will not deliberately run each other off the track.

          <p>In his second game back from a knee injury, Max Muncy provided a much-needed spark for the Los Angeles Dodgers, leading them to a 12-6 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. Muncy went four-for-five with four RBIs, including two powerful home runs, demonstrating a swift return to form. His performance helped break the Dodgers' lineup out of a midseason slump that coincided with his absence. The game also saw positive signs from other struggling hitters, reinforcing the team's belief that the return of key players could serve as a de facto trade deadline acquisition to boost their offense.</p>

          <p>In a powerful first-person account, 87-year-old Buscarita Roa, one of the last active members of Argentina's Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, reflects on her nearly 50-year struggle.

Roa recounts the terror of the era, the disappearance of her son, daughter-in-law, and infant granddaughter, and the desperate, unifying fight of the grandmothers. Although she was reunited with her granddaughter in 2000, she vows to continue the search for the nearly 300 grandchildren who remain missing.</p>
