          <p>Manchester United's new goalkeeper, 23-year-old Senne Lammens, made his debut to a mixed reception, with fans humorously comparing him to legendary keeper Peter Schmeichel. Despite securing the team's first clean sheet of the season, his performance featured some early mishaps, though he ultimately made two crucial saves that demonstrated confidence. Manager Ruben Amorim explained that Lammens' delayed introduction was to allow him to adapt to a new country and training environment, acknowledging the immense pressure on goalkeepers. While Lammens' performance offered a positive note, Amorim emphasized the team's ongoing struggle for consistent momentum, with upcoming fixtures critical for his managerial future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Turkey faces a delicate balancing act regarding its significant energy dependence on Russia, with over 66% of its oil and 41% of its natural gas imports coming from Russia last year. US President Donald Trump and G7 nations have pressured Turkey to reduce these purchases, especially as Russia sells oil at discounted prices due to sanctions. While Turkey has not yielded to these demands, it is quietly pursuing a strategy of diversification, signing long-term LNG contracts with US and Australian firms. This move also aims to improve strained relations with the US, though Turkey's reliance on Russia for other energy sources, like its nuclear power plant project, ensures continued complexity.</p>

          <p>Acoustic piano sales have plummeted significantly over the past century, dropping from over 300,000 in 1925 to just over 17,000 in 2024, reflecting shifting cultural trends and economic pressures. Piano technicians note that millennials, facing housing struggles, are less likely to purchase expensive instruments for their homes. However, digital pianos are offering a more affordable and space-saving alternative, providing accurate sounds and functional keys that benefit new learners. Experts express optimism for a resurgence in piano playing, believing that people will eventually seek musicality and emotional expression beyond constant screen interaction, suggesting a future where digital instruments serve as a vital gateway to the broader world of music.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed hope for the return of all Gaza hostages in the coming days, attributing Hamas's recent agreement to "military and diplomatic pressure." He confirmed an Israeli delegation was dispatched to Egypt to finalize technical details of President Trump's peace plan, aiming for a swift resolution within days, coinciding with the Jewish festival of Sukkot. Despite Trump's explicit call for Israel to halt bombing, Gaza officials reported continued airstrikes and artillery shelling in the territory. The US plan also proposes a "Board of Peace" for Gaza's future, potentially involving former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a suggestion that has already sparked significant criticism.</p>

          <p>Formula 1 drivers are divided over the use of mandatory cooling vests for the Singapore Grand Prix, the first race declared a 'heat hazard' due to high temperatures and humidity. Red Bull's Max Verstappen opposes the vests, citing discomfort, lack of cockpit space, and potential for hot water circulation if dry ice melts quickly. He argues it should be a driver's choice, prioritizing other safety improvements. Mercedes' George Russell, however, plans to use the vest, acknowledging it's not a perfect solution but has seen team improvements in car cooling. McLaren's Oscar Piastri remains undecided, highlighting both benefits and downsides.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), the largest U.S. Lutheran denomination, has installed the Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, marking a historic moment for the predominantly white church. Curry, who previously led the Metropolitan Chicago Synod, succeeds Rev. Elizabeth Eaton, the ELCA's first woman leader. His six-year term officially began October 1st, following his election in July. Curry's appointment is viewed as a significant step for diversity and representation, as the ELCA, despite being over 95% white, has increasingly invested in local congregations of color and multicultural ministries, while maintaining strong ties to growing Lutheran churches globally.</p>

          <p>Costco has partnered with Novo Nordisk to offer GLP-1 anti-obesity medications like Ozempic and Wegovy to its members at approximately half the usual cost. Through its prescription program, members with a valid prescription can purchase a four-week supply for $499, an offer exclusively for those paying out of pocket due to limited insurance coverage. This move addresses soaring drug prices and increasing demand, which has led to a rise in cheaper, compounded versions and calls for stricter federal oversight. Costco's entry into the market aims to boost access to the authentic medications, as public familiarity and usage of semaglutide for weight loss continue to grow.</p>

          <p>The tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep III, one of the largest in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, has been opened to the public in Luxor after two decades of extensive Japanese-led renovation work. Dating back over 3,000 years, the site suffered severe deterioration, requiring incredibly delicate restoration efforts from more than 260 specialists. First discovered in 1799, its contents, including the sarcophagus, were looted centuries ago. The tomb features a 36-meter-long, 14-meter-deep, downward-sloping passageway and main burial chambers for the king and queens Tiye and Sitamun. Its exquisite wall paintings are considered among the finest surviving from the royal tombs of the Eighteenth Dynasty.</p>

          <p>Hamas announced its agreement to key parts of President Trump's Gaza peace proposal, including the release of all hostages, but indicated other portions require further negotiation. A U.S. official viewed Hamas's response positively, with details like weapons decommissioning potentially starting as early as next week. Following Hamas's statement, Trump urged Israel to "immediately stop the bombing of Gaza" to ensure safe hostage release, expressing belief that Hamas is "ready for a lasting PEACE." Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's office confirmed preparations to implement the first phase of the plan for immediate hostage release, with negotiations between Israeli and Hamas delegations expected to begin in Egypt soon to finalize details.</p>

          <p>Families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza expressed a mix of hope and fear following Hamas's agreement to parts of President Trump's peace plan. Vicky Cohen, whose son Nimrod is among the hostages, described waking with "hope and expectation" but also "fear that something will go wrong," highlighting the fragile situation after previous failed attempts. Udi Goren, whose cousin was killed and his body taken to Gaza, expressed optimism for a deal and a better future for both Israelis and Palestinians, urging for action. While many families dare to believe release is near, their hope is tempered by the continued danger and suffering faced by the remaining 47 hostages, urging for swift and efficient negotiations.</p>

          <p>Veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been added to the Dodgers’ National League Division Series roster, marking his expected return to playoff action after being left off the wild-card round roster. Kershaw, who is anticipated to pitch out of the bullpen, provides crucial left-handed depth to combat the Philadelphia Phillies' strong lineup. The Dodgers made minimal changes to their roster, also adding left-hander Anthony Banda, while keeping their 15-man position player group intact. Catcher Will Smith remains active despite recovering from a fractured hand, with manager Dave Roberts confirming his availability to catch in the series, though his starting status for Game 1 is uncertain.</p>

          <p>UCLA basketball player Xavier Booker is undergoing a career reboot, transitioning from power forward to center after transferring from Michigan State. The 6-foot-11 former McDonald's All-American averaged modest numbers in his previous two seasons, often playing on the perimeter. UCLA coach Mick Cronin emphasized the need for Booker to develop traditional big-man skills like pick-and-roll defense, rim protection, and finishing above the rim. Booker, who has gained weight and fully embraced the coaching, believes playing center will be highly beneficial for his future career, combining his existing shooting ability with new post moves and impressive rim-to-rim speed, making him a unique asset.</p>
