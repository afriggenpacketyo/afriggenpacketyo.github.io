          <p>A deadly terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war. The two nations have a decades-old feud over the mountainous region of Kashmir, which is divided between them. After U.S.-led mediation talks, the countries announced a ceasefire. The rivalry stems from the partition of India in 1947, with both nations claiming all of Kashmir as their own territory.</p>

          <h2>Progressives Should Be Concerned About the Declining Global Population</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-10 08:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues that progressives should be concerned about the rapidly falling rates of family formation, as an aging and shrinking population means a massive decrease in expected quality of life in the future. It challenges the notion that fewer people would be better for the environment and highlights the economic benefits of a stable population. The author advocates for policies that support people in deciding whether they want children, such as less expensive housing, universal pre-K, and better schools.</p>
