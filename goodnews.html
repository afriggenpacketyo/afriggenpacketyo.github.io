          <p>The US men's national soccer team demonstrated continued improvement in a 1-1 draw against Ecuador in Austin, Texas, despite a result that coach Mauricio Pochettino views as less important than overall performance ahead of the 2026 World Cup. Folarin Balogun scored the equalizer in the 71st minute, marking his second consecutive goal for the team and solidifying his position as starting striker. The team showcased comfort in a three-man backline and aggressive wingbacks, controlling much of the game's flow against a disciplined Ecuadorian defense.

          <p>The UK, alongside France and Germany, has declared its readiness to utilize the full value of frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine's war effort, aiming to increase pressure on President Vladimir Putin and facilitate negotiations. This joint action, to be taken in close cooperation with the US, goes beyond previous measures that only used profits and interest from these assets. With over £25 billion in Russian assets frozen by the UK alone, and €211 billion across the EU, this move represents a significant financial commitment.

The proposed deal included capping foreign admissions, limiting leaders' political comments, and adopting a binary gender definition, which MIT found inconsistent with its core values.
