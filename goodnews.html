        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers' star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated significant progress in his return to pitching, throwing two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During the outing, he recorded the fastest pitch of his MLB career, a four-seam fastball clocked at 101.7 miles per hour. Despite his strong performance on the mound, Ohtani went hitless in four at-bats, and the Dodgers' five-game winning streak came to an end with a 9-5 loss. Ohtani expressed satisfaction with his aggressive approach on the mound, marking a positive step in his recovery from elbow surgery. In other MLB action, Seiya Suzuki hit his 22nd home run for the Chicago Cubs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France has enacted a new nationwide ban on smoking in numerous public outdoor areas, including all beaches, parks, and near schools and swimming pools, which went into effect on Sunday. The measure aims to reduce the impact of passive smoking, which causes thousands of deaths annually, and is part of a broader strategy to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032. Violators face fines up to ‚Ç¨700, though there is an initial grace period. The new rules, which do not apply to e-cigarettes or the terraces of bars and restaurants, come as France still has one of Europe's higher smoking rates, with over 30% of adults partaking.</p>

          <p>Mexico secured a 2-0 victory over Saudi Arabia, advancing to the semifinals of the Gold Cup and continuing their title defense. Alexis Vega opened the scoring in the second half after a scoreless first half, with his goal initially disallowed for offside before being confirmed by VAR. An own goal by Abdullah Madu in the 81st minute sealed the win for Mexico. This marks the tenth consecutive time Mexico has reached the final four of the tournament. They will next face Honduras, who defeated Panama in a penalty shootout to secure their own spot in the semifinals for the first time in twelve years.</p>

          <p>Major cities across the U.S. and Canada, including New York, San Francisco, and Toronto, are holding large-scale Pride parades to cap off a month of LGBTQ+ celebrations. While marked by joyful festivities, this year's events have adopted a more defiant and political tone, with themes like "Rise Up: Pride in Protest." Organizers and participants are highlighting concerns over recent political and legislative challenges to LGBTQ+ rights, particularly those targeting transgender individuals. The parades also face new headwinds, including a notable pullback in corporate sponsorships from major companies, reflecting a broader shift in corporate diversity and inclusion efforts.</p>

          <h2>Effectiveness of Collagen Supplements for Joint Health Remains Under Scientific Scrutiny</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Collagen supplements are gaining popularity for their purported benefits to joint health, but scientific evidence confirming their effectiveness remains limited. Type II collagen is the primary protein in joint cartilage, which deteriorates with age and has poor regenerative capacity, leading to issues like arthritis. While some small studies suggest collagen may help alleviate joint pain, researchers and medical professionals emphasize that more robust, large-scale studies are needed to make definitive recommendations. Experts note that while supplements are generally safe to try, proven methods for supporting joint health include maintaining a healthy weight, regular exercise, and consuming a protein-rich diet.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new partnership with major supermarkets and food manufacturers to encourage healthier eating habits and combat rising obesity rates. Under the plan, food retailers will be responsible for making healthy options more appealing and accessible, potentially through promotions, loyalty point incentives, or product reformulations. While the initiative is voluntary and does not impose specific targets, businesses will report on their healthy food sales to increase accountability. The policy is part of a broader 10-year NHS plan aimed at creating the "healthiest generation of children ever" and reducing the strain on the national health service.</p>

          <p>Following a single-medal performance at the Paris Olympics, Japan's national swimming team is implementing a new strategy to improve results for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. The team recently held a "virtual athletes' village" camp, where athletes lived together in close quarters while competing, to simulate the unfamiliar and challenging environment of an Olympic Games. The initiative aims to build resilience, foster team unity, and help athletes perform well under less-than-ideal conditions, such as dealing with snoring roommates or transportation delays. Officials and athletes, including Paris silver medalist Tomoyuki Matsushita, reported the experience was valuable for building motivation and a stronger team spirit.</p>

          <p>A new pilot program in Kent primary schools is teaching children as young as five about sun safety to address the rising incidence of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer. The initiative, led by the Melanoma Fund charity, educates pupils on reading UV indexes and applying sunscreen, aiming to instill lifelong protective habits. Experts emphasize that sunburn in childhood significantly increases adult cancer risk, and with UK melanoma diagnoses projected to rise, prevention is critical. The program is planned for a nationwide rollout in 2026, with the goal of reducing future skin cancer cases by empowering the next generation with knowledge.</p>

The rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, lifted off from Tanegashima Island and placed a government climate-monitoring satellite into orbit. The H2A series, which achieved a 98% success rate over its lifetime, is now being succeeded by the more cost-competitive H3 rocket. The final launch marks the end of an era for a vehicle that has sent numerous satellites and probes into space, playing a crucial role in Japan's aerospace exploration and development.</p>

          <p>An estimated crowd of over 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a major demonstration of solidarity and a rebuke of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The large turnout was reportedly spurred by the government's attempt to ban the march under a controversial 2021 "Child Protection" law that conflates homosexuality with pedophilia. The city's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, defied the ban, hosting the event and declaring that the government has "no power over us." The march, which was largely peaceful, celebrated human rights and served as a clear message of opposition to the ruling Fidesz party's policies.</p>

The league, now working in tandem with the men's J-League, has also seen success with player-led campaigns to boost crowds.
