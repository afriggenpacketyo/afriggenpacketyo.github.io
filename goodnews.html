          <p>Xu Lin, a former senior economic planner, suggests China should aim for a 4% GDP growth target over the next five years. This adjustment accounts for potential prolonged rivalry with the U.S. and the need to address structural issues within China's economy. Xu emphasizes the importance of prioritizing employment expansion and debt ratio control. He argues that setting a target higher than China's potential growth rate would be inappropriate, given international complexities and domestic challenges like property issues and weak market confidence.

The increase is attributed to a more aggressive stance against incentivized reviews and improvements in Tripadvisor's detection systems. The company uses a three-pronged approach, including auto-detection, human review, and community feedback, to identify and remove fake reviews. Boosting and member fraud account for the majority of fake reviews, while paid reviews are a smaller but more problematic category.</p>
