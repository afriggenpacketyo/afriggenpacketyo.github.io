          <p>Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska has launched its annual Fat Bear Week contest for 2025, inviting the public to vote for the largest brown bear preparing for hibernation. This popular event, which began in 2014, highlights the importance of bears gaining significant weight—up to 700 pounds—to survive the winter. Twelve contenders are vying for the title, with voting open online from September 23-30. The competition helps make the remote park more accessible and educates about bear health and resilience.</p>

          <p>An inexpensive, generic drug called leucovorin, typically used to treat chemotherapy side effects, is showing promise in helping nonverbal children with autism improve their speech. Dr. Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist, is leading research suggesting the drug bypasses a folic acid transport blockage in the brain linked to autism. The FDA has begun the approval process despite a lack of large-scale phase 3 trials, with preliminary evidence indicating substantial positive impact. Further research is needed to optimize dosing and identify the most responsive children.</p>

          <p>A preliminary trial of the gene therapy AMT-130 has demonstrated a remarkable 75% reduction in Huntington's disease progression over three years in high-dose patients. Researchers from University College London reported that the one-time treatment, delivered via brain surgery, uses a harmless virus to turn off the harmful protein damaging brain cells. While these promising results are yet to be peer-reviewed and published, they offer hope for the 100,000 Americans affected by the condition. Larger studies are still needed, with potential FDA application years away.</p>
