Kane stated that the team was lacking quality and looked fatigued, both physically and mentally.

Yusuf's initial decision to quit followed criticism of Sarah Pochin, Reform's newest MP, for questioning whether the government would ban the burka.

The latest image of the larger J-36 fighter shows the aircraft parked on a tarmac at Chengdu Aircraft Corporation's main plant in Sichuan province. The image confirms the J-36's three weapons bays and the dorsal intake for the third engine, which suggests it is there to provide the additional thrust needed for cruising at supersonic speeds.</p>

The article suggests that Pomona, with its resources and small campus, is well-suited to experiment with formalizing tech-free options and differentiating itself from competitors.

          <p>The US National Guard, part of the US Armed Forces Reserve, is typically deployed for natural disasters but can be used for internal security and military operations abroad. When deployed within states, the governor assumes command, but the US president is commander-in-chief nationwide. President Trump recently overrode California's governor to deploy the National Guard in Los Angeles due to immigration protests, citing national security. The National Guard consists of the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, with around 419,000 reservists as of 2023.</p>

          <p>A state-backed think tank has put forward China's "four core principles" as a constructive framework for addressing disputes in the South China Sea, while blaming regional tensions on external actors who fuel rival claimants' actions and weaken the "willingness for maritime cooperation." The Xinhua Institute report stated that China is committed to managing tensions and exercising restraint in disputes. The four principles include resolving disputes through consultation, managing differences through co-management, achieving positive outcomes through cooperation, and opposing interference from external forces.</p>
