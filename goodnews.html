        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid market volatility, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a predictable and secure option for savers, with current rates providing substantial returns. A $30,000 deposit could earn anywhere from approximately $317 over a three-month term to over $6,700 in a five-year CD, based on today's rates. The primary benefit of a CD is its fixed interest rate, which protects savers from anticipated future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. However, this stability comes at the cost of liquidity, as funds are locked in for the duration of the term, making it crucial for individuals to weigh their need for access to cash against the guaranteed returns.

          <p>YouTube and Fox have successfully negotiated a new distribution deal, ensuring that channels like Fox News and Fox Sports remain available on the YouTube TV streaming platform. The agreement was reached after a short-term extension prevented an imminent blackout, which had been threatened due to a dispute over payment terms. YouTube had previously stated that Fox was demanding significantly higher fees than comparable content partners receive. The resolution prevents service disruption for YouTube TV's roughly 9.4 million subscribers, who would have missed major sporting events, including key college football games and the start of the NFL season.</p>

          <p>Canadian novelist Miriam Toews's new memoir, "A Truce That Is Not Peace," delves into the profound impact of the suicides of her father and sister on her life and work. The book originated from an attempt to answer why she writes, leading her to examine how these personal tragedies shaped her into an author. Drawing inspiration from other writers, particularly poet Christian Wiman's reflections on grief, Toews explores writing as a means to continue conversations with her lost loved ones. The memoir suggests that while closure may be unattainable, literature offers a way to process the past and honor memory, serving as a vital act of survival and remembrance.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter has released her seventh album, "Man's Best Friend," and discussed her creative process and the public reaction to its original cover art. In an interview, she explained that songwriting is a way to process difficult emotions and that her new music explores themes of sexuality more freely. Carpenter stated that the controversial album cover, which depicted her kneeling with her hair being pulled, was intended to be open to interpretation about control and the lack of it. She also touched on her friendship with Taylor Swift, with whom she toured and collaborated on an upcoming song, expressing long-held admiration for the fellow artist.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Identifies Stocks Poised to Benefit from Potential Federal Reserve Rate Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 12:12:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the market anticipating Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, certain sectors and stocks are positioned for significant gains. Companies closely tied to housing and finance, such as Home Depot and Capital One, could see increased demand as lower borrowing costs stimulate consumer spending and the real estate market. A reduction in rates also tends to make high-yield dividend stocks, like Bristol Myers Squibb, more attractive to investors seeking returns superior to those of government bonds. Furthermore, an improved macroeconomic environment could boost Wall Street dealmaking, benefiting investment banks like Goldman Sachs through increased M&A and IPO activity.

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa has reportedly informed confidantes that she does not plan to seek reelection for a third term in 2026. According to sources familiar with the matter, a formal announcement is expected next week. Ernst, who has served in the Senate since 2015 and risen to a leadership position in the Republican conference, has apparently told associates she intended to serve only two terms before moving to the private sector. Her decision opens up a key Senate seat, and several Iowa Democrats have already announced their candidacies for the position, setting the stage for a competitive race.</p>

          <p>A record $30 billion is projected to be wagered legally on the upcoming NFL season, representing an 8.5% increase from last year, according to the American Gaming Association. This growth highlights the expanding legal sports betting market in the U.S., dominated by companies like FanDuel and DraftKings. Despite this expansion, a significant challenge remains from unlicensed offshore sportsbooks, which are now facing increased scrutiny. Law enforcement and attorneys general are intensifying efforts to crack down on these illegal operations, arguing they cost states billions in potential tax revenue and undermine the regulated market.</p>

High-end brokers report a surge in inventory of these legacy properties, which are in high demand from wealthy buyers influenced by the "Yellowstone" effect seeking privacy and a rural lifestyle. For example, the 40,000-acre Antlers Ranch in Wyoming is on the market for $85 million for the first time in five generations.

He is only the 21st player in MLB history to achieve this rare feat. Schwarber had an opportunity to hit a record-breaking fifth home run in the eighth inning but popped out against a position player, infielder Vidal Bruján, who was pitching in the lopsided 19-4 game. This harmless out averted potential controversy over the legitimacy of such a record being set against a non-pitcher, a practice that has become more common in blowouts but remains a point of debate among baseball purists.</p>

Through cultural exchanges and educational programs, India promotes yoga not just as a wellness activity but as a connection to its rich heritage, building people-to-people ties that strengthen its international influence. While its commercialization in the West has drawn criticism, yoga's universal and non-controversial appeal gives India a unique diplomatic advantage.</p>

          <p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, showed that prices rose at a 2.6% annual rate in July, unchanged from June. However, core inflation, which excludes food and energy, edged up slightly to 2.9%, its highest level since February. The data indicates that while inflation has cooled significantly from its peak, it remains above the Fed's 2% target, justifying policymakers' cautious stance on cutting interest rates. The report also revealed a strong 0.5% increase in consumer spending from the previous month, suggesting economic resilience despite ongoing uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

While Palace manager Oliver Glasner publicly insists Guehi must stay, the club is reluctant to lose him on a free transfer next summer.
