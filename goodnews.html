          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalized, marking the first train company to return to public ownership under the Labour government. The initial nationalized service commenced on Sunday, though parts of the journey were facilitated by rail replacement buses due to ongoing engineering work. The government has emphasized plans to enhance services and invest in infrastructure, but stopped short of guaranteeing lower fares. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander described the move as a watershed moment, noting that taxpayers subsidize rail services by ¬£2 billion annually. The article also mentions that two more rail firms will be brought into public ownership later this year.</p>
