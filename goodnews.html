          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman offered their perspectives on President Trump's recent decision to significantly increase H-1B visa fees to $100,000. Huang stressed the importance of immigration for the American Dream and national future, indicating support for the President's actions. Altman also expressed a positive outlook, stating the necessity of attracting the brightest minds and finding financial incentives to streamline the process. This policy change is expected to profoundly affect U.S. technology and finance industries, which heavily depend on the H-1B program for skilled workers, predominantly from India and China.</p>

          <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has raised its global economic growth forecast to 3.2% for this year, noting greater resilience than anticipated in various economies, particularly emerging markets. The U.S. growth outlook for 2025 was also upgraded to 1.8%, though this still represents a slowdown from the previous year. The OECD highlighted strong AI-related investment in the U.S. and fiscal support in China as contributing factors, but cautioned about significant risks from high policy uncertainty, elevated tariffs, and potential financial market repricing. Labour markets are also beginning to show signs of softening, with disinflation appearing to flatten. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Danish renewables giant Orsted experienced a significant 7% jump following a U.S. court's decision to overturn a Trump administration block on its offshore wind project. The ruling grants a preliminary injunction, enabling Orsted to resume construction on the nearly completed Revolution Wind project off the coasts of Rhode Island and Connecticut. This legal victory provides a crucial reprieve for the company, which has seen its stock tumble this year amidst President Trump's strong opposition to offshore wind, including a suspension of new leases. The firm plans to restart work immediately, offering a positive turn after recent financial challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article directly refutes President Trump's assertion that Tylenol use during pregnancy causes autism, providing a scientific counter-perspective. Experts explain that autism spectrum disorder is a complex condition with multifactorial origins, primarily genetic, rather than being caused by a single medication ingredient like acetaminophen. Although some studies have noted an association, a definitive causal link remains unproven, with other large-scale research, such as a Swedish population study, finding no relationship. Scientists attribute the rise in autism diagnoses mainly to increased awareness and evolving diagnostic criteria, cautioning against misinformation that could endanger pregnant women and stigmatize autistic people.</p>

          <p>The European Union and Indonesia have finalized a free trade pact after more than nine years of negotiations, with U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies reportedly accelerating the agreement. The Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) and an Investment Protection Agreement, signed in Bali, aim to abolish most tariffs on EU exports including car parts and pharmaceuticals, while also opening investment opportunities in sectors like electric vehicles. This deal is projected to save EU exporters around €600 million annually in duties and grant wider access to Indonesia's substantial market of 280 million consumers. As the EU's third trade agreement with a Southeast Asian country, it now awaits ratification by member states. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis by The Baltimore Sun suggests that the deployment of the National Guard to Washington D.C. by President Trump was associated with an 18% reduction in reported crimes during its initial 30-day period. Comparing data from August 11 to September 9, 2025, against previous periods, significant decreases were observed in motor vehicle thefts and other property-related offenses. While homicides experienced only a slight decline, the overall crime reduction was notable. Following this mission, Trump's congressional allies are advancing legislation to overhaul D.C.'s criminal justice system, with plans for similar National Guard deployments in other high-crime cities like Memphis.</p>

          <p>England's National Health Service (NHS) is launching "Jess's Rule," a new initiative prompting General Practitioners (GPs) to critically re-evaluate patients whose symptoms persist or worsen over three appointments without a definitive diagnosis. The rule is named in memory of Jessica Brady, who tragically died from advanced cancer at 27 after her symptoms were repeatedly misattributed to long Covid due to her age. This measure aims to prevent similar avoidable deaths by encouraging GPs to consider further actions like in-person consultations, additional diagnostic tests, seeking a second opinion, or referring patients to specialists. The Royal College of General Practitioners supports this guidance, recognizing the difficulties in diagnosing serious conditions with non-specific symptoms.</p>

          <p>This article celebrates the 40th anniversary of Europe's pivotal first Ryder Cup victory, a triumph largely credited to the visionary captaincy of Tony Jacklin. In the early 1980s, the Ryder Cup was on the verge of irrelevance due to decades of overwhelming American dominance and a lack of competitive spirit from the European side. Jacklin, a two-time major champion, assumed the captaincy in 1983 and initiated fundamental changes, including securing better travel and team facilities, and crucially persuaded star player Severiano Ballesteros to participate. His leadership fostered a new sense of unity and professionalism, culminating in Europe's decisive 16½-11½ win at The Belfry in 1985, effectively resurrecting the competition.</p>
