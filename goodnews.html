          <p>A federal judge in New Jersey has cast doubt on the constitutionality of the Trump administration's attempt to deport Mahmoud Khalil, an anti-Israel activist. Judge Michael Farbiarz suggested the deportation order was likely to be dismissed as "unconstitutionally vague." Khalil, accused of leading anti-Israel protests at Columbia University, argues his free speech rights were being violated. The Department of Homeland Security contends that Khalil lied on his visa applications by not disclosing his employment with the Syrian office in the British Embassy in Beirut.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump are scheduled to hold telephone talks, as Japan and the United States prepare for a fourth round of tariff negotiations in Washington. Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's top tariff negotiator and a close aide to Ishiba, will meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. In previous discussions, Ishiba and Trump agreed to explore a face-to-face meeting during the Group of Seven leaders' summit in Canada in mid-June, with Japan holding firm on demanding the removal of higher import duties.</p>

          <p>United Airlines is planning to re-enter New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport through a new partnership with JetBlue Airways. The "Blue Sky" partnership will allow the airlines to sell seats on each other's sites, and enable JetBlue customers to earn frequent flyer miles on United, and vice versa. The deal also includes reciprocal loyalty benefits such as priority boarding and roomier seats for elite status holders, and is subject to regulatory review. JetBlue's leaders have long expressed the need for a partnership to better compete against larger airlines like United and Delta Air Lines.</p>

          <p>This article explores the merits of a more collective approach to child-rearing, contrasting the highly individualistic approach prevalent in America with historical and cultural norms in other parts of the world. The author recounts an experience in Prague where a stranger gently corrected her child's behavior, highlighting the benefits of such interventions in reinforcing social conventions. While acknowledging potential drawbacks, the author suggests that a more communal approach can relieve pressure on parents and more effectively socialize children, fostering a sense of community and shared responsibility.</p>

          <p>Three large wildfires in northeastern Minnesota are nearing containment after burning for weeks, while crews also battle fires in neighboring Canadian provinces. All Minnesota evacuations have been lifted, with officials reporting that the fires now cover about 30,000 acres. The U.S. Forest Service believes the Jenkins Creek Fire was "human caused," and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources is leading the Jenkins Creek and Munger Shaw fight. Interactive maps from the National Interagency Fire Center provide regular updates on the fire's spread, and donations are being accepted to support relief efforts for affected communities.</p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Trump's sweeping global trade tariffs, dealing a blow to his economic policies, stating that the president did not have unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every one of the world's countries. The court said the US Constitution gave Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations, which the president cannot supersede. The Trump administration said it would appeal within minutes of the ruling. Stock markets in Asia rose on Thursday morning following the ruling, and US stock futures also jumped (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Peng Yujiang, a 55-year-old Chinese paraglider, survived an accidental flight to 8,500 meters (27,800 feet) after a "cloud suck" updraft pulled him into a cloud formation.

Chinese authorities are investigating the incident, and Peng has been suspended for six months because the flight was unauthorised.</p>
