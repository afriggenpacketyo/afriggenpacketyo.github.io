The Colts' defense contributed significantly by forcing two turnovers, which the offense converted into scores, solidifying a comprehensive win on a day the team also honored its late owner, Jim Irsay.</p>

          <p>England's football manager, Thomas Tuchel, has expressed his intention to integrate long throw-ins and long-ball tactics into the team's strategy ahead of the next World Cup. Despite England's successful qualifying campaign, which has featured a short-passing style, Tuchel believes these more direct tactics will be crucial for success on the world stage. He acknowledged the limited training time but emphasized that set-pieces and varied attacking patterns will be a point of focus during upcoming international breaks.</p>
