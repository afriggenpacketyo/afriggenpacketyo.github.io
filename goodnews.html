          <p>Zia Yusuf, who had resigned as Reform UK chairman earlier in the week, is set to return to the party in a new capacity. Yusuf will now lead the party's "Doge team," a concept inspired by President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, announced that Yusuf would assume a more visible role within the party, making more frequent appearances in the media. Yusuf's initial resignation was attributed to his belief that working to get the party elected was not the best use of his time, but he has since reconsidered his position. The context is that Reform UK is trying to gain more public traction. The optimism score is 70.</p>
