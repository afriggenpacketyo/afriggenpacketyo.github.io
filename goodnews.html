          <p>A Chinese student's graduation speech at Harvard University, emphasizing "shared humanity" and global unity, has gained widespread attention. The speech was delivered shortly after the Trump administration pledged to aggressively revoke visas of students from China. Yurong ‚ÄúLuanna‚Äù Jiang is the first Chinese woman selected to be the student speaker at a Harvard graduation ceremony, and her message comes amid deepening US-China tensions. The US State Department announced last week that it would intensify screening and ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù revoke student visas for Chinese nationals.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed an infrared contact lens that enables humans to see in the dark. The lens combines conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles that convert infrared light into visible light. While still less powerful than night vision goggles, the lenses allow users to recognize patterns and signals in the dark, even with closed eyes. Potential applications include surgical procedures, encryption, and rescue operations.</p>
