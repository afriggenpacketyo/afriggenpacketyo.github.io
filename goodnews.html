          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff commented on competitor Palantir, stating he is "so inspired" by the data analytics company, particularly its high market valuation relative to revenue. However, he also reiterated his critique of Palantir's pricing, calling it "the most expensive enterprise software I've ever seen" and joking that perhaps Salesforce isn't charging enough. The comments highlight the growing rivalry between the two companies, which compete for government and enterprise contracts. Despite Salesforce being much larger by revenue, Palantir has seen faster growth and has achieved a significantly higher market capitalization.</p>

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, Utah's Republican Governor Spencer Cox has made a prominent call for civility and an end to political rage. Known for his "Disagree Better" initiative, Cox urged young Americans to reject violence and embrace difficult conversations with those holding different views. His response, which emphasized building a culture of healthy conflict resolution, stands as a notable appeal for de-escalation amidst heightened national tensions. Cox has a history of promoting bipartisanship and has previously warned about the dangerous path of political polarization in the United States.</p>

          <p>Sushila Karki, Nepal's former Supreme Court chief justice, has been sworn in as the nation's interim prime minister, becoming the first woman to hold the position. Her appointment follows days of massive anti-corruption protests that led to the resignation of the previous government and resulted in over 50 deaths. The protests were initially sparked by a social media ban but grew into a wider movement against the political elite. Karki will lead an interim government tasked with restoring order and organizing general elections for next March, a move seen as a victory for the youth-led protest movement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, market watchers are focused on the record $7.6 trillion held in high-yield money market funds. A prevalent theory suggests this "wall of cash" could flow into stocks and bonds as yields on cash-equivalent investments decline, potentially fueling a market rally. However, some experts are skeptical, arguing that a large portion of these funds belongs to institutional and corporate investors who are unlikely to shift into riskier assets. They contend that only a return to near-zero interest rates would prompt a significant outflow from these funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As mortgage rates fall to their lowest levels in nearly a year ahead of an anticipated Federal Reserve rate cut, prospective homebuyers are advised to act strategically. Experts suggest that timing is critical, as lenders often price in Fed moves in advance, meaning the best rates may appear before an official announcement. It is also crucial for buyers to improve their credit scores, as the lowest rates are reserved for the most qualified applicants. Finally, the article reminds buyers to secure pre-approval to make their offers more competitive and to prioritize finding the right home over waiting for the perfect rate.
