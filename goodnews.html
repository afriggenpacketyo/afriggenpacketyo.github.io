          <p>An explosion in the boiler room of a 20-story New York City Housing Authority building in the Bronx caused an entire corner of the structure to collapse. The blast, which occurred Wednesday morning at the Mitchel Houses, sent debris raining down on the street but miraculously resulted in no reported injuries or fatalities. Mayor Eric Adams and other officials praised the response, calling it an "all-hands-on-deck moment" that averted a major disaster. First responders are continuing to search the rubble as a precaution, while inspections are underway to ensure the building's structural integrity and restore utilities for residents.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The pharmaceutical industry is breathing a sigh of relief after Pfizer struck a deal with the Trump administration to voluntarily lower some U.S. drug prices. The agreement includes a three-year exemption from potential pharmaceutical-specific tariffs in exchange for a $70 billion investment in domestic manufacturing. This deal sets a precedent that other major drugmakers, many of whom have recently announced U.S. investments, are expected to follow. Analysts believe this shifts the administration's focus away from punitive tariffs, providing more certainty for the sector and reducing the immediate threat of widespread price controls.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Strong consumer demand for electric vehicles, partly driven by the impending expiration of federal incentives, led to significant third-quarter sales growth for major U.S. automakers. General Motors and Ford both reported overall sales increases of approximately 8%, with GM's EV sales more than doubling. The industry is estimated to have sold a record 410,000 EVs in the quarter, capturing a 10% market share. Automakers like Hyundai are now offering their own incentives to maintain momentum after the federal tax credits end, signaling a continued strategic pivot towards the electric vehicle market.

          <p>The Supreme Court has deferred a decision on President Trump's request to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, allowing her to remain in her post until oral arguments are heard in January. The Trump administration has sought to remove Cook for "cause," citing unproven allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. This case is seen as a significant test of the Federal Reserve's traditional independence from political interference. Cook's continued presence on the board is considered a key factor in the central bank's current monetary policy direction, potentially tilting the balance towards further interest rate reductions this year.

          <p>Walmart has announced plans to remove synthetic dyes and over 30 other ingredients, including certain artificial sweeteners and preservatives, from its private-label food products by 2027. The change will impact approximately 1,000 items across its store brands like Great Value and is a response to growing consumer demand for simpler, more familiar ingredients. This move by the nation's largest grocer follows similar initiatives by other major food manufacturers and aligns with increased federal scrutiny on the health effects of artificial food additives. Consumer advocacy groups have praised the decision as a significant step toward improving the safety of food for millions of Americans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the cost of borrowing through a home equity loan has become slightly more affordable for homeowners. A $30,000 home equity loan with a 10-year repayment term now carries an average monthly payment of around $369, a marginal decrease from costs earlier in the year. The article breaks down how fixed interest rates on these loans provide predictable payments for expenses like home improvements. While the savings are modest, the lower-rate environment makes leveraging home equity an attractive option, though homeowners should compare it with alternatives like HELOCs.

          <p>The recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve has lowered the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate to 6.13%, its lowest point in three years, providing significant savings for homebuyers. For a $600,000 mortgage, this translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $3,648, which is about $360 less per month compared to rates at the beginning of the year. The article highlights that this reduction in borrowing costs makes homeownership more manageable amid rising inflation. It also notes the potential benefits for current homeowners considering refinancing, though closing costs must be factored in. (not investment advice)</p>

The shutdown had drawn widespread international condemnation, with the UN warning it could exacerbate the country's humanitarian crisis by disrupting businesses, emergency services, and access to information. While the Taliban has not given an official reason, the blackout raised fears of further isolating women and girls, who rely on the internet as a lifeline for education and connection since their rights were severely restricted. A senior Taliban official confirmed that all communications were restored by Wednesday.</p>

However, the British Medical Association (BMA) has formally disputed the move, warning that an "online triage tsunami" could overwhelm practices and risk patient safety without proper safeguards. While the government says it has provided funding for the transition, many patients report that online booking systems are either unavailable or lack appointment slots.</p>
