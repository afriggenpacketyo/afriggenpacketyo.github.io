          <p>According to an expert at the World Gold Council, cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and stablecoins, do not pose a threat to gold's role as a safe-haven investment. The strategist argues that cryptocurrencies tend to move with equities, unlike gold, which acts as a hedge during market volatility. He believes digital assets do not present any significant risks or comparisons to gold, emphasizing their different characteristics. His comments come as market interest in stablecoins and digital currencies grow amidst heightened Middle East tensions and a weakening U.S. dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Google's cloud infrastructure experienced significant global outages, disrupting numerous internet services, including Shopify and OpenAI. The outages, which began in the late morning PT, affected multiple Google Cloud Platform (GCP) products, leading to service issues for customers. Google engineers worked to recover service, but an ETA for the fix was not immediately available. This incident is a setback for Google, which is competing with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure in the cloud infrastructure market, though all services are now back up and running. The outage had a widespread impact but was eventually resolved.</p>

          <p>The average age of mothers giving birth in the U.S. has risen to nearly 30 years old in 2023, according to a new CDC report. The average age for all mothers increased from 28.7 in 2016 to 29.6 in 2023, while the average age for first-time mothers also increased. Contributing factors include changes in social expectations, advancements in fertility technology, and the rising cost of raising children. The report also noted a continuing decline in teen pregnancies, which could be attributed to delayed sexual activity or improved contraceptive practices. The trend of people delaying childbirth suggests better planning and resources.</p>

          <p>Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang announced he is leaving the company to join Meta as part of a $14.3 billion deal. Meta will have a 49% stake in Scale AI but no voting power, and Jason Droege will take over as CEO of Scale AI. Wang's move is part of Mark Zuckerberg's plan to bolster Meta's AI efforts amid competition from OpenAI and Google. Although Scale AI counts Meta rivals as customers, the company says Meta's investment and Wang's hiring will not impact its customers or data. The fact that this deal is going through at all is a net positive for the industry.</p>

          <p>Dan Wang characterizes China as an "engineering state," noting its rapid development of infrastructure and technology. China's subway stations and high-speed rail are examples of its integrated transport system, which seems like science fiction. China has built more dams, bridges, and high-rises than anyone else, and its STEM graduates outnumber those of the US by more than eight to one. Most of the nation‚Äôs top officials are engineers, whereas in the US, their counterparts are inevitably lawyers. This contrast highlights the different priorities and approaches of the two countries. The focus on engineering and infrastructure suggests future growth and stability.</p>
