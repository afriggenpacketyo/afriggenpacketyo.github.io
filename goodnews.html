          <p>A Florida man and his grandson discovered the wreckage of a large wooden vessel, believed to be up to 150 years old, while fishing in Aripeka's mud flats. The man suspects it could be a 19th-century rum-runner ship, a theory supported by a piece of purplish glass found at the site. Local archaeologists are now investigating the find to determine its origin, after which the state of Florida will take responsibility for the protected historical site. The discovery highlights the commonality of uncovering historical shipwrecks in coastal areas.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid concerns over inflation and high interest rates, financial experts recommend several practical strategies to curb credit card spending this fall. Key suggestions include creating a detailed seasonal budget based on past expenses, using debit or cash for everyday purchases to create emotional distance from spending, and removing saved card information from online accounts to add friction to impulse buys. Other effective tactics involve setting up transaction alerts to track spending in real-time and avoiding "buy now, pay later" services that can obscure total debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new mural by the anonymous street artist Banksy has been confirmed on an external wall of the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The artwork depicts a judge in traditional attire striking a protester on the ground, and its appearance shortly followed a protest where nearly 900 people were arrested. The artist claimed the piece via an Instagram post, consistent with his method of authentication for his politically charged works that often critique government policy and capitalism. The mural was quickly covered by authorities pending further action.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a communication expert, highly likable people consistently follow a simple rule: they make others feel seen through genuine interest and curiosity. This is achieved through small, everyday habits rather than grand gestures or being overly agreeable. These habits include remembering small details about others, freely giving credit for ideas, responding to everyone regardless of their status, readily admitting when they are wrong, and making time for seemingly unimportant conversations. The article emphasizes that likability is a learnable skill that builds stronger professional and personal relationships.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team faces a critical decision ahead of its World Cup quarter-final against Scotland, as star full-back Ellie Kildunne has been ruled out due to concussion symptoms. Head coach John Mitchell must choose between the less experienced but high-scoring Emma Sing and the more versatile and polished veteran Helena Rowland. Experts suggest Rowland is the more likely choice for the high-stakes knockout match, citing her strong defensive performance and experience at the position in the previous World Cup, ensuring stability for the team's spine.</p>

          <p>Following Angela Rayner's departure, the UK's Labour Party has initiated a fast-tracked election to select a new deputy leader, with a winner to be announced on October 25. Prominent party figures like former deputy leader Harriet Harman have weighed in, suggesting the role should go to a woman from outside London to broaden the leadership's reach and complement the current leader. The contest is seen as a battle over the party's future direction, with high-profile names like Dame Emily Thornberry considering a bid for the influential position.</p>

          <h2>AI's Current Impact on the Broader Labor Market Remains Limited, Economist Says</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 09:30:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An economist from the job site Indeed suggests that artificial intelligence's impact on the overall labor market has been relatively small so far, with most disruptions concentrated within the tech industry. The article argues that broader economic uncertainty is a more significant factor in the recent hiring slowdown than AI-driven layoffs. Furthermore, it highlights a growing demand for AI-related skills, indicating that many industries may be looking to augment human workers with AI tools rather than replace them, suggesting a trend toward retraining over termination.</p>

          <p>Two winning tickets sold in Missouri and Texas have claimed the nearly $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot, the second-largest lottery prize in United States history. The massive prize accumulated after 41 consecutive drawings without a grand prize winner, a drought stretching back to May 31. Each ticket holder can choose between an annuitized prize of approximately $893.5 million or a lump sum cash payment of about $410.3 million, both before taxes. The astronomical odds are designed to generate large jackpots that capture public attention.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the monthly cost of operating a Tesla versus a Honda CR-V Hybrid, based on average American driving distances and current energy prices. It concludes that charging a Tesla at home is substantially more economical, costing approximately $0.05 per mile compared to about $0.08 per mile for gasoline in the hybrid. For an average driver, this translates to a monthly cost of around $51 for the Tesla versus $81 for the CR-V. The difference is attributed to the superior efficiency of electric motors over internal combustion engines. (not investment advice)</p>

Roy describes her decision to step away from literary fame as an escape from a "gilded cage" to better understand and write about the marginalized people of India. This path has made her a hero to dissidents and a target of the Indian government, which is pursuing prosecution against her under an anti-terrorism law.</p>

          <p>This article examines the increasing influence of Southern culture on the rest of the United States, evident in trends like rising college enrollment in the South and the national popularity of Southern music genres. The analysis suggests that historical developments, including the advent of air conditioning and the interstate highway system, facilitated the region's economic and population growth. This has shifted the national perception of the South from a backwater to a significant cultural and demographic force, though it raises questions about the selective adoption of its aesthetics without confronting its complex history.</p>
