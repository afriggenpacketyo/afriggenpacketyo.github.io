          <p>Financial analysts are raising price targets for Broadcom following the announcement of a significant partnership with OpenAI to develop custom AI accelerators, a deal expected to generate substantial revenue. This positive development comes as the broader market experiences a downturn, partly driven by speculative stocks and renewed U.S.-China trade tensions. Meanwhile, Salesforce is facing investor scrutiny at its Dreamforce conference regarding the potential impact of AI on its core software business. The article highlights the contrasting fortunes within the tech sector, with AI-related hardware deals showing strong promise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank is approaching the end of its program to reduce its bond holdings, a process known as quantitative tightening. Speaking at a conference, Powell noted that while the balance sheet will not return to pre-pandemic levels, signs of tightening liquidity suggest the runoff may conclude in the coming months. He offered no new guidance on future interest rate cuts, emphasizing that policymakers are carefully navigating the risks between employment and inflation. Powell also defended the Fed's practice of paying interest on bank reserves as essential for controlling monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Citigroup announced stronger-than-expected third-quarter financial results, with every business division achieving record revenue for the period. The bank's net income rose 15% to $3.8 billion, driven by strong performance in its services, banking, and markets segments, causing its shares to rise over 3%. CEO Jane Fraser attributed the success to strategic investments in new products, digital assets, and AI, which are enhancing the company's capabilities. Despite a 9% increase in expenses partly due to the sale of its Mexico business, Banamex, the overall performance reflects significant positive momentum for the financial institution.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, leaving in place the nearly $1.5 billion defamation judgment against him. Jones was ordered to pay the damages to families of the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting for falsely claiming the massacre was a hoax. His lawyers had argued for First Amendment protections and claimed the financial penalty was excessive, but the court denied the request without comment. Jones has not yet paid any of the damages and has filed for bankruptcy, which may lead to the liquidation of his Infowars media company.</p>

          <p>U.S. federal officials have rejected an exceptionally low bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. to acquire 167 million tons of coal on public lands in Montana for less than a penny per ton. The Department of Interior stated the $186,000 offer did not meet the fair market value requirements of the Mineral Leasing Act. This failed sale, which would have been the largest in over a decade, highlights the declining demand for coal as utilities increasingly shift to cheaper natural gas and renewable energy sources. The decision comes despite the Trump administration's efforts to revive the struggling coal industry.</p>

          <p>A stalking trial has revealed that a DNA test "conclusively proved" that Julia Wandelt, a Polish woman who claimed to be the missing British child Madeleine McCann, is not the girl. Wandelt and her associate, Karen Spragg, are on trial for stalking Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, with persistent messages, calls, and visits demanding a DNA test. The court heard that police decided to test Wandelt's DNA in the hope it would stop her behavior. The result confirmed she was not Madeleine, a conclusion the McCanns had already reached after seeing a photo of her.</p>

          <p>Meta is rolling out new automatic protections for Instagram users under 18, setting their accounts to a default content level guided by the PG-13 movie rating standard. This update will block teens from seeing search results for sensitive topics like "gore" or "alcohol" and prevent them from following accounts that regularly post age-inappropriate content. The new restrictions, which require parental permission to opt out of, are designed to create a safer, more age-appropriate experience. A separate, more restrictive "Limited Content" setting will also be available for parents who want to further filter their teen's feed and interactions.</p>

          <p>Belgian midfielder Kevin De Bruyne is enjoying an exceptional start to his season at Napoli after leaving Manchester City on a free transfer, prompting questions about whether City released the 34-year-old star prematurely. De Bruyne was among several senior players who departed the club, a decision he expressed surprise over at the time. His current high performance in terms of goals and assists suggests he could still have been a key asset for Pep Guardiola's squad. Meanwhile, Manchester City has had a solid but not dominant start to its campaign, fueling debate over its recent squad management decisions.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Home Ownership Dynamics with a Reverse Mortgage</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies the ownership structure of a home when a reverse mortgage is taken out, a popular option for homeowners over 62. It explains that the homeowner retains the title and legal ownership of the property, while the lender places a lien on it to secure the loan. The loan balance, which includes interest and fees, grows over time and becomes due when the owner sells, moves out, or passes away. At that point, the owner's heirs can choose to repay the loan to keep the house or sell the property and retain any equity remaining after the loan is paid off.</p>
