          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, accused of human trafficking and conspiring to traffic undocumented migrants, pleaded not guilty in a Nashville federal court.

The prosecution presented evidence suggesting Garcia's involvement in transporting minors and engaging in inappropriate conduct with them.  A judge has yet to decide whether Garcia will remain in custody pending trial.</p>
