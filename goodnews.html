          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist recently released from immigration detention, stated that the Trump administration's efforts to suppress pro-Palestinian voices have failed. He vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights and the rights of immigrants. New York Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined Khalil, asserting that his release demonstrates the Trump administration's losing legal battle against migrants advocating for Palestinians. Khalil was released after a judge determined he was not a flight risk or threat, though the Trump administration intends to appeal.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from making drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The policy change, which could have stripped universities of tens of millions of dollars in research funding, was deemed arbitrary and capricious. The NSF determines each grant recipient's indirect costs individually and is supposed to cover actual expenses. The University of California estimated the change would cost it just under $100 million a year.</p>
