        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At Oregon State University's Big Fish Lab, marine scientists are studying sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay to shift public opinion about the creatures. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the team examines shark stomach contents to understand both the animal's health and the broader ocean ecosystem, operating on the principle that healthy sharks indicate a healthy ocean. Despite the importance of their research for marine conservation, scientists face challenges in securing funding due to the public's ingrained fear of sharks, which hinders financial support for their work.</p>

          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google X executive and happiness researcher, promotes a "90-second rule" for better emotional regulation. The concept, based on neuroscience, suggests that the physiological response to anger or stress, involving hormones like cortisol, lasts only about 90 seconds. By consciously choosing not to re-engage with the negative thought after this period, individuals can prevent prolonged distress. Gawdat, who began his work after the tragic death of his son, advises asking practical questions to assess a situation's truth and one's ability to act, fostering a more resilient and fulfilled life.</p>

          <p>A review of Karen Elliott House's new book, "The Man Who Would Be King," delves into the multifaceted character of Saudi Arabia's leader, Mohammed bin Salman (MBS). The book portrays him as a ruthless modernizer who has significantly liberalized Saudi society, particularly for women, while also brutally eliminating political opposition. House provides an in-depth analysis of his rise to power, his ambitious Vision 2030 plan to diversify the economy, and the lingering shadow of the Jamal Khashoggi murder. The review highlights the book's detailed research and balanced perspective on a pivotal and controversial figure in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Marina Cooley, a professor at Emory University, shares her experience of adopting 17 different hobbies over a year to combat burnout and find a better work-life balance, inspired by Danish culture. She found that engaging in activities like pottery, tennis, and woodworking helped her reduce screen time, build community, and feel less lonely. The experiment changed her definition of self-care from passive appointments to active, skill-building pursuits. Cooley argues that hobbies are not a reward for achieving balance but are the secret to creating it in the first place.</p>

          <p>Florida was the most popular state for relocating retirees in 2023, attracting a net influx of over 44,500 residents aged 60 and older, according to a SmartAsset analysis of Census Bureau data. This figure, while the nation's highest, represents a significant decrease from the previous year. The state's appeal is largely attributed to its lack of income, estate, or inheritance tax, along with its sunny weather and abundant recreational opportunities. Following Florida, North Carolina and Tennessee were the next most popular destinations, while California saw the largest net departure of retirees.</p>

Run by the nonprofit Mars Society, the facility hosts small crews for two-week missions where they live and work under protocols similar to those expected on another planet. Participants conduct "extravehicular activities" (EVAs) in the Mars-like terrain and follow a strict daily regimen. The analog missions are designed to test procedures and understand the psychological and logistical challenges of long-duration space exploration.</p>

          <p>Deaths from heart attacks in the U.S. have plummeted by nearly 90% since 1970, a dramatic public health success story. This progress is attributed to a combination of factors, including major reductions in smoking rates, the widespread use of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, and improved emergency treatments like CPR and angioplasty. While this has saved tens of millions of lives, heart disease remains a leading cause of death, with challenges like obesity and diabetes on the rise. Future progress may depend on new drugs like Ozempic and wider access to advanced screening technologies.</p>

The report suggests that the "technical" aspects of the negotiations are largely complete, and a final agreement now depends on the "political will" of the EU. The dispute is part of a broader series of trade challenges from the EU, which has been investigating Chinese subsidies and other market practices it considers distorting.

          <p>The British and Irish Lions rugby team achieved a 21-10 victory against an understrength Waratahs side, but the performance was marred by numerous errors. Scotland's Huw Jones scored two first-half tries, giving the tourists an early lead, but the Waratahs fought back to make it a four-point game. A third try from Alex Mitchell secured the win, but the Lions' overall play was described as frantic and inaccurate, with a high count of dropped balls and turnovers. Despite the win, the disjointed performance raises concerns with the Test series against the Wallabies just two weeks away.</p>

The "Kill the Drill" movement formed after a state permit was granted for exploratory drilling, sparking fears of a repeat of the economic and environmental devastation threatened by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill. After legal challenges and intense lobbying, the state legislature passed a bill, signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, that prohibits drilling within 10 miles of sensitive estuaries in the region.</p>

          <p>The Apple TV+ series "Murderbot," based on Martha Wells' novellas, presents a unique twist on the artificial intelligence narrative. Its protagonist is a security cyborg (played by Alexander Skarsgård) that hacks its own programming to achieve free will, only to use its autonomy to secretly watch soap operas and avoid human interaction. The show subverts the common trope of AI seeking to become more human; instead, Murderbot is content being a machine and finds humans to be an annoying inconvenience. This take offers a quirky and insightful departure from typical sci-fi stories about machine consciousness.</p>

          <p>Eight key OPEC+ member nations, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, have agreed to increase their collective crude oil production by 548,000 barrels per day in August. This hike is larger than the previously anticipated 411,000 barrels and continues the process of unwinding voluntary supply cuts. The decision was attributed to a stable global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals, such as low oil inventories. This move further accelerates the pace at which the group is returning supply to the market after implementing significant cuts to support prices. (not investment advice)</p>
