        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the government cannot deport or detain Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil based on foreign policy reasons cited by the Trump administration. The preliminary injunction, issued by U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz, focuses on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination that Khalil's presence would compromise U.S. foreign policy interests. The judge found that Khalil's career and reputation are being damaged and his speech is being chilled, leading to irreparable harm. While the administration could still attempt to deport Khalil for other reasons, such as alleged omissions on his green card application, the judge determined that the current detention is primarily due to Rubio's determination, thus the judge ordered the detainment to cease. The article highlights the ongoing legal battle and the administration's efforts to deport international students involved in pro-Palestinian campus activism. The optimism score for this article is 55.</p>

          <p>A New Jersey federal judge issued a preliminary injunction barring the Trump administration from deporting or continuing to detain Columbia University pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil. Judge Michael Farbiarz's ruling prevents the administration from removing Khalil based on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination that his presence poses a risk to foreign policy. Khalil, a green card holder, has been detained since March, with the administration claiming he supports Hamas, a claim his legal team denies. The judge stated that lawful permanent residents accused of misrepresentations on their applications are virtually never detained pending removal. The article details the legal battle and the allegations against Khalil. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>
