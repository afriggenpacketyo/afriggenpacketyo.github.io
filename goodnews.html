          <p>Philadelphia Phillies closer Jos√© Alvarado has been suspended for 80 games after testing positive for external testosterone under Major League Baseball‚Äôs drug-testing program. According to Phillies president Dave Dombrowski, the positive test was attributed to a weight loss drug taken by Alvarado during the offseason, with the player accepting the suspension without appeal. The suspension renders Alvarado ineligible for the postseason and will cost him $4.5 million of his $9 million salary, prompting the Phillies to explore alternative closing options like Jordan Romano and Orion Kerkering.</p>
