          <p>The Trump administration has cut off new federal grants to Harvard University, alleging antisemitism and criticizing its diversity policies, a move Harvard is contesting as illegal government overreach. Education Secretary Linda McMahon stated Harvard failed its legal obligations and won't receive new grants until it demonstrates responsible management. This action follows protests at universities, including Harvard, regarding divestment from Israel, which Trump labeled as pro-Hamas. Harvard, with a $53 billion endowment, argues the administration's demands impose unprecedented control and stifle research, vowing to defend against this overreach. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to this New York Times article, President Xi Jinping's order for his forces to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027 faces uncertainty due to an ongoing purge of top military officials. Over the past two years, several high-ranking officers, including defense ministers and leaders of the Rocket Force, have been removed from their positions. The article suggests that this internal turmoil raises concerns about the competence and reliability of Xi's commanders, potentially weakening his appetite for war. While China's military has made significant advancements, battlefield leadership and experience remain crucial, and the lack of trust within the ranks poses a significant challenge.</p>

Concerns were raised about the high costs of operating the prison and the potential erasure of the island's cultural significance. While some believed Trump would follow through, most dismissed the plan as a publicity stunt, emphasizing the island's current role as a national monument and tourist destination.</p>

          <p>Credit Suisse Services AG will pay nearly $511 million after pleading guilty to conspiring with wealthy American taxpayers to hide over $4 billion in offshore accounts. This plea comes after Credit Suisse violated a 2014 plea agreement and allowed clients to evade U.S. tax obligations from 2010 through 2021. The Department of Justice said that Credit Suisse and UBS are required to cooperate fully with ongoing investigations and disclose any information regarding U.S.-related accounts. The case involves falsifying bank records and concealing U.S. ownership of accounts, resulting in a tax loss of over $71 million to the United States.</p>

          <p>The Japan Crane Game Association has begun offering certification courses in foreign languages to capitalize on the growing popularity of arcade crane games among international tourists. The "Kuretatsu" certification program, which started in 2015, assesses basic claw crane game skills across three levels. The first session with Chinese interpretation was recently held, teaching basic techniques to Chinese-speaking participants. The association plans to expand the certification to other languages, including English, to promote crane games as part of Japan's globally popular subculture.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the North Carolina Board of Elections to certify the results of a contentious State Supreme Court race, rejecting Republican challenger Judge Jefferson Griffin's efforts to throw out thousands of votes. The ruling is a significant legal victory for Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs, who won the election by 734 votes. Judge Richard E. Myers II, a Trump appointee, stated that not counting the challenged ballots would violate the constitutional due process rights of voters. This decision brings closure to a months-long legal battle that tested the boundaries of post-election litigation.</p>
