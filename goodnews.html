          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 14:30:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Comcast is spinning off a majority of its NBCUniversal cable network portfolio into a new company named Versant, a moniker chosen to emphasize corporate versatility in the rapidly evolving media landscape. CEO Mark Lazarus confirmed the spinoff is on track to occur before the end of 2025. Versant will encompass cable networks such as USA, CNBC, and MSNBC, as well as digital assets like Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes. Lazarus envisions Versant as a house of brands, with individual assets interacting directly with consumers rather than the corporate entity itself, with the aim of acquiring assets to build on the company's core.</p>

          <p>This article discusses strategies for managing collection debt, particularly when debt collectors reject settlement offers. While a rejection can be disheartening, it doesn't necessarily signal the end of negotiations, as debt collectors are businesses aiming to maximize payments. The article advises individuals to reassess their approach, potentially increasing the offer, providing proof of financial hardship, or seeking assistance from a debt relief expert. Patience and persistence are crucial, as settlement negotiations can span weeks or months, the article says. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Palantir's shares experienced a significant drop of approximately 14% despite the company reporting ongoing revenue growth acceleration, prompting CEO Alex Karp to defend the company's performance. While Palantir exceeded revenue expectations and raised its revenue guidance for the year, analysts attributed the stock decline to concerns over declining international revenue and failure to meet high growth expectations. Karp remains optimistic about the company's prospects, highlighting its 20 years of investment and a cultural shift in the U.S. contributing to its success.</p>

          <p>Amazon's Zoox robotaxi unit issued a software recall for 270 of its vehicles following a crash in Las Vegas last month.

          <p>Members of the Syrian Druze community share their beliefs about reincarnation, a central tenet of their esoteric faith. Many Druze believe that souls of those who die suddenly are immediately reincarnated as newborns, carrying over knowledge and memories from their previous lives. These beliefs often lead to complicated family dynamics, with some families embracing individuals they believe are reincarnated loved ones. Research suggests that children who believe they have lived before often begin speaking at an early age and mention specific memories, which tend to fade as they grow older.</p>
