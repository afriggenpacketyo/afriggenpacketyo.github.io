          <p>David Hogg has resigned from his position as a Democratic National Committee (DNC) vice chair, citing a fundamental disagreement with the party apparatus regarding the role of the vice chair. Hogg stated that he would focus on his PAC, Leaders We Deserve, to endorse and support aligned candidates in Democratic primaries. DNC chair Ken Martin acknowledged Hogg's activism and respected his decision to step back. The DNC re-do election is still scheduled to proceed, but without Hogg on the ticket.</p>

          <p>Chinese court astronomers recorded details of a dying star‚Äôs explosion in 1408, providing valuable insights for modern astronomers. The astronomers noted the star's size, brightness, and color, describing it as being about the size of a cup-shaped oil lamp with a pure yellow color. This detailed account confirms that the phenomenon was a nova, a slow, temporary brightening caused by a dying star. The discovery helps to narrow down the star's possible position and contributes to a better understanding of astronomical events from centuries ago.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that a deal has been reached with China, pending final approval from both President Xi Jinping and himself, to secure the supply of magnets and rare earth metals to US companies. In return, the US would reportedly ease its threats to revoke visas of Chinese students. Details about the new agreement with China were limited, but the US Treasury Secretary indicated that trade talks with other countries might extend beyond the administration's self-declared 90-day deadline. The negotiations were prompted by US concerns over China's slow release of rare earth exports.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a new species of dinosaur, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, that they say "rewrites" the evolutionary history of tyrannosaurs. Researchers studied two 86 million-year-old skeletons and concluded they belonged to the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including T.rex. This discovery provides insight into how tyrannosaurs evolved from small hunters to formidable giants. The new species exhibits early evolutionary stages of features that were key to the tyrannosaurs' dominance, such as skull anatomy that gave it a strong jaw.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot deport or continue to detain Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist arrested by immigration officers in March. The judge put a pause on his injunction until June 13 to allow the federal government time to appeal. Khalil was arrested as part of President Trump's crackdown on international students who protested the Israel-Gaza war. The judge stated there was no compelling interest to keep Khalil in custody or to deport him, as his career and reputation were being damaged.</p>
