          <p>Mexico has initiated legal action against Google for altering the name of the 'Gulf of Mexico' to 'Gulf of America' on its maps platform, following a U.S. presidential order. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that the lawsuit was filed after previous warnings to Google were ignored. The Mexican government argues that the name change affects their continental shelf and contradicts international agreements, while Google defends its policy of reflecting local official names. The dispute arose after the U.S. president issued an executive order to rename the northern part of the gulf, leading to Google Maps displaying different names based on the user's location.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party in the UK is preparing to introduce new measures aimed at reducing net migration, which reached 728,000 last year. The proposed changes include requiring employers to invest in UK skills before hiring overseas workers, potentially restricting visa applications from countries with high overstay rates, and extending the waiting period for migrants to apply for permanent residency, possibly up to 10 years. Tougher English language requirements for immigrants are also being considered, alongside stricter enforcement of rules for recruiting international care workers. The article also mentions a review of how the 'right to family life' under the European Convention on Human Rights is applied in immigration cases.</p>

          <p>Lord Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the US, described the recent UK-US trade agreement as a platform for expanding trade opportunities between the two countries. The deal reduces or eliminates tariffs previously imposed by the Trump administration on certain UK imports, such as cars, steel, and aluminum. While discussions about the UK's Digital Services Tax (DST) occurred, Mandelson clarified that abolishing the DST was not part of the agreement. He also noted the positive working relationship between Prime Minister Starmer and President Trump, emphasizing their ability to defend their national interests and maintain trust.</p>

          <p>The British steel industry experienced a wave of relief after President Trump agreed to lift the 25 percent tariffs on steel exported to the United States. This trade deal provides some respite for struggling businesses like Marcegaglia Stainless Sheffield, which ships a significant portion of its steel to the U.S. However, uncertainties remain regarding the implications for products processed in the European Union and the overall impact of the Trump administration's trade policies.

The settlement follows a court ruling that ordered Bristol Myers Squibb and Sanofi subsidiaries to pay $916 million, but a lower amount was agreed upon before an appeal was decided. The lawsuit alleged that the companies failed to update labels despite knowing that a significant portion of patients might have a diminished response to the drug.

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, has been released from immigration custody after a judge ruled her continued detention unlawful. The judge cited concerns that her First Amendment and due process rights were violated when her student visa was revoked following the publication of an opinion piece.
