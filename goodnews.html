          <p>A 4.1 magnitude earthquake struck Tennessee on Saturday morning, with tremors felt as far away as Atlanta, Georgia, and western North Carolina. The earthquake's epicenter was located approximately 12 miles from Greenback, Tennessee, which lies about 30 miles south of Knoxville. Residents reported feeling the shaking, and while earthquakes are not uncommon in the region's Eastern Tennessee seismic zone, this event reminded locals of a similar 4.4 magnitude earthquake that shook the area in 2018. The U.S. Geological Survey continues to monitor the situation, but initial reports indicate only minor damage.</p>

          <p>Yankees prospect Jasson Dominguez had a memorable Friday night, becoming the youngest Yankee to hit three home runs in a single game. What made this achievement even more remarkable was that Dominguez, a switch-hitter, hit home runs from both sides of the plate, joining a select group of players including Mickey Mantle and Eddie Murray. Dominguez's performance contributed to the Yankees' 10-2 victory over the Athletics, highlighting his potential and solidifying his place as a key player for the team. The article notes that Dominguez hits significantly better from the left side, making his home run from the right side a positive sign for his development.</p>

          <h2>Progressives Should Care About Declining Global Population</h2>

          <p>An article in Vox argues that declining birth rates are a serious issue that progressives should address, rather than dismiss due to political polarization. The author contends that an aging and shrinking population leads to economic challenges, reduced quality of life, and potential environmental consequences. The article suggests that policies supporting family formation, such as affordable housing, universal pre-K, and better healthcare, align with progressive values and could help stabilize population levels. The author emphasizes the importance of engaging in the conversation about population decline to avoid ceding the issue to right-wing ideologies.</p>
