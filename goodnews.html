        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price has surged to a new all-time high, driven by factors such as softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. The flagship cryptocurrency was last higher by 2% at $108,955.10, according to Coin Metrics. Cumulative inflows into ETFs tracking the price of bitcoin surpassed $40 billion last week, with only two days of outflows in May. Investors anticipate further catalysts, including regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments, to push bitcoin prices higher. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Senate Passes 'No Tax on Tips' Bill: Potential Impact on Workers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 11:54:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate passed a surprise bill proposing a tax break on tip income, a concept supported by both Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 campaign. The bill, if enacted, would allow workers to deduct all "qualified tips" from 2025 through 2028, provided the tips are reported. While this could benefit moderate to middle-income workers substantially, it offers no marginal benefit to the lowest income tipped workers, who already don't pay federal income tax due to their earnings falling under the standard deduction. Concerns have been raised about potential issues such as the introduction of tips in new occupations or misclassification of income as tips to exploit the tax benefit.</p>

          <p>The FDA is planning a major policy shift to limit future COVID-19 shots to individuals over 65 or those with underlying health conditions. This change would apply to updated versions of the vaccine, with the FDA Commissioner and vaccine head arguing that annual booster shots are not worth the risk for healthy people. Vaccine makers may need to fund newer, lengthy placebo-controlled trials for younger, healthy people to gain access to future shots. Experts caution that lengthy clinical trials may result in vaccines that no longer protect against currently circulating variants.</p>

          <p>The United States and Italy signed a pact to bolster efforts to recover the remains of American soldiers who went missing in action during World War II. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) and Italy's culture ministry signed a deal to improve operations to locate and recover the remains of fallen military members who were never accounted for in Italy. The memorandum also establishes the protection of archaeological sites involved in the search efforts. Roughly 72,000 American servicemembers remain unaccounted for from the war around the world, according to DPAA.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>George Wendt, best known for his role as Norm Peterson on the sitcom ‚ÄúCheers,‚Äù died on Tuesday at his home in Studio City, Calif. He was 76. Over more than four decades, Mr. Wendt racked up about 170 film and television credits. But he was best known for ‚ÄúCheers.‚Äù He appeared in every episode of the sitcom during its 11-year run on NBC, beginning in 1982. On the surface, there was nothing remarkable about the Norm character, except perhaps for his general indolence and taste for suds. But as a regular guy among regular guys, he was highly relatable to countless fans of the show.</p>
