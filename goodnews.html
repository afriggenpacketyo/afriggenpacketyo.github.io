          <p>The U.S. Commerce Secretary announced a new policy requiring Intel to provide the government with a non-voting equity stake in exchange for funds from the CHIPS Act. This marks a shift from the previous administration's approach of providing direct grants, with the new strategy aiming to ensure that American taxpayers see a return on the investment. The administration suggests this model could be applied to other recipients of CHIPS Act funding as well. The news caused Intel's shares to climb amid discussions of further government involvement to bolster domestic chip manufacturing.</p>

The airline announced it will begin gradually resuming flights, though it cautioned that a full return to its normal schedule could take a week or more. The agreement resolves a key dispute by guaranteeing pay for work performed while planes are on the ground. This resolution comes as a relief to the thousands of travelers whose plans were affected by the work stoppage.</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, certificates of deposit (CDs) are offering interest rates that can exceed the rate of inflation, presenting a secure option for savers to protect their purchasing power. While national average yields for CDs are modest, online banks are providing significantly more competitive rates, particularly for short-term CDs of one year or less. This phenomenon, known as an inverted yield curve, means savers can currently lock in higher returns on shorter-term investments. Financial experts suggest strategies like laddering CDs to maximize earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The governor of Kentucky has enacted an emergency regulation to ban the sale of bromazolam, a potent synthetic drug often called "designer Xanax." The decision makes the substance a Schedule 1 controlled substance, allowing law enforcement to immediately pursue arrests for its possession and sale. This action is part of a coordinated effort by 21 state attorneys general who are urging the DEA to implement a federal ban. The drug has been linked to nearly 50 overdose fatalities in Kentucky last year.</p>
