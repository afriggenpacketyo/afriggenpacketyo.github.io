          <p>Technology experts are questioning the Trump Organization's claim that its proposed $499 gold Trump phone can be manufactured entirely in the United States. Industry analysts suggest it is "virtually impossible" to source all-American components for the handset. Ethics concerns have also been raised regarding the venture, with some suggesting the phone is another way for President Trump to profit while in office. The Trump family has not specified which company would manufacture the phone, but Eric Trump implied that initial models might not be fully manufactured in the U.S. The project faces significant supply chain and manufacturing challenges.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Apple in China: The Capture of the World's Greatest Company," explores how Apple's partnership with Foxconn revolutionized manufacturing in China. Apple's influence helped China transition from low-end manufacturing to producing cutting-edge technology, with Apple investing billions and training millions of Chinese workers. By 2009, virtually all of Apple's products were made in mainland China, marking a significant shift in global manufacturing. The book raises questions about whether Apple inadvertently contributed to China's geopolitical rise and dependence on authoritarian government.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Community gardeners in Santa Monica are concerned about a proposed 200% fee hike for garden plots, which could force some to give up their spaces. City officials are considering the increase to address a $60-million budget shortfall. Gardeners worry that the price hike will make the plots inaccessible to lower-income residents, turning the community gardens into a "rich person's playground." While some gardeners can afford the increase, others rely on the plots for their outdoor space and connection to nature. The proposed hikes have sparked opposition, with gardeners and community members voicing their concerns and seeking alternative solutions.</p>

          <p>As college graduates enter the job market, employment and salary prospects vary significantly depending on their field of study.

Data from the University of California show promising earnings for graduates in computer science and engineering, but national unemployment rates for recent college graduates are elevated. Students are increasingly considering the return on investment of a college degree, with computer science, engineering, and healthcare offering the highest potential for recouping educational costs.

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed off on a deal removing some trade barriers between the UK and US, implementing parts of an agreement made last month that reduces tariffs on UK cars being shipped to the US. The deal includes a 10% levy on most UK goods, including cars, and did not address the expected removal of charges on steel imports. The US will allow up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, instead of the 25% import tax imposed earlier this year. The UK government said it would "continue to go further and make progress towards 0% tariffs on core steel products as agreed".</p>
