          <p>A rescue operation is in progress in northern British Columbia, Canada, to free three miners trapped underground following a mine collapse. The workers are located in a refuge chamber with sufficient air, food, and water, but communication was lost after a second cave-in occurred. The mining company, Newmont, is using specialized drones and remote-controlled equipment to assess the debris and plan a safe extraction. The incident occurred at the Red Chris copper and gold mine, where production has been suspended during the rescue efforts.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Make Breakthrough Observation of Quantum Friction in Graphene</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 22:00:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from China's Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics has, for the first time, directly observed quantum friction between solid surfaces using folded graphene. Their findings, published in Nature Communications, revealed a counterintuitive effect where thicker folds of the material sometimes slid more easily. This phenomenon is attributed to changes in electron movement within the bent material, which reduces the conversion of motion into heat. The discovery could pave the way for creating ultra-efficient nanodevices with minimal wear and tear.</p>

          <p>Princeton, a city north of Dallas, Texas, has been identified by the Census Bureau as the fastest-growing city in the United States, with its population soaring from 17,000 to 37,000 in just a few years. This explosive growth is driven by affordable housing, attracting many first-time homeowners who are priced out of the larger Dallas market. However, the rapid expansion has created significant growing pains, forcing the city to pause construction to allow its infrastructure, such as sewer lines and roads, to catch up. The city anticipates its population could reach 100,000 within five years.</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams, age 45, was defeated by Magdalena Frech in the second round of the DC Open, ending her attempt at a first winning streak since 2019. Earlier in the tournament, Williams had become the oldest woman to win a tour-level match since 2004, marking a significant moment in her return to the sport. Williams had been absent from the tour for over a year, partly due to surgery for uterine fibroids. Despite the loss, she received a standing ovation from the crowd, celebrating her remarkable longevity and competitive spirit.</p>

          <p>The D.C. city council chairman has announced a deal with the Washington Commanders for a new stadium at the RFK Stadium site, moving forward despite President Trump's recent threat to block any agreement unless the team reverts to its former name. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson expressed confidence that the deal, which includes significant revenue benefits for the city, will pass an upcoming vote. The proposal still faces hurdles, including the formal transfer of the federal land to the city. The move is seen by supporters as a major opportunity for local job creation and investment.</p>

          <p>When automated systems at the U.S. Postal Service cannot read an address due to poor handwriting, the mail is not returned to sender but is digitally routed to a special facility in Salt Lake City, Utah. At this Remote Encoding Center, hundreds of "keyers" work around the clock to decipher millions of images of hard-to-read addresses every day. These specialists can process around 900 items per hour, ensuring that even the most illegibly addressed letters and packages reach their intended destinations. This crucial, human-powered step helps maintain the flow of mail across the country.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has launched a new program to deliver food, groceries, and medicine to immigrant parishioners who are afraid to leave their homes due to ongoing immigration raids. The initiative aims to support vulnerable members of its community, whom the Archbishop described as hardworking contributors now living in fear. The program leverages existing parish networks developed during the COVID-19 pandemic and is funded by donations, including from businessman Rick Caruso.

          <p>This article observes that the 2028 Democratic presidential primary has unofficially begun, as potential candidates like Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom increase their media appearances on non-traditional platforms. This strategy is seen as an attempt to reach a broader audience beyond the typical liberal base, a lesson learned from the 2024 election. These hopefuls are also beginning to shift their rhetoric, with some taking more moderate stances on cultural issues to appeal to a wider electorate. This activity signals a course correction and an effort to redefine the party's image.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that major technology companies are not over-investing in artificial intelligence but are, in fact, underspending. He argues that the race for AI dominance is a "winner-take-all" situation, and reduced spending would signal a lack of belief in one's ability to win. Citing Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased capital expenditure as evidence, Cramer believes the investments are both urgent and necessary for future profitability. He suggests the company that develops the most accurate AI will secure a near-monopoly and massive profits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With regulators like the U.S. FDA banning or discouraging artificial food colorings like Red Dye No. 3, technology firms are racing to develop stable and vibrant natural alternatives. Companies like French firm Fermentalg are using microalgae to create pigments, such as a new blue color that was recently approved for use in food. The challenge lies in creating natural colors that are as vivid and have as long a shelf life as their synthetic counterparts. Major food giants have pledged to phase out artificial dyes, creating a significant market opportunity.</p>
