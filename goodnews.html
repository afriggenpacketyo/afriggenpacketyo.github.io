        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's opposition candidate Lee Jae-myung secured a decisive victory in the presidential election, succeeding Yoon Suk Yeol, whose term was marred by political turmoil and impeachment. Lee's win reflects a public rejection of the ruling People Power Party (PPP), which was implicated in Yoon's controversial martial law order. Lee aims to prioritize restoring South Korea's democracy and uniting a polarized nation. He faces immediate challenges, including navigating trade negotiations with the U.S. and addressing pending legal trials, but his victory signals a potential shift towards greater stability in South Korean politics. The political climate remains tense, with a strong base of Yoon supporters likely to challenge Lee's efforts at reconciliation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks, both prominent cybersecurity firms, are valued differently by Wall Street due to their growth potential and business models. CrowdStrike's higher price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio reflects investor expectations of faster growth, driven by its software subscription model, which yields higher margins. Palo Alto Networks, with a mix of hardware and software, is seen as a more cyclical investment, resulting in a lower P/E ratio. Despite both stocks being expensive by PEG ratio standards, their leadership positions in the cybersecurity sector justify a premium. Jim Cramer holds both companies in his portfolio, viewing them as long-term investments in a mission-critical industry. (not investment advice)</p>

While acknowledging Musk's volatility and recklessness, the author argues that he is driven by a grand vision of saving humanity from extinction by colonizing Mars. The author suggests that Musk's recent foray into politics, while controversial, will be a minor detail compared to his space program's potential success. The piece draws parallels between Musk and Cecil Rhodes, another businessman, politician, and visionary who shaped history through his actions.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Opera concluded its season with a new production of Verdi's "Rigoletto," a politically charged staging set in fascist Italy. The production, directed by Tomer Zvulun, emphasizes the jester's role as an outsider facing mob rule, drawing inspiration from films by Fellini and Bu√±uel. Baritone Quinn Kelsey delivers a gripping performance as Rigoletto, supported by James Conlon's conducting, which brings humanity to the character's anger. Despite some shortcomings in the set design, the strength of the cast and Conlon's direction save the production, marking a step forward for L.A. Opera's interpretation of the opera.</p>

          <p>With forecasts predicting above-normal temperatures this summer, Americans are expected to increase their air conditioner usage, leading to higher electricity bills. Home electricity bills are projected to reach a 12-year high, impacting lower-income households the most. Experts recommend using fans, regularly changing AC filters, and setting AC temperatures between 70¬∞F and 78¬∞F to conserve energy. Additional tips include using indoor plants for shade, keeping curtains closed, and unplugging unused appliances. Utility companies and state governments offer programs and financial assistance to help manage energy costs, and long-term investments like improved insulation and smart thermostats can provide lasting savings.</p>

          <p>Lindsey Graham, known for aligning his views with President Trump, is now advocating for tougher sanctions on Russia, introducing the Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025. This shift comes as Trump's efforts to negotiate a ceasefire in Ukraine have failed, leading to growing frustration with Putin. The bill proposes "bone-breaking sanctions" on Putin and a 500% tariff on goods from countries buying Russian oil, potentially targeting China and India. While the bill's fate depends on Trump's approval, his recent criticism of Putin has emboldened some Republicans to speak out on the conflict, with Graham leading the charge.</p>
