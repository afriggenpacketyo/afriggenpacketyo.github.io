          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that if the U.S. continues to impose restrictions on AI semiconductor exports to China, Huawei will capitalize on its position in the Chinese market. While acknowledging Nvidia's technological lead, Huang warned that Huawei could dominate the Chinese market if U.S. firms are unable to participate. This comes as Beijing focuses on bolstering domestic firms like Huawei to create its own AI chip ecosystem amid U.S. export curbs, however Huawei's CEO Ren Zhengfei said Huawei's single chip is still behind the U.S. by a generation. This strategic shift highlights the ongoing tech competition between the U.S. and China. </p>

The plan aims to incentivize schools to provide value for the money students spend on education. Colleges with lower tuition, debt loads, and strong student outcomes would receive "PROMISE Grants." However, experts point out flaws in the plan, including the omission of defaulted loans and the reliance on data that is not currently available. (not investment advice)</p>
