          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order creating a new designation for countries that wrongfully detain or hold American citizens hostage. This measure allows the U.S. to impose sanctions, export controls, and travel restrictions, similar to the tools used against state sponsors of terrorism. The order is intended to deter nations from using detained Americans as political leverage and to secure the release of those currently held. The action follows several high-profile prisoner swaps and is supported by families of former detainees, such as the Levinsons and Paul Whelan.</p>

          <p>Mayor Eric Adams of New York City has publicly refuted rumors that he would exit the mayoral race, asserting his commitment to running as an independent and defeating Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani. During a press conference, Adams criticized both Mamdani and fellow independent candidate Andrew Cuomo, labeling them as out-of-touch "spoiled brats." He also denied reports of discussions about a potential role in the Trump administration, stating he is focused on campaigning across the five boroughs and continuing his work as mayor for another term.</p>

          <p>Reigning champions Chelsea started their Women's Super League title defense with a win against Manchester City at Stamford Bridge. Despite not being at their peak performance, Chelsea demonstrated their characteristic ruthlessness to secure the victory. Debutant Ellie Carpenter, a key signing from Lyon, made an immediate impact by assisting the opening goal for Aggie Beever-Jones. While Manchester City showed creative pressure and a new dynamic style under manager Andree Jeglertz, they were unable to convert their chances, allowing Chelsea to claim an important early-season psychological advantage over a title rival.</p>

          <p>Scotland's national football team began their World Cup qualifying campaign with a hard-fought 0-0 draw against Denmark in Copenhagen. Head coach Steve Clarke praised the result as a "good start" but emphasized the need for consistent performance in the upcoming matches to secure a spot in the finals for the first time since 1998. Clarke employed a flexible tactical formation to counter Denmark's physicality, a lesson learned from a previous defeat. The result provides a solid foundation for the team as they prepare to face Belarus next in their group.</p>

          <p>Giorgio Armani, the iconic Italian designer who died at 91, fundamentally transformed Hollywood's relationship with high fashion, turning the red carpet into a global runway. Beginning his solo career in 1975, he became renowned for his unstructured, elegant suits that projected an "effortless elegance" for both men and women. Armani's strategic decision to dress film stars, starting with Richard Gere in "American Gigolo," and establish a strong presence in Los Angeles cemented his status as Hollywood's premier couturier. His legacy lies in harnessing celebrity power to build a global empire and making designer fashion an integral part of cinematic culture.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has ruled that the Trump administration's attempt to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Venezuela and Haiti was unlawful. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen's decision sets aside the termination of legal protections and work permits for these individuals, finding that the Department of Homeland Security acted improperly and exceeded its authority. The judge criticized the "unprecedented" speed and manner of the decision-making process under Secretary Kristi Noem.

          <p>Nearly a year after his appointment, England manager Thomas Tuchel's tactical vision for the national team remains a subject of analysis due to a limited number of matches. Having managed only four games, his approach has shown a preference for a 4-4-1-1 formation that adapts into a 2-3-5 or 3-2-5 shape during build-up play, emphasizing ball dominance and physical imposition. While squad selections have included a few new faces, some choices have been questioned. Statistical comparisons to the previous era are broadly similar, but signs of a more aggressive pressing style are emerging as the team builds towards the World Cup.</p>
