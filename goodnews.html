          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1 in the United States, which is associated with an increase in cases in China and Hong Kong.

Despite the detection of the new variant, emergency room visits for influenza, COVID, and RSV remain very low across most states, according to recent CDC data. The CDC is also monitoring wastewater testing, which indicates that most states are experiencing low levels of COVID-19, except for South Dakota, which is experiencing high levels.</p>

          <p>President Trump delivered the commencement address at West Point, amid his administration's crackdown on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in military academies. Recent changes include disbanding student clubs focused on race and gender and removing books related to diversity from academy libraries. Critics argue these actions undermine the values and education of the academies, while supporters claim they aim to restore a merit-based system. The speech occurred amidst planned protests against the administration's policies, with Trump previously criticizing the health of his Democratic opponents after his 2020 West Point address.</p>

          <p>Violent crime rates in the United States have experienced a significant decline after a spike during the pandemic, returning to pre-pandemic levels and potentially reaching historic lows. FBI data indicates that murder rates decreased nearly 12% in 2023 and continued to fall in 2024, driven by factors such as the easing of pandemic-related disruptions and government initiatives to reduce violence. Despite the positive trends, public perception lags behind reality, with many Americans still believing that crime is rising. Experts emphasize the importance of acknowledging these improvements to support effective reforms and reduce fear-driven responses.</p>

          <p>A study in Alabama demonstrates that climate-resilient construction methods, specifically those meeting Fortified standards, significantly reduce hurricane damage to homes, benefiting both homeowners and insurers. Homes built or retrofitted to these standards experienced fewer and less costly insurance claims during Hurricane Sally in 2020. The study suggests that mandatory insurance discounts and grant programs for Fortified construction could serve as a national model for increasing insurability and safety. The initiative has stabilized Alabama's insurance market and encouraged broader adoption of resilience measures.</p>

          <p>Social Security recipients who receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) will receive two checks in May due to calendar quirks, with the June payment issued early because June 1 falls on a weekend. This means that SSI beneficiaries will not receive a payment in June. This recurring calendar quirk also occurs in August and October. Those who receive both SSI and traditional Social Security payments will receive three benefit payments in May.</p>

          <h2>Defund the Police Movement Sees Progress in Austin and Seattle</h2>

          <p>Despite claims that the movement to defund the police failed, Austin and Seattle are seeing progress in shifting funds to social services and community-led initiatives. While many cities backtracked on initial promises to reduce police budgets, Austin and Seattle have invested in homelessness services and non-police crisis response units. Organizers emphasize that the movement has sparked important conversations about city priorities and reimagining public safety. The successes in these cities demonstrate the potential for communities to address social issues through alternative approaches.</p>
