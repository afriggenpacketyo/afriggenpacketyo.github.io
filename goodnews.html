          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil on bail, determining that he is neither a flight risk nor a threat to the community. Khalil, a prominent figure in pro-Palestinian protests, had been detained for over three months, leading to demonstrations in New York and Washington, D.C. The government argued that his activism impacted U.S. foreign policy and sought his deportation, but the judge ruled that the government's justification was likely unconstitutional. Khalil criticized the Trump administration for targeting him due to his protests against military actions, while the White House maintains that the judge lacked jurisdiction to order his release.</p>

          <p>New emails obtained by WRAL reveal Bill Belichick addressing the controversy surrounding his relationship with Jordon Hudson, a 24-year-old model, after a "CBS Sunday Morning" interview. Belichick claimed CBS secretly focused a camera on Hudson, despite her request to sit off-camera, and that she was preventing the interview from probing into personal matters. He stated he met Hudson randomly on a flight in 2021 and that she contributed creatively to his book, "The Art of Winning: Lessons from a Life in Football." Belichick also addressed reports that he requested Hudson be copied on his emails, clarifying she assists him with personal media and has no involvement with the UNC football program beyond that intersection.</p>

          <p>With summer approaching, the question of whether shorts are appropriate for the office remains a contentious topic as companies re-evaluate dress codes. While some companies, like Canny Creative, embrace a casual approach allowing employees to wear shorts for comfort, others maintain a more formal expectation, particularly for client-facing roles. Stylists emphasize that the appropriateness of shorts depends heavily on context, with tailored, formal shorts being more acceptable than beach, sports, or denim styles. A 2022 poll indicated that a majority of Britons found it acceptable for men to wear shorts in the office, but personal preferences and company culture play a significant role.</p>

          <p>Romance fiction, particularly the blend of romance and fantasy known as romantasy, is experiencing a surge in popularity, driven by BookTok and a dedicated community of readers. This has pushed UK fiction revenue above ¬£1 billion for the first time, challenging critics who dismiss the genre as mere "smut." While some readers and industry experts believe attitudes towards romance are improving, others contend that sexism continues to prevent the genre from achieving mainstream recognition. Despite commercial success, critical appraisal of romance books remains lacking, with broadsheets rarely reviewing them.</p>
