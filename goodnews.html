          <p>Deodorant brand Mitchum has issued an apology after numerous customers reported severe skin irritation, including itching, burning, and rashes, from its 48-hour roll-on products. Consumers took to social media to share their experiences, with some describing the pain as feeling like their armpits were "on fire." The company stated that a change in the manufacturing process for a raw material, not a formula change, was the cause. Mitchum is now removing the affected batches from stores in the UK, Ireland, and South Africa and has reverted to its original manufacturing process.</p>

          <p>One year after Brian Niccol took over as CEO, Starbucks is undergoing significant changes to revive its brand and reverse declining sales, with mixed results so far. Niccol's "Back to Starbucks" strategy focuses on improving the customer experience by reintroducing personal touches, enhancing store ambiance, and aiming for faster service. While some customers are returning, the company still faces shrinking traffic, and its stock has fallen 7% over the past year. The turnaround plan has also involved corporate layoffs, a stricter return-to-office policy, and ongoing tensions with the Starbucks Workers United union.</p>

          <p>Chester-based artist Hayden Richard is celebrating the Philadelphia Eagles with a powerful painting of a bald eagle, a piece he started even before the team's last Super Bowl victory. The artwork, which features no players or stadiums, aims to embody the strength and pride of the team and the city. After losing his job as a chef, Richard returned to his passion for art, which he has pursued since childhood in Trinidad. He hopes the painting will be acquired by the Eagles' ownership or players, viewing it as a tribute to "Bird Nation."</p>

          <p>A 57-year-old man has been arrested following a partial evacuation of Terminal 4 at London's Heathrow Airport. The incident, which is not being treated as terrorism-related, occurred after a can of CS spray was discovered, causing irritation to people in the vicinity. Hundreds of travelers were forced to leave the terminal for three hours while authorities investigated. The London Ambulance Service treated 20 people at the scene for minor irritation before they were discharged, and the suspect is now in police custody for further questioning.</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer has announced a strategic portfolio adjustment, trimming its position in Goldman Sachs following the stock's recent surge to a record high. The club is selling 10 shares to lock in profits, citing the company's strong performance and a recent pickup in M&A and IPO activity. Proceeds from the sale are being reinvested into Texas Roadhouse, with the purchase of 40 shares, as the steakhouse chain's stock has recently declined due to margin pressures from high beef prices.

          <p>Americans, particularly younger generations like Gen Z, are increasingly favoring debit cards over credit cards, signaling a cultural shift driven by a fear of accumulating debt. While credit cards once dominated transactions, debit usage has steadily climbed, fueled by a desire for greater financial control and influenced by events like the Great Recession. This trend has prompted financial companies, including Venmo and Klarna, to launch new debit cards with rewards programs to attract these consumers. The preference for debit reflects a conscious effort by many to live within their means.</p>
