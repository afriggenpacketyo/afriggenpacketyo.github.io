          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration from revoking Harvard's ability to enroll international students. The decision halts, at least temporarily, the administration's efforts to restrict international visas for students and scholars. Harvard, which has nearly 7,000 international students, argued that the restrictions would harm its academic environment and financial stability. The judge's ruling maintains the status quo, allowing Harvard to continue enrolling international students while the legal battle continues, providing temporary relief for international students concerned about their ability to study in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Harvard's graduation day was marked by both celebrations and protests amid the university's ongoing fight with the Trump administration. Students and families gathered with signs protesting the government's attacks on the university, while others protested campus antisemitism. Alumni handed out stickers to galvanize support for the university, which has been targeted by the administration for its policies and alleged antisemitism. Despite the challenges, many expressed pride in Harvard's mission and its commitment to academic freedom.</p>
