          <p>At 40 years old, Spanish midfielder Santi Cazorla is set to play his final professional season with Real Oviedo, the club he supported as a child. His career was nearly ended by a severe ankle injury that required 11 operations and left him sidelined for two years, but he made a remarkable comeback. After helping Oviedo secure promotion to La Liga for the first time in 24 years, Cazorla has signed a one-year contract to fulfill his dream of playing for them in Spain's top division. He reflects on his journey with gratitude, crediting his family's support for his perseverance.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Manchester City's Hiring of Pep Lijnders Signals Major Tactical Shift</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 01:25:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes Manchester City's recent strategic moves, suggesting the hiring of Pep Lijnders, Jürgen Klopp's former assistant, is more significant than any player signing. The move indicates that manager Pep Guardiola may be planning a major tactical evolution towards a more direct, high-intensity style of play, mirroring the approach that often challenged his own possession-based philosophy. Recent player acquisitions like Rayan Cherki and Omar Marmoush, who excel at carrying the ball, further support the theory that City is adapting to a more transitional, dynamic form of football to stay ahead in the Premier League.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has begun removing loudspeakers that broadcast anti-Pyongyang messages across the border into North Korea. This action is part of President Lee Jae-myung's initiative to de-escalate tensions and improve relations with the North. The move follows a halt in the broadcasts initiated by Lee's administration in June, which was reciprocated by Pyongyang stopping its own broadcasts. Despite this gesture of goodwill, North Korea recently rejected an offer for dialogue, indicating that reviving long-stalled talks remains a significant challenge.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced an additional £100 million in funding to intensify its crackdown on illegal people-smuggling operations across the English Channel. The new funds will support the National Crime Agency with up to 300 more officers and new technology to disrupt the criminal networks. This move comes as the number of small boat crossings reached a record high for this point in the year. The government also plans to introduce a new criminal offense, with a potential five-year prison sentence, for those who advertise illegal immigration services online.</p>

          <p>At a conference in Kampala, Uganda, China reaffirmed its commitment to promoting peace and stability in the Horn of Africa. Beijing's special envoy, Xue Bing, announced that China would "actively engage" in regional initiatives by offering military assistance, training, and support for infrastructure and trade. The pledge emphasizes China's strategy of fostering "African-led solutions" to regional challenges, including counterterrorism and landmine eradication. This move underscores China's deepening diplomatic and strategic involvement across the African continent.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump commented on actress Sydney Sweeney's controversial American Eagle ad campaign, stating he now "loves her ad" upon learning she is a registered Republican. The ad, which plays on the words "genes" and "jeans," had drawn mixed reactions, with some critics alleging it had racial undertones while supporters praised it. Sweeney's Republican voter registration in Florida surfaced amid the online debate. Trump's remarks add a political dimension to the discussion surrounding the actress and her marketing campaign.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotechnology start-ups Innovent and BeOne are projected to achieve their first full-year profits in 2025, marking a significant milestone for the industry. This signals a maturation of China's biotech sector, which has been supported by a Hong Kong listing rule allowing pre-profit companies to go public. Innovent's anticipated profitability is partly driven by strong sales of its new weight-loss drug, mazdutide, which competes with popular GLP-1 drugs. Analysts suggest these companies are now creating substantial value and will no longer need to rely solely on investor funding. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eight decades after the U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima, efforts continue on the nearby island of Ninoshima to find the remains of thousands of victims. Following the blast, the island served as a makeshift treatment center where many of the dead and dying were brought, but thousands were buried in chaotic, undocumented operations. Researchers and volunteers are still unearthing bone fragments, driven by a desire to provide closure for families and properly honor those who perished. For many survivors, the search represents an enduring effort to fully account for the war's human cost.</p>

          <p>Drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine, Chinese aerospace engineers have proposed a novel upgrade for combat drones to dramatically increase their survival rate against missile attacks. The concept involves fitting small, side-mounted rocket boosters to drones, allowing them to perform instantaneous, high-G "terminal evasion" maneuvers in the final moments before impact. According to a paper published in a Chinese defense journal, digital simulations showed this system could boost a drone's survival probability to nearly 90 percent. This innovation could significantly alter the dynamics of aerial warfare.</p>

          <p>Researchers in Cuba and the UK have initiated a project to save the endangered Polymita tree snails, often called the world's most beautiful snails due to their vibrantly colored shells. This beauty has become a threat, as the illegal shell trade is driving the six known species toward extinction. The international collaboration aims to better understand the snails' genetics and establish a captive breeding program to protect them. The project highlights the paradox where the very features that make a species unique and admired can also lead to its demise.</p>
