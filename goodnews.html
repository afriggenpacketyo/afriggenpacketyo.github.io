        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump publicly stated he has no intention of undermining Elon Musk's companies by removing their government subsidies. This declaration, made on Truth Social, aims to counter speculation that their ongoing public disagreements would lead to punitive actions against Musk's ventures like SpaceX and Tesla. The statement comes amid a tense period where Musk has criticized Trump's policies, and the administration has reviewed federal contracts with Musk's companies. Both SpaceX and Tesla heavily rely on government contracts and regulatory credits, making any potential withdrawal of support financially significant.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has reversed its decision to eliminate paper checks for beneficiaries, confirming they will continue for those without other payment options. The move came after advocacy from lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren, who raised concerns about the impact on unbanked seniors. While the SSA will continue to promote the security and efficiency of electronic payments, it has committed that no one will be left behind. The initial plan to go all-electronic was intended to save costs and improve security, but it overlooked the needs of a vulnerable population.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has submitted a new anti-corruption bill to parliament, reversing a previous version that sparked widespread protests and criticism from the European Union. The initial legislation was seen as undermining the independence of anti-corruption bodies, a move protesters viewed as a regression. In response to the backlash, Zelenskyy's new bill is designed to strengthen the rule of law and ensure the autonomy of these crucial institutions. This course correction is vital for maintaining public trust and advancing Ukraine's ambitions for EU integration.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Foraco International (TSE:FAR) indicates the company exhibits key traits of a potential multi-bagger stock.

          <p>Arsenal has completed the signing of 21-year-old defender Cristhian Mosquera from Valencia in a deal that reinforces their backline.

          <p>Despite both Honeywell and Dover reporting solid quarterly earnings, their stocks experienced pullbacks, which some market analysts see as an opportunity for new investors. Honeywell's shares fell even after it beat estimates and raised its guidance, a reaction described as "disrespectful." Similarly, Dover's stock declined despite what were considered strong metrics. The analysis suggests these post-earnings dips are not reflective of the companies' fundamental health, creating a potentially favorable entry point for those looking to invest in the industrial sector.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The subjective experience of time, which often seems to speed up with age, can be understood through philosophical and scientific lenses. Philosophers like Henri Bergson argued that time is a personal unit of experience, while research suggests our perception shifts logarithmically as we age. This effect is compounded by factors like dopamine levels, which make time fly during enjoyable activities, and the density of memory formation during intense or novel experiences. To subjectively lengthen one's life, the article suggests pursuing meaningful activities, savoring moments, and avoiding routine to create richer, more lasting memories.</p>

This move represents a strategic shift, integrating the beverage-focused concept of CosMc's directly into McDonald's core operations. The company hopes the expanded drink menu will drive customer traffic and boost sales amid recent lackluster performance.</p>
