        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Residents in the Tokyo metropolitan area are increasingly opposing the construction of large data centers in residential zones due to concerns about electricity shortages, heat generation, and obstruction of natural light. Some projects have been scrapped because of this opposition, leading municipalities to take action, such as Koto Ward requiring earlier construction announcements and clear indications of heat-emitting units. The Japan Data Center Council emphasizes the importance of business owners disclosing information and building trust with affected communities as demand for data handling continues to grow, pushing facilities into residential areas. The clashes highlight the challenges of balancing technological advancement with community well-being and environmental concerns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's retail sales saw a substantial increase in May, marking the fastest growth since December 2023, fueled by trade-in programs and holiday spending. However, industrial output growth slowed slightly, and fixed-asset investment also underperformed expectations, with property investment continuing to decline. Despite these mixed signals, the urban unemployment rate fell to its lowest level since November of the previous year, while new home prices in major cities continued to drop. While consumer sentiment could be dampened by falling property prices, a tariff deal between Beijing and Washington offered temporary relief to exports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Santos, an Australian oil and gas producer, experienced a significant surge after receiving a non-binding takeover offer of $18.72 billion from a consortium led by Abu Dhabi's National Oil Company (ADNOC). The offer, which represents a substantial premium over Santos's recent closing price, has been favorably received by the company's board, which intends to recommend shareholder approval. The proposed acquisition would provide the consortium with control over key Australian liquefied natural gas operations and stakes in other significant energy projects. This development underscores the ongoing interest in Santos as a strategic asset, particularly among Middle Eastern energy players. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The final evacuation orders have been lifted nearly six months after a wildfire devastated the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles. The area had been under an evacuation order due to downed wires, potentially explosive lithium-ion batteries, and toxic wildfire debris. Although people are now allowed back into the area, public safety and health officials are urging caution. Lingering soil contamination remains a concern due to the lack of soil testing.</p>
