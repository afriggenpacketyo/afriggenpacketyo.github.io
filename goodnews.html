          <p>A new documentary, "The Haydn Expedition," showcases the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen, an orchestra celebrated for its unique democratic structure and financial independence. Founded by music students in 1980, all members have a say in artistic and operational decisions, which its managing director credits for its high level of motivation and success. The film highlights the orchestra's journey from a "hippie commune" to a world-class ensemble under conductor Paavo Järvi, linking its collaborative spirit to the democratic ideals in Joseph Haydn's music.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chelsea Football Club has agreed to a deal for striker Nicolas Jackson to join Bayern Munich, concluding a prolonged transfer saga. The arrangement involves an initial loan fee of £14.3 million, with a mandatory purchase obligation of £56.2 million based on appearances, bringing the total value over £70 million. Jackson, who joined Chelsea from Villarreal in 2023, reportedly lost the trust of manager Enzo Maresca after receiving two red cards last season. The move is structured to allow Jackson to potentially face his former club in the Champions League.</p>

          <p>At a summit in Tianjin, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced that the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) has adopted a development strategy through 2035 aimed at fostering a multipolar world. The plan sets a clear direction for the regional security bloc, which includes China, Russia, and India, to counter unilateral actions and what it terms "bullying," in an implicit reference to U.S. policies. The summit's joint declaration emphasized support for the WTO-centered multilateral trading system and acknowledged escalating geopolitical tensions as a growing threat.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that European nations are developing "precise plans" for a multinational military deployment in Ukraine as part of post-war security guarantees. In an interview, she said these plans have a "clear road map" and that U.S. President Trump has reassured allies of an "American presence as part of the backstop" for the force. The U.S. role might involve coordination and air support rather than ground troops. The initiative aims to provide credible, long-term security for Ukraine against future aggression.</p>

          <p>A coronal mass ejection from the sun is expected to interact with Earth's magnetic field, potentially creating a display of the aurora borealis visible across 18 northern U.S. states. Forecasters at NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center predict the geomagnetic storm will peak late Monday into early Tuesday. While not expected to be as intense as the major storm in the spring of 2024, it offers a significant opportunity for sky-gazers in states like Montana, Michigan, and Maine to witness the celestial phenomenon.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Self-made millionaire and financial coach Bernadette Joy advises that prospective homebuyers should aim for a 15-year mortgage to build equity significantly faster. She argues that during the initial years of a 30-year loan, payments primarily cover interest, resulting in slow equity growth. According to her, if a buyer cannot afford the higher monthly payments of a 15-year term, they likely cannot truly afford the home once hidden costs like maintenance, furnishing, and increased utilities are factored in.

          <p>Piotr Szczerek, the CEO of a Polish paving company, has issued a public apology after a video of him taking a hat from a young boy at the US Open went viral. The incident occurred when tennis player Kamil Majchrzak threw his cap into the crowd for the boy, and Szczerek intercepted it. In his statement, Szczerek claimed it was a "huge mistake" and that he was convinced the player was passing the hat to him, but acknowledged he hurt the child. He has since returned the hat, and the player later met with the young fan.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced on social media that India has offered to reduce its tariffs on U.S. products to zero, a significant potential development in the ongoing trade disputes between the two nations.

The claim comes as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been strengthening ties with China and Russia at the SCO summit, creating a complex diplomatic picture regarding India's international trade allegiances.

          <p>ScotRail, Scotland's national train operator, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares, meaning passengers will no longer pay higher prices for travel during busy weekday morning and evening hours. The move, which follows a pilot scheme, is intended to make train travel more affordable and encourage commuters to switch from cars to public transport. The Scottish government, which owns ScotRail, expects the policy to cost between £40 million and £45 million annually but believes it is a worthwhile investment to support citizens financially and benefit the environment.</p>

This minimal change is the least in European Ryder Cup history, a deliberate strategy by Donald to prepare for the challenge of playing an away match at Bethpage Black in New York.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As interest rates show signs of potentially falling, financial professionals advise that short-term certificates of deposit (CDs) currently offer the best returns for savers. Terms around six months are identified as a "sweet spot," providing attractive APYs without locking up funds for an extended period. While longer-term CDs have historically yielded more, the current inverted yield curve makes shorter terms more lucrative. Experts also suggest strategies like CD laddering or using no-penalty CDs to balance maximizing returns with the need for liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>
