          <p>Nike reported a significant drop in quarterly profit due to its ongoing turnaround plan, but still surpassed Wall Street's low expectations. The company anticipates a new, substantial challenge from tariffs, estimating a $1 billion incremental cost in the upcoming fiscal year. To counteract this, Nike plans to further reduce its manufacturing presence in China, adjust its supply chain, and implement price increases. The company's stock rose after executives expressed confidence that business results will improve moving forward.</p>

          <p>NASA's Curiosity rover has discovered unusual geometric patterns, described as "boxwork," in the Gale Crater region of Mars. These formations are believed to have been created by groundwater flowing through bedrock cracks billions of years ago, leaving behind hardened, cement-like minerals. The discovery provides further evidence of ancient waterways on the planet and raises new questions for scientists about Mars's transition to a dry, cold desert. The rover continues to ascend Mount Sharp, analyzing different geological layers to understand the planet's past habitability.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers made a series of trades to move up in the second round of the NBA draft, ultimately selecting forward Adou Thiero from Arkansas with the 36th pick. To acquire the pick, the Lakers traded their 55th selection and cash to the Bulls for the 45th pick, then sent that pick and more cash to the Timberwolves. Thiero, a 6-foot-8 wing, is seen as an athletic player who can address the team's needs, drawing comparisons to OG Anunoby.

          <p>A large, bright meteor, also known as a fireball, was witnessed across Georgia and South Carolina on Thursday afternoon. According to NASA, the space rock, estimated to be three feet in diameter and weigh over a ton, traveled at 30,000 miles per hour before exploding 27 miles above West Forest, Georgia. The explosion generated a pressure wave equivalent to 20 tons of TNT, creating loud booms heard by residents on the ground. The American Meteor Society received over 160 reports of the rare daylight event from observers in the region.</p>

          <p>In Chelsea, Massachusetts, a neighborhood suffering from the urban heat island effect, a local environmental group is testing solutions on a "cool block." The initiative, led by GreenRoots, aims to combat extreme temperatures by planting over 100 trees, resurfacing the street with lighter colors, and painting rooftops white to reflect heat. Research shows such urban areas can be up to 20 degrees hotter than greener spaces, a problem worsening with climate change. This project serves as a potential template for other densely populated cities seeking to create more livable and cooler environments.</p>

A White House spokeswoman stated the deadline is "not critical" and that an extension is possible, a decision that rests with the president.
