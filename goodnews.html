Pettersen, a Colorado Democrat, inquired about the national debt as Sam appeared disinterested in the proceedings. Powell thanked her and acknowledged Sam at the end of her allotted time, and Pettersen's spokesperson noted that she is on a childcare waitlist like many Americans. Pettersen has been advocating for parental privileges for members of Congress, arguing that "Congress was not made for women."</p>

Whitson, a retired NASA astronaut, will conduct research for Axiom Space, and the mission will involve science experiments and technology demonstrations. The launch was delayed due to an oxygen leak and concerns about air leaks in a Russian compartment of the space station, but those issues have been addressed.</p>

          <p>The article explores the potential and controversies surrounding lab-grown meat as a solution to the environmental problems caused by traditional meat production. While proponents claim that lab-grown meat can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and land use, critics argue that its environmental benefits are oversold and that reducing meat consumption is a better approach. The science behind lab-grown meat involves growing animal cells in a lab, but the process is energy-intensive and the long-term climate impact is still uncertain. Lab-grown meat has been approved for sale in some countries, but mass production faces challenges in terms of cost and scalability.</p>

Cramer argues that the initial panic over DeepSeek was an overreaction and a microcosm of situations where investors unnecessarily sell off stocks.
