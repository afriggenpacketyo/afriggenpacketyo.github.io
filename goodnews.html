          <p>Shares for major European automobile manufacturers, including Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz, rose significantly following a new trade agreement between the United States and Japan. The deal, which lowers U.S. tariffs on Japanese vehicles to 15%, has sparked optimism that a similar breakthrough could be reached for the European Union. This development comes as the EU has been actively seeking to lower U.S. auto tariffs, facing a potential increase to 30% if no agreement is made. The positive market reaction reflects hopes that the U.S.-Japan deal may set a precedent for future negotiations with other major auto exporters. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and Japan have concluded a significant trade deal that lowers U.S. tariffs on Japanese auto exports from 25% to 15%. President Donald Trump announced the "massive" agreement, stating it also involves a $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S. and opens Japanese markets to American goods like rice and agricultural products. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba confirmed the tariff reduction, which is a crucial development for Japan's economy, as auto exports are a major component of its trade with the U.S. The deal has been seen as a potential political victory for Ishiba amidst domestic pressures.

          <p>Singapore's headline inflation rate remained steady at a four-year low of 0.8% in June, with core inflation also unchanged at 0.6%. These soft figures came in below economists' expectations and are likely to influence the upcoming monetary policy decision by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). The sustained low inflation could allow the MAS to ease its monetary policy to support economic growth amid an uncertain global trade environment. Despite strong GDP growth in the first half of the year, the MAS has expressed concerns about a subdued outlook due to softening global demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists have analyzed teeth marks on the fossilized leg bone of a "terror bird," a large, flightless predator that lived 13 million years ago, and concluded it was likely attacked by an even larger reptile. The puncture marks on the bone, discovered in Colombia's Tatacoa Desert, were matched to an extinct caiman species called Purussaurus neivensis, which could grow up to five meters long. Since the bone shows no signs of healing, researchers believe the attack was fatal. This discovery provides rare evidence of an interaction between two apex predators and suggests the fearsome terror birds were more vulnerable than previously thought.</p>
