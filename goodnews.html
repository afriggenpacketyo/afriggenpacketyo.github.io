          <p>The FDA has approved lenacapavir, marketed as Yeztugo by Gilead Sciences, as a twice-yearly injection for HIV prevention, showing 99.9% effectiveness in clinical trials. This approval marks a significant advancement in the fight against HIV, potentially preventing HIV on an unprecedented scale. However, this approval comes amidst concerns about the Trump administration's decision to cut funding for HIV vaccine research, which experts warn could set back vaccine development by a decade. While lenacapavir is a crucial development, researchers emphasize the continued need for a vaccine to eradicate HIV entirely. </p>

          <p>The U.S. government is launching a five-prong initiative to combat the spread of New World screwworms, including building an $8.5 million insect dispersal facility in Texas. The facility will breed millions of sterile New World screwworm flies to mate with fertile flies, preventing them from laying eggs that hatch into flesh-eating larvae. The USDA also plans to convert a fruit fly breeding facility near Mexico's border with Guatemala into a screwworm fly breeding center. This effort aims to protect livestock, pets, and wildlife from the devastating pest, with officials expressing gratitude for the U.S. taking the threat seriously.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder in the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe, after a retrial. The jury also acquitted her of vehicular manslaughter and leaving the scene, but convicted her of operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol (OUI). Read's defense argued she was framed, while prosecutors contended their relationship had become volatile. The case garnered significant public attention, leading to a Hulu show, podcasts, and a Netflix documentary, with Read thanking her supporters and content providers for spreading the word.</p>

          <p>A California appeals court sided with a former middle school student, Eleri Irons, who sued the El Segundo Unified School District for failing to protect her from bullying. The court upheld the $1 million jury verdict awarded to Irons in 2022, finding the district negligent in supervising and training its employees. The bullying, which began in 2017, included social media harassment, verbal assaults, and a physical attack, with school officials failing to adequately address the issue. The court rejected the district's arguments of immunity and lack of mandatory duties, emphasizing that the district had a responsibility to protect Irons.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve announced Wednesday that it is maintaining its benchmark interest rate, continuing its "wait-and-see" approach amidst the Trump administration's economic policies. While the central bank expects inflation to rise in the coming months, it still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited solid labor market conditions and continued economic growth, but also acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook. The Fed expects inflation, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, to reach 3% by year-end, and unemployment to slightly increase to 4.5%. (not investment advice)</p>

Alexander-Arnold played a part in Real Madrid's goal, intercepting a pass and initiating a counter-attack.
