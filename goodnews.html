          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX is nearing the establishment of an official city named Starbase in South Texas, following a vote approved by local residents, primarily SpaceX employees. The city, located near the Mexico border, aims to support SpaceX's rocket program, which is under contract with the Department of Defense and NASA for lunar and Martian missions. While SpaceX argues that city status will streamline operations and allow for community growth, critics express concerns over Musk's increased control, including potential authority to close a popular beach and state park for launches. This development coincides with SpaceX seeking federal permission to increase South Texas launches from five to 25 annually.</p>

          <p>Singapore's ruling People's Action Party (PAP) secured a landslide victory in the country's 14th general election, with Lawrence Wong leading the party to its win.

          <p>China is undergoing a shift towards a technocratic meritocracy, with a growing number of Communist Party officials holding PhDs and possessing technical backgrounds. Nearly half of the party's youngest cohort of bureau-level officials hold doctoral degrees, with a significant proportion coming from Tsinghua University, often called "China's MIT." This pivot towards competence over ideology reflects a modern adaptation of the traditional Chinese reverence for scholar-officials, and it also offers relative stability amid economic uncertainty. This trend is seen as a strategic move to bolster China's capabilities in its rivalry with the United States.</p>

Carney, who campaigned on a platform of standing up to Trump's economic and territorial ambitions, secured a decisive victory after the Liberal Party initially faced low poll numbers. His strategy involved uniting voters across the political spectrum, including those in Quebec concerned about Canadian independence from the U.S. The article analyzes Carney's approach to policy making and the nature of his mandate in light of the evolving relationship between Canada and the United States.</p>

He acknowledges the exclusion of women from the Catholic priesthood and papal elections as a point of concern. Harris also recounts his experience researching the novel, including a visit to parts of the Vatican generally off-limits to outsiders.</p>

The expansion comes as a major report suggests that shops and services might need to be forced to accept cash in the future to protect those who rely on it. This development aligns Uber's UK operations with those in many other countries, where cash payments are already accepted.</p>
