        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores how society often prioritizes romantic relationships over friendships, leading to a decline in platonic bonds when people couple up. It delves into the historical context, noting that friendships were once highly valued, even considered as intimate as marriages. The piece highlights the pressure on romantic partners to fulfill all emotional needs and suggests that maintaining strong friendships is crucial for mental well-being. It encourages intentionality in friendships, even amidst romantic commitments, and reimagining free time to include friends, thereby reducing the burden on partners and fostering a more balanced social life. The article suggests that jealousy in friendships can be a signal to value the relationship and make an effort to maintain it. </p>

          <p>The UK and the European Union have reached an agreement regarding Gibraltar's status post-Brexit, aiming to avoid border checks between Spain and the British Overseas Territory. Under the agreement, passport checks at Gibraltar airport will be conducted by both Gibraltar and Spanish officials, similar to the system at London's St Pancras station for Eurostar passengers. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated that the deal protects British sovereignty and supports Gibraltar's economy, while Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister Jos√© Manuel Albares and EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic hailed the deal as "historic." The agreement addresses concerns about potential delays at the border due to the EU's upcoming Entry/Exit system and ensures the operational autonomy of the UK's military facilities in Gibraltar. </p>

          <p>Starbucks is piloting a banana-flavored protein cold foam at five locations in the U.S., paired with their iced latte, as part of a menu reimagining. This move reflects the growing popularity of protein-enhanced beverages and snacks. The company is testing new products through its "Starting Five" program before potentially launching them nationwide. To accommodate new items, Starbucks plans to reduce its food and beverage offerings by 30% by the end of Fiscal Year 2025. The menu redesign is part of CEO Brian Niccol's "Back to Starbucks" restructuring plan, aimed at boosting sales and attracting customers back to retail locations after relatively flat sales in 2024 and early 2025. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade deal with China, stating that China has agreed to supply US companies with magnets and rare earth metals, while the US would walk back its threats to revoke visas of Chinese students. The announcement followed two days of intense talks in London aimed at resolving conflicts that emerged after a truce was agreed upon in May. Details about the new agreement were limited, but officials said it would not alter the broad outlines of the May truce. The negotiations were triggered by US concerns that China was being too slow to release exports of its magnets and rare earth minerals, which are essential for manufacturing various products. </p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that U.S. tariff levels on Chinese imports will remain unchanged, even though a trade deal between Washington and Beijing has yet to be finalized. President Trump had indicated that U.S. duties on China would total 55%, which includes existing blanket tariffs and tariffs on specific products. The statement followed high-level trade talks in London, where Trump said a deal was "done" but subject to final approval. China's tariffs on the U.S. will remain at 10%, consistent with the agreement made last month to temporarily reduce retaliatory duties. </p>

          <p>A survey indicates that about one in four parents are adding their children, including toddlers, as authorized users on their credit or debit cards to help them establish a credit rating early. Some parents believe this practice teaches children about the value of money and responsible spending habits. Financial advisors note that many banks allow children to be authorized card users with a Social Security number. Building a good credit score can lead to better rates on mortgages and car loans, and some employers consider credit scores during hiring.
