          <p>Taiwan's President has appointed Freddy Lim, the founder and lead singer of the heavy metal band Chthonic, as its envoy to Finland, a country known for having the most metal bands per capita. Lim, who also served as a national legislator and chairman of Amnesty International in Taiwan, was chosen for his human rights work and international exchange experience. Chthonic is known for incorporating Taiwanese mythology into their music and using their performances to raise awareness about Taiwan's political struggles. Lim's appointment has been met with both excitement from metal fans and skepticism from some Taiwanese legislators, who question his suitability for the role due to his past exemption from military service.</p>

          <p>The House is poised to vote on President Trump's domestic policy bill after Republican leaders unveiled an updated version aimed at appeasing various factions within the party. The legislation, addressing tax, defense, and energy priorities, has faced numerous setbacks due to internal GOP disagreements over Medicaid, state and local tax deductions, and other provisions. Speaker Mike Johnson negotiated changes to win over budget hardliners and blue-state Republicans, but it remains uncertain whether he has enough votes to pass the bill, which is expected to face resistance in the Senate. The White House has urged House Republicans to pass the measure, calling failure to do so "the ultimate betrayal."</p>

          <p>China has called on the European Union to provide a fair playing field for businesses following Brussels' proposal to impose a handling fee on small parcels entering the bloc, most of which originate from China's expanding e-commerce sector. The proposed fee includes a two-euro charge for small packages valued at 150 euros or less sent directly to customers from overseas and a 50-cent fee for parcels sent to European warehouses. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning emphasized the importance of an open and inclusive trade environment and urged the EU to uphold its commitment to openness for Chinese companies.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin continued its upward trend, hitting a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and institutional buyer interest. Despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, Bitcoin's price rise reflects investors seeking alternative stores of value. Concerns over broader macro issues, including Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, have contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability. Additionally, positive regulatory developments in the U.S., such as the GENIUS Act, and support from President Trump and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon have bolstered the market.

          <p>The Marks & Spencer website is back online after being inaccessible for several hours, following weeks of disruption due to a cyber-attack. Customers have been unable to make online orders as the retailer deals with the aftermath, which is estimated to impact this year's profits by around £300 million. The cyber-attack resulted in the theft of some personal customer data, including telephone numbers, addresses, and dates of birth, but not payment or card details. The attack, believed to be carried out by the Scattered Spider hacking group, initially affected click-and-collect and contactless payments, leading to the suspension of all online orders.</p>

The move highlights the value Europeans place on the network's reporting, particularly on Russia and Hungary.
