          <p>Approximately 900 hikers, guides, and staff were successfully rescued from the Chinese side of Mount Everest after a severe weekend snowstorm left them stranded at over 4,900 meters altitude. The storm cut off access to their camps, leading to cases of hypothermia among some individuals, who were met by rescue teams providing food, medicine, and oxygen. The scenic area has been temporarily closed following the incident, which occurred during a week-long national holiday. This article also notes a separate fatality of a South Korean climber on Mera Peak due to a similar storm.</p>

          <p>The New York Yankees achieved a historic comeback in Game 3 of the ALDS, rallying from a 6-1 deficit to defeat the Toronto Blue Jays 9-6 in a must-win game. Aaron Judge delivered a clutch three-run home run to tie the game at six, igniting the team's offense after earlier struggles and silencing critiques of his postseason performance. This dramatic victory marks the largest elimination-game comeback in Yankees franchise history, keeping their postseason hopes alive. The team now prepares for Game 4, relying on a rookie pitcher, as the Blue Jays plan a bullpen game to counter the Yankees' suddenly red-hot lineup and momentum.</p>

          <p>US scientist Dr. Fred Ramsdell comically learned he won the Nobel Prize for medicine while on the last day of a three-week, off-grid hike in Montana's grizzly bear country. His wife received a flurry of text messages, and he initially disbelieved the news. Due to his phone being on airplane mode, the Nobel committee struggled to reach him, making it the most difficult attempt since 2016 for the secretary-general. Dr. Ramsdell, who shares the prize for research into the immune system, eventually connected with officials 20 hours later, adding to the history of laureates learning their news in unusual ways.</p>

          <h2>Blood Type Conversion for Kidneys Shows Promise for Organ Transplants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 00:00:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A groundbreaking study published in Nature Biomedical Engineering reveals promising results for kidney transplants after blood type conversion, potentially revolutionizing organ accessibility and significantly reducing waitlists. Researchers successfully converted a kidney to a universal blood type, which then functioned without rejection for two days in a brain-dead recipient. This innovation addresses the critical shortage of donated organs and challenges in allocation, offering a more efficient use of the existing human organ pool. While engineered animal organs remain a distant prospect, this advancement provides immediate hope for thousands awaiting life-saving transplants.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers Manager Explains Pitching Strategy for Roki Sasaki in Playoff Game</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 23:13:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dodgers manager Dave Roberts explained his decision to hold back ace reliever Roki Sasaki in Game 2 of the National League Division Series, opting for Blake Treinen in a save situation. The strategy aimed to manage Sasaki's workload, as the rookie has been recently converted to a bullpen role and had pitched frequently. Despite Treinen's struggles that nearly cost the game, Sasaki ultimately closed it out. Roberts confirmed Sasaki is now the primary option for future save situations but emphasized careful workload management, acknowledging the pitcher's inexperience in back-to-back relief appearances.</p>

          <p>Best-selling author and illustrator Charlie Mackesy revealed that his upcoming book, "Always Remember," took six years to complete partly because his iPad, containing many original drawings and ideas, was stolen from his car. Despite this setback and personal grief, including the loss of his mother and beloved dog, Mackesy persevered, viewing it as a challenge to overcome. He reflected on the profound impact of his first book, "The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and the Horse," on readers during the pandemic and shared his current passion for rewilding land by planting 2,000 trees in Suffolk.</p>

          <p>Sky-watchers worldwide were treated to the dazzling spectacle of a supermoon this week, which appeared notably brighter and larger in the evening sky. This celestial event, known as a supermoon, occurs when the moon reaches its perigee, marking its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit. This particular occurrence is also recognized as the Hunter's Moon, a traditional name for the first full moon in October, which historically signified the time for preparing for winter in the northern hemisphere by hunting and preserving meats.

          <p>Shares of Trilogy Metals, a US-listed minerals explorer, surged over 200% after the White House announced it would acquire a 10% stake in the Canadian company through a $35.6 million investment. This partnership is part of a broader US initiative to secure domestic supplies of critical minerals, particularly copper, in Alaska's Ambler mining district. The move, which reverses a previous Biden administration decision, aims to bolster supply chains for essential resources used in energy, defense, and manufacturing, acknowledging China's dominance in the critical minerals sector. Environmental opponents, however, express concerns about the project's impact on Alaskan landscapes and wildlife. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A rare interstellar comet, designated 3I/ATLAS, has been photographed closely approaching Mars by two European Space Agency orbiters, marking only the third such object confirmed to enter our solar system. The images show the comet as a faint, fuzzy white dot moving against distant stars, approximately 18.6 million miles from Mars. Scientists describe this as a challenging observation due to the comet's faintness compared to typical targets. The comet, which poses no threat to Earth, is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October, remaining visible before its reappearance in December.</p>

          <p>Following the success of Southeast Asia's first high-speed railway on Java, built with China's assistance, Indonesia is now seeking further Chinese investment for ambitious infrastructure projects, including a 60km urban subway in Bali. The Jakarta-Bandung high-speed line has been operational without hitches, significantly reducing travel time. However, this article raises important questions about the potential for increased debt as Indonesia pursues these extensive projects. Local confidence in China's role is high, yet the financial implications of such large-scale foreign-backed developments remain a key consideration for the nation's future.</p>
