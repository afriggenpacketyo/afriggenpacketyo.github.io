          <p>House Republicans have advanced President Trump's tax bill, including trillions in tax breaks, though the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) remains a point of contention. The House Ways and Means Committee passed the legislation, but some lawmakers are pushing for a higher SALT limit than the proposed $30,000 for those with incomes under $400,000. The current $10,000 SALT cap was implemented to fund the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The full House vote is expected soon, but the bill faces potential changes in the Senate (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Boeing and GE Aerospace have secured a $96 billion agreement to sell Qatar Airways up to 210 aircraft, including 787 Dreamliners and 777X aircraft powered by GE engines. The White House announced the deal, calling it Boeing's largest-ever widebody order and largest-ever 787 order. The agreement was struck during President Trump's state visit with the emir of Qatar. The White House estimates the deal will support 154,000 U.S. jobs annually and over 1 million total domestic jobs over the course of production and delivery. The deal could also draw more scrutiny toward Trump's acceptance, and defense, of Qatar's offer to gift the U.S. a luxury 747 jet that will act as the new Air Force One.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republicans are again targeting Medicaid, proposing changes that include work requirements and increased cost-sharing for enrollees. A GOP proposal would require many enrollees to prove they are working, volunteering, or studying, and to shoulder more of the costs of their care. This effort to cut Medicaid costs is driven by a desire to offset the cost of extending tax cuts passed in 2017. However, the GOP's latest effort toward a massive transformation could be more of a long shot, several health policy experts say. Medicaid enrollment has surged to a record high, with the COVID-19 pandemic driving numbers up and nine more states expanding the program to cover more low-income Americans, including six controlled by Republicans.</p>

The mother, Inciarte, was deported two weeks prior without her daughter.

This move coincides with a wave of bills aiming to restrict the use of fluoride, which has long been added to public water supplies to prevent cavities. The FDA will review the safety of ingestible fluoride products for children by October 31, citing potential health risks that some experts argue are not based in rigorous research. Some states have moved to ban the use of the cavity-preventing mineral in public water.</p>

Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said that the move would free up around 1,400 prison places and buy ministers time to overhaul a system "on the brink of collapse".

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing a freeze on undocumented adult enrollment in full-scope Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program. The freeze would take effect no sooner than January 1, 2026, and would apply to new adult applicants over age 19, though current enrollees would not be kicked off their health care. Newsom is also proposing a $100 per month premium for Medi-Cal enrollees 19 and up with "unsatisfactory immigration status," effective January 1, 2027.

The monthly payment range reflects how dramatically payments can vary depending on your age, gender and contract structure. Selecting the right annuity for your $250,000 investment is important, as it directly impacts your monthly payment, but it also requires careful consideration of both your immediate needs and long-term goals.

          <p>"The Legend of Ochi," a new fantasy film, offers a vision for how Californians can coexist with other large mammals, reflecting anxieties about living in close proximity to wildlife.

Director Isaiah Saxon draws parallels between the film's themes and issues facing Californians today, including conflicts with black bears, wolves, and mountain lions. The film promotes a message of learning from and respecting wild animals.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 13:02:00 EDT</div>

          <p>In Kenya, four young men were found guilty of attempting to smuggle ants, highlighting a growing problem with biopiracy and the illicit trade in wild animals. The men, two Belgians, a Vietnamese, and a Kenyan, were given the choice of a fine of $7,700 or a year in prison. Some of the ants in the men's possession were giant African harvester ants, which are valued at anywhere between around $100 to as much as $220 each. Smuggling ants can also be seen as biopiracy, an infringement of the Nagoya Protocol.</p>
