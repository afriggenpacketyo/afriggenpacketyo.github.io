          <h2>Researchers Explore Using Sharks as Mobile Ocean Sensors to Improve Hurricane Forecasting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 23:20:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists are exploring an innovative method for hurricane forecasting by equipping sharks with sensors to gather crucial ocean data. Researchers from the University of Delaware have tagged mako and white sharks to collect information on water temperature and conductivity, which are key factors in hurricane development. This approach aims to supplement traditional methods like satellites and robotic gliders, as sharks can cover vast areas of the ocean more efficiently. The data collected could eventually be integrated into hurricane computer models, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the conditions that fuel powerful storms.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers' Offense Shows Signs of Revival in Victory Over Red Sox</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 22:15:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 victory against the Boston Red Sox, showcasing a resurgent offense that has struggled for much of July. Key contributions came from Teoscar Hernández, who hit a crucial two-run homer, and Andy Pages, who continued his recent hot streak with multiple hits. After a difficult start to the month, the team has now scored five or more runs in seven of its last ten games, providing some relief ahead of the trade deadline. The win was supported by a solid pitching performance, including the first scoreless outing from the bullpen since early July.</p>

          <p>Chinese quantitative hedge funds are successfully recruiting top-tier talent, including PhD candidates from the United States who are facing funding cuts and stricter visa policies. Firms like Shanghai-based Mingshi are capitalizing on this opportunity by offering competitive salaries to attract scientists and engineers essential for leveraging artificial intelligence in their investment strategies. This brain gain is fueling the expansion of China's quant sector, which is now the world's second-largest yuan-denominated market. The trend highlights a shift in the global competition for financial and technological expertise, benefiting China's rapidly growing investment industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A small business owner in Leicester is preparing for a crucial hearing in her trademark dispute with the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal. Rebecca Dowdeswell, owner of the salon 'nkd', is fighting to re-register her business's trademark after L'Oréal opposed it, citing potential consumer confusion with its 'Naked' line of products. Dowdeswell, who has already spent over £30,000 in legal fees, argues there has been no evidence of confusion in her 15 years of trading. The case, which highlights the challenges small businesses face against large corporations, is set to be decided by the UK's Intellectual Property Office.</p>

          <h2>Warm, Sunny Spring Leads to Insect Boom in the UK, But Raises Future Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 20:53:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has resulted in a thriving population of certain insects, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The warm, dry conditions led to a boom in aphids, a primary food source for ladybirds, and prompted unusually early sightings of numerous butterfly species. However, experts express concern that the lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year, as wetland habitats dry up and egg-laying is disrupted. While this year has been a visibly bumper one for many insects, the long-term trend still indicates a general decline in the UK's flying insect population.</p>

          <p>An Illinois federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration that challenged Chicago's sanctuary city policies. The lawsuit, filed in February, argued that the city's limits on cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents unlawfully hinder federal enforcement efforts. In her ruling, Judge Lindsay Jenkins granted the city's motion for dismissal. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson praised the decision, stating it affirms that the city's ordinance is lawful and supports public safety by allowing police to focus on local needs rather than federal immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society examines the history and impact of the Hollywood blacklist, which arose from the House Un-American Activities Committee's investigations in the 1940s and 1950s. The exhibit focuses on the "Hollywood Ten," a group of writers and directors who were jailed and blacklisted for refusing to answer questions about their alleged Communist affiliations. Curators explain how the anti-Communist crusade extended beyond Hollywood, affecting many ordinary Americans and forcing creatives to name names to save their careers. The exhibit raises enduring questions about free speech, political persecution, and the protection of democracy.</p>

          <p>A new profile examines Donald Trump's deep connection to golf, portraying it as more than a mere hobby but as a core part of his business and political strategy. The article details how the president uses his golf courses as venues for networking, deal-making, and conducting diplomacy away from public scrutiny. Former White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney describes Trump as a fiercely competitive player who uses the sport to build relationships with world leaders and political allies. The piece highlights how golf has been a consistent thread throughout Trump's career, serving as both a passion and a powerful transactional tool.</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are celebrating the success of a mission to save the state's dwindling bighorn sheep population, which had been decimated by disease. After capturing and relocating dozens of healthy sheep from the last disease-free herd to an isolated mountain range, conservationists have confirmed the animals are thriving. Recent observations revealed a growing herd, including newborn lambs, indicating the relocation was successful. The effort by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department is a monumental step in rescuing the native species, whose numbers had fallen by 50% over the last five years.</p>

          <p>A recent article explores the scientific basis for popular health guidelines, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting eight hours of sleep, and taking 10,000 steps a day. Experts suggest that while these benchmarks provide useful guidance, there is often room for individual variation and that strict adherence is not always necessary. For instance, some specialists argue that thirst is a reliable indicator for hydration, while others maintain a target is beneficial. The consensus among experts is that a balanced, consistent approach to health is more important than rigidly fixating on specific numbers for diet, exercise, and mental wellness.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, focusing on how the female body is uniquely affected by elite athletic activity. Researchers are studying topics that were once ignored, such as how breast biomechanics impact running performance and how the menstrual cycle can affect training and competition. This new focus on female-specific physiology is leading to better support, from properly fitted sports bras to strategies for managing period-related symptoms. The shift marks a significant departure from the past, when female athletes were often treated as "mini-men," and aims to improve performance, reduce injury risk, and keep more women engaged in sports.</p>

          <p>Pitcher Walker Buehler, now with the Boston Red Sox, faced his former team, the Los Angeles Dodgers, for the first time since his departure last offseason. Before the game, Buehler reflected on his seven-year tenure in L.A., which was highlighted by his crucial role in the team's 2020 and 2024 World Series victories. While his exit was partly due to a major surgery and the Dodgers' pursuit of other pitchers, he expressed gratitude for his time with the organization. The reunion was a nostalgic moment for Buehler, his former teammates, and fans, culminating in him receiving his 2024 World Series ring.</p>
