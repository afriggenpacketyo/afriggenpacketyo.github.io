          <p>At the United Nations General Assembly, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva delivered a speech criticizing Washington's trade tariffs and military policies while advocating for stronger ties with China. Despite the critical tone, U.S. President Donald Trump extended an unexpected olive branch moments later, proposing a meeting with Lula for the following week. Trump commented to reporters that he and the Brazilian leader had "excellent chemistry" during a brief encounter, suggesting a potential opening for dialogue amid current tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Fifty years after her iconic song "Lovin' You" reached number one, the legacy of singer Minnie Riperton is being honored with a tribute concert at the Hollywood Bowl. The article reflects on her unique vocal talent, including her famous "whistle register," and her lasting influence on artists from Prince to SZA. Riperton, who passed away from breast cancer at 31, is remembered by collaborators like Stevie Wonder and her husband Richard Rudolph for her serene musical style and ability to convey both sweetness and earthiness. Her music continues to find new audiences, solidifying her status as an underappreciated yet highly influential artist.</p>

          <p>Actress Sarah Jessica Parker, one of the judges for this year's Booker Prize, described the process of selecting the six-book shortlist as "real agony" due to the high quality of the longlisted novels. The final shortlist for the prestigious literary award includes past winner Kiran Desai and previous nominees Andrew Miller and David Szalay. They are joined by a trio of U.S. authors: Susan Choi, Katie Kitamura, and Ben Markovits. Parker called the experience of judging a "privilege," highlighting the excitement and difficulty of narrowing down the 153 books the panel read over eight months.</p>

          <p>A bull moose was successfully rescued after falling into a 9-foot-deep abandoned well on private property in Pembroke, Maine. The property owner discovered the animal with only its antlers visible and alerted the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife. In a five-hour operation, a biologist sedated the moose, and wardens used straps and an excavator provided by the family to lift it to safety. After the sedative wore off, the moose ran off into the woods, seemingly unharmed. The family has since capped the old well to prevent future incidents.</p>

          <p>Health officials worldwide, including the World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency, are rejecting President Trump's recent claims that acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, is linked to autism when taken during pregnancy. These organizations stated that available evidence shows no such link and reaffirmed that the medication remains an important and safe option for treating pain and fever in pregnant women. Officials also refuted Trump's separate assertion that vaccines cause autism, with the WHO spokesperson emphasizing that "vaccines save countless lives" and this has been scientifically proven.</p>

          <p>England's squad for the upcoming Ashes tour in Australia features a formidable group of fast bowlers, including Mark Wood, Jofra Archer, and Ben Stokes, which is being described as their most hostile pace attack since the victorious 1970-71 tour. The selection reflects a strategic shift away from the style of bowlers who have struggled in Australian conditions in recent decades. While the strength of the pace attack is a major asset, concerns remain about the durability of key players and the fitness of captain Ben Stokes. The article suggests England's success will depend on starting strong in the first two Tests.</p>

          <p>OpenAI and Nvidia have announced a landmark $100 billion partnership to jointly develop next-generation AI supercomputing facilities. The deal was finalized through a series of rapid negotiations between CEOs Sam Altman and Jensen Huang just before an infrastructure announcement in Texas. Under the agreement, Nvidia will invest in OpenAI in ten separate $10 billion tranches and will supply the advanced processors for the new data centers. This partnership deepens the ties between two of the most influential companies in the AI industry and will fall under OpenAI's ambitious "Stargate" infrastructure project.

          <p>Major League Baseball's competition committee has approved the implementation of the Automated Ball/Strike (ABS) system, often called "robot umpires," starting with the 2026 season. The system will function as a challenge mechanism, where teams can appeal two ball or strike calls per game, with human umpires still making the initial calls. Teams will retain their challenge if the appeal is successful. After years of testing in the minor leagues, the technology aims to improve accuracy and is expected to reduce the number of ejections, a majority of which currently stem from disputes over ball and strike calls.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An often-overlooked provision known as the "Medigap birthday rule" offers seniors in certain states an annual opportunity to switch their Medicare supplemental insurance plans without facing medical underwriting. Typically, after the initial enrollment period, insurers can deny or charge more for coverage based on pre-existing conditions. However, states with a birthday rule, like California and Oregon, provide a window around a beneficiary's birthday to switch to a plan with equal or lesser benefits, regardless of health status. This rule can provide significant financial flexibility and allow seniors to adapt their coverage to their changing needs.</p>

          <p>With recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, the monthly cost of a $60,000 Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become more affordable for homeowners. At the current average rate of 8.05%, monthly payments would be approximately $730 for a 10-year repayment period or $575 for a 15-year period. The article notes that HELOCs offer flexibility, as borrowers only pay interest on the amount they use. Given the potential for further rate cuts, the variable rate of a HELOC could lead to even lower payments in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

Cramer notes that this is part of a broader trend where countries striking trade deals with the U.S. include large Boeing orders.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has pushed back against accusations, led by President Donald Trump, that the central bank's decisions are politically motivated. Without naming Trump directly, Powell stated that claims of the Fed being political are "just a cheap shot." His comments come amid an ongoing campaign by the White House to exert more control over the independent agency, including attempts to install loyalists on its board. Powell's unusually direct language defends the Fed's integrity and its process of making decisions based on economic data rather than political pressure.</p>
