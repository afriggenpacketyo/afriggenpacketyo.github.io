          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is planning a visit to Japan in late August to discuss a high-speed rail project and security cooperation with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The leaders are expected to finalize an agreement for India to adopt Japan's next-generation shinkansen bullet train for a rail line connecting Ahmedabad and Mumbai, a project symbolizing Japan-India cooperation. They may also revise the 2008 Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation to broaden their partnership, including areas like space and cybersecurity, amidst China's growing maritime influence. This visit marks Modi's first since May 2023 and aims to strengthen communication before a Quad summit with the United States and Australia. The optimism score is 80.</p>

          <p>The NHS is planning to map the DNA of all newborn babies in England to assess their risk of developing hundreds of diseases, as part of a broader effort to predict and prevent illness. This initiative, backed by significant government investment, aims to revolutionize healthcare by providing personalized interventions before symptoms begin. The program will involve sequencing complete DNA using umbilical cord blood samples to screen for genetic conditions like muscular dystrophy and liver diseases. While experts welcome the potential benefits, they caution about the need for qualified professionals to interpret the data and provide appropriate counseling to affected individuals.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A heatwave is intensifying across the UK, with temperatures expected to reach up to 34C, prompting the Met Office to issue a yellow thunderstorm warning for parts of England, Scotland, and Wales. The warning anticipates torrential downpours, large hail, and frequent lightning, while an amber heat-health alert is in effect until Monday, raising concerns about pressures on health and social care services. Firefighters are also responding to a surge in wildfires, urging caution with barbecues and flammable materials. While the heat is record-breaking for 2025, it remains below historical peaks, but scientists emphasize that climate change is making heatwaves hotter and longer, increasing the risk of heat-related deaths and disruptions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen is appealing to the House of Lords to support the Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which would grant terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death. This appeal comes after the bill was passed by the House of Commons, but it still requires approval from the Lords to become law. Critics, including Lord Shinkwin, express concerns that the bill could lead to vulnerable individuals being coerced into ending their lives. Dame Esther, who joined Dignitas after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, emphasizes the bill's rigorous safeguards and argues that it would only be available to those with six months to live who choose to ask for help.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan has been proactive in building supply chain resilience, particularly in rare earth elements, making it better prepared for China's recent export restrictions. Following a 2010 export ban by China, Japan diversified its rare earth sources, investing heavily in projects like Australia's Lynas. As a result, Japan's dependence on Chinese rare earths has significantly decreased. This transformation serves as a model for Western nations seeking to reduce their reliance on China's dominance in critical minerals, although challenges remain, especially in heavy rare earth elements.

Alaina Beresford, then 12, sent the message as part of a school project, and it washed up on a Norwegian island where it was found by a volunteer during a beach cleanup.
