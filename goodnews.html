          <p>General Motors has announced plans to expand its production of gasoline-powered vehicles by manufacturing the Cadillac Escalade SUV and adding production of Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks at its Orion Assembly plant in Michigan. This facility was previously expected to be dedicated to electric vehicles, signaling a strategic shift to meet sustained high consumer demand for traditional internal combustion engine models. The decision builds on GM's recent $4 billion investment in U.S. facilities and reinforces its commitment to its profitable truck and SUV lines, even as the industry moves towards electrification.</p>

          <p>In an unusual alliance, Amazon is utilizing Elon Musk's SpaceX to launch its next batch of Project Kuiper internet satellites, highlighting the intense competition and logistical challenges in the satellite internet market. This collaboration is driven by Amazon's need to meet a Federal Communications Commission deadline requiring it to deploy half of its 3,000-satellite constellation by mid-2026. The move underscores the current dominance of SpaceX's launch capabilities, forcing a pragmatic partnership between the rival ventures of billionaires Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk as they both aim to capture the growing satellite broadband market.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with Indonesia, reducing planned U.S. tariffs on Indonesian goods from 32% to 19%. In exchange, the deal reportedly grants American firms "full access" to Indonesian markets and includes commitments for Indonesia to purchase billions in U.S. energy and agricultural products, as well as 50 Boeing aircraft. This pact is the latest in a series of negotiations following widespread tariff threats issued by the White House this spring. While the deal marks a development in U.S. trade policy, specific terms were not immediately confirmed by Indonesian officials.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced it will soon restart shipments of its MI308 artificial intelligence chips to China, following news that the U.S. Commerce Department will resume reviewing its export license applications. This development, which caused AMD's stock to climb, signals a shift in the Trump administration's policy on AI chip exports, which had been tightened over national security concerns. The move comes after lobbying from the chip industry, including competitor Nvidia, which also plans to resume sales of its specialized chips designed to comply with U.S. export controls.</p>

This approach, he argued, allows the U.S. to maintain a technological lead while still engaging in trade.
