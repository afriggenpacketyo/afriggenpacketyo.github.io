        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NYU Stern professor Suzy Welch recommends that job seekers ask, "What kind of person should not work at this company?" during interviews. This question often elicits candid, unrehearsed responses that reveal a company's true values beyond generic platitudes like "innovation" or "empowerment." The answers, such as "someone who wants to try out different roles," provide genuine insight into the workplace culture, helping candidates assess if it aligns with their personal values. Welch advises asking this question late in the interview process, after an offer is made, to maintain rapport.</p>

          <p>Ford announced a significant 14.2% increase in vehicle sales for the second quarter compared to the previous year, far exceeding the estimated 1.4% industry-wide growth. The company sold 612,095 new vehicles, with strong performance from its F-Series trucks, which saw their best second quarter since 2019. Sales of "electrified" vehicles, which include both hybrids and EVs, rose by 6.6%, although pure EV sales saw a notable decline while hybrid sales surged. This growth comes amid a market affected by President Trump's tariffs on imported vehicles and parts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Why President Trump's Tariffs Have Not Led to Significant Inflation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 10:11:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite initial fears, President Trump's tariffs have not yet caused a major spike in U.S. consumer prices, with key inflation gauges remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several factors, including companies pre-ordering goods to "front-load" inventory before the duties took effect. Additionally, some businesses are temporarily absorbing the extra costs or using loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay tariff payments amid ongoing trade policy uncertainty. However, experts caution that this buffering effect is likely temporary, and price increases could still materialize later in the year if tariffs remain high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>A Review of Brittany Newell's 'Soft Core' and the Evolving Genre of Kink in Literature</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 09:50:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reviews Brittany Newell's novel "Soft Core" within the context of the mainstreaming of literary kink. It notes that as BDSM and related practices become more destigmatized, nonfiction works tend to focus on normalization, while fiction like Newell's explores the complex psychological and emotional landscapes of these worlds. "Soft Core" follows Ruth, a San Francisco sex worker, whose life blurs between her various personas as she navigates work, existential dread, and the mysterious disappearance of her ex-boyfriend. The review praises Newell's ability to capture the loneliness and surrealism of the industry.</p>
