          <p>William H. Webster, the only individual to have led both the FBI and the CIA, has passed away at the age of 101. Appointed to the FBI by President Carter in 1978, he was credited with restoring the agency's reputation after a period of scandal. President Reagan later chose him to lead the CIA in 1987 to bring stability following the Iran-Contra affair. Known for his integrity and non-partisan approach, Webster was a respected public servant who guided the nation's top law enforcement and intelligence agencies through turbulent times.</p>

          <p>A major new exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston celebrates the work of Rachel Ruysch, a 17th-century Dutch artist who was one of the most famous flower painters of her era, surpassing even Rembrandt and Vermeer in contemporary fame. The daughter of a renowned embalmer, Ruysch brought a unique, scientifically informed perspective to her art, creating visually sumptuous and detailed still lifes. Despite facing barriers as a woman artist, she achieved immense success, becoming a court painter and winning a lottery. The article explores her life, career, and the rich cultural and economic context of Dutch still-life painting.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday, August 15. The announcement confirms long-standing speculation about a one-on-one summit aimed at resolving the war in Ukraine. Trump suggested that a potential peace deal could involve a "swapping of territories," a complex proposition that he acknowledged would not be easy. The meeting comes as a deadline Trump set for Putin to agree to a ceasefire passed, with the focus now shifting from sanctions to direct diplomacy between the two leaders.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korean troops dismantling propaganda loudspeakers along the border, a significant de-escalation in tensions. The move follows South Korea's own decision to halt its broadcasts, which often featured K-pop and news reports, after the election of President Lee Jae Myung, who favors improved inter-Korean relations. For years, residents on both sides of the border have complained about the constant noise from the dueling broadcasts. This reciprocal action signals a potential thaw in relations after a period of heightened hostility under the previous South Korean administration.</p>

          <h2>Struggling American Malls Find New Life with Unconventional Tenants</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American shopping malls, once facing decline due to e-commerce and shifting habits, are experiencing a potential rebirth by replacing failed anchor stores with unconventional tenants. For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio sold a former Sears space to a large church, which now draws thousands of people weekly. Other malls are incorporating entertainment venues like bowling alleys, large-scale restaurants, and even apartments to create mixed-use community hubs. This strategy of subdividing large retail spaces for niche businesses is driving a tangible increase in foot traffic and creating new cross-shopping opportunities.</p>

          <p>After suffering a concussion during a high school football game, a New Jersey teenager experienced debilitating symptoms that persisted for months. When physical therapy and medication failed, a specialist ordered an MRI, which revealed the true cause: a rare, congenital brain condition called an arteriovenous malformation (AVM). The concussion had likely exacerbated symptoms from the underlying AVM, which was successfully removed via surgery. The family is now advocating for earlier and more thorough testing for persistent post-concussion symptoms, highlighting how the injury inadvertently saved the teen's life.</p>

          <p>New York-based technology company Runwise is tackling energy waste in large commercial and residential buildings with a smart climate control platform. The system uses a network of wireless sensors and weather algorithms to operate heating and cooling systems more efficiently, eliminating overheating and overcooling. Now installed in over 10,000 buildings, the technology has reportedly saved clients like Related and Equity Residential over $100 million in energy costs. The startup recently secured $55 million in funding to expand nationwide and further integrate AI into its energy-saving models.</p>

          <p>Sandra Grimes, a former CIA officer instrumental in unmasking notorious Soviet mole Aldrich Ames, has died at 79. In 1991, Grimes agreed to help investigate why the agency's Soviet informants were disappearing, leading to the discovery that they were being executed. Her meticulous analysis of financial records and activity logs was crucial in identifying Ames, the CIA's counterintelligence chief for Soviet operations, as the spy. Ames was arrested in 1994, and Grimes's work is remembered as a pivotal contribution to U.S. national security during the Cold War.</p>

          <p>A San Francisco-based company, Marathon Fusion, has proposed a modern form of alchemy: manufacturing tons of gold by repurposing neutrons generated during nuclear fusion. The theory, which has intrigued physicists, suggests that this process could create a valuable revenue stream to offset the high costs of developing fusion energy, a potential clean power source. While the idea is currently speculative and faces the major hurdle of commercial fusion not yet being a reality, it represents an innovative approach to making the technology economically viable. The history of alchemy is filled with failed attempts, but this plan is rooted in modern physics.</p>

The firm contends that the fast-growing and high-margin DAT business is a "hidden gem" and that spinning it off could unlock significant shareholder value, potentially increasing the company's valuation by 76% to 304% (not investment advice).</p>

While OpenAI promoted its latest model as its smartest and fastest yet, some Chinese analysts described it as an incremental improvement rather than a revolutionary breakthrough. The new model features a built-in "thinking" function and improved performance in areas like coding and math. The lukewarm reception highlights the heightened expectations and intense competition within the AI industry, where Chinese companies are also rapidly developing their own advanced models.</p>
