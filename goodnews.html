          <p>Recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates a rise in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations across the United States, with test positivity rates doubling over the past two months. This uptick is attributed to factors like the start of the school year and the emergence of new Omicron subvariants such as XFG. Despite the increase, current figures for hospitalizations and positive tests are significantly lower than they were at the same time last year, and health officials anticipate the updated fall vaccines will offer reasonable protection against severe disease.</p>

          <p>With the 2026 midterm elections approaching, the political landscape for control of the U.S. Senate is beginning to solidify, with Democrats defending 13 seats and Republicans 24. The retirement of several Democratic incumbents has created potential openings for the GOP, while Democrats face a challenging map with few opportunities to flip Republican-held seats. Key battlegrounds are emerging in states like North Carolina, Georgia, and Michigan, where open seats and vulnerable incumbents are expected to lead to expensive and highly contentious campaigns that will determine the chamber's majority.</p>

          <p>Shares of Affirm, the buy now, pay later company, increased by 10% after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations for both earnings and revenue. CEO Max Levchin attributed the strong performance to growth in consumer and merchant usage, noting continued consumer strength. The positive report and optimistic guidance for the upcoming fiscal year helped alleviate investor concerns about increased competition and the recent loss of Walmart as a partner, signaling robust momentum for the company.

          <p>Alibaba's U.S.-listed stock surged nearly 13% after the company reported better-than-expected net income for its fiscal first quarter, driven by a significant acceleration in its cloud computing unit. Revenue from the cloud division grew 26% year-over-year, largely due to robust demand for AI-related products, which have seen triple-digit growth for eight consecutive quarters. While overall revenues slightly missed forecasts due to heavy investment in China's competitive e-commerce market, investors responded positively to the strong performance and future potential of the company's AI and cloud businesses.

          <p>An administrative law judge has ruled that a Pacific Palisades homeowner can investigate State Farm's claims-handling practices as part of the insurer's rate increase hearing. The decision is a victory for policyholders affected by recent firestorms who have criticized the company for alleged payment delays and underpayments. State Farm is seeking an 11% rate hike after already receiving an emergency 17% increase, while consumer advocacy groups and affected homeowners argue that no increase should be approved until the company's claims practices are thoroughly examined.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has reportedly accepted a bid from Spanish club Real Betis for Brazilian winger Antony, who is now expected to travel to Spain for a medical examination. The 25-year-old had a successful loan spell with Betis last season and was among a group of players training separately from the main United squad, signaling his impending departure. This transfer marks the end of a disappointing tenure at Manchester United for Antony, who was the club's second-most expensive signing but struggled to perform consistently after his high-profile move from Ajax.</p>

          <p>A Texas man has been reunited with his Fordham University class ring 56 years after he lost it in the waters off Long Island, New York. Al DiStefano dropped the ring in 1969 and assumed it was gone forever, but an electrician named David Orlowski discovered it this summer while using a metal detector at a local beach. After finding the engraved name and graduation year, Orlowski used social media to track down DiStefano through a university alumni group, leading to the return of the cherished memento across a distance of 1,600 miles.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market concluded August with its fourth consecutive monthly gain, with the S&P 500 advancing approximately 2%, although it ended the final week with a slight loss. Profit-taking ahead of the Labor Day weekend and a mixed reaction to Nvidia's strong earnings report contributed to the week's downturn. Investors also processed the latest PCE inflation data, which showed persistent price pressures but did not alter expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September, a topic of focus as the market heads into a historically challenging month.

          <p>Paleontologists have identified the world's oldest known ankylosaur, a 165-million-year-old dinosaur named Spicomellus, based on newly discovered fossils from Morocco. The findings, published in 'Nature,' reveal an animal with a unique and elaborate defense system, featuring long bony spikes fused directly onto its rib bones, a feature never before seen in any vertebrate. This discovery challenges previous theories about the evolution of these 'tank-like' dinosaurs, suggesting their armor was more complex at an earlier stage than previously believed. Researchers have dubbed the creature the "punk rocker" of its time.</p>

          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, has been re-elected in a landslide victory, four years after he says White officials locked him out of town hall and refused to let him serve. The election, the town's first in decades, was held as part of a federal settlement after Braxton sued, challenging the town's history of 'hand-me-down' governance where mayors appointed their successors. His decisive win is being hailed as a significant moment for democratic representation in the small, majority-Black town, which had previously been run by an all-White government.</p>
