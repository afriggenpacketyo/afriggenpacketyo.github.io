          <p>President Donald Trump has paid tribute to Retired U.S. Army Sgt. Michael Verardo, a highly decorated Afghanistan veteran who passed away at 40 from injuries sustained in combat. Verardo's extraordinary resilience, after an IED blast in 2010 left him with severe injuries and required 120 surgeries, became a powerful source of inspiration. His wife, Sarah, transformed their personal struggle into a national movement by establishing the Independence Fund's Trackchair Initiative. This program, which has delivered over 2,000 all-terrain wheelchairs to wounded veterans with the support of Fox News viewers, significantly enhanced their mobility and quality of life. Verardo's legacy is celebrated as a testament to courage, sacrifice, and unwavering perseverance for his nation.</p>

          <p>South Korea's central bank, the Bank of Korea (BOK), has held its policy rate steady at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting, aligning with economists' expectations despite a challenging global trade landscape. This decision follows recent agreements between South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and U.S. President Donald Trump, including multibillion-dollar investment pledges and reduced tariffs on Korean exports. While net exports significantly boosted South Korea's GDP growth in the last quarter, analysts anticipate a potential BOK rate cut within the next three months, possibly in October, to further support economic stability, especially given that inflation remains close to the central bank's 2% target.

          <p>A new NATO report reveals that all member states are projected to meet the alliance's long-standing defense spending target of 2% of GDP this year, a significant increase driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and U.S. demands. However, only three nations—Poland (4.48%), Lithuania (4%), and Latvia (3.73%)—are currently achieving the newly agreed 3.5% target. Despite contributing the largest share in absolute terms, the United States is expected to spend 3.22%. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte welcomed the increased spending but emphasized the need to translate these funds into genuine military capabilities, underscoring that "cash alone doesn't provide security."</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, with sales growth exceeding 50% for the ninth consecutive quarter, signaling strong demand for AI infrastructure. However, the stock slipped in extended trading as data center revenue fell short of estimates for the second period in a row. The company expects $54 billion in revenue this quarter and its finance chief projects $3-4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by 2030. Despite a meeting between CEO Jensen Huang and President Trump, Nvidia sold no H20 chips to China during the quarter due to geopolitical restrictions, though it benefited from releasing existing inventory.

          <p>After a significant delay of over two and a half years, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has appointed Steve Kang, president of the Board of Public Works, as the city's new film liaison. This fulfills a key campaign promise to the film industry, which has grown increasingly frustrated by the lack of a dedicated point person. The appointment aims to help filmmakers navigate city bureaucracy and support the local industry, which is struggling with production job losses to other states and countries offering better incentives. The mayor's office cited a challenging 2025 with firestorms, immigration raids, and military presence as factors for the delay, but the industry hopes this move will ease filming operations.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Expands Free Childcare Hours for Working Parents Amidst Sector Concerns</h2>

          <p>The UK government is expanding its funded childcare program, offering 30 hours a week for working parents of children aged nine months to four years from September. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged eligible parents to apply, but concerns persist regarding staff shortages and the availability of places. While the average cost of full-time nursery care has decreased, providers argue that government funding rates often don't cover full costs, leading to "top-up fees" that some parents cannot afford. The Department for Education projects a need for 35,000 additional staff and 70,000 places by September 2025, with "childcare deserts" remaining a challenge in disadvantaged areas.</p>

          <p>The charity Greater Change is demonstrating success in combating homelessness by providing direct cash aid to individuals at risk or experiencing homelessness, with minimal strings attached. Laura Burns, a mother who received £600 to prevent eviction, exemplifies the program's impact, highlighting the immediate relief and dignity of choice it offers. The charity has disbursed £699,000 to 403 people this year, with 86% moving into stable housing and nearly half finding employment. International studies, like Vancouver's New Leaf project, support this "cash first" approach, showing no increased spending on addictions. While not a solution to systemic housing shortages, this innovative model offers a crucial early intervention, saving taxpayer money and transforming lives.</p>

          <p>China's electric vehicle (EV) industry is rapidly transforming the global car market, with companies like BYD surpassing Tesla in revenue and domestic sales reaching a record 31.4 million units last year. Analysts note the speed and scale of this growth, fueled by government subsidies, tax incentives, and significant investment in EV development, alongside lower labor costs and a robust battery supply chain. This dominance has led to regulatory scrutiny and duties from Western markets seeking to protect their own auto industries. Experts predict China will manufacture 36 million vehicles annually by 2030, exporting 9 million, significantly pressuring smaller manufacturing nations and signaling a major shift in the global automotive landscape.

          <p>Following Nvidia's better-than-expected earnings, CNBC's Jim Cramer dismissed fears of a looming artificial intelligence bubble, asserting that Big Tech's massive AI investments are justified. He emphasized that the high market capitalization of these stocks is secondary to the fundamental need for AI infrastructure. Cramer drew parallels to the dot-com era, noting that while many companies failed, key players like Amazon eventually achieved enormous success, suggesting current hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta possess strong leadership and financials. He believes investors should trust these major customers, who are driving the AI buildout, despite the initial "anticlimax" of Nvidia's stock performance post-earnings. (not investment advice)</p>
