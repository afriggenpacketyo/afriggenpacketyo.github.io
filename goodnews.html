        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following Klarna's successful $17 billion IPO, investors are actively looking for the next major fintech company to go public, signaling a more welcoming Wall Street environment for such listings. Companies like Stripe, Revolut, Monzo, Starling Bank, and Payhawk are identified as strong contenders, each having achieved significant private valuations or demonstrated strong growth. Stripe opted for a secondary share sale at a $91.5 billion valuation, while Revolut and Monzo have also facilitated employee share sales. Many fintech CEOs are closely observing market reception to determine the optimal timing for their own public debuts, with the U.S. often preferred for listings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's Kospi index surged to a record high on Monday, marking its tenth consecutive session of gains, after Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol announced the government would scrap plans to raise taxes on stock investments. This positive domestic news contributed to a mixed trading day across Asia-Pacific markets, as investors also monitored ongoing U.S.-China trade talks in Madrid and China's latest economic data. While Hong Kong and mainland China indices saw modest gains, Australia's ASX/S&P 200 declined slightly. U.S. equity futures remained largely unchanged, with investors bracing for a crucial Federal Reserve meeting this week and hopes for an interest rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun is set to visit China to meet his counterpart Wang Yi, with a primary goal of discussing plans for Chinese President Xi Jinping's potential visit to Seoul next month for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) leaders' summit. If confirmed, this would mark Xi's first visit to South Korea since 2014, signaling a potential recalibration of relations that had soured under the previous South Korean administration's alignment with Washington. The expected appointment of Roh Jae-heon as Seoul's new ambassador to China further indicates efforts by Seoul to balance its diplomatic ties between Washington and Beijing. This high-level diplomatic engagement aims to improve bilateral relations and foster regional stability.</p>

Six-time champions New Zealand are highlighted for their refreshed talent and historical dominance over England, despite some slow starts in recent matches that expose defensive vulnerabilities. Canada, ranked closest to England, has demonstrated strong form, including a historic win and a draw against New Zealand, with almost half their squad having honed their game in England's PWR. France, despite a recent heavy loss to England, is known for elevating its game for the big stage, with key players capable of scoring superb tries, making them a formidable semi-final opponent.</p>

          <p>European stock markets opened higher, with the U.K.'s FTSE, Germany's DAX, and France's CAC 40 all seeing gains, as investors anticipated the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting later in the week. However, Danish wind energy developer Orsted experienced a significant share drop of over 5% after announcing a deeply discounted capital raise of 60 billion Danish kroner. This involved issuing new shares at a 67% discount to its Friday closing price. The broader market also kept an eye on U.S.-China trade talks in Madrid and awaited the U.K.'s inflation print and the Bank of England's meeting, which is not expected to cut interest rates.

          <p>China's $12.7 trillion stock market rally appears poised for further growth, driven by a continued shift of household savings into equities, according to central bank data. Deposits at non-banking financial institutions surged by 1.17 trillion yuan in August, following a 2.15 trillion yuan inflow in July, indicating a strong trend of capital moving towards the capital market. The M1 money-supply gauge, which measures readily available funds for investment, rose 6% year-on-year, its fastest since January 2023. This significant rotation is attributed to low-interest-rate policies that are diminishing returns from traditional banking deposits, thereby making equities a more attractive investment option for households.

          <p>China is exploring an ambitious initiative to convert existing coal-fired power plants into nuclear facilities, specifically utilizing fourth-generation reactors. Proposed by China Energy Engineering Group Co., Ltd (CEEC), the nation’s top state-owned energy infrastructure builder, this "C2N" initiative aims to provide a direct path to decarbonization while preserving valuable energy infrastructure, especially in coastal areas. China, which currently possesses over 1.19 terawatts of coal-fired capacity and expects 100 gigawatts to retire by 2030, sees this as a strategic move. Researchers involved believe these advanced reactors could also enhance site safety requirements and secure greater public acceptance, contributing significantly to the nation's clean energy transition goals.</p>

          <p>Netflix's drama "Adolescence" achieved an Emmy sweep, winning several top prizes, largely due to its acclaimed one-take filming technique across all four hour-long episodes.

Co-created by Stephen Graham, the series was inspired by real-life teen stabbings, aiming to spark public discussion on societal issues, even leading to government support for its availability in schools. Breakout star Owen Cooper, though previously acting in drama classes, gained significant recognition for his powerful performance, especially in a chamber piece episode with a child psychologist, showcasing his range.</p>
