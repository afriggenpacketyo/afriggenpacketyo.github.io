          <p>President Trump announced that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured him that India will halt its purchases of Russian oil, although a specific timeline for this cessation remains unclear. Trump stated that this move would help curtail Moscow's ability to finance its war in Ukraine and mentioned there would be "a little bit of a process" involved. India, one of the largest buyers of Russian crude, has previously defended its purchases as a measure to stabilize global energy prices. The potential shift in India's policy could significantly impact global oil markets and geopolitical alignments.</p>

          <p>President Trump held a dinner for dozens of corporate executives and business leaders to raise funds for a new $200 million ballroom at the White House. The guest list included representatives from major tech companies like Apple and Google, as well as figures from the tobacco, telecom, and cryptocurrency industries. The administration states the 90,000-square-foot expansion will be financed entirely by private donations, not taxpayers, and will allow for larger functions like state dinners. The fundraising effort has drawn criticism from some, like Senator Elizabeth Warren, who question the motivations behind such corporate donations.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani took part in a rare on-field batting practice session as he works to break a significant postseason slump. The two-way player has struggled at the plate, with only two hits in 25 at-bats and 12 strikeouts since the playoffs began. Manager Dave Roberts had previously stated the team could not win the World Series with Ohtani performing at that level. Ohtani downplayed the idea that his pitching duties were negatively impacting his hitting, stating he doesn't feel a direct physical connection between the two roles and is focused on improving his at-bats.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from firing federal workers amid the ongoing government shutdown. The ruling came after the administration sent reduction-in-force notices to over 4,000 employees, with the White House budget director suggesting the total could exceed 10,000. The judge called the firings "unprecedented" and cited President Trump's own social media posts indicating the cuts were intended to punish political opponents. The order provides temporary relief for workers represented by the unions that filed the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>The bands Pulp and CMAT are the bookmakers' favorites to win the prestigious Mercury Prize for album of the year, which will be awarded in Newcastle. Irish singer CMAT is considered the front-runner for her album "Euro-Country," with the comeback album "More" from former winners Pulp as a close second. For the first time, the awards ceremony is being held outside of London, a move intended to decentralize the UK music industry and recognize talent from across Britain and Ireland. Other nominees include PinkPantheress and 84-year-old folk musician Martin Carthy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK housing association chief executive, Kate Wareing, has proposed a plan to help the government close asylum hotels by 2029, a pledge made amid rising community tensions. Her idea involves the government paying councils and housing associations to purchase properties, adding to the social housing stock for both local residents and asylum seekers. Wareing claims this could drastically cut the cost of housing an asylum seeker from £54,000 a year in a hotel to just £4,000. The proposal is reportedly being discussed with government departments as a more sustainable and integrated alternative to the current expensive system.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has released its first-ever handheld gaming console, the ROG Xbox Ally, which integrates directly with the Xbox Game Pass subscription service. The device is essentially a portable Windows PC, allowing it to play a vast library of PC games in addition to the Game Pass catalog. While its screen and performance with modern games are impressive, its reliance on the Windows operating system can lead to hiccups like slow updates before gameplay. The console enters a competitive market, facing established rivals like the Nintendo Switch and Valve's Steam Deck, raising questions about whether its Game Pass integration is enough to justify its premium price.</p>
