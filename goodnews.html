        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO allies are set to commit to increasing their defense spending, potentially reaching 5% of their GDP, as urged by the U.S., with ongoing conflict in Ukraine and Middle East tensions driving the need for greater security. However, some member states are hesitant to meet the target, raising concerns about the fulfillment of these pledges. European aerospace and defense companies emphasize the need for concrete government procurement to scale up production capacity. The U.S. is seeking clear plans and commitment from allies to reach the 5% target, while some European allies may attempt to dilute the spending pledges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist is planning to establish a clinic offering ketamine as a treatment for severe depression, providing an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that offers ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors. The Royal College of Psychiatrists is set to release an updated report on psychedelics, including ketamine, later this year, and the hope is that ketamine assisted therapy will soon be available on the NHS.</p>

Some experts suggest the market views the attack as a relief, diminishing the immediate nuclear threat in the region.

          <p>At the NATO summit in The Hague, ambitious goals for defense spending are placing heavy demands on Germany's military, the Bundeswehr. While Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged financial resources to strengthen the Bundeswehr, NATO aims for member states to spend 5% of their GDP on defense. This proposed increase has sparked debate within the German government, with some questioning its rationality. The summit also focuses on military capabilities, requiring additional troops in Europe amid potential U.S. troop reductions.</p>

          <p>New York City will use ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election, a system where voters rank multiple candidates in order of preference. This system aims to ensure that the elected candidate has broader support and avoids situations where a candidate wins with only a plurality in a crowded field. The ranked choice tabulations will begin on July 1, with official results expected on July 15, and it could take longer to get results. While ranked choice voting can lead to more representative outcomes, it also presents challenges regarding transparency and voter understanding.</p>
