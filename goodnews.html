Ralston, a 24-year-old mother, was found strangled in her car in 1977, and the case went cold due to a lack of credible leads. The break came when a thumbprint found on a cigarette carton in the victim's car matched Sims's, thanks to an upgrade in the F.B.I.‚Äôs fingerprint search algorithm. The arrest brings closure to a decades-long investigation and offers some solace to Ralston's family.</p>
