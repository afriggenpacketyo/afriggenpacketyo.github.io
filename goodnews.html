        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued an injunction preventing the Trump administration from using National Guard and military troops for domestic law enforcement activities in California. The ruling, which the administration can appeal, found that the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878. Judge Charles Breyer's decision specifically cited actions like arrests and crowd control as unlawful uses of the military. The ruling comes amid President Trump's consideration of similar deployments in other U.S. cities to address crime.</p>

          <p>Authorities in La Salle County, Texas, have arrested a 66-year-old man in connection with the 2005 murder of Valerie Laguna, who was nine months pregnant when she was killed. The suspect, Saul Gonzalez, was indicted for capital murder and is being held on a $1 million bond. Laguna's body was discovered in a cemetery, and the cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma. The arrest, made two decades after the crime, was attributed to advances in forensic investigation techniques, bringing a long-awaited development in the case.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from using military forces for civilian law enforcement in Southern California, warning the practice could lead to "a national police force with the President as its chief." The ruling found the deployment of National Guard troops and Marines in Los Angeles to be a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act. This decision could establish a significant legal precedent regarding the domestic use of the military. The Justice Department has indicated it will appeal the injunction.</p>

          <p>During Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to Beijing, analysts noted that despite a recent slowdown in Chinese automotive exports to Russia, there is significant potential for expanded trade between the two nations. As both countries face economic pressure and tariffs from the United States, they are increasingly looking to each other for consumer goods, electronics, and machinery. The leaders signed over 20 bilateral agreements in sectors like energy, aerospace, and agriculture. This cooperation aims to strengthen their economic partnership by increasing trade settled in their local currencies.</p>

          <p>New York Democratic Representative Jerry Nadler, 78, has announced he will not seek re-election in 2026, ending a 34-year career in Congress. Nadler stated that his decision was influenced by the need for "generational change" within the Democratic party, a sentiment amplified by the challenges faced by older party leaders. As the former chair of the House Judiciary Committee, he played a central role in both of Donald Trump's impeachments. His retirement is expected to open up a competitive primary for his safe Democratic seat in Manhattan.</p>

          <p>Zack Polanski, a London Assembly member, has won the Green Party leadership election in the UK, promising a more confrontational style and an "eco-populist" approach. Polanski, 42, aims to challenge the Labour Party from the left and connect with voters on an emotional level. His victory over two of the party's sitting MPs signals a potential shift in strategy for the Greens, who quadrupled their parliamentary seats in the last election. Polanski has also expressed openness to collaborating with a potential new left-wing party formed by former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.</p>

          <p>In an innovative experiment, biologists are using drones to haze gray wolves and prevent them from attacking cattle near the California-Oregon border. The drones are equipped with speakers that blast sounds like AC/DC music, loud movie clips, and human voices to frighten the predators away. This nonlethal method is part of an effort to find new ways for ranchers and the recovering wolf population to coexist. While initial results show promise in interrupting wolf hunts, questions remain about whether the wolves will eventually become accustomed to the tactic.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, financial experts advise savers to consider locking in current Certificate of Deposit (CD) rates before they decline. They suggest strategies such as CD laddering, which involves opening multiple CDs with staggered maturity dates to balance returns with access to funds. Another recommendation is to explore no-penalty CDs, which offer more flexibility for withdrawals despite slightly lower rates. Experts also stress the importance of not locking up too much cash in long-term CDs and shopping around at different financial institutions for the best terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial experts are pointing to a "golden opportunity" for investors to pay 0% on long-term capital gains, thanks to new tax deductions in President Trump's latest bill. The 0% rate applies to investors below certain taxable income thresholds, which more people may now fall under. This allows for "tax-gain harvesting," a strategy of selling profitable assets without incurring taxes, which can be used to rebalance portfolios or reset an asset's cost basis for future tax savings. The higher standard deduction and other new tax breaks are key factors that could expand eligibility for this tax bracket in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>
