          <p>U.S. steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs announced it is investigating the commercial viability of mining rare earths at two of its sites in Michigan and Minnesota. The move aligns with the Trump administration's strategy to reduce American dependency on China, which currently dominates the global supply chain for these critical minerals. Following the announcement by CEO Lourenco Goncalves, the company's shares surged significantly, reflecting investor optimism about creating a domestic source for materials essential in defense, electric vehicles, and other high-tech applications.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicles generally lose value more quickly than their internal combustion engine counterparts, depreciating by an average of 13% more over a five-year period. Key factors contributing to this trend include higher initial government and manufacturer incentives, which lower the baseline for resale value, and the rapid pace of technological advancement in battery range and features. However, as more affordable EV models enter the market and the used EV supply grows, this depreciation gap could begin to narrow, making them more attractive to value-oriented used car buyers.</p>

          <p>Qualifying for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which can wipe out most unsecured debts, is not guaranteed and depends heavily on an individual's financial situation. The primary obstacle is the "means test," which compares a filer's income to their state's median income; those earning below the median often qualify automatically. For higher earners, approval depends on demonstrating a lack of disposable income after accounting for necessary expenses. The article notes that factors like recent luxury purchases or dishonesty on paperwork can also lead to denial, while alternatives like Chapter 13 bankruptcy exist for those who do not qualify.</p>

His victory is seen as a rejection of the two-state solution favored by Turkey and a strong call for a federal solution based on UN resolutions. Erhurman also campaigned on preserving the secular identity of the Turkish Cypriot community against perceived influence from Ankara, a stance that has been welcomed by Greek Cypriot leaders as a positive step toward restarting negotiations.</p>

          <p>Amid increasing market volatility, an Invesco senior portfolio manager recommends that risk-averse investors consider income-generating funds that use options-based strategies. These exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are designed to provide more structural downside protection that is not reliant on traditional asset correlations. The strategy can also offer a source of income that is less sensitive to interest rate changes from the Federal Reserve. The article advises investors to look for ETFs managed by experienced professionals and to be wary of unsustainable yields and high fees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article argues that the U.S. should expand Medicaid to cover GLP-1 anti-obesity drugs like Ozempic for the estimated 14 million eligible low-income Americans. While acknowledging the high initial cost to state budgets, it contends that the long-term benefits, including reduced healthcare spending on obesity-related diseases and improved longevity, justify the investment. The author suggests that costs are overstated, as Medicaid pays significantly less for drugs than private insurers, and prices are expected to fall as more competitors enter the market, making coverage both a moral and economically sound decision.</p>
