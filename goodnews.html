          <p>President Donald Trump has nominated Sergio Gor, a trusted aide currently leading the White House Presidential Personnel Office, to be the next U.S. Ambassador to India and a special envoy for South and Central Asian affairs. Trump emphasized his confidence in Gor to advance his agenda, particularly as relations between the two nations have been strained by ongoing trade disputes, including a planned increase in U.S. tariffs on Indian goods. This appointment aims to navigate the complex diplomatic landscape, with Gor expressing it would be the "honor of his life" to represent the U.S. in this crucial role.</p>

          <p>Excel Parking, a firm widely criticized for its "five-minute payment rule," has been ordered to pay £10,240 to a charity after losing a second court appeal against driver Hannah Robinson. Robinson faced thousands in demands for taking slightly longer than five minutes to pay for parking, often due to poor phone signal. The court found Excel's rule "inherently preposterous" and its litigation conduct "unreasonable," dismissing their claims. This victory comes after the five-minute rule was banned by private parking trade associations and highlights ongoing efforts to hold predatory parking companies accountable.</p>

          <p>Following the passing of 92-year-old Ohio social worker Dan Pelzer, his children discovered an extraordinary legacy: a meticulously kept list of every one of the 3,599 books he had read since 1962. This extensive, 109-page document, which his family describes as a reflection of his lifelong quest for knowledge, spans diverse genres and authors. The Columbus Metropolitan Library, where Pelzer was a devoted patron, shared his remarkable reading list online, inspiring millions and prompting a surge in patrons checking out books from his collection. Pelzer's humble dedication to reading has posthumously cemented his status as an inspiring figure for book lovers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A notable political divergence is becoming apparent between young men and women in Britain, with surveys indicating that young women are increasingly aligning with left-wing ideologies, while young men tend towards right-wing parties such as Reform UK. This generational and gender gap is observed in voting preferences, where young women disproportionately support Labour and the Green Party, and young men show higher engagement with Reform. Researchers suggest contributing factors include varying rates of higher education, the impact of social media, and evolving perspectives on gender equality. This phenomenon reflects a broader shift in political engagement among younger demographics, with many feeling traditional parties no longer represent their interests.</p>

Despite this impressive 28th consecutive win, head coach John Mitchell identified areas for refinement, including midfield passing and kick-off receptions, emphasizing the team's commitment to continuous improvement. This strong start sets a high bar for England as they aim for further success in the tournament.</p>

          <p>Ether, a prominent cryptocurrency, has reached a new record high, its first since 2021, following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish speech at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Powell's comments, suggesting that current restrictive policies might warrant adjustment, led to widespread "panicked repositioning" among traders and significant short liquidations in the crypto market. This shift indicates a renewed momentum, with the administration and the Federal Reserve seemingly aligned on easing monetary policy. Ether's recent leadership in the crypto market is largely attributed to favorable regulatory developments and increasing institutional interest in stablecoins, many of which are powered by the Ethereum blockchain.

          <p>South Korean cafes are increasingly facing challenges from "Cagongjok," a cultural phenomenon describing students and workers who occupy cafe spaces for prolonged study or work sessions. Cafe owners, particularly in high-rent areas like Seoul's Daechi, report issues such as customers utilizing multiple electronic devices and leaving tables unattended for extended periods, negatively impacting business operations. While Starbucks Korea has introduced guidelines to manage "extreme cases," some independent cafes have resorted to "No Study Zone" policies or time restrictions. This trend is seen as a reflection of South Korea's highly competitive society and a shortage of adequate public study spaces, prompting calls for more accommodating urban environments.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has acquired an unprecedented 10% equity stake in chipmaker Intel, a deal announced by President Donald Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, marking a significant intervention in corporate America. This investment, roughly equivalent to $10 billion in CHIPS Act grants, follows Trump's prior public demand for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan's resignation due to alleged ties with Chinese companies. This action is consistent with the Trump administration's broader strategy of direct involvement in private markets, seen in similar agreements with Nvidia, AMD, and a rare-earth mining firm. Critics are raising concerns about the new categories of corporate risk and the politicization of economic policy. (not investment advice)</p>
