          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from ending deportation protections for thousands of Afghans. The ruling provides a one-week pause on the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which was set to expire. Advocacy groups argue that Afghanistan remains unsafe for return, while the administration contends the country's security situation has improved. This decision allows time for legal arguments to be filed, offering a brief reprieve for families facing uncertainty about their futures.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has announced it will soon restart sales of its H20 AI chips to China, a significant development following a previous halt due to U.S. export controls. The company stated it received assurances from the U.S. government that the necessary licenses will be granted. This move comes after CEO Jensen Huang lobbied against the restrictions, arguing they hinder American tech leadership. The resumption of sales for these specialized chips is expected to reinforce Nvidia's market position in China and serve as a new growth catalyst. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's gross domestic product expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, a rate faster than economists had anticipated, easing pressure on Beijing to implement further economic stimulus. Despite the strong GDP figure, which surpassed the government's full-year target, other indicators suggest underlying fragility, such as slowing retail sales growth. Industrial output, however, grew more than expected. The data reflects a mixed economic picture as the country navigates an unstable external environment and insufficient domestic demand, with economists remaining cautious about future headwinds.

Authorities responded to a call about the bear at a gas station, but the coroner quickly determined it was not made of human remains. The suspect, Hector Corona Villanueva, was arrested on suspicion of filing a false report and planting evidence. An artist from South Carolina confirmed she created the prop and had shipped it to a customer in the area, stating she was unaware of the buyer's intentions.</p>

The grueling 135-mile ultramarathon starts in Death Valley, below sea level, and climbs to an elevation of over 8,300 feet, with temperatures often exceeding 120°F. Becker completed the race with about three hours to spare, successfully settling a score after he narrowly missed the 48-hour cutoff time in 2022.
