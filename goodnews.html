          <p>Bitcoin briefly touched a new all-time high before slipping as rising Treasury yields and stock declines pressured risk assets. The cryptocurrency's recent surge has been attributed to factors such as softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. Investors are anticipating regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments to further drive bitcoin prices higher. Despite the volatility, cumulative inflows into ETFs tracking bitcoin's price have surpassed $40 billion, signaling continued institutional interest. (not investment advice)</p>

The bill advanced by the House Ways and Means Committee also includes a no tax on tips provision. A no tax on tips policy could create several issues, Muresianu said. For example, there could be the introduction of tips in new occupations, or a shift in compensation in already tipped occupations toward a greater reliance on tips.</p>
