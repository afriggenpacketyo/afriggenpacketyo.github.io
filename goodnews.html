          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 19:09:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst claims of a "White genocide" in South Africa, some Afrikaners are pushing back against the narrative, asserting that it is untrue and not widely held within their community. The article cites Afrikaner commentator Piet Croucamp, who states that Whites remain economically strong, holding a majority of boardroom positions and earning higher incomes. Cattle farmer Nick Serfontein also disputes the genocide claim, emphasizing that while violent attacks on farmers occur, racial motives are not generally a factor. He highlights his project to train young Black farmers, expressing optimism about the future of shared land ownership. </p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holding is rebranding its digital entertainment division as Hujing Digital Media and Entertainment Group, using the Chinese name for the orca, or killer whale. This move is part of a broader strategy to revitalize growth outside its core e-commerce and cloud businesses. The company stated that orcas represent characteristics such as flexibility and intelligence, aligning with the group's pursuit of digital intelligence, symbiosis, and happiness. This rebranding is in line with Alibaba's strategy to "return to the original mission and start a new business," following a major restructuring two years ago.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new all-time high, driven by factors such as softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. The price of the cryptocurrency rose to $108,955.10, with a high of $109,857, according to Coin Metrics. Cumulative inflows into exchange-traded funds that track the price of bitcoin surpassed $40 billion last week, benefiting from liquidity in the stock market and recent risk-off scenarios. The Senate also voted to advance legislation that would create the first regulatory framework in the U.S. for stablecoins.</p>

          <p>The UK is set to sign a deal with Mauritius, ceding sovereignty of the Chagos Islands while leasing back a crucial military base on the archipelago for 99 years. The deal, which follows negotiations with the former Mauritian leader, was delayed after a change in government in both Mauritius and the US. The agreement includes a multi-billion pound payment from Britain to Mauritius. The UK has faced increasing international pressure to hand over control of the islands, and Labour argues that the deal is in the UK's national security interest.</p>
