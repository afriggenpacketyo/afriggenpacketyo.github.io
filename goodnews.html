          <p>British-South African endurance athlete Lewis Pugh completed a 62-mile swim around Martha's Vineyard to raise awareness about the importance of shark conservation. Pugh aimed to challenge the negative perception of sharks perpetuated by the film "Jaws," which was filmed in the area. He emphasized that sharks are essential apex predators for a healthy ocean ecosystem and that around 274,000 sharks are killed globally each day. Pugh was accompanied by safety personnel and a "Shark Shield" device to deter sharks without harming them during his 12-day swim.</p>

As the 25th overall pick, Dart is slated to earn $16.9 million over four years, including a $9 million signing bonus. Dart has been wearing No. 6 during rookie minicamp and is still considering a deal for No. 2.</p>

          <p>An article discusses the historical rise and fall of electric vehicles in the early 20th century and draws parallels to current challenges faced by the industry. The dominance of cheaper, gasoline-powered cars and a lack of infrastructure led to the decline of electric vehicles by the 1930s. Now, as electric vehicles face political opposition and infrastructure limitations, there are concerns about history repeating itself. Despite challenges, advocates remain optimistic about technical advances and the potential for electric vehicles to overcome these obstacles.</p>

Despite a high percentage of pitches in the strike zone, Scott's mistake pitches are being capitalized on by opposing hitters.

The team is relying on Scott's performance due to injuries to other key relievers, making these adjustments crucial for stabilizing the bullpen.</p>
