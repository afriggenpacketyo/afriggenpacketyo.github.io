          <p>The city of Berlin will rename a prominent central street in honor of Helmut Kohl, the former chancellor widely regarded as the architect of German reunification in 1990. The decision recognizes his crucial role in navigating the political landscape after the fall of the Berlin Wall, though his legacy was later tarnished by a party donations scandal. The newly named Helmut Kohl Avenue will be located in the Tiergarten district, near significant national monuments like the Victory Column and Brandenburg Gate.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-30 08:39:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to common practice, cybersecurity experts suggest that users should not immediately delete spam emails but instead report them to their email providers. Reporting these messages helps train and improve the provider's spam detection algorithms, making them more effective at identifying and blocking malicious or unwanted emails for all users in the future. While unsubscribing can sometimes confirm an active email address to scammers, reporting junk mail is a safe and constructive action that contributes to a more secure online environment.</p>

          <p>A growing number of individuals are using AI chatbots like ChatGPT for mental health support, citing the high cost and lack of access to human therapists. Users find the AI to be an accessible, non-judgmental tool for daily comfort or for rehearsing difficult conversations, filling a critical gap in mental healthcare. However, bioethics experts warn of significant risks, including the creation of false intimacy, a lack of professional oversight, and potential for harm, especially without proper regulation and human supervision.</p>

They conclude that building a stronger, more knowledgeable Jewish identity is the best way to not only withstand hatred but also to live a more meaningful life.</p>
