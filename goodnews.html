          <p>Bitcoin's price has surged to a new record high above $111,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership and corporate adoption. The rise is attributed to positive momentum, growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. Despite a drop in U.S. equities, Bitcoin has diverged, suggesting investors are seeking alternative stores of value. Pro-crypto policies from the Trump administration and the Senate's advancement of crypto legislation are also contributing factors. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a former skeptic, announced the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Svetlana Dali, a Russian citizen and U.S. permanent resident, was found guilty by a federal jury of stowing away on a Delta flight from New York to Paris. Dali admitted to boarding the flight without a ticket by passing through a security lane reserved for crewmembers and blending in with boarding passengers. She claimed to have spent most of the flight in the bathroom. Following her release from custody after the incident, Dali allegedly cut off her ankle monitor and attempted to cross into Canada. A Transportation Security Administration spokesperson said additional security measures are now in place to prevent similar incidents.</p>

          <p>Most teachers and doctors in England will receive a 4% pay raise after the government accepted recommendations from pay review bodies. This award exceeds the previously budgeted 2.8%, with ministers stating that most of the remaining funds will come from existing budgets. Education unions have welcomed the decision but warned of potential cuts to school budgets without additional funding. Health unions, however, reacted negatively, as NHS staff other than doctors were offered a smaller 3.6% rise. The British Medical Association plans to ballot resident doctors over possible strike action, deeming the rise "woefully inadequate."</p>

          <p>The US Supreme Court was evenly split 4-4 on a case regarding public funding for a religious charter school in Oklahoma, resulting in the affirmation of a lower court ruling blocking the funding.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself from the case, and the deadlock sets no nationwide precedent.

          <h2>Treasury Department to Phase Out Penny Production</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 12:58:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Treasury Department plans to discontinue the production of pennies due to their high manufacturing cost, which exceeds the coin's value. The agency has placed its final order for penny blanks, with the United States Mint expected to cease manufacturing in early 2026. This decision is projected to save the Mint approximately $56 million annually. The Trump administration had previously signaled its intention to stop making the 1-cent coin, citing the rising costs of production.</p>

          <h2>Community Groups in Louisiana Sue Over Air Pollution Monitoring Restrictions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 12:55:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Community groups in Louisiana have filed a federal lawsuit challenging a state law that regulates air pollution monitoring, alleging it violates their constitutional rights. The law requires community groups to use federally-approved monitoring equipment and sets restrictions on analyzing and sharing data. Critics argue that the law is an attempt to stifle citizen groups from conducting air monitoring and sharing information about potential environmental violations. The groups' free-speech claims are based on Louisiana's alleged restrictions on publicly discussing or warning people about potentially dangerous air pollution.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 12:53:02 EDT</div>

          <p>If you owe back taxes, have unfiled returns or just got a letter from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) about a similar issue, there's a good chance that the penalties are piling up and interest is growing by the day. That's why more people are turning to tax relief specialists for help. Here are the top questions to prioritize right now if you're dealing with tax debt: What tax relief options am I eligible for based on my current situation? Can I stop IRS collections or garnishments while I explore my options? Will tax relief affect my credit or future tax refunds? What documents do I need to prepare before we start the relief process? What are your fees, and how do I know this will be worth it? (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Democrats seek to insulate security for judges from executive branch politics</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 12:47:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Congressional Democrats introduced a bill Thursday that would shift control of the U.S. Marshals Service from the executive branch to the federal judiciary, in an effort to insulate the agency from political interference and guarantee that judges receive strong security protections. The move comes as President Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi, and other top government officials this year rain down criticism on judges that are ruling against the administration in scores of court challenges. The Marshals protect judges, but they also report to the U.S. attorney general, not to the courts themselves.</p>
