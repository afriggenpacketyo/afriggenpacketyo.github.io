        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has detailed a scaled-back plan for reforming health and disability benefits, confirming that changes to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) will only affect new claimants. This decision follows a significant increase in the number of working-age adults claiming these benefits, rising from three million in 2019 to four million in 2025. A notable driver of this increase has been a rise in claims related to mental health conditions. Analysts suggest factors like the rising state pension age and greater public awareness of benefits may also be contributing to the trend.</p>

          <p>A 92-year-old man, Ryland Headley, has been convicted for the sexual assault and murder of 75-year-old Louisa Dunne in 1967, solving one of the longest-running cold cases in the United Kingdom. Dunne was found strangled in her home, but the case remained unsolved for 58 years. In 2023, investigators re-examined evidence, and modern forensic testing of DNA found on the victim's skirt linked Headley to the crime. The conviction brings a long-awaited resolution to a brutal crime that had remained a mystery for decades.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a one-month delay in its plan to cut off access to a satellite data program considered crucial for hurricane forecasting. The decision to suspend the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) data had alarmed scientists, who warned it could set forecasting back decades. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) stated the delay was requested by NASA and that the original plan was intended to mitigate a significant cybersecurity risk. The data will now continue to be available to forecasters until at least the end of July.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo were the "biggest winners" of the Federal Reserve's 2025 stress tests, according to Wall Street analysts. While all 22 major banks passed the tests, which simulate a severe economic downturn, these two firms saw the most significant reduction in their required stress capital buffers. This easing of capital requirements could allow them to increase shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks, as well as free up capital for lending and investment. The results are seen as another sign of a potentially less onerous regulatory environment for large banks. (not investment advice)</p>
