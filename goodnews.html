          <p>South Korea held presidential elections following months of instability culminating in the removal of the previous president. The election marks a pivotal moment for stabilizing the nation, but the incoming leader faces significant domestic and international challenges. The new president will need to address economic concerns, navigate relations with the United States under President Trump's policies, and manage the ongoing threat posed by North Korea. The outcome of the election is expected to shape South Korea's approach to these critical issues in the coming years.</p>

          <p>South Koreans are voting for a new president in a snap election triggered by the ouster of Yoon Suk Yeol, who faces rebellion charges over his imposition of martial law. Pre-election surveys suggest liberal candidate Lee Jae-myung is likely to win, riding public frustration over conservatives. The new president will face major challenges, including a slowing economy, President Trump's America-first policies, and North Korea's nuclear threats. The election is a defining moment for South Korea's democracy, but observers worry about a domestic divide worsened by Yoon.</p>

          <p>One of the famed bald eagle parents Jackie and Shadow's two eaglets, Sunny, took its first flight from their nest in Big Bear, California. The eaglet jumped off a branch, flapped her wings and flew away, leaving her sister Gizmo behind, though she is expected to leave the nest soon as well. The eaglets were born in March and are nearly 13 weeks old, making it prime-fledging time, which viewers of the Big Bear Eagle Nest Cam have been anticipating. Sunny's flight on Monday was the result of days of practice.</p>
