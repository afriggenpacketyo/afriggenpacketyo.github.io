          <p>British Steel has been awarded a five-year, ¬£500 million contract to supply train tracks to Network Rail, securing thousands of jobs at the Scunthorpe steelworks. This agreement guarantees work for the plant, which has been producing rail since 1865, and ensures British Steel will provide 80% of Network Rail's track needs. The government stepped in to prevent the closure of the plant's blast furnaces, highlighting the importance of domestic steel production for national security. The deal demonstrates the government's commitment to strengthening domestic manufacturing and supply chains to boost economic growth.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs analysts report a resurgence in China's private sector, citing the easing of regulatory restrictions aimed at fostering technological innovation and international expansion. Investment patterns suggest a renewal driven by capital expenditure, overseas expansion, R&D spending, and fundraising activities. The report emphasizes the importance of predictable policies, macroeconomic stimulus, and stable U.S.-China relations for sustained growth. China's private sector, which accounts for a significant portion of the country's GDP and employment, experienced challenges during strict pandemic restrictions and regulatory crackdowns, but is now receiving renewed support from Beijing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that global oil demand will continue to grow until the end of the decade, despite a projected peak in China's demand by 2027. The IEA anticipates that cheaper gasoline and slower electric vehicle adoption in the United States will support consumption. Global oil demand is expected to peak at 105.6 million barrels per day by 2029, with production capacity rising to 114.7 million bpd by 2030. The IEA notes that the market appears well-supplied through 2030, but highlights geopolitical risks to oil supply security.</p>

          <p>The Leipzig Bach Festival is showcasing contemporary arrangements of Johann Sebastian Bach's masterpieces that address themes of oppression and conflict. Performances such as the "Queer Passion" and the "Arabian Passion" use Bach's music to highlight issues facing the LGBTQ community and promote peace in the Middle East. The festival's theme of "transformation" is reflected in the reinterpretations of Bach's works, which often incorporate new instruments and lyrics. The event is also celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Leipzig Bach Archive and is bringing Bach to life through digital technology.</p>

At 36, Woakes is the oldest player in the squad and his accuracy and movement are expected to challenge the Indian batting lineup. He is seen as a senior bowler who can provide leadership and experience to the team. His presence is especially important given the lack of experience in English conditions among the Indian batsmen.</p>
