          <p>China's industrial profits saw a second consecutive month of growth in April, accelerating from 2.6% in March to 3%, despite ongoing U.S. tariffs and deflationary pressures. This improvement is largely attributed to Beijing's policy measures aimed at supporting businesses, particularly in the private sector, which offset some of the tariff impacts. High-tech manufacturing, including biopharmaceutical products and aircraft manufacturing, experienced significant profit increases. However, certain sectors like automobiles and apparel faced headwinds due to price competition and shifting demand. (not investment advice)</p>
