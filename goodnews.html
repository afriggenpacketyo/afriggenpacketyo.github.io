          <p>As students across the UK receive exam results, this article profiles four individuals who achieved their dream careers without attending university. Their paths include becoming a celebrity photographer for stars like Harry Styles, a zookeeper working with lions, a film producer for major television shows, and a self-employed nail technician. These stories illustrate that apprenticeships, self-teaching, and turning hobbies into businesses are viable alternatives to traditional higher education. The individuals advise young people to be patient, use regular jobs to fund their passions, and not feel pressured into a path that isn't right for them, emphasizing hands-on experience as a powerful teacher.</p>

          <p>The first direct air shipment of fresh Cambodian durians has arrived in China, establishing a new air corridor for fruit between the two nations and marking an expansion of what some call China's "durian diplomacy." A two-tonne shipment was transported via cold chain logistics in just four hours, allowing the fruit to reach Chinese consumers with maximum freshness. Durian is now the fifth fresh fruit from Cambodia approved for direct import into the Chinese market, joining bananas, mangoes, longans, and coconuts. This development underscores the strengthening agricultural trade ties and increased customs efficiency between the two countries, though some industry insiders remain cautious about the fruit's market competitiveness.</p>

          <p>In a significant act of cooperation with the Trump administration, Mexico has extradited 26 high-level cartel figures to the United States to face justice. The group includes prominent leaders such as Abigael González Valencia of "Los Cuinis," an affiliate of the CJNG cartel, and Servando "La Tuta" Gómez Martinez, former head of the Knights Templar cartel. This marks the second major extradition of cartel members in recent months, reflecting increased pressure from the U.S. to dismantle the criminal networks responsible for drug trafficking and violence. The move is seen as a milestone in the Justice Department's efforts and follows President Trump's designation of several major cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comprehensive timeline of the high-profile Karen Read case, culminating in her recent retrial verdict. Jurors acquitted Read of the most serious charges, including second-degree murder and manslaughter, in the 2022 death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, but convicted her of driving under the influence. The case was marked by intense legal battles, with the defense arguing Read was framed in an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement, while the prosecution maintained she struck O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die. The first trial ended in a hung jury, leading to a second trial that captured widespread public and media attention.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 22:42:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate hundreds of National Science Foundation (NSF) research grants for UCLA that were abruptly frozen. The ruling stated the government's suspension of over 300 grants, totaling a significant portion of $584 million in frozen funds, violated a previous court order. The administration had cited alleged discrimination and antisemitism at the university as reasons for the freeze, but the judge found the indefinite suspensions were equivalent to a termination. This decision is a major development in the legal battle between UC researchers and the administration, potentially giving UCLA more leverage against demands for a $1 billion payment to restore all its funding.</p>

          <p>United Launch Alliance's new Vulcan rocket completed its first operational mission, successfully launching two military satellites into geosynchronous orbit for the U.S. Space Force. The launch from Cape Canaveral marks a major milestone for the Vulcan, which is set to replace ULA's legacy Atlas V and Delta rockets. This flight was the first to be certified to carry expensive national security payloads, including an experimental satellite, NTS-3, designed to test advanced navigation technology. The powerful new rocket, featuring Blue Origin's BE-4 engines, is designed to deliver heavy payloads directly to high orbits, positioning ULA to compete in the national security launch market.</p>

          <h2>China to Subsidize Interest on Consumer Loans in Effort to Boost Domestic Spending</h2>

          <p>China has unveiled a year-long initiative to subsidize interest costs on personal consumer loans, aiming to stimulate household spending and support domestic demand. Under the plan, the government will cover one percentage point of the annual interest on loans for purchases like cars and education, with the subsidy capped at half the contracted interest rate. The policy, effective from September, is designed to lower credit costs for households and channel more funds into the consumption sector. A finance ministry official stated the goal is to help consumption become the primary driver of the national economy, with the central government funding 90% of the program.

          <h2>AI Startup Perplexity Makes Unsolicited $34.5 Billion Offer for Google's Chrome Browser</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The AI startup Perplexity has made a surprise, unsolicited bid of $34.5 billion to acquire Google's Chrome web browser. This offer comes after a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust ruling suggested Google should divest Chrome to remedy its illegal monopoly in the internet search market. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine, recently launched its own browser and argues that an independent Chrome would benefit user safety and the open web. While the bid is higher than Perplexity's current valuation, the company claims to have backing from investors, though some industry analysts have dismissed the offer as a publicity stunt and significantly below Chrome's actual value.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that while overall cancer survival has vastly improved over the last 50 years, progress has been starkly uneven, with the deadliest cancers falling further behind. For all cancers combined, half of patients now live for at least ten years, double the rate from the 1970s, with survival for melanoma skin cancer exceeding 90%. However, there has been little improvement for cancers of the pancreas, oesophagus, stomach, and lungs, which all have 10-year survival rates below 20%. Experts attribute the gains to better treatments and earlier detection but warn that the rate of progress has slowed, calling for a renewed focus on the most lethal forms of the disease.</p>

          <p>The UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) will add questions about life-saving first aid to the driving theory test for cars and motorcycles starting in early 2026. The goal is to ensure the 2.4 million people who take the test each year have a basic understanding of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and how to use a defibrillator. The agency notes that drivers are often the first to arrive at the scene of a cardiac arrest, and immediate intervention can dramatically increase survival rates. Learning materials have already been updated with the new content to encourage all road users to learn these essential emergency skills.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers rookie receiver Ladd McConkey is now able to learn in person from veteran Keenan Allen, whose practice film he studied extensively before Allen's return to the team. McConkey, who broke Allen's rookie franchise records, says he is constantly picking the veteran's brain to absorb lessons on route running and leveraging defenders. The two are now participating in practice sessions together, with offensive coordinator Greg Roman noting that Allen's presence adds flexibility and strength to the offense. The collaboration between the 33-year-old veteran and the 23-year-old rookie is an exciting prospect for the team's versatile receiver corps.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) has lifted the boil water notice for approximately 9,200 households in Granada Hills and Porter Ranch. The advisory was in place for a week after a faulty, nearly-closed valve from 1967 disrupted water flow, causing outages and low pressure. After complex repairs, the DWP confirmed the water is now safe to drink following successful testing. The agency is urging residents to thoroughly flush all pipes, faucets, and water-using appliances to clear out any stagnant water or sediment before consumption. Affected customers will receive a $20 credit on their bills for the inconvenience.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has formally acknowledged that France used "repressive violence" in Cameroon during the nation's fight for independence in the 1950s. In a letter to his Cameroonian counterpart, Macron accepted France's role and responsibility for events that cost tens of thousands of lives. This admission follows a 2022 report by French and Cameroonian historians, which detailed how French colonial authorities used mass displacement and supported brutal militias to suppress the independence movement. The acknowledgement is part of Macron's broader effort to confront France's colonial history, even as critics argue his gestures do not go far enough in addressing past atrocities.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles police have arrested four teenagers allegedly connected to a string of burglaries targeting high-profile celebrities, including a recent break-in at actor Brad Pitt's home. The suspects, described as street gang members, are believed to be part of a crew that has burglarized the homes of actors and professional athletes. The investigation began after Pitt's Los Feliz home was ransacked in late June when thieves hopped a fence and shattered a window. Police Chief Jim McDonnell noted that burglars are becoming more sophisticated, using surveillance cameras and Wi-Fi jammers, and often target celebrities whose travel schedules are public.</p>
