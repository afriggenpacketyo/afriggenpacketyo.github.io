          <p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated that Israel is not attempting to involve the U.S. in its conflict with Iran, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Herzog described the U.S. decision to strike Iran's nuclear infrastructure as "the right step" for American and global security, citing the Iranian nuclear program as a threat. Despite the military involvement, Herzog emphasized the importance of diplomacy and urged for renewed talks with Iran that are clear and substantive, given past failures in negotiations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio echoed Herzog's message, asserting that the U.S. is not at war with Iran but remains open to a diplomatic path forward. </p>

          <p>Snopes investigated a rumor circulating online that Iranian state TV announced a "great surprise" that the world would remember for centuries. The rumor spread widely on social media and was reported as fact by some news outlets. However, Snopes found no evidence to support the claim, as major news services did not report the announcement, and the earliest instance of the text appeared on an unverified X account. While Snopes could not definitively disprove the rumor, the lack of credible sourcing suggests it is likely false.</p>

          <p>Tens of millions of people across the Midwest and East Coast are experiencing dangerously high temperatures as a rare June heatwave persists. Multiple cities are under heat advisories, with heat indices expected to exceed 100¬∞F. Public health departments are taking measures to protect residents, such as opening cooling centers and providing heat-related guidance. The extreme heat is attributed to a heat dome, a large area of high pressure trapping heat and humidity, with meteorologists noting the unusual extent of the affected region.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Middle East largely remained stable on Sunday following the United States' strike on Iranian nuclear sites. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, driven by expectations that Washington's involvement could expedite a resolution to the conflict. While Saudi Arabia's Tadawul experienced a slight dip, Egypt's EGX30 saw significant gains. Analysts suggest that the Gulf's call for de-escalation and peaceful resolution has helped insulate it from major market disruptions, with some viewing the removal of the Iranian threat as a potentially positive development.

          <p>A study analyzing over 200 parent-child relationships identified five phrases that commonly cause children to resist listening. These phrases, such as "Because I said so" and "Stop crying," trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, hindering their ability to learn and cooperate. The study suggests alternative phrases that honor a child's autonomy while maintaining boundaries, promoting better communication and cooperation. By shifting from controlling language to empathetic and respectful communication, parents can foster a more positive and effective relationship with their children.</p>

          <p>Spain has secured an agreement with NATO to be exempt from the alliance's 5% of GDP defense spending target. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez deemed the target "disproportionate and unnecessary," asserting that Spain can fulfill its NATO commitments with 2.1% of its GDP. This decision follows concerns that Spain's objection could disrupt the upcoming NATO summit. Despite having the lowest defense expenditure proportion in the alliance last year, Spain reaffirmed its commitment to meeting NATO's current 2% target this year.</p>
