          <p>Alan Yentob, the BBC's long-serving arts broadcaster and documentary maker, has passed away at the age of 78. Throughout his career, Yentob interviewed a variety of cultural figures, including David Bowie, Maya Angelou, and Grayson Perry, for TV series like Omnibus, Arena, and Imagine. He also held positions such as controller of BBC One and Two, as well as creative director and head of music and arts. BBC director-general Tim Davie called him a "creative force and cultural visionary" who championed originality, risk-taking, and artistic ambition, and his wife described him as "curious, funny, annoying, late and creative in every cell of his body." The article reflects on his significant contributions to the BBC and the arts world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first rail firm to be renationalized under Labour, with the first nationalized service departing from Woking to Surbiton. The government has termed the move a "new dawn for rail," but has refrained from promising lower fares, focusing instead on improving services and investing in infrastructure. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander stated that she could not promise lower ticket prices, citing the ¬£2bn annual taxpayer subsidy for running the trains. The BBC's Peter Henley was among the first passengers, although he had to transfer to a rail replacement bus at Surbiton due to engineering works.</p>

          <p>The American economy has faced significant chaos over the past half-decade, including a pandemic, recession, inflationary spiral, and trade war. Despite these challenges, corporate profits are high, the jobless rate is low, and new businesses are flourishing. However, the article suggests that this resilience may be wearing off, with businesses now facing unstable tariff rates, bond-market swings, and rising import costs. The author discusses how governmental responses to the pandemic, such as low borrowing costs and financial support to families and companies, played a key role in economic strength.</p>

O'Hara is focused on "getting back to the basics," reducing crime, and earning community trust.
