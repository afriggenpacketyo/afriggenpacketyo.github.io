          <h2>"Clear Protein" Emerges as a Popular Nutritional Supplement Trend</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 17:00:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trend in nutritional supplements, known as "clear protein," is gaining popularity among consumers seeking high-protein options without the heavy, milky texture of traditional shakes. Made from whey protein isolate, these products mix with water to create a juice-like beverage and are often lower in fat, carbs, and lactose. While searches for the product have surged, nutrition experts note that it isn't inherently healthier than traditional whey concentrate and often contains artificial sweeteners. Both forms typically deliver a similar amount of protein per serving, making the choice a matter of personal preference and lifestyle.</p>

          <p>Pop singer Sabrina Carpenter has released her new album, "Man's Best Friend," which follows up on her successful 2024 record "Short n' Sweet." The album's central theme explores the singer's continued frustrations with her love life despite achieving superstardom, detailing encounters with various unimpressive men. Musically, the album continues to draw from 70s AM-radio pop, disco, and country influences, crafted with producer Jack Antonoff. While some critics find it slightly less sharp than its predecessor, the album is noted for its witty lyricism and Carpenter's versatile vocal performance.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he has solved the mystery of a large gash found in the newly installed limestone in the White House Rose Garden. In a social media post, Trump described how he noticed the damage and demanded an investigation, using White House security footage to identify the cause. He stated the damage was accidentally caused by a subcontractor's faulty steel cart rubbing against the stone. Trump declared that the contractor would be charged for the replacement and would not be permitted to work at the White House again, emphasizing the importance of surfaces to him as a builder.</p>

          <p>Despite securing a dramatic 3-2 victory against Burnley with a late penalty, Manchester United's performance has highlighted ongoing problems, particularly with their goalkeepers. Manager Ruben Amorim acknowledged the team's vulnerability, noting that every opposition possession near their box feels like a scoring threat. The winning match featured another significant error from goalkeeper Altay Bayindir, following similar mistakes in previous games by both him and Andre Onana. These recurring issues are fueling speculation that the club may seek to sign a new goalkeeper before the transfer deadline closes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Medical and psychological experts are providing guidance on appropriate screen time for children based on developmental stages, despite a lack of uniform international rules. The consensus recommends being screen-free until age three, allowing toddlers to explore their physical environment and develop attention control. For preschool children, limited and supervised screen time is advised to encourage imaginative play and social interaction. As children get older, the focus shifts from time limits to the quality of content and maintaining open communication, ensuring digital consumption does not replace essential real-world activities and social development.</p>

          <h2>Massive Hydrothermal Vent Field Discovered in Pacific Ocean</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered a massive hydrothermal vent field in the Pacific Ocean, named the Kunlun field, which is over a hundred times larger than the famous "Lost City" field in the Atlantic. Located northeast of Papua New Guinea, the site features deep craters and carbonate walls gushing hydrogen-rich fluids at relatively low temperatures. Scientists believe this unique environment, which supports a diverse ecosystem of deep-sea life, may resemble the conditions on early Earth where life first began. The discovery challenges previous assumptions about where such systems can form and could be a target for future research into abiogenesis.</p>

          <p>Jack Grealish has made a significant impact at Everton since joining on a season-long loan from Manchester City, earning man-of-the-match honors in a recent win against Wolverhampton Wanderers. After a season with limited starts at his parent club, Grealish has provided four assists in two games for Everton, revitalizing his form. Everton manager David Moyes lauded the player's performance, stating he is "even better than I thought." Grealish's resurgence has sparked discussion about whether he can force his way back into England's national team plans ahead of the next World Cup.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Coco Gauff has advanced to the fourth round of the US Open after a confident 6-3, 6-1 victory over Magdalena Frech. The win marked a significant improvement in form for Gauff, who had struggled through two tense, emotional matches earlier in the week after a recent coaching change aimed at fixing her serve. Against Frech, Gauff played with more composure and effectiveness, demonstrating a stronger mental game and more reliable serving. She will next face two-time US Open champion Naomi Osaka in a highly anticipated round of 16 matchup.</p>

          <p>New York City's health department has officially declared the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem to be over, as no new cases have been reported since August 9. The outbreak resulted in 114 confirmed cases, leading to 90 hospitalizations and seven deaths. The source of the bacteria was traced to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been cleaned and disinfected. In response, the city administration has proposed new regulations to enhance the inspection and testing frequency of cooling towers to prevent future clusters.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 12:50:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that stethoscopes enhanced with artificial intelligence can detect three major heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—almost instantly. Researchers in the UK conducted a study across 205 GP surgeries, finding the AI tool significantly increased the detection rates for these conditions compared to traditional methods. The device analyzes subtle heart sounds and electrical signals that are undetectable by the human ear, sending the data to an AI for analysis. Experts believe this innovation could be a "game-changer," enabling earlier diagnosis and treatment for patients.</p>
