          <p>Former President Donald Trump has departed Scotland following a four-day visit that included a meeting with First Minister John Swinney. The two leaders discussed the potential for reducing U.S. tariffs on Scotch whisky and the ongoing conflict in Gaza, with Swinney urging Trump to use his influence to secure a ceasefire. Trump also commented on North Sea oil and gas taxation, aligning with Swinney's view that the industry is overtaxed. The visit combined political discussions with the opening of a new golf course at Trump's Aberdeenshire resort, where he was gifted historical documents related to his Scottish mother.</p>

          <p>University of Colorado football coach Deion Sanders has announced he is now cancer-free and is speaking candidly about his experience with bladder cancer to combat public stigma. Sanders shared details of his difficult journey, including significant weight loss and ongoing issues with bladder control, which he addresses with humor and transparency. He stressed the importance of not being ashamed of such health issues and urged everyone, particularly African American men who may be hesitant, to get regular medical checkups. Sanders credited early detection for saving his life and hopes his story will encourage others to prioritize their health.</p>

          <p>Republican Senate candidate Mike Rogers states that an endorsement from former President Donald Trump provides a significant boost to his campaign to flip a key Democrat-held seat in Michigan. The endorsement helped clear the primary field for Rogers, who is making his second consecutive run for the Senate after a narrow loss in the previous election. Rogers noted that Trump's backing has already unified the state's Republican party and spurred an increase in fundraising efforts. He believes this early momentum gives him a strong advantage as he prepares for the 2026 midterm election.</p>

          <p>Real estate developers are finding new incentives to build affordable housing, which could soon become a more profitable sector. A recent tax and spending bill expanded the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, a key tool for financing such projects, which is expected to help create over a million additional affordable rental homes by 2035. Despite this support, developers still face challenges from high interest rates, construction costs, and local opposition. The industry also faces uncertainty from a proposed $27 billion cut to federal rental assistance programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Comedian and actor Marc Maron has announced that his influential podcast, 'WTF with Marc Maron,' will end this fall after a 16-year run. In a recent interview, Maron reflected on the decision, stating that he and his producer wanted to conclude the project while it was still high-quality rather than letting it diminish. He discussed his ongoing struggles with anxiety and the grief from losing his partner, Lynn Shelton, which he explores in his new HBO special, 'Panicked.' Maron acknowledged that the deep, real-time conversations on his podcast were nourishing and that he will need to find new ways to foster such connections in his life.</p>

          <p>A painting by Surrealist artist Salvador Dalí, which was purchased for only £150 at a house clearance sale in Cambridge, is now expected to sell for up to £30,000. An anonymous art dealer recognized the potential of the piece, titled 'Vecchio Sultano,' and had it authenticated by a Dalí expert. The artwork is part of a series illustrating tales from 'The Arabian Nights' that Dalí was commissioned to create in the 1960s. This particular piece was likely part of a batch that was lost by the original publishers, making its rediscovery significant for art scholars.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Donald Trump's recent visit to Scotland suggests it was highly successful, delivering on his passions for golf, business promotion, and trade deals. The trip featured a major trade agreement with the EU, extensive face-time with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to discuss Gaza and Ukraine, and opportunities to promote his golf resorts. While the visit was largely positive for Trump, he could not entirely escape the ongoing controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files, which followed him across the Atlantic. Overall, the trip reinforced his method of blending personal business with international diplomacy.</p>

          <p>Boeing has significantly reduced its quarterly losses and reported a 35% jump in revenue, fueled by its highest number of airplane deliveries since 2018. The aerospace giant lost $176 million, a substantial improvement from the $1.09 billion loss a year earlier, prompting CEO Kelly Ortberg to declare 2025 as the company's 'turnaround year.' This improved performance follows years of crises and indicates that more stable production and increased deliveries are helping the manufacturer's recovery. However, the company still faces challenges, including delays in certifying new 737 MAX models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Union Pacific has proposed an $85 billion acquisition of Norfolk Southern, a deal that would create the first single transcontinental railroad in United States history. The merger aims to streamline national deliveries by connecting Union Pacific's extensive western network with Norfolk Southern's network across 22 eastern states. While the railroads argue this will improve efficiency and delivery times, the deal will face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators due to concerns about competition and the potential for service disruptions. If approved, the move could trigger further consolidation among the remaining major North American railroads. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eloghosa Osunde’s new novel, 'Necessary Fiction,' is reviewed as a powerful exploration of kinship and community among queer Nigerians who form their own support systems. The article highlights how the book depicts family not as a biological obligation but as a deliberate and sustained act of love, a concept particularly relevant in a world of increasing atomization. By focusing on the deep, restorative bonds of 'chosen family,' the novel offers a compelling vision for how meaningful connections can be forged. It is presented as a singular work within a growing body of LGBTQ literature from Africa.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded its forecast for global economic growth, partly due to a softening of some U.S. tariffs and a surge in U.S. imports as firms rushed to beat new taxes. The IMF now predicts 3% global growth in 2025, up from its April forecast of 2.8%, though this is still below pre-pandemic averages. The organization warned that this boost from 'front-loading' trade is temporary and that higher tariffs and ongoing uncertainty could still weaken the economy.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell has consistently stated that decisions are based on economic data, not political pressure. While the economy shows signs of slowing, the labor market remains solid, giving the Fed justification to wait before making any changes. (not investment advice)</p>
