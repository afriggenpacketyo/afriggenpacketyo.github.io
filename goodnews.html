        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA will continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for high-risk groups like seniors but will require vaccine makers to conduct randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials before approving them for wider use. This decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall. FDA officials cited poor uptake of past annual COVID-19 booster shots and the need for evidence-based strategies. Vaccine makers are evaluating the details and engaging in ongoing talks with the FDA, while the agency is being urged to run new randomized studies in adults between the ages of 50 and 64, where they believe the balance of benefits and risks is uncertain.</p>

          <p>George Wendt, the comedian and actor celebrated for his role as Norm on the NBC sitcom "Cheers," has died peacefully in his sleep at home at the age of 76. Wendt, a Chicago native and uncle of actor Jason Sudeikis, was best known for playing Norm Peterson on "Cheers," which ran from 1982 to 1993, earning him six consecutive Primetime Emmy Award nominations. He reunited with some of the cast of "Cheers" at the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2024. Following his fame on the sitcom, Wendt continued acting and appeared in several TV shows and movies, including "Sabrina the Teenage Witch" and "Saturday Night Live."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the Trump administration won't force Medicaid to cover GLP-1s for obesity, a few states are doing it anyway, but access to GLP-1s, a class of expensive weight loss drugs, remains limited for many patients due to cost concerns among insurers. Only a small number of states cover these drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries, and even in those states, stringent prerequisites limit access. South Carolina Medicaid, for example, estimates only 1,300 beneficiaries will meet the requirements for GLP-1 coverage. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has suggested Medicare and Medicaid might cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment in the future as costs come down.</p>

          <p>England will be the first country in the world to start vaccinating people against gonorrhoea, primarily targeting gay and bisexual men with a history of multiple sexual partners or an STI. The vaccine, originally designed for meningitis B, has shown 30-40% effectiveness against gonorrhoea. NHS England hopes the vaccine will reverse soaring numbers of infections, which reached over 85,000 cases in 2023, the highest since records began in 1918. Vaccination will start in August and will be offered through sexual health services.</p>

          <p>China and the US have stepped back from the brink of a damaging trade decoupling, with better-than-expected results from their Geneva negotiations. The US has scaled back its tariffs on Chinese goods from the prohibitive 145 per cent, but the remaining cumulative tariffs hovering around 50 per cent still cast a long shadow over bilateral trade. Most expect tariffs on Chinese goods to either hold steady or decrease further once the 90-day period lapses.</p>

          <p>Palo Alto Networks shares fell despite reporting better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its April quarter, likely because the company did not raise its full-year outlook for key metrics like remaining performance obligation (RPO) and next-gen security ARR. The cybersecurity company's revenue increased 15% year over year to $2.29 billion, and adjusted earnings per share increased 21% to 80 cents. CEO Nikesh Arora emphasized customer adoption for next-generation security products, with annual recurring revenue (ARR) for those products reaching $5 billion. The company is reiterating its $225 price target and hold-equivalent 2 rating. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump unveiled plans for his ‚ÄúGolden Dome‚Äù missile defense shield on Tuesday, predicting that the ambitious plan to expand the country‚Äôs air defense system would be completed by the end of his term. U.S. officials have said the Golden Dome is necessary to protect against ‚Äúcatastrophic attacks,‚Äù but experts say it faces logistical and financial hurdles. Mr. Trump has said the project will cost $175 billion, although the Congressional Budget Office said it would likely cost far more, as much as $542 billion. Mr. Trump said he was confident that the United States could complete the project in about three years and be ‚Äúfully operational before the end of my term.‚Äù</p>
