          <p>Amidst ongoing tariff turbulence, the UK and US have reached a tariffs agreement, marking a triumph for Downing Street. The aerospace industry will see tariffs removed completely, while a 10% levy will be applied to the car industry, alleviating concerns about potential job losses in the West Midlands. While Britain remains subject to a 25% tariff on steel and aluminium due to technicalities, negotiations continue to resolve the issue. The deal also includes reciprocal access to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef being sold each way, ensuring British farmers can export beef to the US without compromising food safety standards. This agreement, though not a full-fledged US-UK trade deal, represents an achievement for the Prime Minister on the international stage. Optimism score of 75.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced it would slow the pace of government bond purchases from April of next year, while holding the benchmark rate at 0.5% amidst rising growth risks. The central bank aims to improve the functioning of the JGB markets in a manner that supports stability in the markets, reducing monthly purchases of Japanese government bonds by about 400 billion yen per quarter to about 3 trillion yen until March 2026. Inflation in Japan has remained high, partly due to a rice shortage, with rice prices shooting up and Japan's government releasing emergency stockpiles prices. The BOJ will conduct another interim assessment at its June 2026 monetary policy meeting, as the economy faces growth uncertainty while inflation has run above the BOJ's target for around three years.

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump made little headway in bridging gaps over tariffs at their summit on Monday, casting doubt on the prospect of a quick yet "mutually beneficial" package deal.

A 25 percent tariff on autos is seen as a sticking point, as the auto sector forms the backbone of the Japanese economy. Despite economists predicting that higher U.S. tariffs would push down economic growth, Ishiba has consistently said Japan would not rush to make a quick deal at the expense of national interests.
