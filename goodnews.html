Stokes dismissed Sai Sudharsan, checking India's progress, leaving them at 90-2 with a 96-run lead at the close of play. Brook's innings, marked by aggressive strokes and dropped catches, propelled England to virtual parity after a rapid stand with Chris Woakes.

          <p>Middle Eastern markets mostly closed higher on Sunday following the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, with Tel Aviv stocks reaching an all-time high amid hopes for a resolution to the conflict. Saudi Arabia's Tadawul experienced a slight decline, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains; Bahrain issued a "work from home mandate" to ensure public safety. Egypt's EGX30 index was the region's top performer, closing significantly higher, while analysts suggest the Gulf's distancing from the conflict and calls for peaceful resolution have mitigated short-term market impacts. Concerns remain about regional stability, with the UAE and Qatar urging de-escalation.</p>

          <h2>Toxic Phrases That Make Kids Refuse to Listen</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Based on studies of parent-child relationships, certain phrases can trigger defiance in children, leading to decreased cooperation. Instead of using phrases like "Because I said so" or "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," parents should explain their reasoning and give children agency over their behavior. Dismissing a child's emotions or assuming they are intentionally difficult can also be counterproductive; instead, parents should validate their feelings and invite problem-solving. Shifting from punishment to partnership can foster trust and emotional resilience in children.</p>

          <p>Tesla is launching its robotaxi service today, giving a select group of people the chance to ride in its Model Y Robotaxis in Austin, Texas. The pilot program will likely involve a small number of cars operating in a geofenced area, with invited riders using the Robotaxi App to hail the self-driving vehicles. The launch follows scrutiny from government officials and safety advocacy groups regarding autonomous vehicle safety, and Tesla is under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The rollout could help Tesla reach a $2 trillion market cap by the end of 2026, according to analysts.</p>

          <p>NATO members have agreed to increase defense spending to 5% of their countries' GDP, a benchmark long sought by the US, with Spain securing an exemption after initially opposing the measure. The deal requires all member nations except Spain to reach the 5% goal by 2035, with at least 3.5% of national GDP spent on core military needs and an additional 1.5% allocated for related expenditures. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez argued that the 5% figure was unreasonable and counterproductive, citing political pressure at home and Spain's ability to meet its NATO commitments with lower spending.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the U.S. is prepared to meet with Iran following the bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, urging Iran to pursue diplomacy and warning that closing the Strait of Hormuz would be "suicidal." Rubio emphasized that the U.S. mission was not an attack on the Iranian people or a move for regime change, but rather to degrade Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons. He also noted that the U.S. has no current plans for further attacks unless Iran provokes further action and that closing the Strait of Hormuz would prompt a global response.</p>
