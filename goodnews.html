          <p>Indie pop artist MARINA is releasing her sixth album, "Princess of Power," after a challenging period during which she recovered from chronic fatigue syndrome. The artist, Marina Diamandis, explained how the health issues forced her to change her entire life and rebuild her relationship with her career and identity. Despite never having a top 10 single in the U.S. or U.K., her music has gained significant traction on platforms like TikTok and influenced a new generation of artists, and she views her new work as a positive reclamation of her power.</p>

          <p>Charter and Disney have announced an expanded distribution agreement that restores several Disney-owned cable channels to Spectrum TV and adds the ad-supported version of Hulu for many subscribers at no extra cost. The deal resolves a 2023 dispute that led to a 10-day blackout of channels like ESPN, which had threatened access to major sporting events. The new pact is described as financially beneficial for both companies and reflects the increasing flexibility required in the pay-TV industry as it contends with declining subscriber numbers.</p>

          <p>Shares of the stablecoin issuer Circle have resumed a strong rally following its recent IPO, which has also positively impacted the stock of its key partner, Coinbase. As the main distribution platform for Circle's USDC stablecoin, Coinbase benefits directly from its success, a connection investors are increasingly recognizing. The market's volatility is being influenced by ongoing discussions around crypto regulation, such as the proposed GENIUS Act, and the potential for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, which could affect Circle's revenue from its reserves.

This strength is attributed to several factors, including a trade truce with China, strong corporate earnings, and sustained investor enthusiasm for the artificial intelligence sector.

          <p>In a remarkable underdog story, 21-year-old British tennis player Oliver Tarvet, ranked 719th in the world, has qualified for the main singles draw at Wimbledon for the first time.

Due to his amateur status as a student-athlete, he will have to forfeit the majority of the ¬£66,000 in prize money.

          <p>A new, yet-to-be-published study from the University of Toronto suggests that viewing graphic footage of industrial farming can be an effective tool for persuasion. Researchers found that students who watched a 16-minute clip from the animal rights documentary "Dominion" were significantly less likely to choose meat in a meal a week later. This finding challenges the long-held belief in the animal advocacy movement that it is nearly impossible to change individual dietary habits through direct appeals about animal welfare.</p>
