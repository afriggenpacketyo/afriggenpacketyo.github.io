          <p>Carlos Alcaraz clinched his second U.S. Open championship, overcoming defending champion Jannik Sinner in a four-set final. This victory marks Alcaraz's sixth major trophy and his second Grand Slam win of 2025, following his French Open triumph against Sinner. The match, delayed by enhanced security for President Trump's attendance, saw Alcaraz dominate, dropping only one set throughout the entire tournament. This historic final was the third consecutive Grand Slam meeting between the two rivals, solidifying their emerging rivalry in tennis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative study by Chinese and U.S. scientists, utilizing seismic data from NASA’s InSight lander, discovered that Mars has a solid inner core approximately 600km in radius. This finding challenges previous assumptions, as Mars was not expected to have cooled sufficiently to form such a core. The presence of a solid inner core, a feature shared with Earth and the Moon, could reignite discussions about whether Earth was once unique in developing plate tectonics. This significant geological discovery sheds new light on planetary evolution.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets largely rose, with Japan's Nikkei 225 jumping 1.5% and the Topix reaching a record high, after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his resignation. Investors are now eyeing potential successors like Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae, with Takaichi's pro-deregulation stance seen as a potential growth driver. The Japanese yen weakened, and government bond yields increased amid persistent inflation and tighter monetary policy expectations. Meanwhile, OPEC+ agreed to a slower oil production increase, and U.S. stock futures were flat ahead of key inflation data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz secured his second U.S. Open title by defeating Jannik Sinner in a match that was notably delayed due to enhanced security for President Trump's attendance. Trump, making his first U.S. Open appearance in a decade, received a mixed reaction of cheers and boos from the crowd. The event also highlighted Trump's recent imposition of tariffs on Swiss products, raising questions given his presence in Rolex's luxury box, a tournament sponsor.

Hamas later confirmed receiving ideas from the U.S. via mediators and is discussing them, reiterating its demand for a clear end to the war and complete Israeli withdrawal. Trump expressed optimism for a deal soon, believing all hostages would be returned. This article highlights high-stakes diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the conflict in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Robinson, 29, experienced the "biggest shock of her life" when she unexpectedly gave birth to her son, Henry, in a football club toilet, having been completely unaware of her pregnancy.

Despite suffering hip pain, which she attributed to a previous birth, Robinson reported no other typical pregnancy symptoms. The dramatic arrival saw her lift her son out of the toilet, with an off-duty paramedic assisting until an ambulance arrived. The baby was named Henry James in memory of a family friend.</p>

          <p>Global investors are increasingly diversifying away from U.S. equities towards Asia, a trend not seen in a decade, according to Bank of America. This shift is fueled by a weakening U.S. dollar, anticipated looser Federal Reserve monetary policy, and Asia's burgeoning artificial intelligence market. While U.S. equities attracted substantial capital in recent years, inflows have slowed, with investors now evenly allocating between U.S. and international markets. The global AI market is projected to quadruple by 2030, with Asia-Pacific potentially deploying a significant portion of this growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stargazers across Asia, parts of Europe, and Africa witnessed a spectacular "Blood Moon" during a total lunar eclipse on Sunday night. This phenomenon occurs when the Earth aligns between the sun and moon, casting a shadow that makes the moon appear an eerie deep red. Astrophysicists explain this coloration is due to sunlight reflecting and scattering through Earth's atmosphere, with shorter blue wavelengths dispersing more easily than red ones. The event, a source of wonder for millennia, was best viewed in Asia.</p>

Despite stepping down in 1982 to address a cocaine addiction, Burton returned to politics and later founded a nonprofit for foster youth, leaving a lasting legacy of fighting for the underdog.</p>

Despite an early German lead, Northern Ireland managed to equalize through Isaac Price's volley, demonstrating a strong fight. However, two quick goals from Nadiem Amiri and Florian Wirtz secured Germany's victory. O'Neill lamented some defensive errors and questioned a free-kick decision, acknowledging his squad's lack of depth for back-to-back away games.

          <p>California Republicans found rare unity and energy at their fall convention, galvanized by their opposition to Proposition 50, Governor Gavin Newsom's ballot measure to redraw congressional districts. Republicans view this measure as a Democratic attempt to "rig" the 2026 election, potentially costing them five U.S. House seats and control of Congress. With over $40 million already spent on campaigns for and against, the party sees defeating Proposition 50 as crucial for its survival. Gubernatorial candidates are also prioritizing this issue, urging activists to mobilize against what they perceive as a power grab.</p>
