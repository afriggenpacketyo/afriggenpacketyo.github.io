        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Susan Brownmiller, a feminist author and activist, passed away at 90; her book ‚ÄúAgainst Our Will: Men, Women and Rape‚Äù reshaped the modern understanding of sexual assault by reframing it as a crime of power and violence rather than passion. Published in 1975, the book offered a comprehensive history of sexual assault across centuries and examined its use as a wartime tactic. Brownmiller's work contributed to the rise of anti-sexual assault groups, self-defense classes, and the rewriting of sexual assault laws in several states, including the abolishment of the corroborating witness rule and the implementation of rape shield laws. Despite facing criticism for some of her views, Brownmiller remained a significant figure in the feminist movement, advocating against pornography and emphasizing the importance of women recognizing potential danger.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney invited King Charles III to open the 45th Canadian parliament, signaling Canada's sovereignty and independence amidst political tensions with the U.S. under President Donald Trump. The move is seen as a statement against Trump's undermining of Canada's sovereignty and aims to emphasize Canada's unique traditions. While the monarchy's popularity varies among Canadians, the invitation marks a shift towards a more supportive stance from the Liberal government, even though some Quebec politicians are still calling for Canada to cut ties with the monarchy.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his summer tour dates after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain condition affecting hearing, vision, and balance. Doctors say the condition, which involves a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, is treatable but often underdiagnosed, with symptoms that can mimic normal aging. Symptoms include difficulty walking, cognitive issues, and urinary incontinence, and diagnosis typically involves a CT scan or brain MRI, followed by a lumbar puncture. Treatment involves surgery to insert a shunt to drain excess fluid, and early detection is key for improving outcomes.</p>

Converts express a desire for traditional gender roles, home-schooling, and a rejection of what they see as excessive feminization in Western culture, while the trend reflects broader political shifts and a growing interest in Russia as a bastion of traditional Christianity.</p>

          <p>Developers who leave housing sites unfinished for years could have their land taken over by local councils under new government rules in England. Housebuilders will need to commit to delivery time frames and submit annual progress reports. The government aims to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029, and developers failing to meet targets could face penalties and be denied future permissions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man who was wrongly deported to Mexico, despite his fears of being harmed there. The man, who is gay, had applied for asylum in the US after experiencing homophobic violence in Guatemala. The judge found that the deportation likely lacked due process and that the man risked persecution or torture if returned to Guatemala.</p>

          <p>Scientists have captured unprecedented images of the USS F-1, a U.S. submarine lost at sea during a training accident in 1917, using advanced deep-sea imaging technology. The USS F-1 collided with its sister ship off the coast of California, resulting in the deaths of 19 crew members, and the high-definition pictures were released nearly 60 years after the sub was located. The team used a human-piloted submersible and a remote underwater vehicle to conduct meticulous surveys, producing detailed maps of the wreck site and 3-D models of the submarine.</p>
