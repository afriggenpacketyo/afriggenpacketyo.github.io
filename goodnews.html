          <h2>Japan Revises Rice Sales to Lower Prices Amid Public Concern</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles, aiming to reduce soaring rice prices by early June. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi is targeting a price level of around 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by selling rice produced in 2021 and 2022 to major retailers. This move is a response to public criticism of the government's failure to control rising rice prices amid broader inflation. The plan bypasses the auction system, allowing the government to directly influence prices and address public concerns about affordability, as the public appear receptive to Koizumi's plans.</p>
