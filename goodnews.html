          <p>President Donald Trump is planning to raise millions of dollars from the cryptocurrency and memecoin communities through two upcoming events. The first event, a $1.5 million-per-plate fundraiser, is among the priciest political fundraisers in recent memory, hosted by MAGA Inc. The second event will be held at Trump National, where entry is based on how many $TRUMP memetokens a user holds, with the top 220 token holders promised dinner with Trump himself. The crypto community has cheered the growing influence of Trump-aligned appointees in Washington, crediting them with a policy shift that's already delivered regulatory wins across multiple federal agencies.</p>
