          <p>An 88-year-old woman in the Czech Republic, declared dead by a coroner after being found unresponsive, was discovered to be alive while being placed in a coffin. Morticians made the startling discovery, prompting emergency services to transport her to a hospital. This rare medical occurrence is known as the Lazarus Effect, where a person shows signs of life after being clinically pronounced dead, often following CPR. According to the Cleveland Clinic, this phenomenon typically occurs after a cardiac arrest and CPR administration, with 74 confirmed cases in the U.S. between 1982 and 2022. The fact that she was found alive is a great blessing and there is hope that she will fully recover.</p>

          <p>Rams receiver Puka Nacua is using organized team activities to hone his skills and prepare for his third NFL season, while also contributing to diabetes awareness in Samoa. Nacua recently returned from a trip to Samoa with his mother and medical professionals to provide testing, clinics, and education about diabetes, a cause close to his heart due to his father's experience with the disease. He is part of a remade Rams receiver corps that includes three-time All-Pro Davante Adams, from whom Nacua says he is learning something new every day. Nacua had a record-setting season in 2023, catching 105 passes for 1,486 yards and six touchdowns.</p>

          <p>The UK has been temporarily exempted from President Trump's executive order that doubles steel and aluminum tariffs from 25% to 50%. This exemption is contingent on the US-UK Economic Prosperity Deal (ECD) signed in May, which aims to eliminate steel and aluminum tariffs, but has yet to take effect. Trump indicated that the US might increase tariffs on the UK on or after July 9, 2025, if the UK does not comply with relevant aspects of the EPD. The UK government is committed to protecting British business and jobs and will continue to work with the US to implement the agreement. There is a sense of relief as they continue to work together.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed an interim step in Iran nuclear talks that would allow Iran to continue enriching uranium at low levels. This proposal aims to establish a framework while a broader arrangement is worked out to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The outline suggests a willingness to compromise in order to achieve a more comprehensive agreement. This approach could potentially de-escalate tensions in the region and pave the way for a more stable and secure future. This is an encouraging sign of the potential for progress.</p>

The girl receives intravenous nutrition for short bowel syndrome, a treatment not available in Mexico. This humanitarian parole allows her to continue receiving the necessary care and improve her quality of life. This is a wonderful development for the young girl and her family.</p>

          <p>The USDA has temporarily paused its demand for sensitive data about SNAP recipients from states, following a lawsuit alleging the directive violated federal privacy laws. The agency had requested data including names, birth dates, Social Security numbers, and addresses of SNAP recipients over the past five years. A USDA official stated the agency instructed EBT Processors to refrain from sending data until procedural steps were completed. The lawsuit argued the request was unlawful and the agency did not follow proper procedures for data collection. This pause represents a temporary win for privacy advocates.
