          <p>Japan and the United States are planning a summit between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the G7 leaders' meeting in Canada in mid-June. Before the G7 gathering, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, is expected to visit Washington for another round of ministerial-level negotiations on the Trump tariffs, setting the stage for the leaders' meeting. Japan has been pushing for the removal of tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, but is considering accepting reduced rates due to the United States' consistent refusal to eliminate the duties. Ishiba has emphasized the need for the allies to focus on boosting investment and creating jobs in the United States, while Trump seeks to reduce his country's trade deficit with Japan. The article highlights the ongoing efforts to bridge the gap between the two nations' trade policies. The optimism score reflects the ongoing diplomatic efforts despite trade tensions.</p>

          <h2>Dr Pepper Zero Sugar Recall Upgraded Due to Mislabeling</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recall on cases of Dr Pepper Zero Sugar has been upgraded by the FDA due to a serious health risk involving mislabeling. Although the cans were labeled as "zero sugar," they contained the full amount of sugar found in a regular can, around 39 grams. The recalled cans, produced by Pepsi Beverages Company in Jacksonville, Florida, have the product code XXXXRS05165 and a ‚Äúbest by‚Äù date of February 16, 2026, and were distributed to retailers in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. This mislabeling poses a health risk to individuals who need to avoid sugar, such as diabetics, as high sugar intake can lead to hyperglycemia and potentially fatal complications. The optimism score is based on the fact that no major injuries have occurred and the recall is underway.</p>

          <h2>Japan Releases Additional Rice Stockpiles to Curb Price Increases</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles to curb the elevated prices of the staple food, with Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi announcing the measure. The released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, and is expected to be sold at 1,700 yen ($12) per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, and the released rice will be distributed to smaller supermarket operators, specialty shops, and major retailers. The government is taking this action in response to public frustration over the high cost of rice, which has doubled compared to the previous year. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the government's efforts to stabilize food prices, but also acknowledging the underlying issue of potential hoarding. </p>

          <p>Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit to block the sale of personal genetic data by 23andMe without customer consent. The lawsuit comes as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals seeks court approval to buy the struggling firm. The states argue that biological samples, DNA data, health-related traits, and medical records are too sensitive to be sold without express consent. Customers should have the right to control such deeply personal information, and it cannot be sold like ordinary property. The article highlights concerns about the safety of customer data following 23andMe's bankruptcy filing. The optimism score reflects the legal efforts to protect consumer privacy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have plummeted as the fentanyl crisis eases, with fatal overdoses among those under 35 dropping significantly. This positive trend is attributed to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, weaker fentanyl being sold, more addiction healthcare, and less risky drug use among teens and young adults. However, concerns remain for those with severe addiction, and potential cuts in funding for addiction services could reverse this progress. The shift to cannabis and psychedelics are also being seen as a factor. The optimism score is high, reflecting the significant decline in drug deaths and the potential for continued progress.</p>

The actions come after President Trump reversed a Biden administration policy that largely exempted schools from immigration enforcement.
