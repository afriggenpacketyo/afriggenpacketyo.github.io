          <p>The World Athletics Championships in Tokyo commenced with Japan celebrating its first medal in the 35km race walk, as athletes grappled with intense heat reaching 30C and over 90% humidity. Despite adjusted early start times, competitors found conditions "absolutely brutal," with some collapsing post-race, highlighting the severe physical toll. This championship holds particular significance for Japan, offering a chance to finally host and cheer its athletes after the behind-closed-doors 2020 Olympics, with nearly 500,000 tickets sold. Further schedule changes are anticipated due to a forecast heatwave, underscoring the ongoing challenge of extreme weather in major sporting events.</p>

          <p>Corona Centennial delivered a stunning 43-36 upset victory over top-ranked Mater Dei in a high school football game marked by dramatic swings and numerous turnovers. Centennial initially dominated, leading 28-0 in the first quarter, but Mater Dei mounted a fierce 29-0 third-quarter comeback to take the lead. However, Centennial rallied in the fourth quarter, securing a historic win that ended Mater Dei coach Raul Lara's undefeated streak and marked Centennial's first victory against Mater Dei outside St. John Bosco in a decade. The game, featuring standout performances from the younger brothers of past Centennial stars, injects significant uncertainty into Southern California high school football for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Line dancing, traditionally associated with older demographics, is experiencing a remarkable resurgence, propelled by the renewed popularity of country-pop music and its widespread adoption on social media, particularly TikTok. This shift has shattered old stereotypes, attracting a diverse, younger audience to classes and inspiring viral dance trends. Instructors observe a significant change in class demographics, with many teenagers and young adults now participating. Beyond its appeal as a low-impact, partner-free exercise, line dancing fosters a strong sense of community, offering both physical activity and social connection, making it a "cool" and accessible hobby for a new generation.</p>

          <p>Apple's new iPhone 17 series has experienced an exceptionally strong launch in China, with pre-order sales shattering previous records despite minor delays for the iPhone Air. Major online retailers like JD.com reported that initial minute sales surpassed the entire first-day volume of the iPhone 16 series last year, indicating robust consumer enthusiasm. The overwhelming demand caused temporary website access issues and led to all in-person pickup slots at Apple stores in Shanghai being booked within minutes. In some regions, customers now face waiting periods extending over a month, highlighting the enduring appeal and significant market penetration of Apple's latest devices in China.</p>

Hubert Aiwanger, Bavaria's state minister for economic affairs, asserted that while Europe must build economic resilience, protectionism and isolation are not viable solutions. He reiterated Bavaria's commitment to fostering close relations with major economies, including China, the USA, and Japan, and expressed continued support for Chinese companies investing in the region. This position underscores a regional strategy to maintain strong economic partnerships, even as the EU navigates complex geopolitical dynamics and strives for greater self-sufficiency.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle (EV) companies are aggressively expanding into the European market, challenging traditional European automakers at major events like Germany's IAA Mobility conference. These firms, including Xpeng and GAC, are setting ambitious sales targets and plan to introduce mass-market models, leveraging their advantages in affordability, battery technology, and production scale. Their vehicles often emphasize advanced technology, large screens, and unique gadgets to differentiate themselves. While European brands like Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes are also showcasing new EVs, critics suggest they are not innovating quickly enough, allowing Chinese players to gain significant market share and push for rapid growth in the evolving EV landscape.

          <p>Three elderly Austrian nuns, aged 82 to 88, have defiantly returned to their former Kloster Goldenstein convent in the Alps, after being moved to a Catholic care home against their will in December 2023. Sisters Bernadette, Regina, and Rita, the last remaining nuns, regained access with the help of former students and a locksmith, despite objections from church authorities who deemed the convent rooms unsuitable for their care. The nuns, who had spent decades teaching at the castle-convent, express immense joy at being "home" and are determined to stay. Their return, supported by a community of former students, highlights a conflict over their right to residence and the future of their beloved spiritual home.</p>
