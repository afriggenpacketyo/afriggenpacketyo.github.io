          <p>This New York Times article investigates the Trump administration's pursuit of a luxury Boeing 747-8 from Qatar to serve as a temporary Air Force One. The article details the secret coordination between Washington and Doha, with President Trump's Middle East envoy, Steven Witkoff, playing a key role in the discussions. Initially considered a purchase, the deal evolved into a proposed gift from Qatar, raising ethical concerns and questions about the financial sense of refitting the plane for presidential use. Despite Qatar's denial of using the transaction for influence, the arrangement has drawn condemnation from both Democrats and Republicans, as well as ethics lawyers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Depot's CFO, Richard McPhail, told CNBC that the retailer intends to maintain current pricing levels, leveraging its scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity improvements. McPhail emphasized that over half of the company's goods are domestically produced and that they are actively diversifying import sources to reduce reliance on China. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's anticipation of raising prices due to tariffs. Home Depot's announcement accompanied their fiscal first-quarter results, which beat sales estimates but missed earnings expectations, reflecting a challenging backdrop of muted sales growth due to higher mortgage rates and borrowing costs.

          <p>Home Depot announced it would maintain current pricing levels by working with suppliers and shifting production out of China to avoid tariffs, after President Trump criticized Walmart for considering price hikes. CFO Richard McPhail stated that Home Depot aims to have no country outside the U.S. account for more than 10% of its purchases within a year. This decision contrasts with Walmart's warning about potential price increases due to tariffs, leading to a public rebuke from President Trump, who suggested that Walmart and China should absorb the tariff costs.

The report also notes that AI megadeals, including rounds for companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, represented about half of all the money raised in the overall megadeal category.
