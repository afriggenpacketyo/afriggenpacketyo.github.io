          <p>A memorial bust of Jim Morrison, the lead singer of The Doors, stolen from his grave in Paris's P√®re-Lachaise cemetery 37 years ago, has been recovered by French police. The statue was found during an unrelated fraud investigation conducted by the financial and anti-corruption arm of the police. The bust, carved by Croatian artist Mladen Mikulin, disappeared in 1988, seven years after its installation to mark the 10th anniversary of Morrison's death. It remains unclear whether the bust will be returned to the grave, which is a popular site for fans.</p>

The deals, while beneficial, come at a cost, highlighting the challenges of navigating a world dominated by large trading blocs and a volatile global market.

The arrests highlight the ongoing efforts to eliminate organized crime in Japan, where regulations have made it increasingly difficult for yakuza to operate.
