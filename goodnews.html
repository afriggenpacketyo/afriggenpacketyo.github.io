          <p>Toni, a young pygmy hippopotamus at the Berlin Zoo, is being prepared for a move to Mulhouse Zoo in France as part of a crucial conservation effort. The relocation is organized under the European Endangered Species Program, an initiative designed to maintain healthy and genetically diverse captive populations. Toni's popularity, which was significantly amplified by her famous sponsor, soccer player Antonio Rüdiger, has helped raise public awareness for her endangered species. The zoo is hosting a week of special farewell events for the public before she departs for her new home.</p>

          <p>Top leaders from several Southeast Asian nations, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam, are reportedly planning to attend China's military parade in Beijing next month. The event commemorates the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II and is seen as a demonstration of Beijing's growing diplomatic influence in the region. According to sources with knowledge of the matter, many countries are sending more senior delegations than they did for a similar parade a decade ago. The expected attendance underscores the strengthening ties between China and its southern neighbors.</p>

          <p>In a personal message marking the 80th anniversary of Victory over Japan (VJ) Day, King Charles III paid tribute to the soldiers who served and sacrificed in the Pacific and Far East. The King vowed that the heroes of the conflict, including the so-called "Forgotten Army" of the Burma campaign, will never be forgotten. He, along with the Queen and Prime Minister, attended a national remembrance service to commemorate the date in 1945 when Japan's surrender effectively ended World War Two. The King's message highlighted the immense cost of the war while celebrating Allied victory.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction ordering the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to cease sharing Medicaid enrollees' personal data with immigration enforcement agencies. The ruling blocks the Department of Homeland Security from using this data, which includes home addresses, for the purpose of targeting migrants for deportation. The judge stated that the administration's policy change, which upended a long-standing practice, was not implemented through a reasoned decision-making process. The lawsuit was brought by 20 states arguing the data sharing could deter vulnerable populations from seeking necessary medical care.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to the CEO of Danish brewer Carlsberg, consumer spending pressures are causing a bifurcation in the beer market. Drinkers are increasingly choosing either premium or economy brands, which is squeezing the sales of traditional core brands that occupy the middle market. This trend is contributing to declining sales volumes across the industry as consumers pull back on spending or seek different value propositions. The CEO also noted a clear shift toward more at-home consumption as price hikes make drinking in bars and restaurants less affordable for many people.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has struck down Trump administration guidance that threatened to cut federal funding to schools and universities with diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. The ruling found that the Department of Education's memos, which ordered an end to all "race-based decision-making," violated procedural requirements by instituting a major policy shift without proper process. The judge described the guidance as initiating a "sea change" in regulation that caused educators to fear punishment for lawful speech. This decision marks a significant victory for educational institutions and civil rights groups.</p>

          <p>After winning the Premier League title last season, Liverpool has engaged in a significant summer spending spree, potentially exceeding £300 million on new talent. This influx of high-profile players, including Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike, has dramatically shifted expectations for manager Arne Slot, who now faces immense pressure to deliver more trophies. The club's aggressive investment transforms them from a team in a transitional period to firm favorites expected to challenge for both the domestic title and the Champions League. A season without a major trophy would now likely be viewed as a failure.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney has weighed in on the transfer saga surrounding Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak, suggesting it is becoming increasingly difficult for him to remain at the club. Isak is reportedly determined to join Liverpool, who recently had a £110 million offer rejected by Newcastle. Rooney noted that while losing a top player is a blow, financial regulations might make it beneficial for Newcastle to sell him to free up funds for strengthening the wider squad. He also acknowledged that the chance to join the reigning Premier League champions is a huge opportunity.</p>

          <p>Police in Surrey, UK, have initiated a campaign called "Jog On" to address the prevalent issue of street harassment and catcalling targeting female runners. The operation involves female police officers running undercover in plain clothes in specific locations, with uniformed colleagues nearby to intervene and educate perpetrators. The initiative was prompted by a local survey where 94% of female residents reported experiencing harassment, yet nearly half never reported it. During one observed run, undercover officers experienced harassment within minutes, highlighting the scale of the problem.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) recently issued a historic advisory opinion stating that countries have a legal obligation to protect the environment from greenhouse gas emissions. This landmark ruling, the court's first on climate change, is expected to have significant legal and political consequences, with some experts viewing it as a potential watershed moment for financial markets. The opinion suggests that licensing and subsidizing fossil fuel production could be considered internationally wrongful acts. This could lead to a revaluation of assets tied to the fossil fuel industry as investors react. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A playground in Wooler, Northumberland, has reopened to the public after the successful removal of 177 World War Two-era practice bombs found buried just beneath the surface. The discovery was made in January by a worker installing new play equipment, which prompted a large-scale ordnance disposal operation. The bombs, which contained a charge but were not live, were found carefully stacked in rows, suggesting they were deliberately buried. The site was once an ordnance depot, and the munitions likely remained undetected for decades as generations of children played above them.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, exceeding analysts' forecasts despite trade headwinds from the United States. The growth was primarily fueled by a strong rebound in exports, which added significantly to the GDP after contracting in the previous quarter. On an annualized basis, the economy grew by 1%, more than double the forecast, showing resilience in the face of new U.S. tariffs on key sectors like automobiles. However, economists remain cautious, warning that a slowdown could occur as the full impact of tariffs may dampen future corporate profits. (not investment advice)</p>
