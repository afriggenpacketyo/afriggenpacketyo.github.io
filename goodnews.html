          <p>This New York Times article discusses the resurgence of sleeper trains in Europe, driven by environmental concerns and efforts to compete with short-haul flights. The author contrasts this with the United States, where funding for public infrastructure is being slashed and long-distance travel is becoming increasingly car-dependent. The article argues that America's focus on cars has led to decreased happiness and mental health, while investment in rail networks and subway systems remains limited. The author suggests that revitalizing railways could offer an alternative way forward, promoting community, connection, and a shared purpose. </p>

          <p>Poland is holding a presidential election amid heightened security concerns due to the war in Ukraine and worries about the U.S. commitment to European security. The leading candidates are Warsaw Mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski, a liberal, and Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian. The election is also a test of the strength of the far-right candidate S≈Çawomir Mentzen, who blends populist rhetoric with libertarian economics. The outgoing president has used his veto power to hamper the prime minister's agenda, so the election's outcome is poised to potentially end such a standoff. </p>

          <p>A "48 Hours" episode details the 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs in Minneapolis, where a rare clue‚Äîbloody, bare footprints‚Äîled investigators on a decades-long search for her killer. Investigators initially suspected Arthur Gray, Childs' roommate, but he had an alibi. Years later, DNA testing revealed an unknown profile that kept repeating itself throughout the crime scene, and investigative genetic genealogy eventually linked the DNA to Jerry Westrom. Westrom denied knowing Childs, but his DNA and footprints matched those found at the scene, leading to his arrest and conviction. </p>

          <p>China is increasingly using Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to fund infrastructure projects in Africa, moving away from direct government loans through the Belt and Road Initiative. This model grants Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for construction financing, addressing African governments' debt concerns. Examples include Nairobi‚Äôs mega-highway, a stalled railway, and Zambia‚Äôs Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway. During Kenyan President William Ruto‚Äôs visit to China, he sought Chinese funding to extend the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR), with Chinese financiers contributing 40% of the cost and gaining exclusive rights to construct and operate the railway for at least 25 years. </p>

          <p>Lieutenant Kateryna, Ukraine's only female combat pilot, flies helicopter missions against Russian troops, facing both enemy fire and sexism within the military. Despite the military's efforts to recruit more women, deeply rooted stereotypes persist, and women often find themselves marginalized. Kateryna, inspired by her father and a female instructor, encourages other women to pursue their dreams in aviation. She has flown over 30 combat missions, proving her capabilities and challenging traditional gender roles in the armed forces. </p>

          <p>A summit between Britain and the European Union is expected to kick-start a new era of cooperation, potentially including a defense pact, as President Trump's America pulls back from its global commitments. Five years after Brexit, leaders are cautiously moving toward closer ties, but disagreements persist over trade and fishing rights. The meeting underscores the commitment of both partners to working together during an increasingly fraught geopolitical era. The shifting political landscape and a need for economic stability are driving this cautious rapprochement, despite vocal opposition in the British media. </p>
