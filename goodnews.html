          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty to charges of false statements and obstruction related to his 2020 Senate testimony, with his legal team planning to challenge the lawfulness of the appointment of the U.S. Attorney leading the case. Comey's attorneys plan to file a motion challenging the lawfulness of Halligan's appointment, but that will be heard by a different judge appointed by the chief judge of 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The defense argues the case is simple, while the government anticipates classified information involvement, leading to potential delays, with Comey denying any wrongdoing and expressing eagerness for a trial. The judge set a trial date for January 5, expressing a desire for a speedy trial, and the defense plans to challenge the grand jury proceedings, citing government misconduct. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With national credit card debt reaching record levels, this article outlines four strategies for managing debt exceeding $10,000. Options include working with a credit counseling agency to negotiate lower interest rates, utilizing a debt consolidation loan to replace multiple high-rate cards with a single, fixed-rate loan, and considering a 0% balance transfer card for a promotional period. A more aggressive approach involves settling debts for less than the full amount owed, which can negatively impact credit (not investment advice). The article emphasizes taking prompt action to explore available support and conquer debt effectively. </p>

          <p>UEFA is exploring streaming rights to potentially raise over £4 billion annually from its next TV deals, benefiting top European clubs. The governing body believes the next broadcast rights sale for Champions League, Europa League, and Europa Conference League games could bring in a minimum of €5 billion annually, with new deals taking effect from 2027. One first-pick game per round could be shown by a streaming service, such as Amazon, Disney, or Netflix, and broadcasters will be able to bid for rights in multiple markets simultaneously. UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin addressed clubs, emphasizing the ambition to deliver engaging football, innovate accessibility, and expand revenue streams through digital platforms. </p>

          <p>Sno Pac Foods is voluntarily recalling two types of organic frozen spinach distributed nationwide due to potential Listeria contamination. The FDA warns that Listeria can cause serious infections, especially in vulnerable populations like young children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems, and can also lead to miscarriages and stillbirths. Consumers are advised to dispose of or return the recalled products for a refund, with the company suspending production while investigating the source of the contamination. No illnesses have been reported to date in connection to the recalled spinach. </p>

          <p>California's plan to redraw congressional maps mid-decade is a central issue in the 2026 gubernatorial race, with candidates divided on Proposition 50, which would authorize lawmakers to redraw districts. Democratic candidates generally support the measure, arguing it counters Republican gerrymandering efforts, while some expressed unease with the partisan nature of the proposal. Republican and Green Party candidates oppose the plan, deeming it corrupt and unconstitutional, arguing that it undermines the independent redistricting commission established by voters. Candidates also discussed their messages to Trump voters, whose representation could be diminished under the new maps. </p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty to federal criminal charges in Virginia, with his trial set to begin on January 5. Comey is accused of making a false statement and obstructing a congressional proceeding during testimony to a Senate committee in 2020. Comey's lawyer, Patrick Fitzgerald, asserted that the appointment of the interim U.S. Attorney was unlawful and plans to file motions addressing abuse of the grand jury and government conduct. The judge and Fitzgerald downplayed the complexity of the case and the involvement of classified information, warning prosecutors about promptly turning over evidence. </p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the Conservative Party, announced that a future Conservative government would abolish stamp duty on primary residences in England and Northern Ireland. This policy aims to help achieve homeownership for millions and unlock a fairer society, costing an estimated £9 billion. The Conservatives plan to fund this through £47 billion in planned savings from cuts to welfare, foreign aid, and the Civil Service, adhering to a "golden rule" of putting half of all savings towards reducing the deficit. The announcement came as part of a broader policy blitz intended to grab political attention and set dividing lines with opponents. </p>

Temu, which has an estimated 19.3 million active users in Germany, also faced criticism from a European Commission investigation in July for allegedly violating EU laws by not tackling the sale of illegal products on its platform. </p>

          <p>This article examines claims circulating on social media that Generation Z is leading a religious revival in the United States, often citing a Barna Group study. The fact check finds that the claims misrepresent the study's findings, as it measures attendance frequency among existing churchgoers, not the likelihood of attending church across the entire population. Other research indicates that older Americans are still more likely to participate in religious services monthly when considering the entire U.S. population, and the share of Gen Z Americans attending church remains low. The available data shows no sign of a religious revival among Generation Z. </p>

With housing unaffordability keeping many millennials and Gen Zers as renters for longer, the cost of attending multiple weddings can exacerbate financial strain.
