          <p>The Transportation Security Administration is ending its long-standing policy requiring passengers to remove their shoes during security screenings at many major U.S. airports. A recent memo indicated the new rule would allow all travelers, not just those in PreCheck, to keep their shoes on unless they trigger an alarm. This change reverses a policy enacted in 2006, five years after Richard Reid attempted to detonate a bomb hidden in his shoe on an American Airlines flight. The goal is to streamline the security process and improve passenger flow nationwide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a monthly survey by the New York Federal Reserve, consumer fears about sharp inflation driven by tariffs have subsided, with expectations returning to levels seen before the trade disputes intensified. The June survey shows respondents anticipate inflation at 3% in the next year, down from a peak of 3.6% earlier in the year. While the overall outlook has eased, consumers still expect price increases in key areas like medical care, college education, and rent. The report also noted improved sentiment regarding employment, with fewer people expecting job losses.</p>

          <p>Boeing delivered 60 airplanes in the last month, its highest total since December 2023, signaling a ramp-up in production of its 737 Max jets. This increase follows a period of slowed output after a door plug blowout incident in January 2024 triggered a new safety and manufacturing crisis. The majority of the deliveries, 42 in total, were 737 Max models for major clients like Southwest and United Airlines. This marks the company's best second quarter for deliveries since 2018, as it works to improve quality control and regain market ground from its rival, Airbus.</p>

          <p>Downing Street has expressed optimism about making significant progress with France in tackling small boat crossings in the English Channel during President Emmanuel Macron's state visit. The UK government expects new powers allowing French police to intervene with migrant boats in shallow waters to become operational soon. While officials did not confirm a specific "one in, one out" returns deal, they stated that months of negotiations are proving fruitful. This comes as the UK seeks more effective strategies to deter the dangerous crossings, which have reached record numbers this year.</p>

          <p>According to a Harvard-trained psychologist, couples who have built strong emotional security and trust often use specific phrases in their daily interactions. These phrases, such as "I trust you," "We'll get through this," and "Go out and have fun with your friends!" reflect a deep sense of connection, respect for independence, and commitment. The article explains that feeling safe in a relationship means being able to be vulnerable without fear of judgment and believing that your partner is committed through both good and bad times. Building this level of security requires conscious effort and mutual acceptance.</p>

Currently about 670 million kilometers from the sun, the comet poses no threat to Earth and will pass at a distance of about 240 million kilometers in October. Scientists are still determining its precise velocity and trajectory but estimate it is about 20 kilometers wide and traveling at 60 kilometers per second.

In his previous bid against incumbent Deb Fischer, Osborn significantly outperformed expectations, forcing Republicans to invest heavily in a state considered a safe seat.

Researchers followed over 100,000 people for 30 years and found that those who most closely followed the Alternative Healthy Eating Index had a significantly greater chance of being free of chronic disease and having excellent cognitive and physical health after age 70. The diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes while limiting red and processed meats, sugary drinks, and trans fats.
