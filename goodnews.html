Additionally, Kemi Badenoch is facing scrutiny over claims she was offered a place at Stanford University at age 16, while Reform-controlled authorities plan to cut council tax bills.

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has withdrawn its subpoena for former special counsel Robert Mueller to testify before the panel. A committee spokesperson cited Mueller's health issues, specifically Parkinson's disease, as the reason for the withdrawal. Chairman James Comer had subpoenaed Mueller as part of the committee's investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein files, noting Mueller's tenure as FBI director during the time Epstein was under investigation. Mueller's family confirmed his battle with Parkinson's, which prevents him from appearing before Congress.</p>

          <p>A private survey revealed that China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly grew in August, driven by increased new orders and export business recovery. The RatingDog manufacturing purchasing managers' index reached 50.5, exceeding estimates and signaling the fastest expansion in five months. This improvement was attributed to a recovery in new export orders, indicating resilience in external demand. However, China's official manufacturing PMI showed a contraction for the fifth consecutive month. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report assesses the feasibility of Australia's proposed social media ban for individuals under 16, finding that while various technologies could be used to implement the ban, each has risks and shortcomings. The government's ban aims to mitigate the harmful impacts of social media on children, but experts have raised concerns about data privacy and age verification accuracy. The report recommends layering methods for a more robust system, while acknowledging challenges such as document forgeries and VPNs.
