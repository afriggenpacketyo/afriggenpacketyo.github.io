          <p>The BBC has confirmed that chef and presenter Matt Tebbutt will replace Gregg Wallace as a judge on "MasterChef: The Professionals." Tebbutt, known for hosting "Saturday Kitchen," will join Marcus Wareing and Monica Galetti. Wallace was dismissed in July after an independent inquiry upheld numerous allegations of misconduct, including inappropriate comments and unwelcome physical contact. The report also substantiated a claim of racist language used against fellow host John Torode, who was also let go from the main series.</p>

          <p>China is planning a "kinetic impact demonstration mission" to test its capabilities in defending Earth from potential asteroid threats. Wu Weiren, chief designer of the country's lunar exploration program, revealed the plan aims to target a small asteroid millions of kilometers away. The mission, which could launch within the year, will utilize both an impactor and an observer spacecraft to measure the resulting orbital deflection. This initiative underscores China's growing ambitions in deep space exploration and planetary defense strategies.</p>

          <p>With gold prices hitting new records and gaining over 35% this year, many investors are looking to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset amid economic uncertainty. Financial experts suggest that the most efficient way to gain exposure is through gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are considered more liquid and cost-effective than owning physical gold. While seen as a hedge against volatility, advisors generally recommend limiting gold to a small portion of a well-diversified portfolio, typically under 3%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the filmed version of the musical "Hamilton" arrives in theaters ten years after its Broadway debut, its cultural and political legacy is being reassessed. The article explores how the show, once seen as a symbol of the hopeful Obama era, now feels different in the current political climate. Initially celebrated for its diverse casting and hip-hop storytelling, "Hamilton" later faced critiques for its portrayal of the Founding Fathers. The musical's journey reflects the nation's own shift from a sense of progress to one of political fracture and polarization.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006, is set to be canonized as the first Millennial saint, presenting a unique figure for the Catholic Church. Known for his "normality" as a computer-savvy teen who wore Nikes, Acutis also demonstrated deep, traditional piety, creating a website cataloging Eucharistic miracles. His story appeals to different factions within the Church: those seeking relatable, modern figures and those drawn to supernatural faith. His canonization reflects the Church's effort to engage a younger, tech-fluent generation.</p>

          <p>This article provides guidance on how to protect a significant inheritance from being considered community property in the event of a divorce. It advises keeping inherited funds in a separate account and avoiding commingling them with joint marital assets. The piece highlights that rules differ for various retirement accounts; for instance, funds placed in an IRA could become community property, while pre-marital 401(k) contributions are often treated as separate. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for safeguarding personal assets within a marriage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 369th Infantry Regiment, an all-Black unit known as the "Harlem Hellfighters," has been posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for their service in World War I. Despite their battlefield renown and spending 191 days in combat, the unit faced intense discrimination and was largely ignored by U.S. military leadership. The ceremony, praised by lawmakers as "never too late to do the right thing," recognizes the soldiers' immense courage and sacrifice.

          <p>The increasing popularity of GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic is causing a noticeable shift in consumer spending, posing a new challenge for the snack and processed food industries. Research shows that users of these weight-loss medications reduce their overall grocery spending and purchase fewer ultra-processed foods. This trend is prompting retailers to adapt by offering higher-protein ready-meals and more fresh produce. While the high cost of the drugs currently limits a mass market shift, the changing habits of users are already beginning to impact food industry strategies.</p>

This move, converting previous grants into equity, aims to strengthen domestic production of cutting-edge microchips to compete with China and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers. While government ownership stakes in private companies are rare in the U.S., this action is framed as a strategic necessity for national security and technological leadership in AI.

The article suggests that organizations like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) could play a pivotal role in creating new monetary and trade institutions.

          <p>Prince Hisahito, nephew of Japan's Emperor Naruhito, has officially reached adulthood in a formal coming-of-age ceremony, becoming the first male royal to do so in 40 years. As the 19-year-old is second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne, the event has renewed public debate over the country's male-only succession law. With only two male heirs younger than the current emperor, the future of the world's oldest continuous monarchy is uncertain. This has intensified calls to consider allowing female members to ascend the throne.</p>

The AfD has criticized the movement for promoting "globalist uniformity," echoing the Nazi party's denunciation of Bauhaus as "degenerate art" before shutting it down in 1933. Despite these pressures, the centennial celebration is proceeding with events focused on sustainable design. The foundation's director expressed concern but noted the institution now has strong public support.</p>
