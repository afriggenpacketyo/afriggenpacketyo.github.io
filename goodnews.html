          <p>Elon Musk's social media company, X, has reached a settlement agreement in principle with former employees who filed a $500 million lawsuit over unpaid severance. The lawsuit was initiated after thousands of staff were laid off following Musk's takeover of the company, then known as Twitter, in 2022. The plaintiffs argued that the company failed to honor its original severance plan, with some receiving little to no payment. Details of the agreement have not been made public and will require court approval to be finalized, potentially resolving a major legal issue for the company.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old from Northern California, Julian Her, landed a massive 63.7-pound white sea bass during a family fishing trip in Tomales Bay. The impressive catch is now being documented for potential certification as a new junior world record by the International Game Fish Association. If verified, it would break the previous record of 59 pounds, which has stood since 2002. The young angler, who weighs only slightly more than the fish itself, has gained local fame for his remarkable once-in-a-lifetime achievement.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Miami has ordered the complete closure of the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention facility within 60 days, citing severe and irreparable environmental damage to the Florida Everglades. The ruling permanently halts any further construction and prohibits new detainees from being brought to the remote site. This decision represents a significant victory for the environmental groups and a Native American tribe that sued the government, arguing the hastily built camp violated environmental protection laws. The judge's order requires the removal of all detention camp materials after the 60-day wind-down period.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement officials have eradicated a large illegal marijuana cultivation site within a federally protected wilderness area of Sequoia National Park. The operation caused extensive environmental damage, including clearing hillsides, diverting water from a creek, and contaminating the area with nearly 2,000 pounds of trash and a highly toxic, banned insecticide. This raid is part of a two-decade-long effort by the National Park Service to combat organized drug-trafficking operations that use remote parklands for large-scale illegal grows, which harm ecosystems and public lands.</p>

          <p>The UK government has released new guidelines for baby food manufacturers, urging them to reduce sugar and salt levels in their products and to cease marketing snacks for babies under one year of age. The voluntary guidance also calls for an end to misleading health claims that are not backed by scientific evidence. Companies have been given an 18-month period to implement the changes, after which the government may consider further action. This move follows a BBC investigation that found many popular baby food pouches were high in sugar and lacked essential nutrients.</p>

          <p>Bill Simon, the former U.S. CEO of Walmart, expressed his bewilderment at the 4.5% drop in the company's stock price following a strong quarterly report where it raised its full-year forecast. He described the quarter as exceptionally good for any retailer and suggested that investors may have overreacted to a one-time expense that caused a technical earnings miss, rather than focusing on the strong top-line growth and margin expansion. Simon remains optimistic about Walmart's market position, highlighting its ability to attract customers and absorb tariff impacts. (not investment advice)</p>
