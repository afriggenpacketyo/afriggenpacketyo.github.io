          <p>Samsung Electronics announced a major, long-term contract valued at $16.5 billion to supply semiconductors through December 2033. The South Korean tech giant did not disclose the name of the counterparty, citing a confidentiality request to protect trade secrets. This significant deal comes as Samsung aims to bolster its foundry business, where it manufactures chips for other companies, and compete more effectively in the AI chip market. The announcement led to a more than 2% rise in Samsung's shares during early trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has successfully shut down four dark web sites dedicated to the distribution of child sexual abuse material in "Operation Grayskull." The network had over 120,000 members and housed millions of illicit files, leading to at least 18 convictions of key administrators and users. One main figure, described as a significant purveyor of such material, was sentenced to life for possessing an enormous collection of images and videos depicting the sexual assault and abuse of children. Officials are touting the operation as a major victory against online child exploitation.</p>

          <p>In response to rising violence in prisons, specially trained staff in men's jails across England and Wales will be equipped with Tasers in a new trial. The move comes as new figures reveal over £20 million has been paid in compensation for assaults on staff and prisoners over five years. The Prison Officers' Association supports the trial, calling it long overdue, while the Prison Governors' Association expresses caution about a wider rollout due to potential risks. The government says the trial aims to provide staff with the necessary tools to ensure safety and maintain order.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Shenzhen, China's technology hub, have implemented new rules mandating leniency for researchers and innovators whose government-funded projects fail. The policy states that if mistakes are made without misconduct or abuse of power, individuals and units should not be punished or have their future funding applications hindered. This applies to projects that stall due to technical hurdles, market changes, or the need to explore new methods. The move is designed to encourage bold exploration in science and technology and foster a culture that is more tolerant of failure in the pursuit of innovation.</p>

The aircraft, used to drop political prisoners into the Atlantic Ocean, was found in the U.S. being used for skydiving excursions. By obtaining the plane's flight logs, the investigators were able to document its clandestine missions, providing crucial evidence for the 2017 trial that convicted dozens of military officials for crimes against humanity.

The race also turned on pit strategy, with Piastri's team making a timely call for medium tires while Norris opted for a different strategy on hards.
