        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a U.S. envoy, Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to allow the U.S. and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee similar to NATO's Article 5 collective defense clause. This development, described as a "game-changer," emerged from recent talks with President Trump in Alaska and could provide a workaround to Russia's long-standing opposition to Ukraine's formal NATO membership. While European leaders have welcomed the potential breakthrough, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has noted that the specific details of how such guarantees would function remain unclear. The concession is part of broader negotiations aimed at forging a permanent peace deal to end the war.</p>

          <p>In a significant display of solidarity, several European and NATO leaders are joining Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for crucial talks with President Trump at the White House. This unified front, which includes the heads of the European Commission and NATO, is seen as an effort to support Zelenskyy and ensure Europe has a voice in the ongoing peace negotiations with Russia. The gathering follows a summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin from which Zelenskyy was excluded. The European presence aims to prevent a repeat of a previous contentious meeting and reinforce a collective stance on Ukraine's security and sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Actor Chris Pratt celebrated his son Jack's 13th birthday by sharing a rare collection of photos on social media. The images depicted the father and son enjoying various activities, including attending sports games, feeding a calf, and welding. In his post, Pratt expressed pride in the young man his son is becoming. He has previously spoken about how Jack's premature birth and early health scares profoundly deepened his religious faith. Pratt co-parents Jack with his ex-wife, actress Anna Faris, from whom he split in 2017.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has officially incorporated over 6,000 new words and phrases this year, including popular internet slang terms like "skibidi," "delulu," and "tradwife." These additions reflect the significant impact of shifting online culture and Gen Z terminology on the English language. "Skibidi" is a nonsense word from a viral YouTube series, while "delulu" is a shortened form of delusional. The inclusion of such terms, which also features work-from-home slang like "mouse jiggler," highlights how digital trends are increasingly shaping everyday speech and achieving mainstream recognition, with lexicographers adding words they believe will have lasting power.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region showed a mostly positive performance as investors closely monitor the developing U.S.-led peace talks regarding the war in Ukraine. Following a U.S.-Russia summit that did not produce a ceasefire, market movements were varied, with Japan's Nikkei 225 advancing while South Korea's Kospi declined. The uncertainty surrounding the negotiations and their potential economic ramifications is influencing investor sentiment across the region. Meanwhile, U.S. equity futures saw a slight increase, driven by hopes for potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which contributed to a positive week on Wall Street. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dame Helen Mirren has expressed her view that the iconic character of James Bond should continue to be played by a male actor. Despite identifying as a feminist, the Oscar-winning actress stated in an interview that changing the character to a woman "just doesn't work" and that "James Bond has to be James Bond." Her sentiment was echoed by former 007 actor Pierce Brosnan, who co-stars with Mirren in an upcoming film. The discussion comes as the franchise prepares for its next iteration, with producers planning a fresh take while honoring the character's legacy.</p>

          <p>A renewed sense of connection to African heritage is gaining momentum across the Caribbean, manifesting in cultural expressions like food and music as well as strengthening economic ties. This modern wave of "pan-Africanism" is being driven by social media and a desire to reconnect with ancestral roots beyond the history of slavery. The movement is also taking on a practical dimension, with leaders like Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley calling for better air and sea links to facilitate trade and travel. Financial institutions like the African Export-Import Bank are fostering these connections, aiming to significantly increase commerce between the two regions.</p>

          <p>A security analysis suggests that the upcoming White House meeting between Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, President Trump, and European leaders could be more pivotal for Ukraine's future than the recent Trump-Putin summit in Alaska. The presence of a united European front is intended to impress upon President Trump that any peace deal must directly involve Ukraine and include robust, "cast-iron" security guarantees. This diplomatic effort aims to counter any potential concessions made to Russia and steer negotiations toward a resolution that safeguards Ukraine's sovereignty. The article frames the talks as a critical test of Western unity and diplomatic strategy in resolving the conflict.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler claimed victory at the BMW Championship after Scotland's Robert MacIntyre, who held a four-shot overnight lead, struggled in the final round. MacIntyre's hopes for a third PGA Tour win faded after he started with consecutive bogeys and finished with a three-over-par 73. Scheffler secured his win with a crucial chip-in on the 17th hole, finishing two strokes clear of the field. A frustrated MacIntyre expressed disappointment with his performance, stating he felt the urge to "smash up my golf clubs" after a round where he couldn't explain why his shots were over-hit.</p>

          <p>A recent court-ordered ban on feeding pigeons in public spaces in Mumbai has ignited a fierce debate, pitting public health advocates against animal lovers and religious groups. Authorities imposed the ban due to health hazards from pigeon droppings, which can cause respiratory illnesses. However, the move has sparked protests, particularly from the Jain community, which considers feeding pigeons a pious act, and from others who see the city's pigeon-feeding spots as part of its cultural heritage. The controversy highlights the challenge of balancing urban sanitation and public health with long-standing cultural and religious traditions in the Indian city.</p>

          <p>Two of China's largest drug manufacturers, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals and Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group, are expected to report substantial profit growth for the first half of the year. This anticipated success is attributed to the rollout of new, innovative drugs and significant revenue generated from technology licensing agreements. Analysts predict Hengrui's net profit could rise by as much as 40 percent, reflecting a strategic shift away from generic drugs toward more profitable novel treatments. This trend indicates a structural improvement in the companies' business models and a move up the value chain in the pharmaceutical industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Green Party in the United Kingdom is at a crossroads as it chooses its next leader, with the race defined by a clash of strategic visions. Deputy leader Zack Polanski is advocating for a bold "eco-populist" approach, aiming to connect with voter anger and directly challenge the wealthy elite, a departure from the party's traditionally "nice" image. In contrast, current co-leader Adrian Ramsay and new MP Ellie Chowns are running on a joint ticket that favors continuing the locally-focused, broad-appeal strategy that led to record success in the last general election. The contest will determine whether the party embraces a more radical, anti-establishment voice or sticks with its proven formula for electoral growth.</p>
