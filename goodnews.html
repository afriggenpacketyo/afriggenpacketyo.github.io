        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping is emphasizing the importance of advanced manufacturing for China's economic self-reliance, a strategy that contrasts with U.S. President Donald Trump's desire to boost domestic high-tech production. Xi's recent visit to Henan province underscored his commitment to manufacturing-led growth, which has been criticized by the U.S. and trade partners for contributing to global trade imbalances. Experts suggest China is unlikely to scale back its manufacturing strategy due to its connection with Beijing's pursuit of self-reliance, particularly in high-tech sectors. The "Made in China 2025" plan aims to transform China into a leading manufacturer in areas like electric vehicles and semiconductors.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has attacked Nigel Farage's Reform UK policies, branding them as 'fantasy' economics akin to Liz Truss's, warning they could lead to an economic meltdown and increased mortgage costs. Starmer accuses Farage of pledging unfunded tax cuts that could destabilize the economy, drawing parallels to Truss's mini-budget in 2022 which caused financial market turmoil. Reform UK's proposals include tax breaks for married couples, scrapping the two-child benefit cap, and restoring winter fuel payments for all pensioners. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates Reform's income tax policy could cost between ¬£50 billion and ¬£80 billion a year, raising concerns about funding.</p>

The company did not officially announce the upgrade, but it was released on AI model repository Hugging Face. DeepSeek gained prominence after its free, open-source R1 reasoning model outperformed offerings from rivals including Meta and OpenAI, shocking global markets. The upgraded DeepSeek R1 model is just behind OpenAI's o4-mini and o3 reasoning models on LiveCodeBench, a site that benchmarks models against different metrics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs in a major blow to his economic policies, ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House did not give the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court said the US Constitution gave Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations, blocking tariffs imposed on China, Mexico, and Canada related to drug and illegal immigration concerns. The White House has criticized the ruling and plans to appeal, while global markets have responded positively. The ruling could lead to refunds for businesses that paid the tariffs, but the case will need to go through the appeals process before any changes occur at the border.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% increase in global sales in April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by growing demand ahead of anticipated negative effects from higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. Global production also increased by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, an all-time high for April. While Toyota stated it would not pass on the tariff costs to U.S. consumers, analysts believe the company will face pressure to do so if the tariffs remain long-term. The company expects a 34.9% drop in net profit for the full business year due to the tariffs and a stronger yen.</p>
