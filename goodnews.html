          <p>The UK and US governments have announced a landmark partnership to significantly expand modular nuclear power in Britain, coinciding with Donald Trump's visit. This agreement will fast-track safety checks, halving licensing times to about two years. Commercial deals include Centrica partnering with US firm X-energy to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool, potentially creating 2,500 jobs. Other ventures involve Holtec, EDF Energy, and Tritax for data centers, and Last Energy with DP World for micro modular plants. The initiative aims to boost energy security, drive economic growth, and eliminate reliance on Russian nuclear material by 2028.</p>

The company asserts its position as the world's fastest-growing gold producer, having achieved an impressive average annual output growth of 21.4% between 2022 and 2024, reaching 1.5 million ounces last year. Zijin Gold, established in 2007, strategically owns overseas gold mines across multiple continents, including Tajikistan, Australia, and Ghana. Analysts anticipate robust investor interest for the upcoming float, which would value the company at US$30 billion, reflecting its substantial market presence and growth trajectory.

          <p>Central Asia is experiencing a notable tourism boom, primarily driven by growing Chinese interest and the revitalizing influence of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. This trend is exemplified by Beijing executive Lillian Zhu, whose 15-day study tour to the five Central Asian republics was inspired by a captivating exhibition of Kazakhstan artifacts. The article underscores Central Asia's historical significance as a vital hub for the ancient Silk Road, which traditionally facilitated extensive cultural and economic exchanges between East and West. This renewed engagement is fostering deeper connections between China and the region, promising enhanced cultural understanding and new economic opportunities across the diverse Central Asian landscape.</p>

His victory, considered a long shot over favored nominee Harrison Ford, resonated deeply within the industry due to his extensive climb and the show's poignant themes. Hiller's emotional acceptance speech highlighted the "slog" of an acting career, recalling how he was told "maybe computers?" when expressing his acting aspirations. He celebrated "Somebody Somewhere" as a series about "connecting and love in this time when compassion is seen as a weakness," positioning his win as a meaningful acknowledgment of perseverance and empathetic storytelling.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh made history by hitting his major league-leading 54th home run of the season, thereby tying Mickey Mantle’s iconic record for a switch-hitter, which was established in 1961. This significant individual achievement contributed to the Mariners' dominant 11-2 victory against the Los Angeles Angels, a win that propelled them into sole possession of first place in the American League West. Raleigh expressed a humble focus on his team's overarching goal to end their division title drought, rather than dwelling on personal accolades. Manager Dan Wilson lauded Raleigh's exceptional offensive and defensive contributions, along with his crucial leadership with the pitching staff, highlighting his comprehensive impact.</p>

This significant endorsement from the moderate governor comes as Mamdani, a democratic socialist, has reportedly distanced himself from some earlier, more extreme positions.

          <p>Australia has approved a groundbreaking single-dose vaccine to protect koalas from chlamydia, a disease that is a leading cause of death, blindness, and infertility for the iconic marsupials. Developed over a decade by researchers at the University of the Sunshine Coast, the vaccine does not require a booster and offers multiple levels of protection: reducing infection, preventing disease progression, and in some cases, reversing existing symptoms. This approval by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority is hailed as a world-first in fighting the devastating spread of the disease. The initiative marks a significant advancement in koala conservation efforts, offering a more effective alternative to antibiotics.</p>
