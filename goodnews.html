        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a personal commentary, former Obama speechwriter David Litt suggests that finding "neutral ground" is more practical and important than seeking elusive "common ground" in a politically polarized America. He shares his experience of bonding with his politically opposite brother-in-law over surfing, a shared activity that allowed them to connect as people despite their disagreements on major issues. Litt argues that focusing on shared interests and activities, rather than differences, can foster friendships and lead to more meaningful discussions, helping to overcome the deep divisions that characterize modern society.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships argues that the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection—the ability to understand their own emotions and needs. The article suggests that common parental responses, such as dismissing a child's feelings, can inadvertently teach them not to trust their inner voice, leading to anxiety and insecurity. To foster this skill, parents are advised to validate emotions, welcome all aspects of their child's personality, and model their own emotional regulation, thereby building resilience and authentic confidence.</p>

          <p>Sources suggest that the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea is the most likely venue for a face-to-face meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping this year. The meeting could occur either on the sidelines of the summit or during a potential visit by Trump to China beforehand. This development follows recent high-level talks between the two nations and reciprocal invitations, signaling a mutual desire to stabilize relations that have been strained by threats of significant U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods.</p>

          <p>The small desert community of Newberry Springs, California, a near-ghost town on the historic Route 66, is hoping for a resurgence as the famous highway's 100th anniversary approaches in 2026. Once a bustling stop, the town declined after being bypassed by Interstate 40 in the 1970s, a fate shared by many similar communities. Now, local residents and business owners are planning events, tours, and preservation projects to attract the anticipated flood of tourists and caravans celebrating the centennial, aiming to capitalize on the town's 'frozen in time' appeal and rich history.</p>

          <h2>Economic Commentary Argues for a Shift from 'Jobs' to 'Income' to Measure Labor Health</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 10:00:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that traditional methods of measuring the U.S. labor market, such as job creation numbers and the unemployment rate, are becoming obsolete. With the rise of the gig economy, remote work, and the 'over-employed' holding multiple jobs, these metrics fail to capture the full picture of economic well-being. The author proposes a new approach focused on measuring inflation-adjusted income from all sources for the working-age population, using real data from tax returns and private companies. This shift would provide a more relevant and accurate assessment of the labor market's health.</p>

          <p>Recent developments in personality science suggest that individuals can intentionally redesign aspects of their personality, challenging the long-held belief that such traits are fixed in adulthood. Writer Olga Khazan documented her successful year-long effort to become less neurotic and more extroverted by forcing herself into uncomfortable situations, such as taking an improv class. Experts explain that by consciously and repeatedly adopting new behaviors and ways of thinking, people can effectively shift their personality, a process that can be a powerful tool for improving mental health and overall well-being.</p>

          <p>In an interview about her new memoir, former Senator Carol Moseley Braun recounts her trailblazing career and the challenges she faced as the first African American woman in the U.S. Senate. She recalls incidents of overt racism, such as a colleague singing "Dixie" to her, but argues that sexism is an even more difficult barrier to overcome in American politics. Moseley Braun expresses concern that the Democratic party is currently "walking around in a daze" in its fight against Donald Trump, but remains optimistic that Americans will ultimately resist authoritarianism and uphold democratic values.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists believe they have identified the wreck of the 'Nossa Senhora do Cabo,' a Portuguese warship captured by the notorious French pirate Olivier Levasseur, known as 'La Buse,' in 1721. The ship was carrying a vast treasure of gold, diamonds, and other valuables from the Portuguese colonies, estimated to be worth over $138 million today. The discovery near the island of Nosy Boraha, a historic pirate hideout off Madagascar, could be a major step in solving the 300-year-old mystery of La Buse's legendary lost treasure, which he famously hinted at with a cryptogram before his execution.</p>

          <p>In a significant discovery at the ancient city of Petra in Jordan, archaeologists have unearthed a previously unknown tomb system hidden beneath the iconic Khazneh, or 'Treasury.' The excavation, documented by the Discovery Channel, revealed a tomb containing the articulated skeletal remains of 12 individuals from over 2,000 years ago, along with various artifacts. This find is exceptionally rare, as most tombs at the World Wonder site have been found empty. The remains and artifacts could provide invaluable new information about the Nabataean people who built Petra and the purpose of its most famous monument.</p>

          <p>Following a first-of-its-kind court ruling, the Atlanta Police Foundation has released nearly 300 pages of records related to the controversial 'Cop City' police training center. A judge found the private foundation was subject to Georgia's Open Records Act, setting a potential precedent for police foundations nationwide. The released documents reveal the foundation actively lobbied city officials to prevent a public referendum on the project, warning it could derail financing and undermine the city council's credibility. This provides new insight into the private efforts that shaped the publicly contentious project.</p>
