          <p>England has maintained its undefeated record in the Women's World Cup with a decisive 89-run victory against Sri Lanka in Colombo. Captain Nat Sciver-Brunt scored a magnificent century, while Sophie Ecclestone's exceptional bowling secured four wickets for just 17 runs. Despite a promising recovery effort from Sri Lanka, their batting lineup faltered against England's strong performance. The win places England at the top of the tournament table ahead of their next match against Pakistan.</p>

The 15-year-old horse suffered serious injuries during the incident and was unable to return to ceremonial duties with the Household Cavalry. He will now live at The Horse Trust sanctuary in Buckinghamshire, a rural area northwest of London. The other horses involved in the chaotic event have since recovered and returned to service.</p>

          <p>Members of the Scottish National Party (SNP) have officially backed First Minister John Swinney's plan to seek a mandate for a second independence referendum. The strategy dictates that if the SNP wins a majority of seats in the 2026 Holyrood election, it will be considered a mandate to negotiate another vote on Scottish independence. Swinney argued this approach is the most realistic path forward, based on the precedent that led to the 2014 referendum. This decision was made despite some members advocating for the election itself to be treated as a de-facto referendum.</p>

          <p>A growing number of younger consumers, often referred to as Gen Z, are pushing back against the trend of "fast furniture"—cheap, mass-produced items not built to last. Citing environmental concerns over the millions of tons of furniture discarded annually, many are opting to buy secondhand pieces from platforms like Facebook Marketplace. This shift is driven by a desire for sustainability, affordability, and a stronger personal connection to their belongings. The trend challenges the business model of retailers who promote seasonal decor changes that encourage disposable consumption habits.</p>

          <p>Tomaino Hermine Patricia Ndam Njoya is one of twelve candidates, and the only woman, running for president in Cameroon's upcoming election, challenging 92-year-old incumbent Paul Biya's 43-year rule. As the mayor of Foumban and leader of the Democratic Union for Cameroon party, Ndam Njoya is campaigning on a platform of "Freedom. Justice. Progress." Despite the challenges, her candidacy is seen as significant, especially as she has garnered the support of a dozen former presidential candidates who are encouraging a united opposition.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden has begun radiation and hormone therapy as part of his treatment for an aggressive form of prostate cancer. The diagnosis was first revealed in May, with doctors noting the cancer had metastasized to the bone but appeared to be manageable with treatment. This new phase of care follows a separate successful procedure in September to remove cancerous cells from his skin. His spokesperson confirmed the 82-year-old is currently undergoing the five-week radiation treatment and is said to be doing well.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Political analysts suggest that pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump was a critical factor in securing the recent ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. Observers argue that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long built his career on understanding American politics, recognized the necessity of maintaining U.S. support. As American public opinion on the conflict has shifted, Trump's direct involvement was instrumental in bringing the parties to an agreement to end the war in Gaza. The durability of the peace deal remains a key question for the region.</p>
