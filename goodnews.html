          <p>Professor Michele Dougherty has been named the UK's new Astronomer Royal, becoming the first woman to hold the prestigious advisory role in its 350-year history. Despite not studying science in secondary school, her passion led her to become a leading space scientist involved in a mission to Jupiter's icy moons. Dougherty hopes her appointment will inspire more women and girls to pursue science and aims to use the position to engage the public about the wonders of space and its economic importance. Her achievement is celebrated as a significant step toward greater diversity in science.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has advised investors to be cautious regarding the initial public offering of design software company Figma, suggesting its valuation may be too high from the start. While praising Figma's strong business fundamentals, impressive client list including Netflix and Google, and profitability, he voiced concerns over its high IPO price. Cramer also noted recent weakness in the enterprise software sector and potential margin pressures from the company's necessary, long-term investments in artificial intelligence. He suggests the stock could become too expensive if it surges immediately after trading begins. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The city of New Orleans has introduced the Crescent City ID program, a municipal identification card designed to improve access to city services for all residents, particularly vulnerable groups. This initiative is aimed at individuals who may struggle to obtain traditional IDs, such as migrants, the homeless, and members of the LGBTQ+ community. The move is seen as a supportive measure for undocumented people amid the Trump administration's nationwide crackdown on so-called "sanctuary" cities. To protect applicants, officials have stated that the program will store minimal personal information.</p>

          <p>The Senate has confirmed Susan Monarez, a health scientist and long-serving civil servant, as the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, making her the first director to undergo Senate confirmation. Monarez, who is also the first non-physician to lead the agency in decades, takes charge of a CDC facing low morale, staffing shortages, and proposed budget cuts. During her confirmation, she identified restoring trust, modernizing public health infrastructure, and improving outbreak response as her top priorities, while navigating the complex political landscape of the current administration's health agenda.</p>

          <p>While watermelon is a hydrating and nutritious summer fruit, health experts caution that overconsumption can lead to several negative side effects. Due to its high content of certain sugars known as FODMAPs, it can cause digestive issues like bloating and gas for some individuals. The fruit also contains tyramine, an amino acid that may trigger migraines in susceptible people. Additionally, its natural sugar content, though moderate, means that individuals with diabetes should be mindful of their intake. Dietitians recommend enjoying watermelon as part of a balanced diet rather than in excessive amounts.</p>
