          <p>Hong Kong's recent legalization of stablecoins is drawing interest from mainland Chinese institutions, with Citic Securities predicting a surge in tokenized real-world assets (RWA) in the city. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to a reference asset, could assist mainland companies in launching their RWA projects in Hong Kong by providing market liquidity. Analysts note that the new law will also facilitate the development of digital currency payment and settlement interfaces. The move comes as financial regulators worldwide increase their focus on stablecoins, recognizing their potential for both stability and disruption.</p>

However, the report also notes that those seeking a better retirement lifestyle will require a higher income than before, as costs for moderate and comfortable lifestyles have increased.

While the WHO suspects increased transmissibility due to mutations, there is no evidence of more severe disease.
