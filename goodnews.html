          <h2>Maryland Honors Early Catholic Settlers with Reinterment Ceremony</h2>

          <p>Maryland officials conducted a profound reinterment ceremony for 65 of the state's earliest Catholic settlers at Historic St. Mary's City, more than three centuries after their original burials. The event, held at the newly reconstructed 17th-century Brick Chapel, honored these individuals who were foundational in pioneering religious liberty in colonial America. Researchers extensively studied the remains, uncovering valuable insights into chronic illnesses, diet, and dental care from that era, with findings to be published in a future book. This observance also delivered a broader message about tolerance and coexistence, advocating for St. Mary's City's recognition as a pivotal site in American history, comparable to Jamestown and Plymouth for its role in establishing fundamental American experiences.</p>

          <p>China's gold market is currently experiencing a significant surge, with prices nearing an unprecedented US$3,900 an ounce, which has created a mix of excitement and trepidation among investors and consumers. Many individuals are grappling with the dilemma of whether to buy, sell, or hold their gold assets, often expressing frustration over missed opportunities as prices continue to climb. For example, one Guangzhou engineer sold 200 grams anticipating a downward correction, only to witness prices rise further, prompting a shift to investing in silver. This article highlights how the record-high rally has generated a "gold fever" environment, where sentiment remains highly volatile in both individual and retail sectors.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 22:43:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is significantly lagging behind other major markets like China and Europe in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, despite recent sales increases driven by a now-expired government subsidy. Analysts predict a sharp drop in EV demand following the end of the $7,500 tax credit, as high interest rates and inflation already deter buyers. This article highlights how policy differences, with former President Biden pushing for EV growth and former President Trump advocating market-driven sales and implementing tariffs, have impacted the sector. High prices for EVs in the US, partly due to tariffs on Chinese manufacturers, further contribute to the slower transition compared to global trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking President Trump's attempt to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland for at least 14 days. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut ruled that Trump's justification for the deployment fell short of the high bar required without the state governor's consent, stating that protests were "not significantly violent or disruptive." The judge emphasized the constitutional tradition of resisting military intrusion into civil affairs, affirming that the nation operates under constitutional law, not martial law. Oregon officials, including Governor Tina Kotek, lauded the decision as a victory for state sovereignty and a clear message against presidential overreach, maintaining that local law enforcement can manage the situation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury is currently exploring the possibility of minting a new one-dollar coin to commemorate the nation's 250th anniversary, with a draft design featuring an image of President Donald Trump. U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach reposted an X post showcasing the proposed coin, which includes Trump's face on one side and a depiction of him pumping his fist with the words "Fight, Fight, Fight" on the reverse. This consideration is made possible by the Circulating Collectible Coin Redesign Act of 2020, signed by Trump. However, existing legal provisions, including the Thayer Amendment, typically prohibit living persons from appearing on U.S. currency, raising potential challenges unless Congress provides a specific exception, as it has done in the past for commemorative issues.</p>
