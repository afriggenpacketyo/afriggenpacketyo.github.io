          <p>Seattle police have arrested a 29-year-old man in connection with the June home invasion and robbery at the home of rapper Macklemore. During the incident, two men entered the residence through an unlocked door and attacked the nanny with bear spray while the rapper's three children were asleep. The investigation led authorities to a jewelry store where items from Macklemore's home, including a distinguishable Seattle Sounders ring, and other recent burglaries were recovered. The suspect was arrested as part of a broader investigation into high-profile burglaries targeting celebrities and sports figures in the area.</p>

The proposed redistricting, pushed by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to create more Democratic-leaning districts and could be crucial in determining control of Congress. Solis is targeting the redrawn 38th District, which would be left without an incumbent, and has already secured endorsements from prominent figures like Mayor Karen Bass and civil rights leader Dolores Huerta.</p>

The event features a matchup between Morehouse College and Johnson C. Smith University, but organizers emphasize it is a broader cultural celebration. The four-day event aims to create an HBCU homecoming atmosphere with a pep rally, battle of the bands, and step show. By hosting the classic in Boston, organizers hope to amplify the presence and rich history of historically Black colleges and universities in a new region and build a national platform.</p>

          <p>An Arlington, Texas, man has been reunited with his Fordham University class ring 56 years after it slipped off his finger and fell into the water off a Long Island dock in 1969. An electrician using a metal detector discovered the ring at Cedar Beach earlier this summer. After finding the owner's name and graduation year engraved on it, he used social media to track down a classmate, who then located the original owner, Al DiStefano. DiStefano, now 77, called the ring's return a miracle, praising the finder's integrity in returning the valuable and sentimental item.</p>

          <p>Several cast members are leaving "Saturday Night Live" ahead of its 51st season, including eight-season veteran Heidi Gardner and recent additions Michael Longfellow, Devon Walker, and Emil Wakim. The departures were announced as the show prepares for a refresh following its landmark 50th season. SNL creator Lorne Michaels indicated that after keeping the cast stable for the anniversary, it was time for a shake-up to reinvent the show. Gardner was known for popular 'Weekend Update' characters like Angel and Bailey Gismert, while the others had carved out unique roles in their shorter tenures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists in Peru have discovered a 3,800-year-old sculpture of two toads, which they believe confirms that a devastating climate event led to the collapse of an ancient civilization near Caral. The sculpture was found at the Vichama archeological site, an urban center that developed after Caral's decline. Researchers interpret the toad, an Andean symbol for water and fertility, along with wall carvings of malnourished individuals, as evidence that the population suffered from prolonged drought. This finding suggests that severe climate change was a key factor in the disappearance of this ancient culture.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have uncovered new details about Spicomellus, the world's oldest known ankylosaur, revealing it was covered in long bony spikes that were fused directly onto its rib bones. This unique anatomical feature, described in the journal Nature, has never been seen before in any other vertebrate, living or extinct. The 165-million-year-old herbivore, found in Morocco, is being called one of the strangest dinosaurs ever discovered. The finding challenges previous theories about the evolution of armored dinosaurs, suggesting their defenses were far more elaborate at an earlier stage than previously thought.</p>

          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, has won a decisive reelection victory in the town's first formal election in over 60 years. In 2020, Braxton became mayor-elect after running unopposed, but he alleged that white officials locked him out of the town hall and prevented him from serving. This led to a federal lawsuit challenging the town's decades-long practice of "hand-me-down governance," where mayors appointed their successors. The subsequent settlement mandated the election, where Braxton's victory affirms his leadership and marks a significant shift in the town's political landscape.</p>

The author reflects on his journey, the generosity of the American family who adopted him, and the profound sense of gratitude he feels for the opportunities now available to his child.

          <p>For senior homeowners looking to tap into their home's equity without sacrificing a low mortgage rate, several alternatives to refinancing exist. A reverse mortgage, available to those 62 and older, converts equity into payments for the homeowner, with repayment deferred until the owner moves or passes away. Home equity loans offer a lump sum at a fixed interest rate, which have recently been declining. Alternatively, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) provides a flexible credit line with variable rates, allowing homeowners to borrow only what they need. (not investment advice)</p>
