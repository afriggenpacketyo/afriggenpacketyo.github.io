          <p>A fire at St Michael's Hospital in Bristol, UK, prompted the evacuation of pregnant women and babies from the maternity unit. The fire, which broke out on the roof and destroyed several solar panels, was quickly extinguished by Avon Fire and Rescue Service. Midwives supported the evacuees, moving them outside the building and later to the Bristol University Life Sciences building, while the cause of the fire is being investigated. The hospital, including the delivery suite, has since reopened, and appointments are proceeding as planned.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy has reversed its decision to remove 381 books from the U.S. Naval Academy's libraries after a Pentagon review using standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) titles. The initial removal was based on the Navy's own terms, which identified a broader range of titles, but the new review found only about 20 books needing removal pending further evaluation by a Department of Defense panel. This reversal follows a Pentagon memo standardizing search terms for DEI-related content, aiming for compliance with a Trump executive order to eliminate DEI programs; the standardized search terms included terms such as 'affirmative action,' 'anti-racism,' and 'gender affirming care.' Almost all of the originally pulled books have been returned to circulation.</p>

          <p>Svetlana Dali, a Russian citizen and U.S. permanent resident, has been found guilty of stowing away on a Delta flight from New York to Paris. Dali passed through security in a crewmember lane and boarded the flight without a ticket, remaining in the bathroom for most of the journey. After being discovered by Delta employees, she was sent back to New York, where she admitted to intentionally evading TSA officials and Delta employees to travel without paying. Dali has been in custody since December 2024, after cutting off her ankle monitor and attempting to cross into Canada.</p>

          <p>The Republican-led House passed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" by a narrow 215-214 vote, advancing President Trump's tax and immigration agenda after weeks of internal GOP disputes. The bill includes tax cuts, Medicaid reform, and immigration spending, fulfilling campaign promises such as no tax on tips or overtime, and was celebrated by Trump as a significant legislative achievement. The bill now heads to the Senate, where revisions are expected, and includes changes such as an increased SALT deduction, a later start date for Medicaid work requirements, and the renaming of MAGA Savings Accounts to 'Trump' Accounts.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has continued its upward trajectory, reaching a new record high above $111,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership, corporate adoption, and optimism surrounding U.S. crypto regulation. Despite a drop in U.S. equities, bitcoin's price surge reflects its growing status as an alternative store of value, supported by a pro-crypto agenda from the Trump administration. Bitcoin ETFs have seen strong inflows, and the number of bitcoin held by public companies has increased significantly, comprising 15% of the total bitcoin supply.</p>

          <p>Teachers and doctors in England have been granted a 4% pay rise following government acceptance of salary recommendations, though health unions have reacted negatively to a smaller 3.6% rise for other NHS staff. Education unions have welcomed the decision but warn of potential budget cuts without additional funding, while the British Medical Association considers strike action over the 'woefully inadequate' rise for resident doctors. These rises come after ministers accepted proposals from pay review bodies, and there are concerns about how the government will fund the increases without affecting frontline services.</p>

Giant sloths walking the land were easy targets for early human hunters, while smaller, tree-dwelling sloths managed to survive.
