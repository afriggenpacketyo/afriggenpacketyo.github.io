          <p>Procter & Gamble exceeded fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue expectations, driven by strong performance in its beauty and grooming divisions. Despite the positive results, the company reported flat overall sales volume, indicating that inflation-weary consumers are stretching their budgets and reducing purchases in categories like home and health care. P&G's CFO highlighted a bifurcated consumer environment, where higher-income shoppers buy in bulk while others cut back, though the company maintained its full-year financial forecast amid these challenging trends.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The concept of 'aliens' in popular culture has evolved significantly, reflecting shifting societal anxieties and technological advancements. Early depictions of little green men in the 1950s mirrored Cold War paranoia, while later films like "E.T." presented a more empathetic view. This article traces how alien narratives have served as metaphors for everything from corporate greed and refugee crises to social exclusion. It concludes by drawing a parallel to artificial intelligence, suggesting that AI represents a new form of 'alien intelligence' that evokes similar feelings of unease and misunderstanding in modern society.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot stated he is not concerned about star winger Mohamed Salah's recent lack of goals, despite Salah having scored only three times in the league this season. After being the team's top scorer last year, Salah has experienced his longest Premier League scoring drought since joining the club. Slot attributed the dip in form to several factors, including the departure of Trent Alexander-Arnold and the integration of new summer signings, which requires time for new connections to form on the field. He expressed full confidence that Salah will soon return to his prolific goal-scoring ways.</p>

          <p>A recent commentary piece reflects on the jewelry heist at the Louvre, framing the crime not as a national tragedy but as a thrilling and almost comically French escapade. The article argues that the theft, conducted by burglars who escaped on mopeds, brought more global attention to the jewels than they ever received in the museum. It contrasts this non-violent, ingenious crime with more brutal robberies, suggesting the incident is a refreshing reminder of adventure and cleverness. The author posits that the real offense was the museum closing for two days, disrupting thousands of tourists' plans.</p>

          <p>Global assets managed by hedge funds have surged to an all-time high of nearly $5 trillion, driven by the strongest quarterly net capital inflow in 18 years and positive investment returns. According to Hedge Fund Research, the industry's assets grew by over $238 billion in the third quarter, including $33.7 billion in new allocations from institutional investors. This growth is attributed to successful bets on technology and AI, increased M&A activity, and expectations of lower interest rates, signaling robust investor confidence in the sector's ability to navigate market trends.

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn returns that can outpace inflation, with the added benefit of locking in a fixed rate. While national average yields for CDs are relatively modest, top rates offered primarily by online banks are significantly higher, with some short-term CDs exceeding 4.40% APY. The current economic environment features an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs often provide better returns than long-term ones. To secure the best rates, savers are advised to compare offers from online financial institutions and consider laddering CDs of various terms. (not investment advice)</p>

This is only the fifth impact crater confirmed in China and the first to be found in the country's southern region. Researchers estimate that the energy released by the impact was equivalent to about 600,000 tonnes of TNT, or roughly 40 atomic bombs. The discovery provides new insights into the geological history of the area and the potential for extraterrestrial impacts.</p>

For Labour, the third-place finish is a devastating blow, reflecting wider concerns about the party's standing in Wales ahead of the full Senedd election next May.

          <p>Philip Pullman's new 'Book of Dust' trilogy, a companion to his controversial 'His Dark Materials' series, explores the danger of ideas by featuring books that cause people to become estranged from their souls. This article connects the plot to the real-world censorship battles that once targeted Pullman's own work for its anti-religious themes. While Pullman's original series was written in opposition to C.S. Lewis's Christian allegories, his new work suggests a belief that some books and ideas can indeed be dangerous. This reflects the ongoing culture wars over which books are appropriate for children in school libraries.</p>

The case had sought to nullify the party's 2023 congress, where a new leader was elected, alleging procedural violations and vote-buying. CHP officials have maintained that the legal action was a politically motivated attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government to undermine them, especially following their significant gains in recent local elections.
