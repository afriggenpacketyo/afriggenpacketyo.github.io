          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is set to become the largest shareholder in MP Materials, the country's only operational rare earth miner, through a $400 million investment in preferred stock. This public-private partnership aims to bolster the domestic supply chain for rare earth magnets, which are critical for military hardware like F-35 jets and drones, thereby reducing U.S. reliance on China. The investment will fund the expansion of MP Materials' processing and manufacturing capabilities, including a new magnet facility with a 10-year purchase guarantee from the Pentagon.

          <p>Delta Air Lines saw its shares jump 10% after reinstating its 2025 profit outlook and providing a stronger-than-expected forecast for summer travel. CEO Ed Bastian noted that while bookings have stabilized after a period of soft demand, they remain lower than initially predicted at the year's start. The airline's second-quarter earnings and revenue slightly exceeded Wall Street expectations, driven by strong sales of premium seats and its partnership with American Express. The company has adjusted its strategy by trimming capacity outside of peak travel times to adapt to changing consumer booking patterns. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an inflationary economy, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way to grow savings, with top accounts currently providing returns that outpace inflation. These savings vehicles allow investors to lock in high rates for a fixed term and are typically insured up to $250,000. While national average yields for one-year CDs are around 2.01%, competitive online banks offer significantly higher rates, with some one-year terms reaching 4.40% APY. Experts suggest considering shorter-term CDs, as the current inverted yield curve means they often have higher rates than longer-term options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For those looking to buy a home or refinance, understanding current interest rates is crucial in a challenging market of high rates and limited inventory. As of early July 2025, the national average for a 30-year fixed mortgage is approximately 6.70%, while a 15-year loan is around 5.88%. To secure a favorable rate, financial experts recommend strengthening one's credit profile, as the best rates are typically offered to borrowers with scores in the mid-to-high 700s. It is also advised to shop around and compare different lenders, as terms and fees can vary significantly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A savings account is a vital tool for building a financial safety net, and current high-yield options offer significant growth potential. While the national average savings rate is a modest 0.38%, top high-yield savings accounts, often from online banks, are offering rates between 4.11% and 4.30%. Online banks can provide these superior rates due to lower overhead costs, and they often feature low minimum deposits and no monthly fees. Financial planners emphasize that these accounts are an effective way to make savings work harder and stay ahead of inflation, compounding wealth over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Italian confectioner Ferrero has announced its agreement to purchase cereal maker WK Kellogg in a deal valued at $3.1 billion, causing WK Kellogg's shares to surge by 30%. The acquisition includes iconic brands like Froot Loops and Frosted Flakes, which were spun off from Kellogg (now Kellanova) in 2023. This move marks another step in Ferrero's expansion into the U.S. market and reflects ongoing consolidation in the packaged foods industry, as many consumers shift away from sugary cereals. The deal deepens Ferrero's North American portfolio, which already includes Nestle's U.S. candy business. (not investment advice)</p>

Munn had previously highlighted the importance of the Lifetime Risk Assessment test, which prompted her own biopsy and discovery of an aggressive cancer despite negative mammograms. The test calculates a woman's five-year and lifetime risk based on factors like age, family history, and reproductive history. Medical experts note that such risk assessments are crucial for identifying high-risk individuals who may require more intensive screening beyond standard mammograms.</p>

Ukrainian companies, having gained unparalleled battlefield experience, are developing flexible and effective drone technologies, often combining commercial parts with innovative local solutions. As Kyiv begins to loosen export restrictions, these firms are seeking international partnerships and joint ventures to attract investment and scale production, potentially outside Ukraine to protect against attacks.

          <p>In an interview, economist Dean Spears, co-author of "After the Spike," makes the case that falling global birth rates and the prospect of long-term depopulation pose a significant challenge to human progress. He argues that more people lead to more innovation, knowledge, and shared infrastructure that improves everyone's lives. While acknowledging environmental concerns, he contends that progress has always come from changing human activity through policy and technology, not by having fewer people. Spears urges a careful, non-politicized conversation about creating a society that better supports parenting and makes it easier for people to choose to have families.</p>
