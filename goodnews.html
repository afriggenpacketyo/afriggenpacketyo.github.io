          <p>Matthew McConaughey discusses his new film, "The Lost Bus," which dramatizes the harrowing 2018 California wildfires and his unique experience acting alongside his 93-year-old mother and 17-year-old son. The article highlights director Paul Greengrass's dedication to realism, which involved building extensive real sets and utilizing gas lines for controlled fire effects instead of virtual environments. Based on a Washington Post article, the film portrays the heroism of a school bus driver and teacher who navigated 22 schoolchildren through a raging inferno to safety. This production speaks to universal themes of making critical decisions under pressure and the increasing global danger posed by wildfires.</p>

          <p>Orange County officials are initiating a cross-reference of voter rolls with pet registration data to identify and prevent any non-human voters, following a felony charge against a Costa Mesa woman for allegedly registering her dog and casting ballots. Supervisors Dan Wagner and Janet Nguyen introduced this measure, stressing the importance of restoring public confidence in elections. While some supervisors, like Katrina Foley, affirmed the integrity of the current voting system, others, such as Vicente Sarmiento, advocated for focusing on increasing voter participation. The Registrar of Voters has already reviewed thousands of unincorporated pet records without finding issues and is expanding this review to all incorporated cities within the county.</p>

Glenn Youngkin addressed a Turning Point USA event at Virginia Tech, one of the first gatherings since Charlie Kirk’s assassination, telling attendees they are "the next Charlie Kirk" and urging them to carry on his fight for faith and freedom. Youngkin emphasized Kirk's enduring "blueprint" for advancing truth and faith in the face of evil, challenging students to engage in thoughtful dialogue and remain steadfast in their beliefs. He also lauded Kirk's wife, Erika Kirk, who has assumed the role of Turning Point USA CEO, leading the crowd in applause for her leadership.

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel's return to "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after a temporary suspension garnered an estimated 6.26 million broadcast viewers, marking his highest ratings in years, despite being preempted by about a quarter of ABC affiliates. The late-night show was suspended following Kimmel's comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr had deemed "some of the sickest conduct possible." In his return monologue, Kimmel clarified that his intention was never to make light of the murder. His monologue alone garnered over 26 million views across YouTube and other social media platforms, indicating significant public interest in his comeback.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration cannot constitutionally mandate states to cooperate with immigration enforcement in order to receive certain Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grants, marking a significant legal setback for its "sanctuary" city policies. U.S. District Judge William Smith sided with 20 states, arguing the policy was "arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional," and that withholding critical emergency funds would cause "irreparable harm" to disaster response and public safety. The Trump administration had sought to punish jurisdictions limiting cooperation with ICE, but states contend such requirements undermine trust in local police. This decision is likely to face an appeal from the administration.</p>

          <p>Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska has unveiled the 12 contenders for Fat Bear Week 2025, an annual competition highlighting brown bears as they bulk up significantly for hibernation. This engaging event, initiated in 2014, aims to make the remote park accessible globally through online voting and livestreams on Explore.org. Scientists estimate bears can gain up to 700 pounds, reaching over 1,400 pounds, with their survival through the harsh winter being the ultimate "prize." The article introduces several notable bears, including 128 Jr. ("Biggie"), 32 Chunk (last year's runner-up who is healing from an injury), and 856 ("the old man of the river"), each with unique characteristics and fishing styles.</p>

          <h2>Off-Label Drug Leucovorin Shows Promise in Improving Speech for Some Children with Autism</h2>

          <p>Parents report their son with autism, Mason, began speaking after trying leucovorin, an off-label generic drug derived from folic acid, typically used to ease chemotherapy side effects. Dr. Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist, is studying leucovorin, theorizing it bypasses a folic acid transport blockage in the brain for some autistic children, potentially improving speech. The FDA has begun the approval process despite limited large-scale trials, highlighting a gap in drug repurposing for conditions with no approved treatments. Mason's parents call the drug his "little bottle of hope," with plans for him to attend mainstream kindergarten, underscoring the profound impact this old medicine could have.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald declared his team is "fuelled by something money can’t buy," in what appeared to be a subtle criticism of their American rivals, who are receiving $500,000 stipends for the first time. This marks a departure from tradition, with $300,000 of the American payment allocated to charity, while European players compete unpaid. Donald emphasized pride, national representation, and the legacy of past players as Europe's core motivators. American player Collin Morikawa dismissed the payment's impact on desire, arguing it enables players to support their teams and communities, amidst ongoing criticism from former European players regarding the stipend's fit with the Ryder Cup ethos.</p>
