          <p>A young mountain lion cub that was struck by a vehicle and suffered severe injuries, including a fractured skull, has been successfully released back into the wild. The San Diego Humane Society's Ramona Wildlife Center spent nearly five months rehabilitating the cub, carefully managing its recovery while ensuring it did not become habituated to humans. After gaining sufficient strength and demonstrating natural survival instincts, the cub was released in a remote area of the Santa Ana Mountains. The successful rehabilitation showcases the vital work of wildlife rescue organizations in giving injured animals a second chance.</p>

          <p>Decades after being declared extinct, the Tasmanian tiger, or thylacine, continues to captivate enthusiasts who report thousands of sightings and dedicate themselves to finding proof of its survival. This Australian marsupial predator, which officially died out in 1936, has become a national obsession, with seekers using trail cams and analyzing potential tracks. In a separate scientific endeavor, a de-extinction project backed by millions in funding aims to resurrect the species by engineering the genome of its closest living relative, the dunnart. While some scientists call the project impossible, the enduring hope reflects a collective remorse for the animal's extinction.</p>

          <p>Legendary filmmaker Werner Herzog, now 82, reflects on a six-decade career defined by his relentless pursuit of extreme and unusual stories. Known for films like "Aguirre, the Wrath of God" and "Grizzly Man," his work explores the power of nature and the edges of human sanity, often filmed in grueling, remote locations. He famously hauled a 340-ton steamship over a mountain for his film "Fitzcarraldo," rejecting special effects to capture reality. Herzog, who also teaches filmmaking to "rogues," believes in the necessity of "good criminal energy" and real-life experience to create authentic art.</p>

          <p>Sealand, a former World War II anti-aircraft fort located seven miles off the English coast, stands as the world's smallest self-declared state. Founded in 1967 by Roy Bates, a "pirate radio" broadcaster, the micronation has its own royal family, constitution, and a history of fending off coups and rival buccaneers. With a land mass of two tennis courts and a full-time population of one, Sealand has survived through a unique blend of defiance and modern entrepreneurship. Today, the Bates family sustains their principality by selling noble titles online, continuing the legacy of their unique national mythology.</p>

She notes that he enjoys his villainous roles in productions like "The Mandalorian" and "Jack Reacher," and is unafraid to play into the caricature of himself as a "wild man." However, she emphasizes that this perception is misleading, describing him as a "really, really sweet, good man" in their private life.

          <p>A contentious proposal to mandate the sale of hundreds of thousands of acres of public land in 11 Western states has been removed from the Republican tax and spending bill. The provision, championed by Senator Mike Lee of Utah, faced strong bipartisan opposition from lawmakers, conservationists, and recreation advocates. Lee stated he withdrew the measure because he could not secure safeguards to prevent the land from being sold to foreign interests or large corporations. The plan's removal is seen as a major victory for public land defenders, though they remain vigilant against future privatization attempts.</p>
