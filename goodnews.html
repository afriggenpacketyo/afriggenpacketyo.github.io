          <p>In an interview, Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan framed the recent presidential summit with Vladimir Putin as a preliminary step toward a ceasefire in Ukraine, driven by the pressure of U.S. sanctions. He emphasized Alaska's strategic military and energy importance, suggesting the state's strength serves as a message to Russia and highlighting its potential to supply natural gas to Asian allies. Sullivan also defended the reversal of previous environmental protections, arguing that resource development is vital for the state's economy, national security, and the well-being of its Indigenous populations.

          <p>In response to the federal law enforcement takeover in Washington D.C. and threats of similar actions in other cities, Black mayors are pushing back against a narrative of rampant urban crime. Leaders from cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, and Baltimore are highlighting significant, data-supported declines in violent crime and homicides following pandemic-era peaks. They attribute this success to community-based strategies and public health approaches to violence prevention, arguing that the federal focus on militarized policing is a politically motivated misrepresentation of their achievements.</p>

This collective move, involving leaders from the European Commission, NATO, France, and Germany, is seen as an effort to bolster Zelenskyy's position following his exclusion from the recent U.S.-Russia summit. The united European front aims to ensure their continent's voice is heard in peace negotiations and to prevent a repeat of a previous tense encounter between the American and Ukrainian leaders.</p>

          <p>Ronnie Rondell Jr., a prolific Hollywood stuntman and actor, has passed away at the age of 88. His long career included work on major films and television shows like "Lethal Weapon" and "Star Trek," but he is most famously known for being the man on fire on the cover of Pink Floyd's 1975 album "Wish You Were Here." The dangerous stunt, which involved being set alight 15 times for the photograph, singed his mustache. Rondell was a co-founder of the company Stunts Unlimited and was highly respected in the industry as a mentor and legendary performer.</p>

          <p>A former software entrepreneur has completed a challenging, multi-year renovation of Thorne Island, a derelict Napoleonic fort off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales. After purchasing the abandoned property in 2017, Mike Conner invested heavily to overcome significant logistical hurdles, including bringing running water and electricity to the island for the first time in years. Now equipped with 40 beds, modern amenities, and its own nightclub, the historic fortress that once protected against French naval attacks has been transformed into a unique, off-grid party and event space now on the market for £3 million.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued after being trapped for two days in a cave-like space behind a powerful waterfall in California's Kern River area. The man, an experienced rappeller, was pushed off his lines by the extreme water hydraulics at the Seven Teacups waterfalls and became stranded. After he was reported missing, search teams used a drone to locate him behind the cascade of water. A California Highway Patrol helicopter crew then performed a difficult hoist to lift him to safety, concluding what the local sheriff's office called a "stunning survival story."</p>
