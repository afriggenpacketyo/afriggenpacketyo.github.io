          <p>Albania is holding parliamentary elections, viewed as a critical juncture for its democratic progress and aspirations for EU membership, as Prime Minister Edi Rama seeks a fourth term. The ruling Socialist Party is campaigning on an EU accession platform, promising to bring Albania into the EU by 2030, but analysts emphasize the need for institutional reforms and anti-corruption efforts. The opposition, a coalition led by Sali Berisha, faces challenges due to internal divisions and corruption charges against its leaders, while new parties are emerging to offer reformist alternatives. Recent electoral code changes aim to introduce preferential voting, but limitations remain that reinforce party leadership control.</p>

          <h2>China's Exports Surge Despite US Tariffs, Driven by Southeast Asian Demand</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 02:38:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced a significant surge in April, primarily fueled by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, effectively offsetting a sharp decline in exports to the United States due to recently implemented tariffs. While overall exports rose by 8.1%, shipments to the U.S. plummeted by over 21%, highlighting the impact of trade tensions. The surge in exports to ASEAN countries, particularly Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand, suggests a shift in trade dynamics, possibly involving transshipment through third countries. Despite the challenges posed by U.S. tariffs, China's overall trade performance demonstrates resilience, although analysts anticipate potential weakening in the coming months.</p>

          <p>The 19th Venice Architecture Biennale is exploring how cities can adapt to rising temperatures caused by climate change, addressing the urgent need for urban resilience. Curator Carlo Ratti emphasizes the importance of collaboration across disciplines to rethink the built environment and address the challenges of a warming world. The exhibition highlights the overheating of urban areas due to sealed surfaces and lack of green spaces, and presents solutions such as transforming cities into flood-resistant "sponge cities." The German Pavilion's "Stress Test" exhibition offers a visceral experience of the future urban climate, underscoring the need for rapid action to make cities habitable.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is set to announce new sanctions targeting Russia's 'shadow fleet' of oil tankers, which have been used to circumvent existing sanctions on Russian oil and gas exports since the invasion of Ukraine. These restrictions, announced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer at a summit of northern European leaders, will affect up to 100 vessels responsible for transporting over ¬£18 billion worth of cargo since the start of 2024. The sanctioned tankers will be barred from British ports and could be detained in UK waters, aiming to disrupt Russia's war efforts and protect subsea infrastructure. The Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) members are also expected to announce further support for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Nvidia intends to release a modified version of its H20 chip for the Chinese market in July, aiming to navigate U.S. export controls restricting China's access to advanced semiconductor technology. The downgraded H20 chip will feature significantly reduced memory capacity to meet the new technical thresholds set by U.S. authorities, after the original H20 was effectively blocked from sale. This move represents Nvidia's effort to maintain its presence in a crucial market while adhering to evolving regulatory requirements. Downstream customers may also have the potential to modify the module configuration to adjust the chip's performance levels.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump suggested that U.S. tariffs on goods from China may decrease as trade officials from both nations prepare for discussions, signaling a potential de-escalation in the trade war. Trump's remarks followed the unveiling of a trade agreement with the UK, the first since he imposed steep levies globally in April. The upcoming meeting in Switzerland is viewed as a promising sign that both countries are ready to ease trade tensions, although analysts caution that systemic issues between the U.S. and China may persist.

          <p>Kent E. Calder of Kyodo News analyzes America's revived strategic interest in Greenland, driven by its geographic location and the interplay of climate and geopolitical considerations. With the Arctic warming and Russia expanding its presence, Greenland's proximity to both Russia and the U.S. East Coast makes it strategically significant. The Trump administration's unilateral approach to Greenland, however, raises concerns among NATO allies. Calder suggests applying the "Compact of Free Association" model from the Pacific to balance U.S. interests with international concerns, ensuring NATO security and reinforcing stability.</p>
