        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent declines in mortgage rates have created significant savings opportunities for homebuyers and those looking to refinance. With the average 30-year fixed rate dropping from 6.93% in January to 6.34% today, the monthly payment on a $700,000 loan has decreased by approximately $273. This translates to annual savings of over $3,200 and nearly $100,000 in total interest over the life of the loan. The article provides a detailed breakdown of these costs, comparing different loan terms and outlining the financial implications for borrowers in the current market. (not investment advice)</p>

Her journey involved significant emotional distress until she received a diagnosis of PCOS, a common and often underdiagnosed cause of infertility affecting one in ten women. Following successful treatment that led to the birth of two children, she is now encouraging others facing similar difficulties to seek medical help and maintain hope.</p>

          <p>Shares of Fair Isaac Corp., the company behind the FICO credit score, surged over 20% after it announced a new business model that will allow it to license scores directly to mortgage lenders. This change could potentially disintermediate the three major credit bureaus—Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax—whose stocks fell on the news. The move is intended to eliminate markups on FICO scores and give lenders more choice, a development praised by the Federal Housing Finance Agency director as a way to make markets more competitive.</p>

          <p>Tesla announced a 7% year-over-year increase in vehicle deliveries for the third quarter, totaling 497,099 units, as customers likely rushed to buy before a key federal tax credit expired. While deliveries surpassed analyst expectations, the company's vehicle production saw a slight decline compared to the same period last year. The report comes amid a sales slump in Europe and increased competition, and Tesla's stock dipped by over 3% following the announcement.</p>

          <p>The captain of the oil tanker Boracay, believed to be part of Russia's "shadow fleet" for evading sanctions, has been charged in France for refusing to comply with naval orders. The vessel was boarded by the French navy as it was on an EU sanctions list for transporting Russian oil exports. This action highlights ongoing international efforts to counteract Russia's strategy of using a covert fleet of tankers with obscured ownership to maintain its energy trade despite Western sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to purchase OxyChem, the petrochemical division of Occidental Petroleum, for $9.7 billion in cash. The deal is Berkshire's largest acquisition since 2022 and comes as the conglomerate holds a near-record amount of cash reserves. Occidental Petroleum, in which Berkshire already holds a significant stake, plans to use $6.5 billion of the proceeds to pay down its debt, a move its CEO says will unlock shareholder value and allow the company to resume its stock buyback program.</p>

The reunion was made possible after Emana, who was inspired to become a nurse herself and now works at the same hospital, found an old photo that helped her identify Perry.</p>
