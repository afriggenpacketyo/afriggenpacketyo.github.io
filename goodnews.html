          <p>A Virgin Australia flight from Melbourne to Brisbane was delayed for two hours after a stowaway snake was discovered in the cargo hold. A snake catcher successfully removed the 2-foot green tree snake, which was initially thought to be venomous. The snake, native to the Brisbane region, likely boarded the plane in a passenger's luggage and will be rehomed with a licensed keeper due to quarantine rules.</p>

          <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court has struck down a 176-year-old abortion ban, ruling that it was superseded by a more recent 1985 law. The 4-3 decision by the court's liberal majority clarifies that abortions are legal in the state until fetal viability. This ruling resolves legal uncertainty that arose after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, providing more certainty for abortion providers and patients in Wisconsin.</p>

          <p>Germany is increasingly looking to Taiwan as an alternative source for drones and their components to decrease its dependence on the Chinese market. A recent report shows Germany became the second-largest importer of Taiwanese drones in early 2025, reflecting a broader European effort to build "non-red" supply chains independent of Beijing's influence. While a complete decoupling is unrealistic, Germany aims to diversify key components like software and chips to mitigate national security and cybersecurity risks. (not investment advice)</p>
