          <p>David Bailey, CEO of BTC Inc. and a crypto advisor to President Trump, has launched Nakamoto, a bitcoin investment company with $300 million in funding. The company intends to acquire and invest bitcoin into companies globally, including those in Brazil, Thailand, and South Africa. Nakamoto will merge with a Nasdaq-listed company, with a public listing expected this summer. This venture follows a model popularized by Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy, aiming to capitalize on the increasing appetite for bitcoin exposure in capital markets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this New York Times article, the author argues that the charitable tax deduction in the U.S. disproportionately benefits wealthy donors and the institutions they support, such as museums and universities. The current system allows higher-income individuals to receive larger income tax deductions for their charitable donations, effectively subsidizing their philanthropy more than that of lower-income individuals. The author suggests replacing the current system with a tax incentive that is determined by the amount of the donation, not the income of the donor, such as matching private donations or tax credits.</p>

          <p>Part of a Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to crash back to Earth this week after being stuck in orbit for over half a century.

The risk to people on the ground is considered low, but the capsule's projected flight path could see it land anywhere between 51.7¬∞ north and south latitude, covering most of the inhabited world.</p>

While the rainfall amounts may seem insignificant compared to other parts of the country, it's a significant amount for the arid landscape of Las Vegas, which typically receives very little rain in May.</p>
