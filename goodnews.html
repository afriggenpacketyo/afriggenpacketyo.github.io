          <p>According to a company source, Nissan is considering closing two plants located in the Kanagawa Prefecture. This potential closure could significantly impact the local economy and workforce, reflecting broader challenges within the automotive industry. The decision likely stems from factors such as declining sales, increased production costs, and the shift towards electric vehicles, which require different manufacturing processes. The company is assessing the feasibility and potential consequences of this move before making a final decision, and further details are expected to emerge as the evaluation progresses.</p>

The show depicts characters like Cassian Andor facing challenges similar to those experienced by marginalized communities in Latin America. The Empire's oppressive tactics and the themes of resistance draw parallels to historical events like the Tlatelolco massacre. Through its characters and narratives, 'Andor' offers a commentary on authoritarian regimes and the struggle for liberation, highlighting the importance of empathy and resistance in the face of oppression. The article argues that the series is not just historical stories but also warnings and templates on how to confront the present moment.</p>

          <p>Tesla announced a change to its corporate bylaws that will limit shareholders' ability to sue the company for breach of fiduciary duties. The new bylaw requires shareholders to hold at least 3% of Tesla's outstanding shares to institute or maintain a derivative proceeding, a stake worth over $30 billion. This move takes advantage of a Texas state law and creates a significant barrier to shareholder lawsuits against insiders. Tesla previously moved its incorporation to Texas after a Delaware court decision rescinded Elon Musk's 2018 CEO compensation package.</p>

He emphasizes the importance of a strong concept and thorough understanding of textiles in his designs. Boateng also reflects on his impact on Savile Row, where he was the first black designer to open a shop, breathing new life into the street.</p>

          <p>Two British men accused of robbing a luxury jewellery store in Tokyo can be extradited to Japan following a landmark ruling. For almost a decade, Japanese authorities have pursued the extradition of Kaine Wright, 28, Joe Chappell, 38, and a third man over allegations they posed as customers to steal items worth ¬£679,000 (¬•106m) from a Harry Winston store. Judge Goldspring rejected Wright and Chappell's challenges against extradition. This is the first time Japan have successfully received fugitives from the UK.</p>

          <h2>Leaked Audio from Biden Special Counsel Interview Reveals Memory Lapses</h2>

          <p>Leaked audio from former President Joe Biden‚Äôs interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur showed the president struggling with key memories, including when his son Beau died and when he left the vice presidency. The audio came out after more than a year of congressional lawmakers demanding its release amid questions about the former president‚Äôs memory lapses and mental acuity. In one instance, Biden said that Beau Biden was either "deployed or is dying" at that time, before a lawyer corrected him that Beau died in 2015. The audio also showed Biden asking multiple times when his term as vice president ended while being questioned specifically about some of the classified documents at his home.</p>

          <h2>California Board Rescinds Hazardous Waste Proposal After Public Outcry</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 19:30:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A California environmental oversight board unanimously voted to rescind a controversial proposal that would have allowed municipal landfills to accept contaminated soil. The decision followed months of intense scrutiny from residents and environmental groups who expressed concerns about toxic dust and chemicals leaching into groundwater. State officials had argued that the change would ease disposal of contaminated soil, but environmental advocates countered that it would weaken California's hazardous waste standards. The decision reflects a victory for community members and environmental groups who prioritized public health and safety.</p>
