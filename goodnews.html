          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has conveyed to U.S. President Donald Trump his desire for 'productive' discussions regarding U.S. tariffs. With a parliamentary election looming and his approval ratings at record lows following a series of slush fund scandals, Ishiba dismissed his agriculture minister Wednesday after an off-the-cuff remark about gifted rice angered a public that is already questioning the Japanese leader's handling of soaring prices. Ishiba hopes to mitigate potential negative repercussions for his administration and prevent emboldening the opposition. The discussions aim to address trade tensions between the two countries. </p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation accelerated to 3.5% in April, the highest in more than two years, driven by rising rice prices and reduced energy subsidies. The increase in the nationwide core consumer price index, excluding fresh food, follows a 3.2% rise in March and has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target since April 2022. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has signaled his intention to raise rates, while also monitoring the effects of U.S. tariffs. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has pledged to lower rice prices, staking his job on the line.</p>
