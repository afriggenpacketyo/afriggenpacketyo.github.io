        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced a new policy restricting its main civil service internship program to students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This change, effective in 2026, aims to increase representation from working-class families within Whitehall. The determination of background will be based on parental occupation when the student was 14. Successful interns will be prioritized for the Fast Stream graduate program, as the government seeks to diversify its workforce and ensure it better reflects the country it serves. This initiative is part of a broader effort to move civil service roles outside of London.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans for a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom to be constructed in the White House's East Wing. The project, estimated to cost $200 million, will be funded by President Trump and other private donors, not by taxpayers. With a capacity for 650 seated guests, the new venue is intended to host major state functions without the need for temporary tents. Construction is scheduled to begin in September and will replace the current East Wing, which was originally built in 1902 and has undergone numerous renovations.</p>

During an earnings call, Cook emphasized that Apple is "very open" to mergers and acquisitions of any size that can accelerate its AI roadmap, confirming seven smaller company acquisitions this year. While Apple's capital expenditures are lower than competitors like Google and Meta, the company is reallocating staff and using a hybrid investment model to enhance its AI capabilities. Cook affirmed that AI is one of the most profound technologies and will affect all Apple devices.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to reestablish the Presidential Fitness Test and its associated council, a program retired during the Obama administration. The original test, dating back to the 1950s, was designed to assess student fitness through exercises like pull-ups and a one-mile run. The new order directs the council, to be chaired by golfer Bryson DeChambeau, to develop strategies for reviving the test and promoting physical education to combat childhood obesity. This move aims to foster a new generation of healthy citizens and address what the administration terms a national security threat posed by sedentary lifestyles.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers opted for a conservative approach at the MLB trade deadline, making modest additions rather than blockbuster deals. The team acquired veteran reliever Brock Stewart from the Minnesota Twins and outfielder Alex Call from the Washington Nationals to address bullpen and defensive needs. Unlike other National League contenders who made significant acquisitions, the Dodgers' front office expressed confidence in their existing roster to defend their World Series title. The team is betting on the return of injured players and improved performance from its star hitters to carry them through the remainder of the season.</p>

          <h2>FICO CEO Defends Score Pricing, Stating It Does Not Hinder Homeownership</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>FICO's CEO, Will Lansing, has responded to criticism from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) regarding price increases for its credit scores. He argued that the cost, at $4.95 per score for a mortgage, is a minor part of closing costs and does not create a barrier to homeownership. This defense comes after the FHFA allowed lenders to use competitor VantageScore for the first time, a move Lansing claims raises "safety and soundness concerns." He asserted FICO's market dominance and superior predictive power, even as the company faces increased regulatory scrutiny. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cole's French Dip, a historic Los Angeles restaurant claiming to have invented the iconic sandwich, has postponed its planned closure by 45 days. The decision follows a massive outpouring of community support and a dramatic surge in business after the initial closing announcement. Owner Cedd Moses stated that while the recent customer traffic is likely not sustainable long-term, the extension provides temporary relief and keeps staff employed. Moses is now actively seeking a new buyer who will respect the landmark's historical value, citing the challenging economic model for restaurants in Los Angeles as the reason for the original decision.</p>

In response, JD.com announced a 1 billion yuan investment to establish 10,000 self-operated "7Fresh" kitchens over the next three years.

          <p>With the Federal Reserve continuing its pause on interest rate cuts, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) face a strategic decision. Financial experts suggest that the current environment, with CD rates still comfortably above 4%, presents a good opportunity to renew or shop for new accounts. Because banks may lower rates in anticipation of future Fed cuts, locking in today's higher rates now could be advantageous. Savers are advised to act before their CD's grace period ends to avoid automatic renewal into a potentially lower-rate account and to compare offers to maximize their earnings.
