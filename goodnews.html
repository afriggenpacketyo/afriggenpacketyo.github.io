        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mounjaro, a weight loss injection previously used for type 2 diabetes, is now available at GP surgeries in England, but eligibility is restricted to those with a BMI of 40 or over (37.5 for minority ethnic backgrounds) and four out of five specific health conditions. NHS England plans a phased rollout to reach those most in need, while some GP practices caution that few patients will initially qualify. Pharmacy organizations express concern that demand may exceed supply, and training is needed for healthcare staff to administer the drug safely. The medicine makes you feel fuller so you eat less, and individuals will need to discuss potential side-effects with their GP or clinic.</p>

          <p>China has become the world leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold in the country last year being electric. This dominance is attributed to long-term government planning, vast subsidies, and control over critical supply chains in battery production. Chinese EV makers like BYD are now leading the global market, offering affordable EVs for the mass market. The government's support includes subsidies for consumers, tax exemptions, and a large public charging network.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist in Scotland hopes to establish a clinic offering ketamine as a treatment for severe depression, providing an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This follows a private clinic in Lanarkshire that began offering ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors. The Royal College of Psychiatrists has urged caution but is due to publish a new report on psychedelics later this year, with updated information on ketamine.</p>

However, most of the monkeys survived, and researchers were able to preserve valuable data and biological samples. The survival of the monkeys and the research data is considered a testament to the resilience of the team and the adaptability of the monkeys.</p>

It took five days before a sperm whale came alongside the boat, but Vega described the encounter as "otherworldly." The experience was both terrifying and rewarding, providing insight into the importance of conservation efforts.</p>

Sloths are vegetarians that digest toxins slowly, saving energy and blending into the canopy to avoid predators. Despite their solitary nature, female sloths will climb to the top of a tree when they're in heat and scream for sex.</p>

Medical staff were worried about losing their licenses or going to jail if they did what she needed due to the state's new six week abortion ban. After contacting the governor's office, doctors eventually agreed to give her the medication, but the situation highlighted the confusion and fear surrounding abortion laws in the state.
