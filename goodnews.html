          <p>A Missouri woman, Lisa Jeanine Findley, has been sentenced to four years and nine months in federal prison for attempting to fraudulently sell Elvis Presley's Graceland estate. Findley fabricated loan documents to falsely claim that Lisa Marie Presley had used the historic property as collateral for a $3.8 million loan. She then published a fake foreclosure notice and attempted to auction the home before being stopped by a lawsuit from Presley's granddaughter, Riley Keough. The scheme involved identity theft and an attempt to blame a Nigerian fraud ring after the plot was uncovered.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in Patagonia, Argentina, have discovered a new species of megaraptoran dinosaur, named Joaquinraptor casali. The fossil, which was found with the remains of an ancient crocodile in its jaws, provides significant insight into this lesser-known group of predators. Megaraptorans were characterized by their powerful claws and elongated skulls, and this nearly complete skeleton helps fill a major gap in the evolutionary timeline. The discovery suggests these dinosaurs used their long, powerful arms to hunt, unlike the T. rex, which relied on its massive teeth, showing there was more than one way to be a top predator during the Cretaceous period.</p>

          <p>The 2026 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival has sold out all passes for both of its weekends just three days after they became available. This marks a return to the festival's pre-pandemic trend of rapid sellouts, a welcome sign for promoter Goldenvoice after several years of slower sales. The lineup features headliners Justin Bieber, Sabrina Carpenter, Karol G, and Anyma, among a wide array of other artists. The quick sales are seen as a positive indicator for the concert industry, which has recently faced challenges with other festivals being canceled and some major tours struggling with ticket demand.</p>

          <p>A Chicago family is highlighted for their celebration of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, emphasizing the importance of passing down traditions during what they describe as a challenging time for the Jewish community. For Brittany and Dan Gruber, teaching their young daughters to prepare traditional foods like apples and honey is a way to instill a sense of "Jewish joy." The holiday marks the beginning of the High Holy Days, a period of reflection and new beginnings. The family's celebration revolves around shared meals, prayer, and creating their own unique customs, underscoring the holiday's universal message of taking a moment to reflect on one's impact on others.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly is investing $6.5 billion to construct a new manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas. The plant is intended to significantly boost production of its small molecule drugs, including its highly anticipated experimental oral obesity pill, orforglipron. This investment is part of a larger strategy to increase domestic manufacturing capacity, with Eli Lilly having already announced plans for four new U.S. plants. The move is seen as crucial for meeting the massive demand for new GLP-1 weight-loss drugs and comes as the Trump administration pressures companies to re-shore pharmaceutical production. The Houston site is expected to create over 600 permanent jobs.</p>

The second is from a 19-year-old feeling left behind and experiencing panic attacks as their friends have gone to college. The columnist advises the first to reclaim her autonomy to escape the anxiety, and encourages the second to reframe their narrative, embrace being alone for a time, and recognize that their life is just beginning.

          <p>A man has been sentenced to 12 months in jail for stalking singer Cheryl Tweedy and breaching a restraining order for the fourth time. Daniel Bannister, 50, appeared at the singer's home in June, prompting his arrest. In a victim impact statement, Tweedy said the repeated incidents have intensified her worry and made her young child scared. The judge noted Bannister's defiance of court orders and issued a new restraining order. The court heard that Bannister had previously been jailed for manslaughter in an unrelated case in 2012.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a period of strengthening, the growth rate for single-family home rents in the U.S. began to slow in July. Rent prices increased by 2.3% year-over-year, a rate below the pre-pandemic average and a significant deceleration from previous months. This cooling trend was observed across most major metropolitan areas and at all price tiers, with markets like Miami seeing no rent growth at all. The slowdown could indicate that landlords are facing pressure from struggling consumer finances. This marks a shift from the past few years when single-family rentals were in high demand due to the expensive for-sale housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in federal grant funding to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The administration had frozen hundreds of millions in grants, citing allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action. U.S. District Judge Rita Lin ruled that the government likely violated federal law by not providing specific procedures or explanations for the cuts. This ruling concerns hundreds of critical medical research grants for studies on Parkinson's disease, cancer, and nerve regeneration, which the university argued were pivotal for public health.</p>

They state there is no new or robust scientific evidence to support a causal link and that paracetamol remains an important treatment option for pain and fever.

It acknowledges that Ocasio-Cortez has moderated some of her initial left-wing stances, drawing criticism from parts of her base. However, the author concludes that despite any flaws, her charisma and fighting spirit may make her the best-placed figure to lead the country out of the current political landscape.</p>
