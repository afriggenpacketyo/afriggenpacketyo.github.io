          <p>This New York Times article delves into Audra McDonald's Tony-nominated performance of "Rose's Turn" in the Broadway revival of "Gypsy," exploring the depths of the character Rose's self-delusion and self-knowledge. The article discusses how McDonald, along with director George C. Wolfe, musical director Andy Einhorn, and choreographer Camille A. Brown, crafted a rendition that exposes a previously unseen vulnerability and fear of abandonment in Rose. McDonald's interpretation draws on personal experiences and a focus on Rose's relationship with her own mother, resulting in a raw and emotionally devastating performance that leaves audiences deeply moved.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced it is initiating a scientific review to potentially remove ingestible fluoride prescription drug products for children from the market by October 31. While fluoride is known to strengthen tooth enamel and reduce cavities, the FDA cites studies suggesting that ingested fluoride may alter the gut microbiome and be associated with thyroid disorders, weight gain, and decreased IQ. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., a long-time critic of fluoride, supports the move, while dental experts largely maintain that fluoride is safe and effective in preventing dental decay.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will remove all sanctions on Syria, aiming to give the country "a chance at greatness" under its new government. Speaking at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum in Riyadh, Trump stated his administration has already taken steps to restore normal relations between the U.S. and Syria, which has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism since 1979. The decision marks a shift in U.S. policy following years of sanctions imposed in response to the Assad regime's crackdown on anti-government uprisings.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's administration is considering accepting a $400 million luxury plane as a gift from Qatar, sparking legal and ethical concerns. While Trump calls it a "great gesture," some Democrats label it "wildly illegal," citing constitutional provisions against elected officials accepting gifts from foreign leaders without congressional approval. The move also raises questions about potential conflicts of interest, as Trump's family is pursuing business deals in Qatar and the UAE. Experts suggest that any use of the plane by Trump after leaving office would be a violation of the constitution.</p>

Despite easing inflation and a steady job market, many Americans still struggle with high-interest credit card debt. The article suggests that debt forgiveness can offer targeted relief by reducing debt obligations, especially for those who are falling behind on payments or have limited access to alternative debt relief options. The article also acknowledges the trade-offs, such as credit damage and potential tax liability, and advises consulting a debt relief expert.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s overhaul of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which involved firing thousands of staffers and canceling billions in grants, will face scrutiny from Congress. Kennedy will testify before lawmakers to discuss President Trump's proposed budget for the agency, which would make the restructuring and budget cuts permanent. Former HHS leaders have weighed in on Kennedy's approach, with some supporting the need for cuts while others criticize the lack of strategy and potential impact on public health programs.</p>

          <p>Former FDA Commissioner Dr. David Kessler warns that weight loss drugs like GLP-1s have "no end game" due to a lack of data on long-term use and how to safely discontinue them. Kessler, who used the drugs himself, emphasizes that they are not miracle pills and require a larger journey involving diet, exercise, and medical supervision. He also raises concerns about the potential for weight regain upon stopping the drugs and the need for the FDA to require data on safe usage and discontinuation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated his intent to remove all US sanctions against Syria. This statement came during a period when concerns were being raised about the detention of streamer Hasan Piker by border agents, who questioned him about his views on Trump and Hamas. The decision on Syria and the concerns over Piker's detention reflect the current political climate and policy shifts under the Trump administration.</p>

          <h2>California Sues Over Trump Policy Tying Transportation Grants to Immigration</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 13:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California's Attorney General Rob Bonta filed two lawsuits challenging a Trump administration policy that would deny the state billions of dollars in transportation grants unless it complies with the administration's immigration enforcement policies. Bonta argues that imposing these conditions exceeds the administration's legal authority and treats essential community safety funds as a bargaining chip. The lawsuit highlights the ongoing conflict between California and the Trump administration over immigration policies and federal funding.</p>

          <p>In this "Dear James" advice column from The Atlantic, a reader seeks guidance on managing debilitating stage fright. James Parker responds by recommending meditation as a means to cultivate a sense of detached awareness from the body's anxious responses.
