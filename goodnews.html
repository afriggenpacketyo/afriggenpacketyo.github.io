          <p>Japan's primary stock index, the Nikkei 225, reached a new record by breaking the 45,000 mark, leading gains across Asia-Pacific markets. The surge was influenced by optimistic remarks from President Trump regarding ongoing trade negotiations between the United States and China. Other regional markets, including South Korea's Kospi and Australia's ASX/S&P 200, also saw gains, reflecting broader investor confidence following positive closes on Wall Street. This market activity occurred as investors globally anticipated a key meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's effort to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, allowing her to remain in her position. The 2-1 decision upholds a lower court's injunction, which found that President Trump likely lacked the legal "cause" to remove her over alleged mortgage fraud that predated her appointment. The ruling ensures Cook will participate in the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee meeting, a significant development in the ongoing conflict over the central bank's independence from political pressure. The case highlights the legal interpretation of the Federal Reserve Act's removal provisions.</p>

He emphasizes that the disease is manageable with proper diet, exercise, and a positive mindset, drawing parallels to the resilience he learned during his football career.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 19:47:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is re-evaluating the prominent "black box" warnings on menopause hormone therapy drugs, which currently caution against risks like stroke and breast cancer. Many medical experts now argue that the initial research from 2002, which led to these warnings, was flawed because it focused on older women and overstated the risks for those who begin treatment earlier. This potential change could make hormone therapy, considered the most effective treatment for symptoms like hot flashes, more accessible and less stigmatized for perimenopausal women. However, some experts urge caution and further public input before any labels are altered.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Democratic members of the House committee on China are pressuring the Trump administration to include "binding requirements" in any future trade agreement with Beijing to curb its structural industrial overcapacity. In a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, they argued that China's overproduction in sectors like steel and solar panels leads to damaging price wars and harms global markets. This call for stricter terms comes as U.S. and Chinese officials engage in high-stakes trade negotiations. The Democrats' position aligns with concerns previously voiced by the Biden administration about the economic impact of China's state-supported manufacturing output. (not investment advice)</p>

Cramer highlighted their ability to fend off competitors and government interference as key strengths.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, a proposal the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is now actively reviewing. Trump argued the change would save money and allow corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits, a view shared by some business leaders like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon. The move, which would align U.S. practice more closely with that of the U.K. and E.U., could be implemented by the SEC without congressional approval. Supporters of the current system, however, argue that quarterly reports provide essential transparency for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Beachgoers in Santa Monica may notice the ocean turning a fluorescent pink as researchers from UCLA and the Bay Foundation conduct a study on water circulation. A temporary, nontoxic dye is being released near the Santa Monica Pier to track how water moves around a man-made breakwater from the 1930s. Scientists suspect the structure impedes circulation, contributing to the area's consistently poor water quality and high bacteria levels. By tracing the dye's path, the team hopes to better understand the pier's environmental impact and find solutions to improve the cleanliness of one of California's most popular beaches.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a "framework" for a deal with Chinese-owned ByteDance that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States, avoiding a potential ban. The agreement would require the sale of TikTok to a U.S.-based owner to address national security concerns over data privacy and potential Chinese government influence. The move comes ahead of a September 17 deadline imposed by President Trump. While details remain sparse, the announcement signals a potential resolution to the long-running dispute over the popular app, which has about 170 million American users.</p>

          <p>A brush fire, named the Nissan Fire, broke out Monday afternoon in Oceanside, near Highway 78 and College Boulevard in northern San Diego County. Firefighters responded quickly to the blaze and were able to stop its forward progress before it reached the freeway. However, the firefighting activity prompted the Oceanside Fire Department to close several eastbound lanes of Highway 78, causing significant traffic delays in the area. The cause of the fire is under investigation, but crews successfully prevented it from spreading further and causing more extensive damage to the surrounding area.</p>
