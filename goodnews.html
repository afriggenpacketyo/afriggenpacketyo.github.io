          <h2>Dodgers' Max Muncy Avoids Season-Ending Injury, Team's Trade Deadline Strategy Unchanged</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 22:27:47 EDT</div>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy has avoided a major season-ending knee injury, being diagnosed with only a bone bruise after a frightening on-field collision. While he is expected to be sidelined for approximately six weeks, the team's management expressed relief that no ligaments were torn, which allows him to potentially return before the playoffs. General manager Brandon Gomes stated that this positive prognosis means the Dodgers' trade deadline plans will likely remain unaltered. The team will rely on internal options like Tommy Edman to cover third base in the interim, confident that Muncy can regain his form upon his return.</p>

          <p>Authorities in New York City temporarily closed a section of beach in Far Rockaway, Queens, on the Fourth of July after multiple shark sightings occurred dangerously close to swimmers. Drones operated by the city's emergency management team confirmed the sharks' proximity, leading lifeguards to clear the water as a safety precaution. The article notes that the beach was reopened after about an hour following continued monitoring. This incident comes as New York state officials, including Governor Kathy Hochul, have been increasing shark surveillance measures along Long Island's popular beaches to ensure public safety during the busy summer holiday season.</p>

          <p>In response to U.S. actions targeting China's dominance in the shipbuilding industry, both South Korea and Japan are implementing policies to strengthen their own sectors. South Korea's new presidential administration has labeled the domestic industry as being in a 'major crisis' and has pledged significant support to reclaim its status as a global leader. The government's new growth policy guide focuses on developing advanced, eco-friendly, and autonomous vessels through increased digitalization and automation. These measures aim to enhance production capabilities and improve working conditions, positioning the nations to compete more effectively on the global stage.</p>

          <p>Italian luxury brand Prada is facing accusations of cultural appropriation from artisans in Kolhapur, India, after releasing a line of sandals that bear a striking resemblance to traditional Kolhapuri chappals. The local artisans, who handcraft the leather sandals for a modest price, were angered that the high-fashion version did not acknowledge its design origins. The controversy has drawn attention to the struggles of the nearly 5,000 artisans who work in difficult conditions for low wages to preserve the centuries-old craft. In response to the backlash, local industry associations are now seeking better recognition and potential compensation to support the artisans' cultural legacy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the evolving perceptions of crying in the workplace, questioning whether it is a career-damaging sign of weakness or a normal human emotional response. It references a recent public display of emotion by a UK politician and gathers anecdotal evidence from various professionals, both men and women, who have cried at work due to stress, frustration, or personal news. Career coaches and experts suggest that modern workplaces are increasingly valuing emotional intelligence, viewing authentic emotional expression as a potential strength. However, some acknowledge a lingering bias that may perceive crying as instability, potentially affecting promotion prospects in more traditional environments.</p>

          <h2>Tiny Zooplankton Play a Major Role in Carbon Sequestration, New Research Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 19:10:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New scientific research reveals that tiny marine animals called zooplankton are 'unsung heroes' in the fight against climate change due to their significant role in carbon storage. These creatures, including copepods, gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the ocean's surface in Antarctica before migrating hundreds of meters deep to hibernate. During this deep-sea hibernation, they burn their fat reserves, effectively locking away vast amounts of carbon that would otherwise enter the atmosphere. The study quantifies this process, estimating it sequesters as much carbon annually as the emissions from 55 million cars, highlighting a crucial natural mechanism for mitigating global warming.</p>

          <p>This article details the story of Bishara Bahbah, a Palestinian-American economics professor who has become an important, unofficial backchannel negotiator between Hamas and the Trump administration. After becoming known for his pro-Trump advocacy within the Arab-American community, Bahbah was contacted by a senior Hamas official in April to help facilitate talks for a ceasefire and hostage release. Acting as a conduit, he relays messages between Hamas officials in Qatar and Cairo and President Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. Bahbah's involvement is credited with helping to build trust and secure the 'good faith' release of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander in May.</p>

          <p>A pair of male Humboldt penguins, named Scampi and Flounder, are successfully raising a chick at Chester Zoo in the United Kingdom. This marks a bumper breeding season for the vulnerable species at the zoo, with a total of ten chicks hatched. Zoo experts decided to share the parenting duties by placing one of two eggs laid by another penguin pair into Scampi and Flounder's nest to improve the chick's chances of survival. The article notes that same-sex penguin pairings are not uncommon, and the new parents are sharing feeding and care duties as expected. The zoo's colony plays a crucial role in the international breeding program for the at-risk species.</p>
