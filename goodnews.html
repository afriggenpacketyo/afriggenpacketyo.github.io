          <p>Best Buy has lowered its sales and profit projections for fiscal year 2026, citing increased costs due to tariffs on consumer electronics. The company has already raised prices on some items in mid-May as a last resort to offset these expenses, though the specific items affected were not disclosed for competitive reasons. CEO Corie Barry emphasized the company's need to remain adaptable amidst evolving global trade policies, especially after a federal trade court struck down many of Trump's tariffs. Best Buy is also focusing on improving customer experience, expanding its third-party marketplace, and driving efficiency to manage costs, with new product launches like the Nintendo Switch 2 expected to boost sales.

          <p>Experts are weighing the benefits of short-term versus long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) in June, considering factors such as the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies and market uncertainty. Short-term CDs currently offer more competitive annual percentage yields (APY) than longer-term options. While long-term CDs provide a fixed interest rate for an extended period, short-term CDs offer higher rates and earlier maturity dates, making them potentially more advantageous in the current economic climate. A CD ladder strategy, involving multiple CDs with varying maturity dates, can also be a useful approach in this environment. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a U.S. court blocked some of President Trump's tariffs, the administration is exploring various legal avenues to circumvent the ruling. Goldman Sachs economists suggest that Section 122 of U.S. trade law, Section 301 investigations, and Section 338 of the Trade Act of 1930 could be utilized. Section 122 could quickly replace the blocked tariffs, while Section 301 investigations and Section 232 tariffs could be broadened to other sectors. Legal experts also suggest the possibility of the Supreme Court ultimately deciding the issue, given the lack of precedent on the statute in question.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has directed the Trump administration to lift a pause on processing immigration benefit applications for immigrants admitted under Biden-era parole programs. Judge Indira Talwani found the government's actions arbitrary and capricious, impacting hundreds of thousands of immigrants from countries like Ukraine, Cuba, Haiti, and Afghanistan. The ruling prevents the administration from halting parole extension requests and processing applications for immigrant relatives of U.S. service members. A Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman stated that the law favors the Trump administration, which views the Biden parole policies as an abuse of authority.</p>

          <p>Stocks experienced an upswing following a federal court's decision to block some of President Trump's tariffs on China and other major U.S. trading partners. The ruling invalidated levies on numerous countries, including a 10% tariff on goods from nearly all countries. However, the Trump administration quickly appealed the decision, leaving the ultimate fate of the tariffs uncertain. The ruling centered on Trump's use of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, with the court asserting that the law does not explicitly permit tariffs.</p>

          <p>An Atlantic article argues that the U.S. Court of International Trade's decision to strike down most of President Trump's tariffs is a vindication of the rule of law. The court's ruling emphasizes that neither the Constitution nor any statute authorizes Trump to impose the tariffs he ordered. Critics' claims of judicial overreach are weak due to the Constitution's delegation of tariff power to Congress, the involvement of states in the lawsuit, and the court's specific jurisdiction over trade disputes. The article suggests that the administration's criticism of the judiciary indicates contempt for any check on presidential power.</p>

          <p>Kevin Hassett, a top economic advisor to President Trump, expressed confidence that court rulings throwing out aggressive tariffs will be overturned on appeal. Hassett stated that the administration's efforts to use tariffs to ensure fair trade are legal and will resume soon. He criticized the court ruling and said the administration will continue its anti-fentanyl efforts. While the administration has other options to circumvent the ruling, Hassett said that is not the current plan because they are confident the decision will be overturned.</p>
