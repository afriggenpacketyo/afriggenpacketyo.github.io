          <p>All 50 states, Washington, D.C., and four U.S. territories have agreed to a $7.4 billion settlement with Purdue Pharma and the Sackler families, resolving litigation over the opioid crisis. The settlement ends the Sacklers' ownership of Purdue and bars them from making, selling, or marketing opioids in the U.S. The funds will support opioid addiction treatment, prevention, and recovery programs over the next 15 years, with a significant amount distributed in the first three years. Connecticut Attorney General William Tong acknowledged the settlement is insufficient but momentous, marking the culmination of years of legal battles.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the high costs and risks associated with payday loans, explaining that a $1,000 loan can quickly escalate due to fees and high APRs. Payday lenders often charge a flat fee per $100 borrowed, which can result in an APR close to 400%. The article warns against rolling over loans, as it leads to accumulating more fees without reducing the principal. It advises exploring safer alternatives due to the potential for long-term financial consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Women's Super League (WSL) is expanding from 12 to 14 teams starting in the 2026-27 season. This change was presented at a shareholders' meeting by WSL Football, which assumed control of the top two tiers from the Football Association in August 2024. To achieve this expansion, the upcoming season will see changes to promotion and relegation, including automatic promotion for the WSL 2 champion and runners-up, and a play-off match. From 2026-27 onwards, there will be one automatic promotion spot for the winner of WSL 2, with the bottom team in the WSL relegated, and a play-off between the second-bottom team of the WSL and the runners-up in WSL 2.</p>
