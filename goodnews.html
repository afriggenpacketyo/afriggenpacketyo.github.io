          <p>Economist Marc Sumerlin, a reported candidate for Federal Reserve chair, has publicly confirmed his interest in the position and advocated for a substantial interest rate cut. The former George W. Bush administration economist argued that a 50-basis-point reduction would be a "no-brainer" given current labor market weakness and stable inflation. Sumerlin's stance on monetary policy aligns with President Trump's frequent calls for the Fed to lower rates. While stressing the importance of the central bank's independence, Sumerlin noted that his nomination would depend on being in alignment with the president's economic vision.

          <p>In her campaign for Virginia governor, Democrat Abigail Spanberger is reaching out to Latino voters with her first Spanish-language radio advertisement. The ad focuses on economic issues, with Spanberger pledging to lower costs for families, a key concern for this demographic. This move reflects a broader Democratic effort to regain support among Latino voters, who showed increased backing for Republicans in the 2024 election. The ad also criticizes her opponent, Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, for supporting Trump administration policies. The Virginia race is often seen as an early indicator of the national political mood following a presidential election.</p>

Fields explained that his focus has shifted over the last six months, leading him to disregard outside opinions and criticism by concentrating on a larger perspective guided by his relationship with God. He mentioned that he has become "low-key addicted" to reading the Bible daily, finding wisdom in it that he can apply to his everyday life. Fields encouraged others to explore the text, suggesting it has provided him with a sense of stability and purpose.</p>

The album will feature 12 tracks, including a collaboration with Sabrina Carpenter, and is described as more upbeat and pop-focused than her recent work. Swift explained that the project is a focused, high-quality collection of songs intended to be infectiously joyful and make listeners want to dance.</p>

          <p>Millions of AT&T customers affected by two separate data breaches in 2024 can now file claims as part of a proposed $177 million class-action settlement. The breaches exposed the personal information of 73 million account holders and the call and text records of nearly all cellular customers. Eligible individuals, who are being notified via email, can claim up to $7,500 for documented losses traceable to the incidents. The settlement requires final approval from a federal court, with a hearing scheduled for December 2025, meaning payments will not be issued until after that date at the earliest.</p>

          <p>Researchers at MIT have utilized generative artificial intelligence to invent two new potential antibiotics capable of killing drug-resistant superbugs like gonorrhoea and MRSA. The AI designed the molecular structures of the drugs from scratch, which then proved effective in laboratory and animal tests. This approach represents a significant advancement from previous methods where AI was used to screen existing chemicals. While the new compounds require years of further testing before they can be used in humans, scientists believe this technology could usher in a new era of antibiotic discovery to combat the growing global threat of antimicrobial resistance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This year's A-level results in the UK show a slight increase in top grades, with 28.3% of all grades being A* or A, and a record number of 18-year-olds securing their first-choice university spot. The cohort taking these exams was smaller but considered academically stronger due to stricter GCSE grading post-pandemic. A growing regional disparity was observed in England, with London students achieving significantly more top grades than those in the North East. For the first time since 2018, boys slightly outperformed girls in achieving the highest marks, partly driven by results in popular subjects like maths.</p>

          <p>Swiss pilot Raphael Domjan has reportedly broken the altitude record for a solar-powered electric plane, reaching 9,521 meters (31,237 feet) in a flight over Switzerland. The SolarStratos aircraft, made of lightweight carbon fiber with a wide wingspan covered in solar panels, completed the flight in just over five hours. The team described crossing paths with a commercial airliner as a powerful symbol for the future of decarbonized aviation. The flight data is being sent to the World Air Sports Federation for official validation, as Domjan aims to eventually fly the solar plane into the stratosphere to promote renewable energy.</p>

          <p>Residents in Fort Collins, Colorado, have spotted cottontail rabbits with bizarre, horn-like warts growing from their faces, leading to nicknames like "demon rabbits." However, wildlife officials have clarified that the animals are not dangerous and are infected with Shope papillomavirus, a relatively common and mostly harmless virus. The virus, which is spread by fleas and ticks, can cause tumors that sometimes resemble horns but does not affect humans or other animals. The condition typically resolves as the rabbit's immune system fights off the infection, and it is believed to be the origin of the jackalope myth in North American folklore.</p>

          <p>Rebecca Young, a 13-year-old pupil from Glasgow, has been recognized as one of Time magazine's 'girls of the year' for inventing a solar-powered heated blanket to help homeless people. Her design, which uses solar panels to charge a battery pack that provides warmth at night, won a national engineering competition and was developed into a working prototype by the firm Thales. Thirty-five of the blankets have been distributed by Homeless Project Scotland. As part of the honor, run in partnership with Lego, Rebecca was also featured as a Lego mini-figure on a digital cover of the magazine.</p>

          <p>A woman from Manhattan, New York, discovered a 2.30-carat diamond at Arkansas's Crater of Diamonds State Park, which she is now using for her engagement ring. Micherre Fox, 31, found the colorless gem on the final day of a month-long search at the park, which is the only public diamond mine in the world. Two years prior, she had decided she wanted to find her own diamond for a ring, viewing the hard work as symbolic of a successful marriage. The park confirmed her find was the third-largest diamond discovered there this year, out of 366 gems found by the public.</p>

          <p>Social Security beneficiaries may receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026, according to a new forecast from the Senior Citizens League. This projection is slightly higher than the 2.5% increase recipients saw in 2025. The annual adjustment is designed to help benefits keep pace with inflation and is officially announced by the Social Security Administration in the fall after reviewing inflation data from the third quarter. While inflation has remained relatively stable this year, some economists express concern that a modest COLA may not be sufficient if consumer prices rise later in the year due to tariffs.

          <p>Cisco reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that slightly surpassed analysts' expectations, along with an optimistic forecast for the upcoming fiscal year. The company's results were bolstered by strong demand for its networking equipment, particularly from companies building out artificial intelligence infrastructure, which generated $800 million in orders during the quarter. CEO Chuck Robbins noted that the total AI-related orders for the fiscal year exceeded $2 billion, doubling the company's initial goal. Despite operating in a complex economic environment, Cisco's performance indicates continued investment in AI and data center technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a departure from long-standing tradition, the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics will allow corporate sponsors' names on its venues. The agreement between the LA28 organizing committee and the International Olympic Committee breaks with the 'clean venue' policy that previously required stadiums like SoFi Stadium to be given generic names during the Games. This change is expected to generate significant additional revenue to help cover the event's $7.1 billion privately funded budget. Existing venues with naming rights, like the Crypto.com Arena, can retain their names if their sponsor signs on as a top-level Olympic partner, streamlining logistics and enhancing the fan experience.</p>
