          <h2>Study Suggests Vitamin D Could Slow Biological Aging</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that vitamin D supplements may help slow down biological aging. Researchers at Mass General Brigham and the Medical College of Georgia found that daily vitamin D3 intake could reduce biological wear and tear, equivalent to nearly three years of aging. The study tracked over 1,000 U.S. adults and measured telomere length in white blood cells, with those taking vitamin D3 showing significantly less telomere shortening compared to the placebo group. The research team emphasized that more work is needed to determine how vitamin D impacts aging in different populations and whether these effects endure over longer timeframes.</p>

          <h2>Apprenticeship Funding Shift Prioritizes Under-21s in England</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-26 19:50:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government in England is restructuring apprenticeship funding to focus on individuals under 21, with funding for level 7 apprenticeships (equivalent to a master's degree) limited to this age group. This shift aims to create 120,000 more training opportunities for young adults and those needing retraining. While the government promises more training for under-21s, critics argue that scrapping funding for postgraduate apprenticeships will harm public services, particularly the NHS, and restrict professional entry for those not attending university. Seven new foundation apprenticeships will also be introduced in sectors like health and social care, engineering, and construction.</p>

          <h2>King Charles's Canada Visit Seen as Subtle Rebuke to Trump</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>King Charles and Queen Camilla's visit to Canada is being interpreted as a symbolic assertion of Canadian sovereignty amid tensions with the United States. Prime Minister Mark Carney invited Charles to open Canada's Parliament, a move viewed as emphasizing Canada's distinct heritage at a time when President Trump has repeatedly suggested Canada become the 51st U.S. state. The visit, marked by traditional ceremonies, is intended to reinforce Canada's independent identity and political traditions.</p>

          <p>Physicists are studying the acoustics of rocket launches to understand and potentially mitigate the impact of noise on communities. With the increasing frequency of launches by companies like SpaceX, the noise from rockets and sonic booms is becoming a growing concern. Researchers are analyzing the unique three-part sonic boom generated by Falcon 9 boosters and preparing for the even louder Starship rocket. The goal is to gather data that could inform strategies to lessen disruptions before rocket noise becomes a pervasive problem.</p>
