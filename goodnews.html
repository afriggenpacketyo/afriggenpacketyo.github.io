          <p>Robert Harris, author of the novel Conclave, draws parallels between the process of selecting a new Pope and the dynamics of the TV show "The Traitors." The BBC reports that Harris believes the conclave, with its secretive and intense environment, shares similarities with the show's challenge of identifying "traitors" among the "faithful." He argues that the conclave is a "rather brilliant device" for finding the right leader and suggests that political parties could learn from this process. Harris also raises questions about the exclusion of women from the Catholic priesthood and papal elections.</p>

The party secured the most votes and seats, gaining control of numerous councils. The analysis reveals that Reform's success is concentrated among those who voted for Brexit in 2016 and for Boris Johnson in 2019. The party's appeal is stronger in working-class areas and places with fewer university graduates, indicating a distinctive demographic base.</p>

          <p>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used to help qualifying students pay for private school tuition, according to CBS News. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most students attending an accredited private school, up to $30,000 per year for students with disabilities, and $2,000 a year for home-schooled students. Democrats argue that the legislation hurts public schools and primarily benefits wealthier students already attending private schools.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen beat Lando Norris to pole at the Miami Grand Prix, according to the BBC. Verstappen said he improved the car a tiny amount, which helped him rotate it a bit better. It was a second piece of good news for the four-time champion this week, after the birth of his first child, a daughter called Lily. Antonelli's third place proved his pole in the sprint on Friday was not a flash in the pan.</p>
