          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining about 2%, in contrast to a decline in some major technology stocks. This market rotation is driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. Lower borrowing costs are particularly beneficial for smaller companies that rely on debt for financing operations and expansion. Despite the daily gain, small-cap stocks have lagged behind the broader market since the AI boom began in late 2022. (not investment advice)</p>

Stallone described Hogan as having a special "glow" and a consistently positive and self-deprecating demeanor on set. He highlighted Hogan's professionalism and concern for his co-star's safety during their wrestling scenes, noting that the wrestling legend would hurt himself to protect Stallone. Stallone recalled that Hogan, who played Thunderlips, was at the very beginning of his career and had not yet fully developed his famous persona.</p>

          <p>Walmart is expanding its 10% employee discount to include nearly all grocery items, such as milk and meat, effective immediately for its 1.6 million U.S. workers. Previously, the discount on most food items was limited to the holiday season. The move comes as rising tariffs and inflation are expected to increase consumer prices, a concern Walmart's own CFO has acknowledged. By enhancing this benefit, the company aims to support its employees' financial well-being, while also potentially boosting its own sales and improving worker retention.</p>

          <p>The Habit Burger & Grill is continuing its marketing rivalry with In-N-Out by updating a billboard near LAX to mock its competitor's drop in a national fast-food ranking. After ranking first in a USA Today poll where In-N-Out placed fourth, Habit altered the sign to cross out "#2" and replace it with "#4." The campaign also takes a jab at In-N-Out's recent decision to move its headquarters and leadership to Tennessee from its long-time California base. Habit's CMO emphasized that his company remains "proudly Californian" and is not relocating.</p>

          <p>A recent report from Intercontinental Exchange reveals that U.S. homeowners' equity has reached a new record, with approximately 48 million mortgage holders possessing tappable equity. The average homeowner holds around $213,000 in accessible value, contributing to a total of $11.6 trillion in usable equity nationwide. The article explains that homeowners can calculate their equity by subtracting their mortgage balance from their home's current market value. While options like home equity loans and HELOCs make this value accessible, borrowers are reminded that these are loans secured by their property. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For savers with a large sum like $50,000, high-yield savings and money market accounts offer competitive interest rates without the volatility of stocks or the withdrawal restrictions of CDs. This article calculates the potential earnings for each, showing that at current top rates, a money market account would earn slightly more than a high-yield savings account over a year—$2,200 versus $2,175. While the difference is minimal, both options provide flexibility and significantly higher returns than traditional savings accounts, making them viable choices for risk-averse savers.

          <p>According to Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman, succeeding in the age of artificial intelligence will depend more on soft skills than technical expertise. He advises that the single most important skill to cultivate is critical thinking, a piece of guidance he has given his own teenage child. Garman argues that as AI handles more routine tasks, human value will lie in creativity, adaptability, and the ability to make nuanced judgments. He also emphasized the continued importance of communication and other "people skills," which remain areas where humans outperform AI.</p>

          <p>A recently passed budget bill has expanded the flexibility of 529 savings plans, which allow for tax-deferred and tax-exempt growth when used for qualified educational expenses. The definition of "qualified" has been broadened to include costs for vocational programs like welding and cosmetology, required continuing education courses, and expenses for professional licensing exams. This change addresses a common concern among parents that their child might not pursue a traditional college degree. The increased versatility makes the 529 plan an even more powerful tool for funding a wider range of career and educational paths. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a new estimate from The Senior Citizens League, Social Security beneficiaries may receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026. This projection, based on the latest inflation data, is slightly higher than the 2.5% increase recipients saw in 2025. The Social Security Administration determines the official COLA each fall using inflation figures from the third quarter to ensure benefits keep pace with rising prices. Some economists express concern that even with the adjustment, the increase may not be sufficient to cover anticipated inflation rates driven by factors like new tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
