          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has unveiled a plan to address the state's homelessness crisis, urging cities and counties to take immediate action. The plan includes a model ordinance for local governments to address encampments and connect individuals experiencing homelessness with shelter and services, backed by $3.3 billion in Proposition 1 funding. Newsom emphasized the need for urgency and humanity in resolving encampments, citing the success of previous state efforts that cleared over 16,000 encampments. The governor is also encouraging local leaders to use their authority to enforce policies that protect public health and safety while respecting the rights of those experiencing homelessness.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has endorsed Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican candidate for governor of New Jersey, solidifying Ciattarelli's position in the upcoming primary. Trump praised Ciattarelli as an "America First Candidate" and stated that he would work closely with a Trump administration. Ciattarelli, who narrowly lost to the Democratic governor in 2021, expressed his gratitude for the endorsement. However, the endorsement could be a liability in the general election, as New Jersey traditionally leans left and Trump is seen as a polarizing figure in the state.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's attempt to remove three board members from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) sought to review CPB's operations. CPB leaders rejected this request, citing federal law establishing the organization's independence from government control. The Trump administration argues that the president has the power to remove personnel exercising executive authority. CPB is challenging Trump's efforts in court, arguing that it would lack a quorum to conduct business if the board member firings were upheld, potentially affecting legislative communications, litigation, and grant approvals.</p>

          <p>Edan Alexander, a US-Israeli hostage, has been released by Hamas after being held captive in Gaza for 19 months, reuniting with his family in Israel. Israel paused military operations in Gaza to facilitate the transfer, which Hamas described as a goodwill gesture aimed at advancing ceasefire negotiations ahead of President Trump's visit to the Middle East. Alexander is believed to be the last living US citizen held by Hamas. Netanyahu credited military and political pressure from Trump for the release, while affirming Israel's intent to continue military actions in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to reduce tariffs on Chinese products after trade talks in Geneva, signaling a potential easing of trade tensions between the two countries. The agreement will lower tariffs on Chinese imports to a minimum of 30 percent, down from 145 percent, while China will reduce its import duty on American goods to 10 percent from 125 percent. The two countries have also committed to future talks aimed at stabilizing their economic relationship. While the decision offers a temporary reprieve for businesses, questions remain about whether the trade disruptions were worth the limited concessions from China.</p>

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that a new software update prevented a radar outage at Newark airport after a telecommunications line failed, marking the third such incident in two weeks. Duffy attributed the recent problems to the Biden administration's handling of the air traffic control facility in Philadelphia. He also said the FAA should have set up a new radar system for Newark in Philadelphia instead of piping the signal in from New York for controllers. Duffy laid out an extensive plan to replace the nation's outdated air traffic control system, including installing 4,600 new high-speed data connections and replacing 618 radars.</p>

While the U.S. continues to grapple with a substantial budget deficit, the influx of tariff revenue helped to increase the surplus for April.
