          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 23:00:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba Cloud has introduced Aegaeon, a novel computing pooling solution that significantly reduces Nvidia GPU utilization for its artificial intelligence models. During beta testing in Alibaba Cloud’s model marketplace, the system decreased the number of Nvidia H20 GPUs needed to serve dozens of models up to 72 billion parameters from 1,192 to just 213. This innovation directly addresses the prevalent issue of resource inefficiency, where many AI models are only sporadically accessed, leading to substantial underutilization of expensive GPU power. Researchers from Peking University and Alibaba Cloud presented this work, highlighting its potential to dramatically cut operational costs for concurrent large language model workloads.</p>

          <p>A popular Chinese spy drama, "Silent Honour," has triggered a significant public reaction, inspiring an outpouring of praise for real-life agents and a "sudden surge" of visitors to the tomb of Wu Shi. Wu, an underground Communist Party member who served as a KMT lieutenant general in Taiwan in 1949, is now being honored with hundreds of flowers and thank-you notes, even outside the traditional Ching Ming festival. This cultural phenomenon demonstrates how popular media can profoundly shape national sentiment and historical memory, fostering appreciation for figures like Wu, whom many now regard as an "unsung hero."</p>

          <p>Eugenio Suárez's dramatic eighth-inning grand slam was the decisive blow, leading the Seattle Mariners to a 6-2 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays and positioning them one win away from their inaugural World Series appearance. The game saw Cal Raleigh initiate the eighth-inning rally with a leadoff home run, tying the score at 2-2, before Suárez's powerful opposite-field blast secured a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven American League Championship Series. This pivotal win puts the Mariners in control, with a chance to clinch the series in Game 6 on Sunday in Toronto, reflecting a significant shift in momentum.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hong Kong is strategically enhancing its financial ecosystem to solidify its role as a premier offshore yuan trading hub, aiming to streamline and reduce the cost of borrowing the Chinese currency. Regulators in Hong Kong and mainland China have introduced a suite of measures, including the upcoming expansion of a scheme in December. This expansion will allow direct investments for mainland firms to secure yuan loans for overseas investments and for foreign firms to obtain yuan funding for mainland expansion. These initiatives are crucial for attracting more international investors and companies, especially given that Hong Kong dollar interest rates are currently more than double those of mainland yuan loan rates, thus bolstering the yuan's internationalization.

          <h2>President Trump Imposes Tariffs on Imported Trucks and Buses to Boost Domestic Manufacturing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 20:40:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has enacted a proclamation imposing significant tariffs: 25% on imported medium- and heavy-duty trucks and their components, and 10% on all imported buses. This measure is designed to shield U.S. companies from foreign competition and vigorously promote domestic manufacturing within the automotive sector. To further incentivize local production, the Trump administration will provide credits to manufacturers who import some parts but assemble their vehicles in the United States, thereby offsetting tariff liabilities. This policy reinforces the administration's strategic objective of strengthening American industry, supporting domestic labor, and enhancing the cost competitiveness of U.S.-based automakers.

          <p>This article delves into the legacy of Liu Huaqing, the former commander of the Chinese navy, who is celebrated as a visionary strategist and technocrat for his instrumental role in modernizing China’s naval forces to world-class capabilities. Frequently likened to the influential 19th-century American naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan, Liu's career began with him joining the Red Army at age 13 and participating in the Long March. Despite never having seen the sea until his transfer to the newly established PLA Navy in 1952, he became a key architect of China's "blue sea strategy" and championed the development of its aircraft carrier program.</p>

          <p>The annual Orionid meteor shower is anticipated to reach its peak around October 22, promising a captivating celestial display of bright, fast-moving meteors visible until November 7, primarily between midnight and dawn. These meteors, originating from the debris left by Halley's Comet as Earth passes through its trail, burn up in our atmosphere, producing distinctive streaks of light. To best observe this phenomenon, the article recommends finding a dark location away from city lights with an unobstructed view, looking towards the constellation Orion, which ascends in the east after midnight. Stargazers can expect approximately 15 meteors per hour during the peak, offering a prime opportunity for observation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's traditional Diwali gold rush is notably different this year, primarily influenced by soaring gold prices that have exceeded $1,440 per 10 grams. While this has slightly impacted jewelry demand, a "fear of missing out" (FOMO) among consumers, coupled with a growing preference for lighter yet elaborately designed pieces, continues to drive market activity. This article underscores a significant shift towards purchasing gold and silver for investment purposes rather than purely for adornment, a trend corroborated by bullion market data indicating a substantial increase in investment demand. India's central bank is also a key player, actively acquiring gold to diversify its foreign exchange reserves. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is experiencing a remarkable reversal in its fentanyl overdose crisis, with fatal overdoses decreasing by about 25% in 2024, which translates to nearly 30,000 lives saved. This article highlights several key factors contributing to this positive trend, including a robust commitment to harm reduction strategies. Programs like Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) are effectively steering individuals with substance use disorders towards recovery and support services rather than criminalization. Furthermore, the widespread adoption of medication-assisted treatment (MAT) using methadone and buprenorphine, alongside the increased availability of the overdose-reversing drug naloxone, have proven instrumental in mitigating the epidemic's impact.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has delivered a rare public reprimand to City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto, instructing her to retract her request to overturn a federal judge's order that bars the LAPD from using crowd control weapons against journalists. This directive was issued just before "No Kings" anti-Trump demonstrations, and in the context of numerous legal claims accusing LAPD officers of excessive force against both protesters and journalists. The council's unanimous decision reflects increasing dissatisfaction with the city attorney's legal approach, which some council members believe compromises protections for media and peaceful demonstrators. Feldstein Soto's legal team subsequently complied, withdrawing their request.</p>
