        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party has been elected president of South Korea in a snap election following the impeachment of former leader Yoon Suk Yeol. Kim Moon-soo, Lee's conservative rival, conceded the race, and Lee pledged to reinvigorate the economy and unite the country. Voter turnout was an impressive 77.8%, the highest ever seen in a Korean election, reflecting the public's desire for change after Yoon's controversial imposition of martial law. Lee's victory marks the Democratic Party's return to control of both the executive branch and the parliament, presenting new opportunities and challenges for South Korea's domestic and foreign policies.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Bureau of Prisons must continue providing hormone therapy and social accommodations to transgender inmates while they challenge President Trump's executive order restricting access to such treatments. The judge granted a preliminary injunction sought by three transgender inmates, citing the Administrative Procedure Act. The ruling blocks administration officials from enforcing the executive order regarding hormone therapy and social accommodations for transgender individuals in the Bureau of Prisons' custody. The case is one of several brought by transgender inmates in response to Mr. Trump's executive actions.</p>

          <p>A $400,000 annuity can provide a substantial guaranteed income stream during retirement, offering financial consistency and protection against longevity risk. The monthly payments can vary based on age, gender, and the type of annuity chosen, with potential payouts ranging from approximately $2,300 to $4,000 per month. While annuities offer predictable income and freedom from market volatility, they also come with trade-offs, including limited flexibility and potential tax implications. It is important to weigh the advantages and disadvantages and consider working with an expert to determine if an annuity is the right fit for a retirement plan (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Lee Jae-myung has secured a decisive victory in the South Korean presidential election following a period of political chaos triggered by his predecessor's failed martial law bid. The snap election comes just three years after Lee narrowly lost his last presidential bid to Yoon. Lee's victory signals a rejection of the ruling People Power Party (PPP), which was tarnished by Yoon's actions. As president, Lee faces the challenge of uniting a polarized country and negotiating trade deals with the US to mitigate the impact of tariffs.</p>
