          <p>Eli Lilly announced its daily weight loss pill, orforglipron, successfully met its primary goal in a late-stage trial for patients with obesity and Type 2 diabetes, paving the way for global approval. The oral GLP-1 treatment helped patients lose an average of 10.5% of their body weight over 72 weeks and significantly lowered blood sugar levels, with most no longer meeting Type 2 diabetes criteria. While existing injections offer greater weight loss, this needle-free option, which requires no dietary restrictions, could expand access and convenience for millions. The company anticipates a global launch around next year, despite some patients discontinuing due to gastrointestinal side effects.</p>

          <p>This article compares the interest-earning potential of a $100,000 certificate of deposit (CD) versus a high-yield savings account, offering insights for savers seeking to grow their money safely. While CDs provide fixed interest rates and predictable returns over a set term, high-yield savings accounts feature variable rates that can fluctuate with market conditions. The analysis shows that depending on the term length, either option could yield slightly more interest, but CDs offer guaranteed earnings, appealing to those who prioritize stability over potential rate changes. Savers are advised to carefully calculate potential earnings and consider their liquidity needs before committing to a choice (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>An Italian masterpiece, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Ghislandi, stolen by Nazis from a Jewish art dealer 80 years ago, has been located in an Argentine estate agent advertisement. The painting was photographed hanging in a house near Buenos Aires once owned by a senior Nazi official who fled to South America after World War II. The artwork, part of over 1,100 pieces looted from dealer Jacques Goudstikker, was traced when the official's daughter put the property up for sale. Lawyers for Goudstikker's estate are now working to reclaim the painting, highlighting ongoing efforts to recover art plundered during the Holocaust.</p>

          <p>A Utah judge has ordered the state legislature to redraw its congressional map, ruling that the 2021 lines violated "mandatory redistricting standards and requirements" and a citizen initiative against partisan gerrymandering. This decision could open up a winnable seat for Democrats in the heavily Republican state, where all four congressional seats are currently held by Republicans. The ruling comes amid broader mid-decade redistricting battles across the US, with both Republican and Democratic parties seeking to gain advantages in their respective states. The Utah legislature has 30 days to enact a remedial map, potentially reshaping the state's political landscape.</p>

          <p>With US credit card debt exceeding $1.21 trillion, many Americans seek ways to consolidate high-interest balances without harming their credit scores. This article outlines several credit-safe strategies, including debt management programs through credit counseling agencies, which can lower interest rates and simplify payments. Using a personal loan to pay off credit cards is another option, potentially improving credit mix and utilization if a lower interest rate is secured. Balance transfers to 0% APR cards and leveraging home equity loans or HELOCs are also discussed, with strong caveats about responsible use. The core advice emphasizes addressing underlying spending habits for lasting financial health.</p>

          <p>A Frankfurt court has ruled that Apple cannot market its Apple Watch as "CO2-neutral" in Germany, finding the tech giant misled consumers. The court sided with environmental group Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH), stating that Apple's claims, which relied on a Paraguay reforestation project to offset emissions, lacked sufficient long-term guarantees for the project's continuation. The ruling, which Apple can appeal, highlights growing scrutiny over corporate greenwashing and emphasizes the need for robust, verifiable environmental claims. DUH welcomed the verdict as a victory against misleading ecological advertising practices.</p>

          <p>Despite the S&P 500 index's strong performance in 2025, investment experts are cautioning against a concentrated strategy due to the market's narrow growth, heavily reliant on a few technology giants. The "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks accounted for 26% of the S&P 500's earnings growth, with the top 10 holdings representing approximately 40% of the index. Advisors recommend diversifying into other sectors, international markets, and smaller-cap stocks, or considering equal-weight indices, to mitigate risks associated with this concentration. The article highlights that while long-term index investing remains valid, frequent account checking makes a "set-it-and-forget-it" approach challenging for most investors (not investment advice).</p>
