        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese exports saw a 4.2% year-on-year increase in September, breaking a four-month decline, primarily fueled by robust growth in shipments to Asia. Despite this overall rebound, exports to the U.S., Japan's second-largest trading partner, continued to fall by 13.3%, even after a trade deal aimed at reducing tariffs. The nation's economy has demonstrated unexpected resilience, and the new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's commitment to loose monetary policy and fiscal stimulus is anticipated to further weaken the yen, thereby enhancing the competitiveness of Japanese goods and benefiting exporters. This article underscores the complex dynamics of Japan's trade balance and the forward-looking economic strategies under its new leadership.</p>

          <h2>Experts Debunk Common Haircare Myths, Emphasizing Scalp Health</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 20:34:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Leading trichologists have debunked four pervasive haircare myths, offering clarity on effective hair maintenance practices. They confirm that cold water provides no additional shine, and damaged hair, such as split ends, cannot be repaired by products, necessitating a haircut. Furthermore, experts assert that hair does not "self-clean," emphasizing the critical need for regular washing to prevent oil and debris buildup that can worsen scalp conditions. Lastly, dry shampoo is advised for only single-day use between washes, as overuse without washing can lead to an itchy and flaky scalp. The article advocates for a focus on proper scalp health, akin to facial skincare, over relying on temporary fixes or misleading product claims.</p>
