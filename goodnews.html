          <p>At its recent party conference, Reform UK made a concerted effort to showcase a wider range of political figures beyond its well-known leader, Nigel Farage. The party aims to dispel the perception that it is a "one-man-band" by promoting new defectors and local leaders who could become future candidates. This strategy is part of a broader ambition to significantly increase its number of elected officials across the country, though it faces the challenge of properly vetting thousands of new candidates to avoid past scandals.</p>

          <p>A former British Army officer who served in Iraq has co-founded a support group called Sisters in Service to help female military veterans who now work in healthcare. The organization aims to combat the isolation and lack of understanding many women face after leaving the armed forces, as public perception often overlooks their front-line roles. The group provides a community for members to connect over shared experiences, offering a vital network that can be difficult to find in traditional veterans' spaces.</p>

          <p>Texas A&M defensive lineman Cashius Howell accomplished a historic feat in college football during his team's victory over Utah State. In the second quarter, Howell sacked the opposing quarterback on three consecutive plays, single-handedly forcing a punt. This rare achievement was the first time a player has recorded sacks on three straight plays in a college game since 2015. Howell's dominant performance was a key factor in the No. 19 Aggies' comfortable 20-point win.</p>

          <p>With Dame Anna Wintour transitioning from editor-in-chief of US Vogue to a global editorial director role, the iconic fashion magazine faces a critical moment. Her successor, Chloe Malle, must navigate a media landscape where the influence of print magazines has been diminished by social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Wintour's tenure was defined by her ability to merge fashion with pop culture and politics, but the magazine's future relevance will depend on its new leadership's ability to adapt and innovate.</p>

During his visit, Prince Harry will announce a significant donation to Children in Need. The trip has also fueled speculation about a possible reconciliation meeting with his father, King Charles, who will be in the UK during the same period.</p>

          <p>The European Union is set to introduce its new digital Entry/Exit System (EES) this autumn, which will replace manual passport stamping for non-EU citizens entering the 29-country Schengen Area. Travelers from countries like the UK will need to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial photo, on their first entry. While the system aims to enhance security and streamline travel in the long run, there are concerns that the initial registration process could cause significant delays at major border crossings like Dover and Eurostar terminals.</p>

          <p>Despite a surprisingly shaky first half, England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, secured a dominant 47-7 victory over Australia to advance to the World Cup quarter-finals. Australia initially unsettled the hosts, taking an early lead and disrupting England's usually formidable driving maul. However, England's superior depth and defense took control in the second half, shutting out the Wallaroos completely and extending their winning streak to 30 consecutive matches as they head into the knockout stage.</p>

          <p>England defeated Andorra 2-0 in a World Cup qualifier, maintaining their strong position atop their group but delivering a performance that was widely seen as lackluster and uninspired. Despite dominating possession, Thomas Tuchel's side struggled to create clear chances against the 174th-ranked team, relying on an own goal and a second-half header from Declan Rice. The unconvincing display has raised concerns about the team's progress under the new manager ahead of a more challenging match against Serbia.</p>

His time of 1:18.792 surpassed the previous record set by Lewis Hamilton in 2020. The new record was made possible by a combination of factors, including the lower drag of the current generation of F1 cars and a recently resurfaced, higher-grip track at the Monza circuit.</p>
