          <p>A Chinese national, Haoxiang Gao, who was a student at the University of Michigan, has fled the United States after being charged with illegal voting in the 2024 general election. Gao allegedly admitted to registering and casting a vote despite being a non-citizen. After being ordered to surrender his passport, Gao reportedly used another passport to board a flight to Shanghai, China. The FBI has charged him with flight to avoid prosecution, though the U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with China. The case is among a small number of instances of non-citizens voting in federal elections. </p>

          <p>The New York Yankees defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers, preventing a series sweep after a shaky start from Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto. Yamamoto struggled with his command, allowing multiple runs early in the game. The Dodgers' offense, missing Mookie Betts due to injury, couldn't capitalize, and Ryan Yarbrough, a former Dodger, pitched effectively for the Yankees. Despite late home runs from Pages and Muncy, the Dodgers couldn't overcome the early deficit, inviting more scrutiny over their inconsistent start to the season. The Yankees' victory highlighted the Dodgers' ongoing struggles with consistency. </p>
