          <p>The UK Parliament is debating a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to seek assistance in ending their lives, with MPs considering amendments such as protecting healthcare workers' right to opt out of participating. Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP sponsoring the bill, emphasizes the importance of choice and compassion for those facing difficult end-of-life circumstances, while opponents raise concerns about potential pressure on vulnerable individuals. The debate has been emotionally charged, highlighting the complexities and differing perspectives surrounding assisted dying, and the bill is set for further debate and voting on June 13. The government remains neutral, allowing MPs to vote according to their conscience on this divisive issue.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that his administration will soon inform other nations of the tariff rates the U.S. will impose on imports, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick sending the letters. This move follows recent negotiations with major trading partners regarding tariffs set in April, which U.S. companies like Walmart and Target pay, potentially leading to higher prices for American consumers. While Trump aims to incentivize domestic manufacturing, trade experts remain skeptical that tariffs alone will spark a major revival in U.S. manufacturing, citing other factors like labor and energy costs as more critical determinants.</p>

          <p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, is facing increasing scrutiny and legal action in Africa regarding its data privacy practices and content moderation. Nigerian authorities have issued substantial fines against Meta for regulatory breaches, including discriminatory practices and unauthorized data sharing, which Meta is appealing. Additionally, a lawsuit is being prepared against Majorel, a Meta contractor, over the psychological impact of content moderation work on its employees in Ghana, sparking calls for stronger regulatory frameworks for tech platforms in Africa. These legal challenges could set precedents for data protection and digital sovereignty across the continent, as African countries seek to hold global tech giants accountable.</p>

She defends PBS against accusations of bias, noting that the network strives to present multiple viewpoints and that a significant portion of its programming is dedicated to children's education.

          <p>Richemont, the owner of Cartier, saw its shares jump after reporting better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales, driven by strong performance in its Jewellery Maisons division, which includes Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels. While the specialist watchmakers segment experienced a decline in sales, overall revenues rose 7% year-on-year, indicating that the wealthiest consumers are continuing to spend on luxury goods despite global economic uncertainties. The company's chairman noted that ongoing global uncertainties would continue to require "strong agility and discipline," and analysts suggest that Richemont's pricing power could help offset headwinds from gold prices, U.S. tariffs, and foreign exchange fluctuations.</p>

          <p>The article explores the science of consciousness through the story of Ian Berg, who suffered a severe brain injury in 1986 and was initially diagnosed as being in a vegetative state. Over time, his family noticed signs of awareness, and later research revealed that a significant percentage of unresponsive brain-injury patients show signs of awareness.
