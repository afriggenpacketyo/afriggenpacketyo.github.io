          <p>President Trump has consistently stated his opposition to Medicaid cuts, even as House Republicans propose a bill that would significantly reduce funding for the program. The bill aims to cut hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade by imposing work requirements, increasing eligibility checks, and penalizing states offering Medicaid to illegal immigrants. Despite Trump's assurances, the proposed cuts have faced criticism from Democrats and some Republicans, who argue they contradict his promises and would leave millions uninsured. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 8.6 million more Americans will become uninsured under the proposal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 2.3% in April, slightly less than economists anticipated, signaling that inflation remains above the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. Housing costs were a major factor, with energy costs also increasing despite lower gasoline prices. Economists are closely monitoring the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on consumer prices, though the effect may not be immediately apparent in economic data. Due to a tentative trade agreement between China and the U.S., some experts have lowered their year-end CPI forecasts, suggesting the Fed may cut rates twice in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

As president, he legalized gay marriage and abortion, and oversaw a decrease in unemployment, poverty, and infant mortality. He also controversially deregulated cannabis for recreational purposes. Mujica remained true to himself even in office, often appearing at meetings in casual attire, and was seen as above suspicion of corruption.</p>

          <p>The 78th Cannes Film Festival has commenced in the French Riviera, implementing a stricter dress code that prohibits nudity and voluminous outfits. The festival also coincides with President Trump's proposal to impose a 100% tariff on films made outside the U.S., raising concerns about the global film and TV industry. During the opening ceremony, Robert De Niro accepted the prestigious Palme d'Or award and criticized Trump, while a small group of freelance workers protested outside the event, advocating for better working conditions.</p>
