          <p>Bulgaria has received the green light from the European Commission and the European Central Bank to join the euro zone, potentially becoming the 21st member state to adopt the single currency. The assessment indicates that Bulgaria meets the necessary requirements, including price stability, government deficit and debt ratio limitations, and exchange rate stability. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has congratulated Bulgaria, emphasizing the benefits of increased investment, trade, stability, and prosperity for the Bulgarian people. The final decision rests with the Council of the EU, and there are mixed attitudes within Bulgaria regarding euro adoption.</p>

          <p>Three former Salvadoran military officers have been convicted for the 1982 killings of four Dutch TV journalists during El Salvador's civil war and received 15-year prison sentences. The journalists were ambushed by soldiers while reporting behind rebel lines. The judge also condemned the government for the delayed justice and ordered President Nayib Bukele to issue a public apology to the victims. The prosecution was reopened in 2018 after the Supreme Court declared a general amnesty unconstitutional, marking a significant step in the fight against impunity.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced a ¬£15 billion investment in transport infrastructure projects across England, benefiting mayoral authorities in the Midlands, the North, and the West Country. The funding will support tram, train, and bus projects, with significant allocations for Greater Manchester, the West Midlands, and West Yorkshire. The move marks a shift away from the Treasury's Green Book rules, which have been criticized for favoring London and the south-east. The investment aims to address regional disparities and boost growth in areas facing electoral challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced that changes to the winter fuel payment, aimed at increasing eligibility, will be implemented this year. This decision marks a U-turn on one of Labour's initial policies after winning power, which had restricted the payment to those on pension credit only. The original policy led to criticism and a poor showing in local elections, as it excluded millions of pensioners. While the exact details of the changes remain unclear, the government has stated that more people will qualify for the allowance this winter.</p>

          <h2>Experts Explain Why On-Time Debt Payments Aren't Enough to Improve Credit Score</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While paying bills on time is crucial for credit scores, experts emphasize it's not the only factor. Not all debt payments are factored into credit scores, such as rent-to-own, private school tuition, and some BNPL loans. Your credit score is influenced by various factors, including payment history, credit utilization, length of credit history, credit mix, and new credit applications. Monitoring your credit report can help you understand which payments are influencing your score and ensure accuracy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new paper proposes an alternative to the Big Bang theory, suggesting that our universe emerged from a gravitational collapse inside a black hole. The research indicates that the Big Bang was not the start of everything but the outcome of a bounce inside a massive black hole. This model, grounded in known physics, offers a different perspective on cosmic origins, addressing unanswered questions in the standard cosmological model. The black hole universe model makes testable predictions, including a small positive spatial curvature, and could shed light on mysteries such as the origin of supermassive black holes and the nature of dark matter.</p>
