          <h2>Federal Court Rejects Trump's Reciprocal Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 21:46:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority by implementing reciprocal tariffs without congressional approval. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to unilaterally impose sweeping duties. The ruling, which caused Dow futures to jump 500 points, has been swiftly appealed by the Trump administration, which claims the tariffs are necessary to address a national economic emergency caused by foreign countries' nonreciprocal trade practices. Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, a lead plaintiff in the case, hailed the ruling as a victory for working families and small businesses, arguing that the tariffs inflated prices and burdened Americans.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Golden eagles are beginning to venture back into England from southern Scotland, raising hopes that they may nest in the area. The resurgence is attributed to the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project (SSGEP), which has translocated juveniles and sub-adults from the Scottish Highlands since 2018. Satellite tagging confirms that some eagles are exploring Northumberland and other areas, marking a potentially significant milestone. Golden eagles were wiped out in England and Wales by the mid-19th century due to persecution, and the project aims to reestablish a population in the region, with conservationists expressing hope that the birds will settle in areas like the Lake District and Northumberland Uplands.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal court has blocked President Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that he overstepped his authority.

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has ordered the Trump administration to lift a pause on various immigration applications, stating that it is not in the public interest for hundreds of thousands of immigrants to lose their legal status in the U.S. The ruling affects immigrants from Afghanistan, Latin America, Ukraine, and other regions whose ability to remain and work in the U.S. had been threatened. The judge found that the government's actions were arbitrary and capricious, violating federal administrative law. The programs at the center of the order rely on a legal immigration authority known as parole.</p>
