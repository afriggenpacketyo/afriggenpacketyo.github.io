          <p>Cambodia's government has announced it will nominate Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing his role in brokering a ceasefire to the country's border conflict with Thailand. Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol credited Trump's efforts, which included threatening trade consequences, for ending the deadliest clashes between the two nations in over a decade. The conflict had resulted in at least 43 deaths and displaced over 300,000 people. This follows previous Nobel nominations for Trump from Israel and Pakistan for his diplomatic interventions.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking study led by Chinese scientists has traced the evolutionary history of the potato back to an ancient hybridization event. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, researchers discovered that about nine million years ago, a forerunner of the tomato crossbred with a tuberless, potato-like plant. This hybridization was a key driver in the development of tubers, the edible part of the potato that has made it a global food staple. The findings, published in the journal Cell, shed new light on the origins of this crucial crop.</p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's "roving patrols" for immigration enforcement in Southern California. The court affirmed that reasonable suspicion for a stop cannot be based solely on factors like race, language, or location. The ruling supports a lower court's finding that there was significant evidence of constitutional violations. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass praised the decision, expressing hope that it would alleviate the fear within immigrant communities affected by the aggressive tactics.</p>

          <p>A truck carrying a large quantity of hot dogs spilled its contents across a major highway in Shrewsbury, Pennsylvania, causing significant traffic disruption during the Friday morning commute. A mechanical issue caused the truck's trailer to be ripped open against a concrete divider, scattering the sausages across the road. Emergency crews, including the local fire company, were dispatched for the clean-up. The fire chief noted the unexpected slipperiness of the hot dogs on the pavement, which complicated the removal efforts.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the Journal of Climate suggests a connection between decadal solar cycle activity and a pattern of increased summer rainfall in northern China. Researchers found that changes in the sun's magnetic cycle influence the positioning of the monsoon rain belt over the country. This phenomenon contributes to a "south drought and north flooding" pattern observed in recent years. The findings could be crucial for improving long-term climate predictions and flood season preparedness in the region.</p>

          <p>Lifeguards in Seal Beach, California, are warning of a significant seasonal rise in stingray-related injuries, with daily incidents jumping from an average of one to as many as 15. Officials attribute the increase to calm, warm waters drawing the stingrays closer to shore, combined with hot weather bringing more people to the beach. A specific area near the San Gabriel River, known as "ray bay," is a particular hotspot. To avoid being stung, beachgoers are advised to shuffle their feet in the sand to alert the camouflaged fish of their presence.</p>
