          <p>David Hogg has stepped down from his position as a Democratic National Committee (DNC) vice chair due to a "fundamental disagreement" regarding the role of the vice chair within the party. Hogg, who rose to prominence as an activist after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, intends to focus on his PAC, Leaders We Deserve, which aims to support aligned candidates in Democratic primaries. DNC Chair Ken Martin acknowledged Hogg's activism and respected his decision, though tensions had been escalating between Hogg and senior DNC leaders, including Martin himself, over the direction of the party. The DNC will proceed with the election re-do without Hogg on the ticket, allowing the party to focus on other priorities. The young activist feels that he can better serve the party by focusing on his organization rather than staying in the DNC role. The role is now free for other candidates to compete for.
