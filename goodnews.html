          <p>The UK government plans to purchase 12 new F-35 A fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear bombs to participate in NATO's airborne nuclear mission. These jets can also carry conventional weapons and will be based at RAF Marham in Norfolk, marking a significant strengthening of the UK's nuclear capabilities. The use of nuclear weapons would require authorization from NATO's nuclear planning group, the US president, and the British prime minister. This move has been lauded by Prime Minister Starmer as an investment in national security during an era of radical uncertainty, with the aim of supporting businesses and jobs across the country.</p>

Powell acknowledged the baby at the end of Pettersen's questioning, and Pettersen's communications director noted that she is on the waitlist for childcare, like many Americans, so she is finding ways to make it work.</p>

Bayern Munich, having already secured their place in the next round, fielded a rotated lineup and struggled to find urgency, though they improved after halftime.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to release documents, photos, and internal reports detailing the military's activities in Southern California, granting a procedural victory to the state in its effort to limit the deployment of troops. The ruling authorizes California lawyers to depose key administration officials regarding the duration of troop deployment under federal control. This decision follows a previous appellate court ruling that deferred to the president's authority to federalize the National Guard. The case revolves around California's claim that troops aiding immigration raids violate the Posse Comitatus Act.</p>

          <p>Anthropic, an artificial intelligence company, has won a legal victory in a copyright case, with a judge ruling that using legally purchased books to train its AI model, Claude, does not violate U.S. copyright law. The court deemed this use "quintessentially transformative" and protected under the "fair use" doctrine. However, Anthropic will face a separate trial in December regarding the downloading of millions of pirated books, which the court found may have broken the law. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by authors who claimed Anthropic's practices amounted to "large-scale theft."</p>
