        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Governors Tim Walz of Minnesota and Wes Moore of Maryland called for a more forceful Democratic party at Jim Clyburn's annual Fish Fry in South Carolina. Both governors emphasized the importance of building coalitions and engaging with diverse constituencies to win back lost American voters. Walz urged Democrats to compete in every district and for every school board seat, while Moore stressed the need to deliver a tangible alternative to Trump's policies. Neither governor indicated any intention to run for president in 2028, focusing instead on the immediate political battles of 2025. Clyburn praised both Walz and Moore as great leaders but deferred to their individual plans regarding future political ambitions. The event served as a platform for potential Democratic rising stars to connect with influential party members and donors. Optimism surrounds the party's potential for future success with strong leadership. </p>

          <p>An NPR producer and a group of friends have been recreating the reality TV show 'Survivor' every year since 2022. What started as a pandemic binge-watching hobby has evolved into a highly anticipated annual event, complete with challenges, tribal councils, and strategic gameplay. The friends spend months planning the challenges and twists, mirroring the show's format of 'Outwit, Outplay, Outlast'. This year's event in Collegeville, PA, involved a gauntlet of challenges, including a Crisco Watermelon wrestling match. The weekend is described as anxiety-inducing but also the highlight of the year, fostering camaraderie and shared experiences among friends. The tradition culminates in the passing of the torch to the next pair of 'Jeffs' who will plan the following year's game. </p>

          <p>Memory cafes are providing camaraderie and support for people with dementia and their caregivers, offering a social outlet and respite from the challenges of the condition. These cafes, which number over 600 in the U.S., provide a relaxed environment for socializing, activities, and mutual support. The gatherings help combat social isolation, which is common after a dementia diagnosis, and ease the stress on caregivers. As federal health funding faces potential cuts, memory cafe organizers believe their services will become even more vital. The cafes are relatively inexpensive to run and offer a valuable resource for a growing population affected by memory loss. </p>

          <p>Defence Secretary John Healey anticipates that the UK will allocate 3% of its GDP to defence by 2034, with the government's strategic defence review outlining priorities for future military and security spending. The review, based on the assumption of reaching the 3% target, warns of emerging threats from drones and artificial intelligence. It recommends deploying digital experts alongside troops to counter enemy drones and manage future unmanned weapons. The review identifies Russia as an immediate threat and China as a sophisticated challenge, while also addressing Iran and North Korea as regional disruptors. The government plans to invest over ¬£1.5 billion in improving military housing as part of this commitment. </p>

          <p>The A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened after 23 years of roadworks and a ¬£2 billion upgrade project. The 28-mile improvement aims to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce journey times. The project, initially conceived in 1990, involved constructing nearly 70 structures, including over 40 new bridges and a dozen new junctions. Despite criticisms about the project's cost and duration, Welsh ministers assert that the upgrade will significantly benefit communities across the region. The completion marks the end of frequent tailbacks and serious crashes, providing a direct route between Swansea and Monmouthshire. </p>

          <p>The Japanese government's release of cheaper stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers has begun, drawing consumers to stores. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. are among the first to sell the rice at 2,160 yen ($15) per 5-kilogram bag. At an Ito-Yokado store in Tokyo, 500 bags sold out within 30 minutes of opening. This initiative aims to alleviate the impact of soaring rice prices on households. The government is selling 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022, hoping direct sales will more effectively curb prices. </p>
