        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk has stated he does not support a merger between his electric vehicle company, Tesla, and his artificial intelligence firm, xAI, responding with a simple "No" to an investor query. However, he has suggested that Tesla might hold a shareholder vote on whether to invest in xAI, which develops the Grok AI chatbot. This comes amid moves to integrate his various companies, including merging xAI with social media platform X and a reported $2 billion investment in xAI from SpaceX. The developments highlight Musk's strategy to build an interconnected tech ecosystem centered around AI.</p>

          <h2>'Social Prescribing' Gains Traction as Doctors Prescribe Community Activities for Health</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 05:00:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing healthcare movement known as "social prescribing" involves doctors prescribing community activities like cycling, art classes, or volunteering instead of, or in addition to, traditional medication. The approach focuses on what matters to the patient to improve both mental and physical health, tackling issues like loneliness, diabetes, and depression. Proponents, citing examples from the U.K. and U.S., say it complements conventional treatments by leveraging the proven benefits of social connection, exercise, and nature. Studies suggest this method not only improves patient outcomes but can also reduce healthcare costs by lowering emergency room visits.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a journalist recounts her experience going on a "date" with a customized AI boyfriend from the app Replika, created out of frustration with modern dating. The narrative explores the surreal interactions of texting the chatbot during a real-world dinner, highlighting the AI's ability to provide witty, attentive, and even emotionally resonant responses. However, the author ultimately concludes that while the AI companion can mimic intimacy and feel comforting, it lacks the shared experience and genuine presence of a human connection. The article reflects on the growing trend of seeking companionship from machines to combat loneliness.</p>

          <p>After 15 years of construction, China has completed a massive extra-high voltage "energy ring" encircling the Tarim Basin, home to the country's largest desert. The project transforms the remote and forbidding region into a significant hub for transmitting new energy. This extensive power grid, featuring nearly 10,000 transmission towers and nine substations, will collect and distribute electricity from various sources, including wind, solar, thermal, and hydropower. The infrastructure covers over a million square kilometers and is a major step in China's efforts to develop and integrate renewable energy sources from its vast western regions.</p>

          <p>China's market regulator, SAMR, has approved the acquisition of software vendor Ansys by the U.S. chip design software giant Synopsys. The approval comes with conditions aimed at protecting Chinese clients, requiring the combined firm to honor all existing contracts and not reject renewal requests from Chinese customers. This decision is significant as it pertains to electronic design automation (EDA) software, a critical technology for China's semiconductor industry. The approval follows a recent move by Washington to lift some export curbs on this type of software, signaling a potential easing of tech-related tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. The growth, which surpassed economists' expectations, was primarily driven by a strong manufacturing sector, which expanded 5.5% year-over-year. Analysts suggest the positive figures were partly due to businesses front-loading exports to get ahead of potential U.S. tariffs. Despite the better-than-expected performance, Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, warning of significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy for the second half of the year.

          <p>Andrew Bailey, the Governor of the Bank of England, has indicated that the central bank is prepared to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK job market continues to weaken. In a recent interview, Bailey stated he believes the path for rates is "downward," citing signs that businesses are reducing hiring and offering smaller pay increases. The latest official data shows job vacancies have fallen to their lowest level since 2021. Economists widely expect a rate cut at the Bank's next meeting in August, which would impact mortgage, credit, and savings rates for millions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, beating economists' forecasts and bolstered by strong shipments to non-U.S. markets. A temporary tariff truce with the United States also helped slow the rate of decline in exports to America. The data also showed a notable 60% surge in rare earth shipments to a record high. While imports rose for the first time this year, the increase was modest. Despite the positive first-half performance, analysts remain cautious, warning that export momentum could falter later in the year due to ongoing uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariff policies.

Norwegian consumers have responded positively to the quality and affordability of the Chinese models, presenting a significant challenge to established Western automakers, including market leader Tesla.
