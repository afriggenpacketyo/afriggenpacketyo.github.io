          <p>For the first time since 2019, all 13 of Yosemite National Park's campgrounds will be open to visitors this summer, according to the National Parks Service. This includes an additional 500 campsites compared to recent years, increasing accessibility to the popular park, which saw over 4 million visitors in 2024. Maintenance and staffing challenges had kept several campgrounds closed since 2020, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Reservations for Yosemite are available at Recreation.gov, but securing a spot is highly competitive, often filling up within minutes. The reservation system was introduced in 2020 amid the pandemic and temporarily halted earlier this year.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has reduced the hours of the nightly curfew in downtown L.A., allowing businesses to remain open later into the evening. The curfew, which was enacted in response to protests against President Trump's immigration crackdown, will now begin at 10 p.m. instead of 8 p.m. The mayor cited reduced crime and vandalism as reasons for the adjustment. The LAPD will maintain a strong presence in the downtown area to ensure safety. Since protests began on June 7, the LAPD has arrested 575 people, including 14 for looting.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer and Donald Trump finalized a UK-US trade deal at the G7 summit in Canada, which covers aerospace and the auto sector. The US president said Britain would have protection against future tariffs ‚Äúbecause I like them‚Äù. Under the agreement, the UK aerospace sector will face no tariffs from the US, while the auto industry will have 10% tariffs, down from 25%. However, the steel industry still faces 25% tariffs, although the two leaders pledged to work towards 0% tariffs on core steel products. The US still seeks assurances about the Chinese owners of British Steel, highlighting potential complications.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration's termination of over $1 billion in research grants at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was "void and illegal". Judge William Young stated that the cuts, which targeted research with perceived connections to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), constituted unlawful discrimination. The judge ordered the reinstatement of grants previously awarded to organizations and states that filed the lawsuit. The administration's move to slash NIH funding was part of a broader effort to shrink the federal government and national debt. The ruling only applies to some grants, with further claims to be decided after additional evidence is presented.</p>

          <p>A new proposal in California would make it a misdemeanor for law enforcement officers to cover their faces while conducting official business. The bill would require officers to show their faces and be identifiable by their uniform, with exemptions for the national guard, SWAT teams, and officers responding to natural disasters. State senators Scott Wiener and Jesse Arreguin aim to boost transparency and public trust in law enforcement. The proposal comes amid concerns about federal officers conducting raids while covering their faces and badges, leading to fears of vigilante-style actions.</p>
