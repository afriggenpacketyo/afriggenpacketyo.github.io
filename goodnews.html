          <p>A high court in Bogotá has overturned the bribery conviction of former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe, who was previously sentenced to house arrest for witness tampering and procedural fraud. The court ruled that the charges were not proven "beyond reasonable doubt," citing methodological errors and biased evaluation of evidence in the initial sentence. Uribe, who served from 2002 to 2010, had been accused of bribing former paramilitary members to lie about his alleged ties to their groups. The case has been a source of political division within Colombia and has strained relations with the U.S.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve having cut interest rates multiple times, the window for securing high-yield certificate of deposit (CD) accounts is closing. While rates are lower than in previous years, they remain competitive compared to traditional savings accounts, offering a fixed return in an uncertain economic climate. Financial experts suggest that savers looking to lock in current rates, which can still be found around 4%, should act quickly before anticipated future rate cuts further diminish returns. The opportunity to earn significant interest on accounts like a $10,000 CD may not return for several years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery has announced it is exploring "strategic alternatives," including a potential sale of the entire company or its individual Warner Bros. and Discovery Global businesses. This move comes after the company received "unsolicited interest from multiple parties" and just months after it revealed plans to split into two separate entities by 2026. The company's stock price surged nearly 10% following the announcement, with its market value hovering around $49 billion. Potential bidders are speculated to include major industry players like Paramount Skydance, Comcast, and Sony.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has officially launched ChatGPT Atlas, a new web browser built around its generative AI chatbot, directly competing with Google's Chrome. The browser, initially available for macOS, integrates ChatGPT into the user experience, allowing for seamless interaction like summarizing pages and completing tasks via a sidebar. CEO Sam Altman stated the goal is to rethink the browser concept, introducing features like a persistent memory and an "agent mode" for automating tasks like booking flights. The announcement prompted a roughly 3% drop in the stock price of Google's parent company, Alphabet.</p>

The analysis suggests caution for the restaurant stock at its current levels due to persistent commodity price pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The current controversy over President Trump's new ballroom is the latest in a long history of renovations and additions to the White House. Since its construction, various presidents have left their mark on the building, reflecting changing tastes and needs. Notable past projects include Theodore Roosevelt's 1902 addition of the West Wing and Franklin D. Roosevelt's installation of an indoor swimming pool in 1933. One of the most extensive remodels was overseen by Harry Truman, who gutted and rebuilt the interior from 1948 to 1952, while Jacqueline Kennedy led a famous restoration of its historic decor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals facing overwhelming debt, Chapter 7 bankruptcy can offer a fresh start, but eligibility is largely determined by income through a "means test." This test compares an individual's household income over the last six months to their state's median income for a similar-sized household. If income is below the median, qualification is likely; if above, a more detailed calculation of disposable income after expenses is required. The article explains that even if one doesn't qualify for Chapter 7, alternatives like Chapter 13 bankruptcy, debt settlement programs, or credit counseling are available.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels are expected to hire Kurt Suzuki, a former catcher who concluded his 16-year playing career with the team in 2022, as their next manager. Since retiring, Suzuki has served as a special assistant to the team's general manager. He will become the fifth manager for the struggling franchise since 2018, replacing Ron Washington, who missed much of the 2025 season due to health issues. The Angels are coming off their 10th consecutive losing season and hope the new leadership can help turn the team around.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Weighted vests have become a popular fitness trend for intensifying workouts, but a medical expert advises caution. Dr. Jon LaPook explains that while they can increase calorie burn and improve cardiovascular workload, they also act as a mini stress test on the heart, making it important for those with health conditions to consult a doctor. To avoid injury, it is recommended to start with a light weight, such as 5% of one's body weight, and ensure the vest fits properly to prevent stress on joints. The key is to listen to one's body and build up usage gradually.</p>

          <p>China's commerce minister has accepted an invitation for urgent talks in Brussels to address escalating trade tensions with the European Union. The discussions will focus on China's recently broadened restrictions on the export of rare earth minerals, which are critical for the EU's high-tech and green industries. Another key issue is the fallout from the Netherlands' decision to effectively take control of the Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia, citing national security concerns. The EU's trade chief described China's export controls as "unjustified and harmful" and is seeking immediate solutions to the disputes.</p>

          <p>A family-medicine clinic in Aurora, Colorado, called Mango House, has developed a sustainable and profitable model while serving a community of largely refugee and immigrant patients. The clinic thrives by preferring Medicaid, an insurance program often considered financially unviable by other providers. Founder Dr. P. J. Parmar achieved this through radical efficiency, such as eliminating appointments in favor of a walk-in system, which keeps wait times short and patient volume high. By streamlining operations and focusing solely on mastering Medicaid's billing system, the clinic provides accessible care while remaining financially independent and successful.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has ruled that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg must take the witness stand in an upcoming trial concerning the adverse effects of social media on young users. The judge also ordered Snap CEO Evan Spiegel and Instagram head Adam Mosseri to testify, denying their motions to be excused. The ruling stated that a CEO's testimony is "uniquely relevant" to allegations that the companies knowingly created addictive features harmful to minors without providing adequate warnings. This trial is one of many lawsuits social media companies are facing over the impact of their platforms on youth mental health.</p>
