          <p>UK Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey is calling for a fellowship scheme to attract US cancer scientists to the United Kingdom. This proposal comes in response to the Trump administration's decision to cut billions from biomedical research grants, a move that has caused significant concern within the scientific community. Davey's speech at his party's conference frames the initiative as an opportunity for the UK to lead in the fight against cancer by providing a haven for researchers affected by what he calls the US government's "anti-science agenda." The plan suggests offering discounted visas to these scientists, though specific details on the discount levels have not yet been released.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic frontrunner for New York City mayor, initially withdrew from a scheduled town hall on WABC-TV to protest the suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" by parent company ABC. Mamdani stated that it is not the government's role to bully talk show hosts off the air, referencing the pressure from the FCC that led to the show's preemption. Following Disney's announcement that Kimmel's show would return, Mamdani reversed his decision and said he would reschedule his appearance, framing the outcome as a victory for free speech. The incident injected the national debate over media censorship and political pressure into the local mayoral race.</p>

He highlighted stocks across various sectors, including T-Mobile in telecommunications and consumer-focused companies like Royal Caribbean and Dollar Tree. In the financial sector, Cramer pointed to Capital One, American Express, and Citigroup as having strong potential. He also suggested that while the healthcare sector has struggled, biopharmaceutical company Incyte shows promise, and in technology, Dell and Jabil are well-positioned due to their roles in AI infrastructure and manufacturing.

          <p>A magnitude 4.3 earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay Area early Monday morning, centered near Berkeley, waking many residents across the region. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported that over 22,000 people felt the shaking, which was described as strong and long. Fortunately, no major damage or injuries have been reported, although some businesses experienced broken windows and fallen merchandise. The event caused temporary delays on the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system as tracks were inspected for safety. Officials noted the quake serves as an important reminder for residents to be prepared for seismic activity in the earthquake-prone region.</p>

          <p>This commentary piece argues that the return of Jimmy Kimmel to late-night television represents a critical moment for free speech and democracy in the United States. The author contends that humor is a powerful tool for holding authority accountable and that attempts by political figures to silence comedians are a hallmark of authoritarianism. The article frames Kimmel's choice—whether to temper his political comedy or continue speaking freely—as a test of courage against fear and self-censorship. It posits that in the current political climate, making fun of powerful leaders is not just entertainment but a form of patriotic duty to protect democratic values.</p>

          <p>The Walt Disney Company has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air, nearly a week after the late-night show was indefinitely suspended. The suspension followed comments Kimmel made regarding the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which drew criticism from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr and led major affiliate station owners to drop the program. In its statement, Disney explained the show was paused "to avoid further inflaming a tense situation," but after conversations with Kimmel, the decision was made to bring it back. The reversal comes after significant backlash from Hollywood figures and free speech advocates who condemned the suspension as censorship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>General practitioners in England are being encouraged to adopt a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," designed to prevent diagnostic misses for deteriorating patients. The rule urges doctors to "think again" if a patient presents with the same symptoms three times without a clear diagnosis or improvement. The guidance is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from cancer after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid. Her family hopes the rule will ensure that patients who are persistently unwell receive further investigation, such as specialist referrals or additional tests, to catch serious illnesses like cancer earlier and improve patient safety.</p>

          <p>China is in the process of drafting its 15th five-year plan, a comprehensive blueprint that will guide the nation's economic and social development from 2026 to 2030. This long-standing practice of strategic planning is considered a key political advantage by President Xi Jinping, especially amid rising global uncertainty. The upcoming plan is crucial for achieving China's long-term goal of becoming a "moderately developed country" by 2035. Experts suggest that given the turbulent global landscape, Beijing may need to prioritize flexible, qualitative goals over rigid quantitative targets to successfully navigate the challenges ahead and steer its economy toward its ambitious objectives.

          <p>A potential school shooting in Northern California was averted thanks to a tip submitted through the "Say Something" anonymous reporting system, according to police. The tip line, created by the Sandy Hook Promise organization, alerted authorities to concerning social media posts by a former student of Menlo-Atherton High School. Police responded by locking down the campus and locating the student, from whose home weapons were recovered. This incident marks the 19th credible planned school attack the system has helped prevent since its 2018 launch, highlighting the critical role that student reporting and community vigilance play in ensuring school safety.</p>
