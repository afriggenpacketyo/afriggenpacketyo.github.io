          <p>A voluntary recall of Dr Pepper Zero Sugar has been upgraded to Class II by the FDA due to a serious health risk, as cans labeled "zero sugar" were found to contain the full amount of sugar present in regular Dr Pepper. The mislabeled cans, produced by Pepsi Beverages Company in Jacksonville, Florida, have the product code XXXXRS05165 and a "best by" date of February 16, 2026, and were distributed to retailers in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. Customers who purchased the affected cans are urged to return them for a full refund or discard them, as the mislabeling poses a risk to individuals who need to avoid sugar, particularly those with diabetes, as excessive sugar intake can lead to hyperglycemia and potentially fatal ketoacidosis.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to reduce elevated rice prices. The release will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the 2020 rice expected to be sold at 1,700 yen ($12) per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, down from about 910,000 tons before the government began releasing stocks earlier this year. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi aims to quickly deliver the stockpiled rice to consumers at lower prices, targeting smaller supermarket operators and specialty shops, in addition to major retailers, with applications being accepted starting Wednesday.</p>

          <p>Rapper Doechii used her BET Awards acceptance speech to denounce the Trump administration's deployment of military forces against protesters in Los Angeles.

She questioned the nature of a government that deploys the military against democratic protests, drawing applause from the audience. Doechii's message coincided with ongoing demonstrations in Los Angeles and other cities across the US, as California leaders condemned Trump's actions as inflammatory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has issued a warning about an unprecedented decline in world fertility rates, attributing it to the prohibitive costs of parenthood and a lack of suitable partners. UNFPA surveyed 14,000 people across 14 countries, revealing that one in five respondents have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children. The survey highlighted financial limitations as a significant barrier, with 39% of respondents citing it as a reason for not having children, while only 12% attributed it to infertility. Demographers note that this marks a shift in the UN's focus, as the agency has historically emphasized issues related to women having more children than desired.</p>

          <p>The government has committed ¬£14.2bn of investment to build the new Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, ahead of the Spending Review. Sizewell C is projected to create 10,000 direct jobs, thousands more in firms supplying the plant, and generate enough energy to power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed the "landmark decision" as a catalyst for economic growth, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband emphasized the investment's necessity to usher in a "golden age of clean energy." However, critics like Alison Downes, director of Stop Sizewell C, argue that ministers have not been transparent about the project's total cost, citing incomplete negotiations with private investors.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have significantly decreased, with fatal overdoses plummeting from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 in 2024, according to provisional CDC data. This trend is attributed to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less deadly fentanyl being sold, increased addiction healthcare access, and a shift towards less risky drug use among teens and young adults. A study found that the number of teens abstaining from substance use grew to its highest level in 2024, with experts suggesting that the devastation caused by fentanyl has led to a preference for safer drugs like cannabis and psychedelics. Despite this progress, sustaining the recovery may be challenging, particularly for those struggling with severe addiction, and potential cuts to federal funding for addiction services could jeopardize these gains.</p>
