          <h2>UK Ministers Consider Removing Two-Child Benefit Cap</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-27 05:48:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap, which restricts means-tested benefits for families with more than two children born after April 2017. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson acknowledged the policy has contributed to poverty but cautioned that reversing it would be expensive. The Child Poverty Taskforce, led by Phillipson and Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall, is assessing the cap as part of a broader child poverty strategy, with a decision expected in the autumn. While a Labour government would never have introduced such a cap, the taskforce is weighing the costs of both action and inaction, as the latter can significantly harm children's life chances.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's policies against "woke" initiatives, particularly Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs, are causing some US corporations to scale back or eliminate these programs, which is now impacting European firms. Some German companies, like Volkswagen and Deutsche Telekom, are reducing their DEI efforts in the US, while others, such as BMW and Siemens, are closely monitoring the situation but maintaining their commitment to diversity. Despite the backlash, many companies, including Apple and Microsoft, are reaffirming their support for DEI, with some rebranding and reorganizing to avoid potential lawsuits. While some companies may change how they communicate their DEI efforts, their core attitudes and actions largely remain the same, with many still launching initiatives to attract women, people with migrant backgrounds, and older workers.</p>

          <p>Seven & i Holdings Co., the Japanese operator of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain, has appointed Stephen Hayes Dacus as its first foreign CEO, amidst a buyout offer from Canadian rival Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. Dacus pledged to enhance corporate value and focus on the convenience store business, which faces slowing growth in Japan and the United States. Shareholders approved Dacus' appointment along with other board members, including Junro Ito as chairman. The company is considering the buyout offer while also pursuing its own restructuring plans, such as selling its supermarket business and a U.S. listing for its U.S. 7-Eleven unit. </p>

The boys' father, a naturalized American citizen, joined ISIS a decade ago, and the children were born overseas. The U.S. government brokered the family reunification, viewing it as a model for addressing the legacy of the Iraq War and the plight of thousands in Syrian camps. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have supported efforts to repatriate U.S. citizens from these camps, recognizing the humanitarian catastrophe and the risk of radicalization.</p>

          <p>Twenty companies in Japan have applied to purchase 110,000 tons of government stockpiled rice, following the agriculture minister's announcement to release rice through direct contracts to curb soaring prices. This amount is over 30 percent of the 300,000 tons planned for release through direct sales contracts with major retailers. The move comes as supermarket rice prices have doubled from a year earlier, despite previous efforts to lower prices through auctions. The government aims to stabilize food supply and alleviate public anxiety over rising rice prices, and the new measures may include revising eligibility criteria to include smaller retailers.</p>

The measures are intended to mitigate an expected economic slowdown and address public concerns over higher consumer prices.

          <p>Chinese scientists have challenged Darwinian evolution by demonstrating that acquired traits can be inherited without DNA changes. A study published in Cell showed that rice plants adapted to cold stress passed on their tolerance across five generations through DNA methylation changes. This breakthrough reignites the debate between Darwinism and Lamarckism, suggesting that environmentally induced epigenetic variation can contribute to the inheritance of acquired characteristics. The research highlights the potential for non-genetic adaptations to play a significant role in evolution.</p>
