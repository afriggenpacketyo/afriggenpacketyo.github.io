          <p>Facing a trade war with the United States and weak domestic consumption, China is considering lifting its unofficial ban on K-pop acts, which has been in place since 2016. The decision comes as China looks for ways to revitalize domestic demand, with cultural events like concerts and music festivals being promoted to stimulate spending in tourism and hospitality. K-pop is seen as a tariff-proof sector, with core revenue drivers like streaming and concerts being digital and intangible, making them immune to cross-border tariffs. Analysts also suggest that improving relations with South Korea through cultural diplomacy could benefit China economically.</p>

          <p>Shell reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter profit and announced a $3.5 billion share buyback program, marking the 14th consecutive quarter of at least $3 billion in buybacks. The company's adjusted earnings for the first three months of the year were $5.58 billion, surpassing analyst expectations. CEO Wael Sawan described the earnings as "another solid set of results" and reaffirmed the company's reduced annual investment budget of $20 billion to $22 billion for 2025. The announcement contrasts with British rival BP, which lowered its share buyback after first-quarter profit fell short of expectations.</p>
