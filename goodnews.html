          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has identified a 'genetic switch' that could enable mammals to regenerate damaged tissue, a capability typically limited in vertebrates like humans. Their study, published in Science, found that mice fail to regenerate because they cannot produce enough retinoic acid, a key compound for tissue repair. By reactivating a dormant DNA pathway, the researchers successfully triggered ear regeneration in a mouse, a finding that could have significant implications for regenerative medicine across different tissue types.</p>

          <p>Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis, who returned from a brief retirement, is leading an aggressive turnaround plan to revive the Stellantis truck brand after years of declining sales. The strategy includes bringing back Hemi V-8 engines, returning to NASCAR, and offering an industry-leading warranty to combat a 38% sales drop since 2019. Kuniskis aims to regain significant market share from competitors by fixing issues stemming from a problematic redesign of the Ram 1500 and launching over 25 new initiatives through 2026.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, a writer recounts her experience moving into a house with actors in Los Angeles and developing a deep connection with a charming Australian roommate. Despite a powerful mutual attraction, she pulled back from a physical relationship, a decision that was validated when he later revealed he had a girlfriend and a compulsion for sex. The experience, while emotionally complex, led her to a deeper understanding of love, friendship, and the different forms soulmates can take beyond traditional romance.</p>
