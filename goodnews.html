          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams met with President Trump in Washington, D.C., to discuss city priorities, including infrastructure needs, coinciding with the release of documents related to Adams' previously dropped federal corruption case. Trump suggested Adams came to thank him for past support, while Adams initially focused on a wind farm project canceled by the Trump administration, later acknowledging gratitude for Trump's earlier support during the investigation. The released documents revealed that the F.B.I. investigated Adams for witness tampering, though no charges were filed on that matter, and the dismissal of the case has caused controversy within the Justice Department. The article highlights the sensitive timing of the visit given ongoing issues between New York City and the Trump administration.</p>

          <h2>Trump Hints at Lowering China Tariffs Ahead of Trade Talks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 20:39:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump suggested that the U.S. may be open to lowering tariffs on China, proposing an 80% tariff rate ahead of trade negotiations in Switzerland. This conciliatory tone comes after months of tense trade relations, with the U.S. imposing tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports, prompting retaliatory levies from China. Analysts suggest that investors are interpreting Trump's statement as part of the negotiation process, with expectations that tariffs could be further reduced. A deal would be welcomed by businesses and consumers affected by price hikes due to the trade war.</p>

          <p>Elton John, Dua Lipa, and over 400 British musicians, writers, and artists are urging the Prime Minister to update copyright laws to protect them from artificial intelligence. They are seeking transparency from AI developers regarding the use of their material to train AI models, arguing that failing to do so would mean "giving away" their work to tech firms. The artists are calling for support for an amendment proposed by Baroness Beeban Kidron that would allow for licensing agreements between creators and companies. While some argue such measures could hamper the UK's growth, the artists express concern over the inclusion of their works in the data used to develop generative AI systems.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere this weekend after a rocket malfunction left it stranded in Earth orbit. The spacecraft, weighing roughly 1,050 pounds and cloaked in a protective heat shield, was designed to survive a plunge through Venus‚Äôs toxic atmosphere, which means there‚Äôs a good chance it will survive its dive through Earth's atmosphere. Experts estimate the re-entry will occur on Friday or Saturday, but the exact location of impact remains unknown. If pieces of the spacecraft survive and are recovered, they legally belong to Russia.</p>

          <p>California public health officials have issued an annual quarantine on mussels that aren't commercially harvested, effective through October 31, due to naturally occurring toxins that can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid biotoxins. The quarantine affects the California coastline from Oregon to the Mexican border, including all bays, inlets, and harbors in Los Angeles County. These biotoxins occur due to algae blooms, and cooking the shellfish does not reliably eliminate the toxins. Commercially grown mussels are exempt from the quarantine as they undergo frequent testing.</p>
