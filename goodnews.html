          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit a U.S. Steel mill in Pennsylvania as the deal between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel is finalized. This visit follows Trump's announcement of a "planned partnership" between the two companies, which aims to keep U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pennsylvania. Senator David McCormick stated that the agreement includes an American CEO and a majority of U.S. board members, with the U.S. potentially holding a golden share for government approval of board members and production levels. The United Steelworkers union opposes the sale, citing concerns about potential job risks, while U.S. Steel has warned about job losses and headquarters uncertainty without the acquisition.

          <p>Costco's shares experienced a slight dip despite the company surpassing quarterly earnings and revenue estimates, reporting an 8% year-over-year sales increase. The company's leaders noted that tariffs have increased costs and posed other challenges, necessitating supply chain adjustments and price increases in some instances. Despite economic worries related to tariffs, Costco may benefit from its competitive pricing, bulk discounts, and discounted gas and groceries. The company's ability to negotiate prices with suppliers due to its size also provides an advantage. (not investment advice)</p>
