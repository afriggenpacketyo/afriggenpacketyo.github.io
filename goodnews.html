          <p>Chinese mathematicians have successfully resolved a 65-year-old problem related to the Kervaire invariant, a function that measures whether a smooth framed manifold can be converted into a sphere through surgery. The breakthrough, achieved using major computational methods, provides proof that manifolds of Kervaire invariant one exist in dimension 126. This achievement concludes a decades-long mystery and could be applied to further problems in the field.</p>

          <p>John Cameron Mitchell discusses his college speaking tour, where he encouraged students to embrace punk ideals to navigate a potentially post-democratic America. He shares stories of his father, a closeted bisexual Army major general, and Claude Cahun, a French Jewish Surrealist, as examples of punk action. Mitchell advises students to stop canceling each other, explore punk culture, and engage in D.I.Y. collective action to build community and foster empathy. He emphasizes that punk is about making useful stories outside approved systems and encourages students to connect with others in real life.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article challenges the traditional "Hero's Journey" narrative, arguing that motherhood and caregiving can also be epic adventures filled with trials, triumphs, and profound self-discovery. The author contends that caring for another person can be just as transformative as solo quests, offering unique insights into human connection and resilience. By reframing caregiving as a heroic endeavor, the article seeks to elevate the value of domestic and familial experiences, promoting a more inclusive understanding of wisdom and personal growth. The author suggests this shift in perspective could encourage greater investment in long-term relationships and provide more support for caregivers.</p>

          <p>Malibu is contemplating constructing a sewer system along Pacific Coast Highway after a wildfire destroyed hundreds of homes with septic systems. The proposal marks a significant shift for the city, which was founded to prevent such infrastructure.

Concerns remain about treatment locations, financing, and managing waste during the construction period, with costs potentially ranging from $124 million to over $200,000 per property.</p>
