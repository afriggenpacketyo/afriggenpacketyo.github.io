          <p>Shachi Kurl analyzes the challenges facing Canada under Prime Minister Mark Carney, including economic concerns, strained relationships with the U.S. due to President Trump's policies, and deteriorating bilateral ties with China and India. The article suggests Canada needs to redefine its global role beyond its relationship with America, focusing on trade agreements with Britain and the European Union. Kurl emphasizes the importance of meeting NATO military spending guidelines and avoiding rhetorical missteps that plagued the previous administration, as Canada seeks to secure its economic and strategic future. The country's upcoming role as host to the Business 7 summit and the Group of 7 presents a critical opportunity for a reset on the global stage.</p>

          <h2>India to Include Caste Details in Upcoming Census, Potentially Reshaping Social Justice Programs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India will include caste details in its next census, announced by Information Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, a move expected to have significant socio-economic and political consequences. This decision could lead to increased demands for raising quotas in government jobs and college admissions for Other Backward Classes (OBCs). The last time India counted all castes was in 1931 under British rule; since then, only Dalits and Adivasis have been counted. While supporters argue this data is essential for effectively implementing social justice programs, critics fear it could exacerbate social unrest. The announcement comes before a crucial election in Bihar, where caste is a major issue.</p>

          <p>The World Trade Center Health Program has resumed certifying illnesses linked to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, restoring access to treatment for cancer patients and first responders. This comes after weeks of uncertainty caused by administrative issues, including the layoff and alleged reinstatement of the program's administrator, Dr. John Howard. The restoration of certification processing means that the program can now review and approve claims from responders and survivors who have developed new conditions linked to the attacks. While clinics are relieved, they remain wary about the future and emphasize the need for transparency and accountability to prevent future disruptions.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States have agreed to accelerate tariff talks, aiming to reach a mutually beneficial deal as early as June. Following meetings between Japanese and U.S. officials, both countries will hold intensive ministerial discussions starting in mid-May. While Japan intends to negotiate in a way that would not be detrimental to its national interests, discussions are focusing on nontariff barriers and expanding bilateral trade. The talks come as the Trump administration has imposed tariffs on goods imported from Japan, which have been paused until early July.</p>
