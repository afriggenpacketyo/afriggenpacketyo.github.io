        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, has decided to keep its benchmark lending rates unchanged, a move that follows the monetary easing measures implemented last month aimed at stimulating economic growth. The 1-year loan prime rate remains at 3.0%, while the 5-year LPR stays at 3.5%, aligning with market expectations. This decision comes after Chinese authorities reduced lending rates for the first time since October in response to trade tensions with Washington, and some analysts suggest a restrained approach to further monetary easing, exploring alternative avenues to stimulate economic growth. Despite recent volatility in the forex market, Chinese officials express confidence in their ability to manage it, while the PBOC aims to expand the international use of the digital yuan.

          <p>Wyndham Clark has admitted to and expressed regret for his outburst in the locker room after missing the cut at the 2025 U.S. Open at Oakmont Country Club. The golfer acknowledged making a mistake and apologized for his actions, which included damaging locker doors, and he hopes to move forward and focus on the rest of the year. Clark's last nine months have been largely disappointing, with only one top 10 finish, but he began the Travelers Championship with a strong opening round.

          <p>Members of the Italian soccer team Juventus visited President Trump at the White House, an event that left some players feeling "weird." The players, coach, and FIFA president were present, but the visit primarily focused on political discussions about potential U.S. involvement in the conflict between Israel and Iran. Some players expressed a desire to focus on playing football rather than engaging in politics, while others recalled past critical comments about Trump. Awkward moments arose when Trump questioned the possibility of women joining the team and made remarks about stealth.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with federal immigration authorities to receive transportation funding. The ruling supports a lawsuit filed by 20 states challenging the administration's authority to tie transportation dollars to immigration enforcement. The judge deemed the policy arbitrary and capricious, lacking specificity in how states should cooperate and noting that Congress did not authorize the Secretary of Transportation to impose immigration enforcement conditions on transportation funds. This decision reinforces the separation of federal and state responsibilities regarding immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A former manager of an El Cajon company pleaded guilty to hiring undocumented workers, receiving one year of unsupervised release and no jail time as part of a plea agreement.
