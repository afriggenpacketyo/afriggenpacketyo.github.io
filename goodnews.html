          <h2>Nvidia to Resume Sales of H20 AI Chips to China After Receiving U.S. Government Assurances</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 00:09:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia announced it expects to soon resume selling its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China after the U.S. government provided assurances that export licenses will be granted. This move reverses previous restrictions that had significantly impacted Nvidia's sales in the Chinese market. The decision follows intensive lobbying by CEO Jensen Huang and is part of a broader, preliminary trade framework between the U.S. and China. The resumption of H20 shipments, along with new compliant chips being developed, is anticipated to be a major growth driver for the company.</p>

          <p>Chinese aerospace company Space Pioneer announced its Tianlong-3 rocket has passed a critical ground-based stress test, a significant milestone following a major setback last year. The test successfully simulated key mission phases, including lift-off and flight, using the rocket's nine-engine first stage. This achievement is crucial for the company's credibility after a 2024 static-fire test ended in the rocket unexpectedly lifting off and crashing. The test confirms the structural integrity of the rocket's tail section, which must endure immense forces during launch and landing for future reusability.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 23:59:02 EDT</div>

          <p>Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg revealed the company's plan to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on constructing enormous AI data centers in the United States to advance its goal of developing "superintelligence." The first facility, named Prometheus, is slated to be operational in Ohio by 2026, with another multi-gigawatt cluster, Hyperion, planned for Louisiana. These data centers are incredibly resource-intensive, requiring vast amounts of energy and water, which raises environmental concerns. The massive investment underscores Meta's commitment to leading the AI race, a move that has been met with a positive response from the stock market.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary stay, blocking the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 11,700 Afghans. The administration had planned to terminate the protections, arguing that conditions in Afghanistan had improved sufficiently for their return. However, immigrant advocacy group CASA sued, and the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals has paused the policy for one week to allow for legal arguments to be filed. Advocacy groups praised the ruling as a critical, albeit brief, reprieve for families who would otherwise face deportation to a country still in crisis.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh has won the 2025 All-Star Home Run Derby, becoming the first catcher and first switch-hitter to ever claim the title. Raleigh, who entered the All-Star break leading the major leagues with 38 home runs, defeated Tampa Bay's Junior Caminero 18-15 in the final round. His path to victory included a dramatic tiebreaker win in the first round and a powerful semifinal performance. The event also featured a 513-foot blast from Pittsburgh's Oneil Cruz, the longest drive of the night, highlighting a memorable evening of power hitting at Truist Park.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Animals Can React to Sounds Produced by Stressed Plants</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from Tel Aviv University provides the first evidence that animals respond to sounds made by plants, suggesting a previously unknown layer of ecosystem interaction. The study found that female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were emitting high-frequency sounds associated with distress, such as dehydration. While these sounds are inaudible to humans, they can be perceived by many insects and some mammals. This discovery opens up a new field of research into how these acoustic signals might influence animal behaviors like pollination, feeding, and seeking shelter, and even communication between plants.</p>

          <p>China's economy demonstrated resilient growth in the second quarter, with its Gross Domestic Product expanding by 5.2%, surpassing economists' forecasts of 5.1%. This performance keeps Beijing on track to meet its full-year growth target of 5% and may reduce pressure on policymakers to introduce further large-scale stimulus. However, the data also revealed weaknesses, as retail sales growth slowed and the real estate investment slump deepened. While industrial output was strong, officials noted that domestic demand remains insufficient and external factors continue to pose risks to the economic outlook.</p>

The mission, organized by private company Axiom Space, included crew members from India, Poland, and Hungary, marking the first time in over 40 years their respective nations have sent astronauts to space. After spending 18 days conducting research in orbit, the crew is expected to splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the California coast.

          <p>Researchers at Dalian University of Technology in China have developed a new manufacturing technique that could significantly improve the performance of aircraft engines, including those for next-generation fighter jets. The method involves rapidly cooling superalloy turbine discs, which are critical components that must withstand extreme temperatures and pressures. The quality and durability of these discs have long been a bottleneck for China's aerospace industry. This technological advancement could help close the gap with Western countries in the development of high-performance engines needed for advanced military aircraft.</p>

          <p>Bob Becker, an 80-year-old runner from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has made history by becoming the oldest person to finish the Badwater 135, widely considered the world's toughest foot race. The ultramarathon covers 135 miles through California's Death Valley, where temperatures can exceed 120°F, and involves significant elevation gain. Becker completed the race with about three hours to spare before the 48-hour cutoff, a redemptive achievement after he narrowly missed the deadline in 2022. His successful finish is an inspiring story of endurance and determination, proving that age is not a barrier to achieving extraordinary physical feats.</p>

The experience is designed to evoke the "analog magic" of waiting for a physical photo strip to develop, a novelty for digital natives. While a for-profit venture, the space offers a unique cultural experience, blending retro technology with contemporary selfie culture in a setting designed to resemble a Wes Anderson film.</p>
