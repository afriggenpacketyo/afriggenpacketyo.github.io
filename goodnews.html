          <p>Chinese officials have renewed their commitment to tackling the persistent issues of oversupply and excessive competition within the nation's solar photovoltaic (PV) industry. At a recent meeting, Industry and Information Technology Minister Li Lecheng emphasized the need to curb "disorderly low-price competition" and promote the phasing out of outdated production capacity. This directive follows President Xi Jinping's call to address similar industrial challenges. The government aims to guide companies toward improving product quality to ensure the sector's healthy and sustainable development. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is scheduled for a two-day tour of rural South Carolina, a visit that is intensifying speculation about a potential 2028 presidential campaign. The tour will take him through eight of the state's most economically and environmentally challenged counties, many of which are Republican strongholds. While his advisors insist the trip is focused on helping Democrats and highlighting issues in rural communities, its location in an early presidential primary state is seen by many as strategic groundwork. This visit is part of Newsom's broader outreach to voters in southern states.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully grown a human heart-like structure within a pig embryo, which reportedly continued to beat for 21 days. The research, led by the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, involved reprogramming human stem cells to enhance their survival in the host embryo. These modified cells were then implanted into pig embryos at an early stage of development. This breakthrough in chimera research, which follows the team's previous success in cultivating human kidneys in pigs, marks a significant step in organ generation studies.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has taken an individual into custody after they crossed the heavily fortified border from North Korea. The person, who was unarmed, traversed the Military Demarcation Line in the central-west section of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The military safely guided the individual out of the mine-strewn area and has handed them over to law enforcement for investigation. The Joint Chiefs of Staff did not specify whether the incident is being treated as a defection attempt and noted no unusual military movements from the North.</p>

          <p>A stateless Palestinian woman who was detained by ICE upon returning from her honeymoon has been released after more than four months in custody. Ward Sakeik, 22, was arrested in February despite having complied with ICE check-in requirements since she was a child. Her case drew significant attention after the government attempted to deport her twice, once in defiance of a judge's order. Sakeik, whose family is from Gaza, was born in Saudi Arabia and described being criminalized for her statelessness, something over which she has no control.</p>
