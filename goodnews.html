          <p>Mexican music star Juli√≥n √Ålvarez's sold-out concert at AT&T Stadium in Arlington has been postponed due to visa issues, according to a statement from CMN and Copar Music.

In 2017, √Ålvarez's U.S. work visa was revoked due to alleged ties to a drug trafficker, but he regained it in 2025 after being removed from the sanctions list in 2022.</p>
