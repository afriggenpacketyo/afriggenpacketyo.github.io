          <p>Australia has approved a groundbreaking single-dose vaccine to protect koalas from chlamydia, a leading cause of death and infertility for the marsupials. Developed over a decade by UniSC researchers, the vaccine aims to reduce infection, prevent disease progression, and even reverse existing symptoms. Chlamydia can cause blindness and starvation in koalas, and while antibiotics exist, they have limitations and side effects. This approval marks a significant step in conservation efforts for the vulnerable species, offering substantial hope for their future.</p>

          <p>Brain fog, characterized by difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and mental slowness, is a common experience often linked to stress or being overstretched. This article, featuring advice from medical expert Dr. Tharaka, emphasizes that brain fog is temporary and not a sign of personal failing. It recommends simple strategies like deliberately scheduling short breaks between activities to allow the brain to reset and process information, acting as "mental buffers" to reduce cognitive overload and improve focus.

          <p>Football pundit Danny Murphy contends that Manchester United's struggles stem from player selection and positioning rather than their 3-4-2-1 formation. While acknowledging tactical improvements in team compactness, Murphy highlights individual mistakes, such as Bruno Fernandes's defensive lapses when played deeper, as costing the team goals. The article suggests that manager Ruben Amorim is exacerbating issues by deploying players in roles where their natural instincts or qualities are not optimized, leading to recurring errors despite overall system improvements. Murphy advocates for a shift in personnel to address these fundamental issues.</p>
