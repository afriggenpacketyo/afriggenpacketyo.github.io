While he was in Brisbane preparing for a Test match, his wife, Kayla, gave birth to their fifth child, a daughter named Aine, in the back of a car en route to a hospital in New Zealand. Aki, who had not yet met his newborn, shared the "funny story" with journalists after the match, praising his wife as a "powerful, strong woman" for handling the unexpected delivery.

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, announced that applications for a $50 billion fund to support rural hospitals will be available in early September. The fund is part of legislation that also enacted significant cuts and changes to Medicaid, including new work requirements. Oz stated the money is intended for workforce development and technology implementation like telehealth, arguing it will help stabilize healthcare access in rural areas. This initiative comes as many rural facilities face financial pressure from the broader changes to the Medicaid program.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is planning a compensation scheme for victims of mis-sold car finance, with potential payouts estimated to be under £950 per person. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not deeming hidden commissions unlawful, found that excessively large commissions could be considered unfair. The FCA will consult on the details, but the scheme could cover millions of agreements dating back to 2007, with the industry expected to bear the full cost of the redress program.

          <p>A small earthquake with a magnitude of 3.0 was reported in the New York City and New Jersey area on Saturday night, causing brief shaking but no reported damage or injuries. The U.S. Geological Survey located the epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, about 10 kilometers below the surface. While tremors were felt across the region, officials noted that such minor quakes are not considered significant. This event follows a much stronger 4.8 magnitude earthquake that surprised the area in April 2024, reminding residents of the region's seismic potential.</p>

          <p>The final Test match between England and India is poised for a dramatic conclusion on its fifth day, with the series outcome hanging in the balance. England requires just 35 more runs to win, while India needs four wickets, after a rain-shortened fourth day of incredible tension at The Oval. Sublime centuries from England's Harry Brook and Joe Root seemed to put the hosts in control of their record-breaking chase of 374. However, a late surge from India's bowlers, who took three quick wickets, turned the match on its head.</p>

          <p>With a self-imposed deadline for a new trade deal passed, the U.S. and Canada remain locked in a tariff dispute, though analysts note the situation is complex. While Canada now faces a 35% U.S. tariff rate, a carve-out for goods compliant with the existing USMCA means nearly 90% of its exports can still cross the border duty-free, providing a buffer. Despite this, businesses desire certainty, and Canada continues to negotiate, hoping that pressure from U.S. industries hurt by the tariffs will encourage a resolution that rolls back the punitive measures.

This shift highlights the changing dynamics of global trade, as Brazil, a top coffee producer, seeks to strengthen its commercial ties with China. The move is a direct response to protectionist measures from the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>
