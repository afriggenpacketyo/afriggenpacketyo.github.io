          <p>Bitcoin has surged past $125,000, reaching a new all-time high, with analysts attributing the rally to the U.S. government shutdown prompting investors to seek alternative assets. Historically, the fourth quarter has been strong for the cryptocurrency, and this year is supported by strong demand from ETFs and corporations. While some experts point to favorable macroeconomic conditions and increasing institutional adoption as signs of sustained growth, others caution that the rally may be precarious. Experts advise potential new investors to consider their long-term strategy before buying in at elevated prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve recently cutting interest rates and more reductions expected, savers are evaluating the best place for their money. A comparison of a $10,000 deposit shows that earnings from a Certificate of Deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account are currently very similar over terms ranging from three months to one year. However, a key difference is that CD rates are fixed, guaranteeing a return, while high-yield savings account rates are variable and likely to decrease with future Fed cuts. The article suggests a strategic approach of using both to lock in current high rates while maintaining some liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Space company Firefly Aerospace is acquiring defense technology contractor SciTec in an $855 million cash-and-stock deal aimed at bolstering its national security capabilities. Firefly plans to integrate SciTec's software, which includes missile warning, tracking, and defense systems, into its own launch and space services. The acquisition follows a recent rocket explosion during a ground test that caused Firefly's stock to sink, but the company continues to build key government partnerships, including a major contract with NASA. SciTec will operate as a subsidiary of Firefly once the deal closes later this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) can be an attractive funding source, especially as the Federal Reserve begins cutting interest rates. A $150,000 HELOC with a 10-year repayment term currently costs around $1,811 per month, while a 15-year term costs about $1,424 per month. These costs are lower than they were a year ago and are expected to decrease further with anticipated rate cuts, as HELOCs have variable rates. The article notes that borrowers only make payments on the amount they actually use from the credit line. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For seniors looking to supplement their retirement income, a reverse mortgage can be a viable option, but it requires a substantial amount of home equity. Most lenders require homeowners to have at least 50% to 60% equity to qualify for a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), the most common type. The actual amount that can be borrowed is not the full equity amount but is instead calculated based on the borrower's age, current interest rates, and FHA lending limits. If a homeowner falls short of the equity requirement, options include paying down the existing mortgage or downsizing. (not investment advice)</p>
