          <p>Ethan Mbappe, the 18-year-old brother of superstar Kylian Mbappe, is beginning to forge his own path in professional football after moving to Lille. Previously in the Paris St-Germain youth system, Ethan left the club when his brother's contract was not renewed, a situation Kylian suggested was linked to his own departure. Now playing as a midfielder for Lille, the younger Mbappe is praised for his football intelligence and calm demeanor despite the pressure of his famous surname. He recently scored his first goal for his new club and is preparing to face his former team.</p>

          <p>Nearly four years after its controversial £305m acquisition by a Saudi-led consortium, Newcastle United has undergone significant transformation. The club has modernized its training facilities, won its first major domestic trophy in decades, and qualified for the Champions League under manager Eddie Howe. However, growth has been tempered by financial regulations (PSR), which prevent limitless spending, and ongoing criticism from human rights groups regarding Saudi Arabia's record. The club's journey reflects a gradual build rather than an instant overhaul, balancing on-field ambition with off-field financial realities.</p>

          <p>Beijing is adopting a new public diplomacy strategy in Africa by sponsoring local social media influencers and content creators to visit China. This initiative aims to connect with younger African audiences and present a more positive image of the country, focusing on culture, tourism, and history. Recently, prominent Kenyan influencers were sponsored for a tour of China's Hunan and Fujian provinces to document their experiences for their large online followings. Analysts view this as a significant shift in China's soft power approach, moving beyond traditional state-led media to more personal engagement.</p>

          <p>In his upcoming memoir, music legend Lionel Richie reveals that he was training to become an Episcopal priest before his career in music took off. The 76-year-old icon, who described himself as a very shy young man, was performing with his college band, The Commodores, when a woman in the audience shouted "Sing it, baby!" Richie credits this single moment of encouragement with changing his life's trajectory, prompting him to abandon his clerical training. He realized that his songs could serve as his "real sermons," leading to a celebrated decades-long career.</p>

          <p>Germany's government has unveiled a "Modernization Agenda" aimed at integrating artificial intelligence across public administration to enhance efficiency and reduce bureaucracy. The plans include using AI to streamline visa processing, create online platforms for businesses, and even deploy an AI avatar of a state minister to communicate in multiple languages. While officials emphasize that AI is key to future growth, the initiative has raised concerns among experts about over-reliance on US tech companies and the need for scientific oversight. The push reflects Germany's effort to avoid falling behind in the global technology race.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from deploying the federalized Oregon National Guard to Portland. The judge ruled that the administration failed to meet the high legal standard required to deploy troops without the governor's consent, stating the protests were not disruptive enough to justify such an action. In her decision, the judge noted the country's tradition of resisting military intrusion in civil affairs and warned that the president's actions risked blurring the line between civil and military power. Oregon officials celebrated the ruling as a victory for state sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Six Democratic candidates vying to be California's next governor addressed key issues like housing affordability, cost of living, and healthcare at a labor union forum in San Diego. While largely aligned on policy, candidates sought to differentiate themselves through their personal backgrounds and political experience. Former HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra emphasized his extensive government service, while former Assembly Majority Leader Ian Calderon highlighted his millennial perspective. The event provided a platform for contenders to appeal to the influential AFSCME union as the 2026 gubernatorial field begins to take shape.</p>
