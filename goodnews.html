          <p>China's top intelligence agency, the Ministry of State Security (MSS), has dismissed a recent CIA campaign to recruit Chinese informants as a sign of desperation. The MSS claims the CIA is exaggerating the "China threat" to secure a larger budget.

Lead study author Dr. Eduardo L√≥pez Bran noted that the results exceeded expectations, achieving high percentages of hair regrowth. While these preclinical results are promising, Dr. Bran cautioned that human clinical trials are needed to confirm the findings and ensure safety.</p>
