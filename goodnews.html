        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Constitution mandates 'due process of law' for all non-citizens on U.S. soil, though the specifics remain contested, this article explains. While President Trump insists this doesn't mean individual trials for millions, legal experts confirm the Constitution doesn't guarantee a trial for every migrant detained. The Supreme Court has stated that detainees are entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard, appropriate to the nature of their case. However, the specifics of 'notice' and 'hearing' depend on an immigrant's status and circumstances, such as whether they are seeking asylum, and under the 'expedited removal' program, migrants within 100 miles of the border can be deported without a hearing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several major companies, including Coca-Cola and Constellation Brands, report a slowdown in North American sales from Hispanic shoppers, who represent a significant portion of the U.S. consumer base. Executives attribute this decline to economic concerns and fears surrounding stricter immigration policies. A contributing factor to the dip, some experts say, is fear around stricter immigration policy. The Latino unemployment rate ticked up to a seasonally adjusted 5.2% in April, from 4.8% a year earlier and 5.1% in March, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Some companies are prioritizing efforts to win back Hispanic consumers through targeted advertising and acquisitions.</p>

          <p>The Met Gala, raising a record $31 million for the Costume Institute, officially opened the exhibition 'Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,' which examines 300 years of Black fashion.

The Costume Institute has never had a Black curator, and the Met has its own history of racism. Despite these concerns, the gala was a celebration of Black designers, stylists, and celebrities, with many attendees showcasing daring and memorable looks, including Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor suspended its 2025 financial guidance, anticipating a $2.5 billion impact from President Trump's tariffs, despite beating Wall Street's first-quarter expectations. The company expects to offset $1 billion of these costs, resulting in a net impact of $1.5 billion. Citing near-term risks, including potential supply chain disruptions and future tariffs, Ford is taking a cautious approach. This tariff impact is less than that of General Motors.</p>

The recent dramatic upward swings in the currency were largely driven by exporters' rush to convert U.S. dollar reserves to the local currency as the U.S. dollar faltered, and life insurers' intensified hedging for their U.S. dollar debt holdings.</p>
