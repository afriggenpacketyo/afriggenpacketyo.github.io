          <p>The FDA has approved Moderna's new COVID-19 vaccine, mNexspike, for adults 65 and older and individuals aged 12 to 64 with at least one health condition that increases their risk from the coronavirus. This new vaccine uses a lower dose than Moderna's existing vaccine and is not intended as a replacement, but rather as an additional option. The decision reflects skepticism about vaccines from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other Trump administration officials, differing from the U.S.'s previous approach to COVID-19 vaccines. The FDA's approval was based on a study that found the new vaccine to be safe and at least as effective as the original.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. The incident occurred around 4 a.m., causing the hives to come off the truck and release the bees. Authorities advised the public to avoid the area and stay at least 600 feet away, while more than two dozen beekeepers assisted with the rescue. The road where the truck overturned was closed for about 24 hours to allow the bees to re-hive and find their queen bee.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Delaying Medicare enrollment can result in penalties that can increase premiums for life, but there are exceptions. If you or a spouse is still working for an employer with 20 or more employees, you can generally opt to keep the employer-provided health insurance and delay applying for Medicare without being penalized. Delaying enrollment also allows your husband to continue making contributions on your behalf to his health savings account. Medicare suggests confirming with the employer‚Äôs benefits department to ensure appropriate coverage and eligibility to delay application.</p>
