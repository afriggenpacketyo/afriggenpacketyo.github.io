          <p>Gap's Athleta brand has appointed Maggie Gauger, formerly the head of Nike's women's business in North America, as its new CEO. This move is a significant win for Athleta, which has struggled with declining sales and seen multiple leadership changes, but represents a considerable loss for Nike during a pivotal effort to expand its female customer base. Gauger, a 20-year Nike veteran, was central to the company's strategy to attract more women shoppers, a key growth area. Her departure adds another layer of transition for Nike as it competes with rivals like Athleta and Lululemon, while Athleta hopes her expertise will reinvigorate the brand's performance and appeal.</p>

          <p>YouTube is rolling out a new artificial intelligence tool designed to estimate users' ages to better protect teenagers from inappropriate content. The technology will analyze viewing history and account age to identify users under 18, at which point it will automatically disable personalized ads and limit exposure to certain content categories. If the system incorrectly identifies a user's age, they will have the option to verify it with an ID. The feature, which builds on existing parental controls, will be tested with a small group of U.S. users before a wider rollout, reflecting a broader industry push to enhance safety for younger audiences.</p>

          <h2>Horror Film 'Together' Explores Codependency Through a Visceral Lens</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 15:58:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new film “Together,” starring real-life couple Dave Franco and Alison Brie, presents a unique blend of body horror and relationship drama. The story centers on an unhappy couple who move to a remote forest and discover a mysterious pool of water that causes living things to physically merge. The movie uses this grotesque premise as a metaphor for codependence, exploring how a long-term relationship can cause two people to lose their individual identities. The review praises the film for its empathetic performances, expert misdirection, and effective use of humor to underscore the tragic and fleshy horror of the couple's predicament.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: UK's Conditional Recognition of Palestinian State Faces Political and Practical Hurdles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 15:48:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's announcement to recognize a Palestinian state, conditional on Israeli actions, represents a significant shift in UK foreign policy driven by both public and political pressure. However, this article questions whether the move can be more than a symbolic gesture, given the stringent conditions placed on both Israel and Hamas, which seem unlikely to be met. Critics, including some Labour MPs, are concerned that making recognition conditional on Israel's actions undermines the principle of self-determination for Palestinians. The ultimate impact of the decision may be limited without parallel action from the U.S., which holds greater influence over Israel.</p>

          <p>In one of the largest drug seizures in the country's history, authorities in the Dominican Republic captured 1.5 tons of cocaine from a speedboat after a pursuit lasting over 12 hours. The chase, which involved helicopters, boats, and cars, began off the southern coast and concluded with the arrest of three Dominicans and one Colombian. The operation highlights the Caribbean nation's role as a major transit point for drug trafficking, with officials seizing over 46 tons of drugs in the past year.

          <p>President Trump is actively pursuing a long-held ambition to construct a large ballroom at the White House, a project he believes he is uniquely qualified to oversee. For at least 15 years, Trump has expressed his desire to replace the temporary tents used for large events like state dinners with a permanent, grand structure capable of holding a thousand people. He has reportedly reviewed architectural concepts and suggested construction could begin soon. While Trump sees it as a necessary and beautiful addition, some, like a former Obama-era social secretary, express concern that a large, permanent ballroom could appear tacky and obstruct iconic views of the historic residence.</p>

          <p>Although the Federal Reserve is not expected to cut interest rates at its upcoming meeting, the event is surrounded by significant intrigue. Two Fed governors, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, have advocated for a rate cut and may dissent from the decision to hold rates, a rare occurrence. The meeting will also be the first since President Trump's criticism of the central bank, an issue likely to be addressed by Chair Jerome Powell. While arguments for a rate cut exist due to a stable labor market and limited inflationary impact from tariffs, the consensus points toward the Fed maintaining its current policy until at least September.

          <p>For seniors on fixed incomes, a reverse mortgage can provide a crucial financial buffer by converting home equity into regular payments. This article outlines several important dos and don'ts for those considering this option, especially given current economic pressures like inflation. It advises using the funds for strategic purposes like essential bills, not just as extra cash, and carefully choosing the right payment structure (lump sum, monthly, or line of credit). Seniors are also encouraged to compare reverse mortgages with alternatives like HELOCs and to be prepared for a potentially time-consuming application process that includes mandatory counseling.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral social media post has educated many people on the difference between the spellings "gray" and "grey." In response to a user's question, the Merriam-Webster dictionary clarified that the distinction is primarily geographical. "Gray" with an 'a' is the common spelling in American English, while "grey" with an 'e' is standard in British English and other parts of the world. The explanation drew a variety of reactions, from gratitude for the clarification to lighthearted roasting of American English for its unique spelling conventions, similar to the "color" versus "colour" debate.</p>
