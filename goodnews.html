          <p>The iconic Reel Inn seafood restaurant, a beloved fixture on Pacific Coast Highway for nearly 40 years, faces an uncertain future after being destroyed in the Palisades fire. Owners Andy Leonard and Teddy Seraphine-Leonard are in a state of limbo, negotiating with California State Parks to rebuild on the state-leased land. After initial communications suggested they could not rebuild, the state agency has reversed its stance, now expressing a commitment to help bring the restaurant back. However, a clear timeline for its potential return remains elusive for the community landmark.</p>

His phenomenal 2024-25 season, where he scored 35 goals and led PSG to a treble, was pivotal. Manager Luis Enrique strategically moved him into a more central, goal-scoring role after Kylian Mbappe's departure, unlocking his world-class talent.</p>

          <p>The Walt Disney Company has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air on Tuesday, nearly a week after it was suspended indefinitely. The show was pulled following comments Kimmel made about the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which drew criticism and pressure from figures including the FCC Chairman. Disney stated the suspension was to avoid "inflaming a tense situation" and that the decision to bring the show back was made after "thoughtful conversations" with the host, resolving a significant media controversy.</p>

          <p>A new, tiny quasi-moon, designated 2025 PN7, has been discovered orbiting the sun in a path similar to Earth's. Scientists at the University of Hawaii first spotted the object, estimated to be between 60 to 120 feet across, and believe it has been Earth's travel companion for about 60 years. Unlike a true moon, quasi-moons are not gravitationally bound to Earth but follow a similar orbital path. This provides rare opportunities for scientists to study a single near-Earth asteroid over an extended period.</p>

          <p>England's Hannah Hampton, recently named the world's best female goalkeeper, has overcome significant adversity, including a serious eye condition that doctors warned should prevent her from playing football.

A senior White House official expressed confidence that China has approved the deal, which would allow the app to continue operating for its 170 million American users under new oversight.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, homeowners looking to borrow $50,000 may find both home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) more affordable. Currently, a $50,000 HELOC is slightly cheaper on a monthly basis than a fixed-rate home equity loan for both 10- and 15-year terms. However, homeowners must weigh this small initial saving against the risk of the HELOC's variable rate, which could increase in the future, unlike the stable payments of a home equity loan.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to stop construction on the Revolution Wind farm, allowing Danish energy company Orsted to resume work on the project. The Interior Department had issued a stop-work order for the nearly completed wind farm off the coast of New England, a move Orsted challenged as unlawful and issued in bad faith. The judge's ruling for a temporary injunction is a significant setback for the administration's stated goal of shutting down the U.S. offshore wind industry.</p>
