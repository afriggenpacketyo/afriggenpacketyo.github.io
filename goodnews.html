          <p>A writer shares her personal experience of being diagnosed with very high cholesterol and advised to change her diet, years after recovering from anorexia. The essay explores the complex emotional and psychological challenges of adopting "healthy" eating habits when one's identity has been shaped by both the disorder and a performative recovery that rejected all food restrictions. The author criticizes societal health messaging that conflates weight with health and the design of health apps that can trigger disordered eating patterns. She reflects on the difficult journey of balancing physical health needs with mental well-being.</p>

          <p>Thirty years ago, Mike Tyson's return to boxing after a prison sentence for sexual assault marked a pivotal moment for the sport's pay-per-view model. The highly promoted fight against Peter McNeeley, which lasted only 89 seconds, shattered viewership records despite being a blatant mismatch, attracting a massive celebrity audience. This article reflects on how the event, promoted as "He's Back," demonstrated that spectacle and celebrity could triumph over competitive substance. It set a precedent for future high-profile exhibition matches and influencer boxing, proving that Tyson's controversial mystique and drawing power remained potent.</p>

          <p>Social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram are rapidly changing the way people communicate, a phenomenon explored in Adam Aleksic's book, "Algospeak: How Social Media is Transforming the Future of Language." The article discusses how algorithms, which prioritize engagement, have given rise to a new lexicon of viral memes and phrases that spread globally at an unprecedented speed. This digital evolution of language is rewiring how individuals, particularly younger generations, interact and express themselves both online and offline, creating new linguistic norms.</p>

          <p>In the Swedish city of Kiruna, a landmark 113-year-old wooden church is being moved in its entirety to a new location 5 kilometers away. The complex, two-day operation involves hoisting the 672-tonne structure onto giant rolling platforms to save it from ground subsidence caused by over a century of iron ore mining. This event is a key part of a broader project to relocate parts of the city threatened by ground fissures from the mine, which is the area's largest employer. The church's treasures, including a large altar painting and a 1,000-pipe organ, are being moved while still inside the structure.</p>

          <p>The exclusive members' club chain Soho House is being taken private in a $2.7 billion (£2 billion) acquisition by a consortium led by U.S. hotel group MCR Hotels. Actor and investor Ashton Kutcher is part of the deal and will join the company's board. Since going public in 2021, Soho House has struggled to achieve profitability and has faced criticism that its rapid expansion diluted its exclusive brand. The deal, which returns the company to private ownership, is seen as an effort to stabilize its business model away from the pressures of public market reporting.</p>

          <p>China has revealed images of a new crewed tilt-rotor aircraft, marking a significant advancement in its military aviation capabilities. The prototype, which appears to be manned, combines the vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) abilities of a helicopter with the speed and range of a fixed-wing plane, similar to the U.S. V-22 Osprey. While this technology offers enhanced versatility for military operations, it is also known for its significant mechanical complexity, high costs, and historical safety challenges. This development represents China's first publicly shown crewed aircraft of this type.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi stated that China and India should be partners, not adversaries, during a visit to Delhi aimed at improving bilateral relations. The meeting with his Indian counterpart, S. Jaishankar, is only the second of its kind since deadly border clashes in 2020 severely strained ties. Both sides acknowledged they are seeking to move forward from a difficult period, with discussions covering trade, border disputes, and other issues. This visit is seen as a step toward normalizing relations and may lay the groundwork for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit China for an upcoming regional security summit.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Open has reimagined its mixed doubles tournament, attracting top singles stars like Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu with a massive prize pool and a shorter format. The move is intended to generate more fan interest and media attention for the event. However, it has drawn criticism from doubles specialists, who argue that it transforms a Grand Slam competition into a "glorified exhibition" and denies them significant earning opportunities. The article explores this divide, highlighting the USTA's push for innovation and commercial appeal against the concerns of players who feel the changes devalue the tradition of the discipline.</p>

          <p>A team of researchers and volunteers has used artificial intelligence to create facial reconstructions of Welsh convicts who were deported to Australia in the 19th century. By analyzing detailed prisoner records, historical sketches, and in some cases, photos of modern descendants, the project brings the faces of these individuals to life. The research traces the stories of 60 people from Anglesey, who were transported for crimes ranging from sheep theft to stealing a handkerchief. The project sheds light on a period when an estimated 162,000 convicts were sent to Australia, where having a convict ancestor is now a point of pride.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Travelers are increasingly opting for "coolcations," choosing destinations with more temperate climates over traditional Mediterranean hotspots to avoid extreme summer heat and wildfires. This shift in tourism is driving interest in places like Scandinavia, the Scottish Highlands, and Slovenia, as well as prompting more travel during the cooler spring and autumn shoulder seasons. While this trend may alleviate overtourism in southern Europe, it also poses economic challenges for countries like Greece and Spain that rely heavily on peak-season tourism. Experts predict this behavioral shift will solidify, redefining Europe's traditional travel seasons.</p>

          <p>The Hepworth Wakefield art gallery has successfully raised £3.8 million to purchase "Sculpture With Colour (Oval Form) Pale Blue And Red," a significant piece by Dame Barbara Hepworth. The acquisition prevents the sculpture from being sold to a private international buyer and ensures it will remain on permanent public display in the artist's hometown. The fundraising campaign was a major success, receiving over 2,800 public donations alongside large grants from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Art Fund. The piece is a rare example of Hepworth's wooden carvings from the 1940s.</p>

This article highlights initiatives like "Wharf Connect" in London, which organizes free events such as dumpling-making classes and pub quizzes for young workers. These structured, activity-focused gatherings provide a low-pressure environment for a generation that reports high levels of loneliness and may have underdeveloped social skills due to remote work. The trend reflects a broader rejection of purely digital connections in favor of building tangible, real-life communities.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports to the Global South have doubled since 2015, with a significant acceleration following the U.S.-China trade war, according to a new S&P report. In the last five years, these exports grew by 65%, far outpacing the 28% growth in exports to the United States. China now sends over 50% more goods to the developing world than to the U.S. and Western Europe combined. Analysts suggest that ongoing trade uncertainties with the West will continue to push Chinese firms to deepen their commercial ties with the Global South, potentially creating a new center of gravity in global trade.
