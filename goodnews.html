          <p>Donald Trump has endorsed Jack Ciattarelli for New Jersey governor, marking a shift from Ciattarelli's past criticisms of Trump, including calling him a "charlatan." Trump stated that Ciattarelli is now "ALL IN" and will work closely with his administration if elected. Ciattarelli responded positively to the endorsement, emphasizing the need to unite the party and make New Jersey affordable and safe again. The endorsement has drawn criticism from other Republican candidates and the Democratic Governors Association, who claim Ciattarelli would prioritize Trump's agenda over New Jersey's interests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reports on an anticlimactic auction of the Riggio family art collection at Christie's in New York, signaling a potential slowdown in the art market. The auction, featuring works by modern masters, fell short of pre-sale expectations, with experts citing economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs as a contributing factor. While some artworks sold above estimates, the overall sale lacked enthusiastic bidding, and a major Warhol painting was withdrawn. The article suggests that the weakness in the Warhol market and the overpricing of some items contributed to the lackluster results.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has released a model ordinance urging cities to implement bans against homeless encampments, citing the need to take back the streets and provide alternatives. Newsom emphasized that there are no more excuses for inaction and that the state is providing resources. The model ordinance requires that policies prioritize shelter and services and must not unduly limit local authority to clear encampments. This effort is supported by $3.3 billion in new Prop 1 funding, and comes as Newsom approaches the end of his term.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the use of GLP-1 drugs, originally for diabetes, for weight loss and metabolic health, focusing on the importance of reducing visceral fat rather than just weight. The article highlights that GLP-1 drugs can be remarkably effective at reducing visceral fat, improving metabolic health.
