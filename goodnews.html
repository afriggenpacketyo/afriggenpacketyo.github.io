          <h2>FDA Reconsiders Approval of Food Additive Azodicarbonamide Due to Safety Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA is revisiting its approval of azodicarbonamide (ADA), a food additive used to whiten flour and improve bread dough, following concerns about its safety. ADA, also known as the "yoga mat chemical" due to its use in plastics, is banned in Europe because it can break down into semicarbazide, a possible carcinogen. While the FDA previously deemed ADA safe, international health authorities have raised concerns, prompting a renewed safety review of ADA and other additives like BHT and BHA. The FDA plans to release a modernized prioritization scheme for reviewing chemicals in the food supply for public comment later this month. The agency's systematic process to review the safety of chemicals in the food supply will soon be finalized after receiving over 70,000 comments on its post-market review process framework.</p>

          <p>WWE star Rhea Ripley has called out wrestling fans who criticize female wrestlers, arguing that their negativity hinders the perception of women's wrestling as a serious sport. Ripley, a three-time WWE women's champion, emphasized that these toxic fans undermine the progress and achievements of women in the industry. She encouraged fans to focus on their own lives rather than degrading successful women. WWE has been investing in women's wrestling for over a decade, with numerous superstars emerging, and has recently introduced midcard championships for women.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding the Trump administration's executive order seeking to limit birthright citizenship, focusing on the legality of nationwide injunctions issued by lower courts. Justices questioned the government's lawyer on how the policy, which aims to deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents without legal status, could be implemented and enforced. Concerns were raised about the practicality of hospitals and states adapting to the new policy within the given 30-day timeframe. Several justices suggested that the order goes against established Supreme Court precedents, while others focused on whether lower court judges have the authority to issue sweeping injunctions that halt presidential policies nationwide.</p>

          <p>A new report from Healthy Babies, Bright Futures reveals that rice sold in U.S. stores contains high levels of toxic heavy metals, including arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury. Arsenic was found in 100% of the rice samples tested, with one in four samples exceeding the FDA's limit for infant rice cereal. The report tested 105 brands from 20 metro areas, finding arsenic at the highest levels, followed by cadmium. The USA Rice Federation stated that while they do not believe there is a public health safety issue, they will continue to work with the FDA to ensure the U.S. rice supply meets any established threshold. To reduce exposure, the report suggests cooking rice like pasta, using rice alternatives, and choosing rice wisely, opting for Calrose, sushi, and white rice grown in California, jasmine rice from Thailand or Basmati rice from India.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Investing in gold should not be based on a fixed schedule but rather viewed as a strategic portfolio component. Conventional wisdom suggests allocating no more than 10% of a portfolio to gold as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. The frequency of investment depends on individual financial goals and risk tolerance, aiming to reach the recommended allocation over time. Waiting for a "cheap time" to invest may be futile due to gold's long-term price appreciation, but existing investors might consider rebalancing their portfolios after significant price surges.

          <p>Harvard Law Library has discovered that a document acquired in 1946 for just $27.50 is an authentic 1300 Magna Carta, a rare find with only about two dozen originals known to exist. David Carpenter, a medieval history professor, identified the document while searching through Harvard's digital archives. The Magna Carta, initially signed in 1215, is a crucial historical document that influenced the U.S. Constitution by establishing the principle that even the monarchy is not above the law and guaranteeing certain rights. The final iteration of the document dates to 1300, and only six other copies are known to exist.</p>

          <p>Walmart has cautioned that even with reduced tariffs on Chinese imports, the company may need to raise prices on certain items. CEO Doug McMillon stated that tariffs are creating cost pressures, particularly in categories like electronics and toys, despite efforts to absorb some of the impact. The retailer has also pulled its quarterly profit outlook due to global economic uncertainty. CFO John David Rainey noted that a return to dramatically higher tariff levels could jeopardize the company's ability to grow earnings year-over-year.

Justice Sotomayor argued that the executive order violates Supreme Court precedents, while the administration defended the order as protecting the value of American citizenship.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding President Trump's attempt to end birthright citizenship, with justices questioning the legality of nationwide injunctions blocking the policy. The case centers on Trump's executive order to limit U.S. citizenship only to children born to lawful permanent residents. Arguments addressed the authority of individual district court judges to block presidential policies nationwide. Justices expressed concerns about the potential for chaos and confusion if citizenship rules varied across different states, while the Trump administration argued that nationwide injunctions impede the executive branch's ability to implement policies.</p>

          <p>Doctors have successfully treated a baby born with a rare genetic disorder using a gene-editing therapy specifically designed to repair his unique mutation. The infant, KJ Muldoon, received three infusions containing billions of microscopic gene-editors targeted at his liver. While long-term results are pending, initial signs indicate the treatment has partially reversed his condition, reducing the risk of brain damage. This marks a significant step towards personalized medicine, offering potential transformative treatments for patients with extremely rare disorders. The treatment, developed through an international collaboration, offers hope for a new approach to addressing rare genetic diseases.</p>

          <p>Following several major potential Republican candidates declining to run in key U.S. Senate races in 2026, questions have arisen about whether the party is struggling to recruit competitive candidates. High-profile Republicans like Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia and former Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire opted not to run for Senate. Some Republicans suggest this may indicate challenges in recruiting centrist candidates who appeal to voters statewide. Others argue that these decisions do not necessarily signal broader recruiting issues and that other factors, such as family considerations, may be at play.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in a case challenging the constitutional provision of birthright citizenship, but the focus shifted to the power of federal district court judges to issue nationwide injunctions. The justices appeared divided on the issue, with some skeptical of the Trump administration's argument that lower courts should not have this right. Justice Brown Jackson expressed concern that the argument would create a "catch me if you can" system of justice. President Trump has long maintained that the Constitution does not guarantee birthright citizenship, issuing an executive order to that effect.</p>
