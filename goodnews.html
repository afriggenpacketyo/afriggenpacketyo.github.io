          <p>Retired UFC star Jon Jones has been exonerated after New Mexico prosecutors dropped charges related to a traffic incident in February. The case was dismissed after Jones's legal team presented cell phone records proving he was not at the scene of the crash, arguing the accusation was falsely made by an intoxicated driver to avoid a DWI charge. Jones's attorney stated they were "fully vindicated" and are now reviewing the conduct of the Albuquerque Police Department during the investigation. Despite his retirement, Jones has hinted at a possible return to fighting in 2026.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has ruled to reinstate Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat who was fired by President Donald Trump. In a 2-1 decision, the court affirmed that FTC commissioners can only be removed by a president for cause, citing nearly a century of legal precedent. The ruling allows Slaughter to immediately return to her role at the agency, which is responsible for enforcing consumer protection and antitrust laws. The legal dispute underscores the ongoing tension regarding the independence of federal regulatory agencies from partisan political influence.</p>

          <p>A jury has cleared rapper Cardi B of all liability in a $24 million civil lawsuit brought by a security guard who alleged assault and battery. The plaintiff, Emani Ellis, claimed the rapper scratched and spat on her during a 2018 confrontation outside a doctor's office while Cardi B was pregnant. The rapper testified that while a heated verbal exchange occurred, she never physically touched the guard, a version of events supported by witnesses. After less than an hour of deliberation, the jury found in favor of the artist, who stated outside the courthouse that she would deny the charges "on my deathbed."</p>

          <p>A forthcoming book by Valentine Low, "Power and the Palace," details several notable claims about the British royal family's interactions with the political world. Among the anecdotes, the book alleges that Queen Camilla fought off a sexual assault as a teenager and that the late Queen Elizabeth II was privately in favor of remaining in the European Union. The article also recounts stories about interactions between royals and politicians, including Michael Gove, Boris Johnson, and Tony Blair. Buckingham Palace has not commented on the book's claims, which offer a behind-the-scenes look at the monarchy.</p>

          <p>The Kilauea volcano on Hawaii's Big Island has resumed its eruption, with fountains of lava shooting up to 330 feet into the air from its summit crater. This marks the 32nd episode of the current eruption that began in December 2024, with all activity so far contained within Halemaʻumaʻu crater in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The U.S. Geological Survey noted that lava is emerging from multiple vents, driven by magma accumulating in a lower chamber. Scientists are monitoring the volcano, noting that while the spectacular fountains continue, their height has recently decreased.</p>

          <p>Shares of Google's parent company, Alphabet, jumped 8% in after-hours trading following a federal judge's ruling in its landmark antitrust case. Investors reacted positively as the court declined to impose the most severe penalties sought by the Department of Justice, such as the forced sale of the Chrome browser. While the judge found Google held an illegal monopoly, the remedies focus on barring exclusive contracts and requiring some data sharing, rather than a structural breakup. The decision was viewed as a significant win for the tech giant, alleviating market fears of a more disruptive outcome. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Police forces and councils across the UK are issuing fresh warnings about a rise in parking-related scams. These fraudulent schemes include fake text messages demanding payment for non-existent fines and tampered payment machines equipped with "skimming" devices to steal credit card details. To protect themselves, consumers are advised to verify that any fine notification includes their vehicle registration, the time, and location of the alleged offense. Additionally, people should be wary of clicking links in unsolicited texts and physically inspect payment machines for any suspicious attachments before use.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bipartisan bill aimed at imposing sanctions on Chinese officials who fail to take action against the trafficking of fentanyl and its precursors. The legislation would also target Chinese manufacturers and distributors who do not implement credible measures to prevent the flow of synthetic opioids. The bill's sponsor argued for the necessity of targeting the source of production in China. While supporting the measure, some Democrats emphasized that sanctions alone are insufficient and that effective diplomacy is also essential to address the crisis.</p>

          <p>In a detailed ruling, a federal judge has ordered significant changes to Google's search business to curb its illegal monopoly but stopped short of breaking up the company. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta rejected the Justice Department's request to force a sale of the Chrome browser, calling it an "incredibly messy and highly risky" step. Instead, the remedies prohibit certain exclusive default-search deals and, crucially, require Google to provide rivals with access to some of its valuable search query data. The decision attempts to restore competition while acknowledging the influence of emerging AI technologies.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has delivered a scathing ruling, finding that the Trump administration's deployment of National Guardsmen and Marines in Los Angeles constituted a "serious violation of the Posse Comitatus Act." The 1878 law prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement except under specific circumstances not met in this case. The judge's opinion detailed how the administration attempted to circumvent the law by creating a "constitutional exception" to justify the operation. The ruling blocks further such deployments in California and rejects the administration's expansive claims of presidential power.</p>

          <p>Following a market decline where all major indices fell, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to trust the quality of the companies they own for long-term gains. He attributed the drop primarily to profit-taking in Big Tech stocks, a common occurrence in September, rather than fundamental weaknesses in the companies themselves. Cramer also noted that investor anxiety is being fueled by a recent court ruling on tariffs and anticipation of the upcoming labor report. He recommended holding onto strong growth stocks and cautioned against making reactive decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zack Polanski's landslide victory as the new leader of the Green Party of England and Wales signals a potential shift in UK left-wing politics. His blunt, digitally-savvy communication style presents a new challenge for the Labour Party, which is already facing pressure from other factions on the left. The analysis questions how Polanski's brash, left-wing approach will resonate with the party's more traditional, rural supporters who previously backed his rivals. There is also potential for conflict or collaboration with a new party being formed by Jeremy Corbyn, as both could be competing for the same voter base.</p>

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot grows to an estimated $1.3 billion, an analysis of the lottery's data highlights key factors for potential winners. The after-tax value of the prize varies significantly by state, with winners in states like Florida and Texas taking home the most due to no state income tax on winnings. Conversely, a winner in New York would receive the lowest payout after taxes. The data also reveals the most and least frequently drawn numbers over the last 100 drawings, although lottery officials emphasize that each draw is a random event with odds of winning the jackpot at 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

Walden, who struggled to gain traction in a field that includes Mayor Eric Adams and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, had previously proposed a "drop out challenge" that his competitors did not accept.</p>
