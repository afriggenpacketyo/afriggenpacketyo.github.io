        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to growing pressure, President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to petition the court for the release of grand jury transcripts related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. The move came shortly after the Wall Street Journal published a story about an alleged letter from Trump to Epstein, which the president has decried as fake and threatened to sue over. The directive has been met with mixed reactions, with some supporters praising it as a step toward transparency while critics argue it is a limited gesture that will not reveal the full scope of evidence.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author reflects on turning 35 and the realization that adulthood does not come with all the answers. He muses that most people are simply "winging it" through a constant process of becoming. Using the French comedy series "Bref" as a bookend to his own journey as an American immigrant in France, he explores themes of nostalgia, regret, and the formation of identity. The author concludes that while living in a world facing immense challenges, the goal is to build a meaningful life, stay open to the unexpected, and hope that the pieces will make sense in retrospect.</p>

          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province has captured local attention by inventing and building his own 7-meter submarine. The inventor, identified only as Zhang, said he had been fascinated by machines since childhood and was inspired by a television program featuring a submarine in 2014. Using 5,000 yuan (about $700) he had saved, he purchased steel plates, a battery, and an engine to secretly construct the vessel. His creation, a sleek black craft, has been seen navigating a local river, fulfilling his lifelong dream of building a machine that could travel underwater.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has acknowledged that European nations have historically done too little to fund their own defense, effectively "free-riding" on U.S. security guarantees. In an interview with the BBC, Merz stated that Europe has heard the U.S. call to increase its contributions and is now doing more to bolster its own security. This shift comes in response to Russia's war in Ukraine and pressure from the Trump administration. Merz emphasized a growing triangular alliance between Germany, the UK, and France to focus on security, foreign policy, and economic growth.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people across all 50 U.S. states participated in marches and rallies to protest the Trump administration and honor the legacy of civil rights icon John Lewis. The "Good Trouble Lives On" day of action, coinciding with the fifth anniversary of Lewis's death, involved over 1,500 events organized by dozens of advocacy groups. Protesters' demands included an end to crackdowns on civil and voting rights, the targeting of minority groups, and cuts to social programs. The events were inspired by Lewis's call to engage in "good trouble, necessary trouble" to advance justice.</p>

          <h2>China Unveils New Military Drone with Vertical Take-Off and Landing Capability</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 22:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has debuted a new military drone that takes off and lands vertically on its tail, similar to a rocket. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), developed by state-owned Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, demonstrated its reconnaissance and situational awareness capabilities in a recent drill. Its design allows it to fly much faster than a quadcopter while retaining the flexibility of vertical take-off and landing, eliminating the need for a runway. The drone's intelligent control system also showcased advanced autonomous functions, such as target allocation and threat avoidance, which are vital for potential swarm operations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix has used generative artificial intelligence for on-screen visual effects for the first time in one of its original productions. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos announced that AI was used to create a building collapse scene in the Argentine sci-fi show "The Eternauts." He positioned the technology as an opportunity to enhance creativity and make advanced effects feasible for productions with smaller budgets, stating it was ten times faster than traditional methods. The use of generative AI remains a controversial topic in Hollywood, where it has sparked fears of job displacement and was a key issue in the 2023 actors' strike.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Trump, 79, was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described CVI as a benign and common condition where leg veins have difficulty sending blood back to the heart. A letter from the presidential physician affirmed that Trump "remains in excellent health" and that tests found no evidence of more serious conditions like deep vein thrombosis. The announcement addresses recent public speculation about images showing the president with swollen legs and a bruised hand.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) may soon change its restrictions on liquids in carry-on bags. Speaking at a conference, Noem said she is questioning "everything TSA does" and that the rules on liquid sizes could be the next major announcement. This follows the recent immediate removal of the requirement for passengers to take off their shoes during security checks. The potential change is linked to the deployment of new CT scanners at airports, which provide more detailed 3D images of bag contents, enhancing security screening capabilities.</p>

          <p>The annual Congressional Women's Softball Game brought together female lawmakers from both parties to compete against a team of journalists, setting aside partisan politics for a greater cause. Unlike the men's game, which pits Republicans against Democrats, the women play on one unified "Team Congress." The event raises money for the Young Survival Coalition, a charity that supports young adults diagnosed with breast cancer. Co-founded in 2009 by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a breast cancer survivor herself, the game has raised nearly $5 million and serves as a powerful symbol of bipartisan unity.</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old from Essex, England, has fully immersed himself in the culture of the 1940s, from his clothing and music choices to his job at an antiques shop. The teenager, named Lincoln, developed a passion for the era after learning about the World Wars and was drawn to its sense of community and elegance. His wardrobe is composed entirely of period clothing, he listens to orchestras from the time, and he even rides a 1939 bicycle. He believes it is important to remember the sacrifices made during that period and hopes to one day decorate his own home entirely with 1940s items.</p>
