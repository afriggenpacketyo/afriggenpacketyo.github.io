          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced a partial U-turn on winter fuel payments, ensuring more people receive the allowance this winter. The payment, designed to help cover energy costs, was previously limited to those on pension credit, a policy that drew criticism. While details are forthcoming, the government aims to expand eligibility without reverting to the previous system of universal payments to all pensioners. Pensions Minister Torsten Bell emphasized the goal of avoiding payments to high-income individuals while ensuring support for those in need. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Rijksmuseum in the Netherlands is exhibiting a Victorian-era condom adorned with erotic art, offering a glimpse into 19th-century sexuality and sexual health. The condom, made around 1830 from a sheep's appendix, features an image of a nun and clergymen. The museum acquired the condom to highlight the lighter and darker sides of sexual health during a time when sensual pleasure was intertwined with fears of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. The exhibit, titled "Safe Sex?", aims to shed light on underrepresented aspects of 19th-century life.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the American Museum of Natural History made a surprising discovery about the Oort Cloud while preparing a planetarium show. During the fine-tuning of a scene, they noticed a spiral shape within the inner section of the Oort Cloud, challenging the previous understanding of its structure. This unexpected finding, relying on data about celestial object movements and simulations, suggests a more complex shape than a sphere or flattened shell. The discovery highlights the potential for accidental findings in scientific endeavors and the importance of accurate data representation.</p>

The Shanghai Jiao Tong University researchers said their optical fibre network is scalable, showing the viability of this kind of quantum network. The quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network uses multiple lasers to send paired photons between users, with added noise to help hide the signals. The researchers said realizing a 10,000km-level quantum communication network with many users remains a significant challenge.</p>

          <p>Researchers have identified a "sustain" phase in the brain that links experiences to emotions. Following an experience, a signal lingers in the brain, generalizing the emotional state. This sustained signal allows the experience to interact with other stimuli, influencing emotional responses. The findings may help explain emotional differences in neuropsychiatric conditions. However, some researchers argue that the lingering signal may not be specific to emotion but could also be involved in other cognitive processes.</p>
