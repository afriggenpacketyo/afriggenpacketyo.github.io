          <p>Joseph Nye, the American scholar known as the father of 'soft power,' passed away, prompting varied reactions in China. During his life, Chinese scholars widely praised Nye's concept of soft power, which emphasizes cultural and value-based influence over hard power tactics. However, after his death, Chinese scholars expressed caution regarding his intellectual legacy, suggesting his policy influence was limited and his stance towards China was not always perceived as friendly. Despite this, Nye's soft power concept has been embraced by Chinese leaders, including President Xi Jinping, and has been the subject of numerous studies by Chinese scholars and officials.</p>

          <p>A Florida federal judge dismissed the majority of claims against celebrities and YouTubers who endorsed the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The lawsuit alleged that these high-profile figures promoted FTX without disclosing their financial incentives, violating advertising laws. However, the judge ruled that the plaintiffs failed to prove the celebrities had sufficient knowledge of FTX's misconduct to be held liable for promoting the exchange. This decision narrows the scope of the litigation following FTX's collapse in 2022, which resulted in billions of dollars in customer losses.</p>

Gates expressed concern that progress may be stalled due to aid cuts from the U.S. and European countries.

          <p>A trade deal between the United States and the United Kingdom is expected to provide some economic relief and boost confidence, but it faces limitations in significantly lifting the overall British economy. The deal is likely to support sectors like the auto industry, but the U.K.'s trade is heavily skewed towards services, which are not directly impacted by tariffs. Economists suggest that the greater threat to Britain is the global uncertainty created by Trump's trade policies, rather than specific tariffs on Britain, as domestic factors are more central to the U.K.'s economic story.</p>
