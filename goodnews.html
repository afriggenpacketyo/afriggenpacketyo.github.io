        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The World Bank has increased its 2025 growth forecast for China to 4.8%, up from 4%, despite ongoing U.S. trade tensions that saw tariffs on Chinese imports temporarily surge. This revised projection aligns more closely with China's official target, attributing the boost to government stimulus and resilient exports, particularly to Southeast Asia and Europe, which offset declines in U.S. shipments. However, economists anticipate a slowdown to 4.2% in 2026 as stimulus measures are toned down and domestic drags like a real estate slump and tepid consumer spending persist. Challenges also include high youth unemployment and structural issues differentiating Chinese startups from their U.S. counterparts. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD experienced an 880% surge in UK sales in September year-on-year, making the UK its largest market outside China with 11,271 cars sold. This growth is attributed to the UK's lack of tariffs on Chinese EVs, unlike the EU and US, which have imposed levies to protect domestic manufacturers. BYD's market share in the UK jumped to 3.6%, and the company plans to launch more hybrid and electric models, having recently opened its 100th retail outlet. Despite a record high in overall EV sales in the UK, petrol and diesel vehicles still constitute over half of new car sales. (not investment advice)</p>

The university's Vice Chancellor stated that due diligence was followed, presenting the campus as a strategic move to address financial pressures in the higher education sector and boost transnational education. While acknowledging Kazakhstan's historical human rights issues, the university believes its presence will help educate future leaders with shared values. The project, which has over 300 students, is funded by the Kazakhstani government and a business group.</p>

          <p>England and Manchester City defender John Stones revealed he considered retiring last season due to recurring foot and hamstring injuries that limited his appearances. The 31-year-old, who hasn't played for England since October 2024, described the mental toll of constant breakdowns despite his professional efforts. Although he ultimately decided against it, driven by a fighting and winning mentality, the period was "very difficult." Stones is now back in the England squad for upcoming matches, and his value to manager Thomas Tuchel was evident when he was asked to join a training camp while injured, demonstrating his commitment and leadership qualities to the team.</p>

          <p>Pine martens have been reintroduced to Exmoor National Park for the first time in a century, as part of the Two Moors Pine Marten Project. Nineteen animals, sourced from Scottish populations, were released at undisclosed locations last month, each fitted with a radio collar for monitoring. Conservationists hail this as a "positive sign for nature," emphasizing the species' critical role in woodland ecosystems and its "balancing effect." This article notes that the reintroduction aims to restore native wildlife, which had declined due to hunting and habitat loss. The timing was chosen to allow the animals to benefit from abundant autumn fruits, following a similar successful reintroduction on Dartmoor.</p>

          <p>Tesla is expected to unveil a more affordable version of its popular Model Y SUV on Tuesday, aiming to counteract falling sales and diminishing market share amidst increasing global competition. CEO Elon Musk has previously hinted at mass-market vehicles, though earlier plans for a $25,000 EV were canceled. This article suggests the new "affordable" vehicle will be based on existing manufacturing platforms, with key questions remaining about its exact price and driving range, potentially below $30,000 including U.S. EV tax credits. The launch comes as Tesla grapples with slowing demand for its current lineup and challenges from Musk's political views impacting brand loyalty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California has passed a new law requiring streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime to standardize audio levels, preventing commercials from being significantly louder than the programs they interrupt. This legislation extends existing Federal Communications Commission regulations, which have applied to broadcast and cable television since 2010, to the previously exempt streaming platforms. Governor Gavin Newsom signed the bill, emphasizing the public's desire for consistent volume. The article highlights that the bill was inspired by a state senator's aide whose newborn was disturbed by blaring ads, aiming to bring "much-needed peace and quiet" to California households and potentially setting a national standard due to the industry's concentration in the state.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is poised to strengthen its role as a "superconnector" by potentially joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), with strong support from ASEAN economic ministers. This article highlights that RCEP membership would significantly deepen Hong Kong's already extensive trade ties with Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania, where 70% of its merchandise trade occurs. The agreement aims to eliminate 90% of tariffs over two decades, offering substantial benefits to Hong Kong businesses, particularly SMEs, through reduced overhead costs and logistical obstacles. Accession would also lower import costs, increasing high-quality consumer goods inflow and reducing manufacturing expenses for downstream firms. (not investment advice)</p>
