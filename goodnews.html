        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's administration has made "copper plans" available on ObamaCare exchanges to most Americans, a move touted to significantly reduce healthcare costs. Previously restricted to those under 30 or with rare hardship exemptions, these plans offer lower premiums with slightly higher out-of-pocket costs, potentially saving families thousands annually. The reform aims to address rising ObamaCare prices and expand coverage for uninsured individuals, especially healthier younger demographics, thereby stabilizing the market. This initiative is presented as a solution to ObamaCare's fundamental problems, offering more affordable options to millions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India urged BRICS members to address its significant trade deficits with them, particularly China and Russia, while the bloc collectively rallied against U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar highlighted India's largest trade deficits being with BRICS partners, advocating for smoother trade flows and dedicated initiatives to boost exports among member states. This stance contrasted with Brazil and China, who took veiled swipes at Washington's trade policies, warning against "Hegemonism, unilateralism, and protectionism." Despite these trade tensions, India and the U.S. have shown signs of improving relations, recognizing their mutual strategic importance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ange Postecoglou is reportedly a strong candidate to replace Nuno Espirito Santo as head coach at Nottingham Forest, following Nuno's sacking late Monday night. The club is actively advancing its efforts to secure a replacement, with sources indicating that initial contact has already taken place with Postecoglou, 60. There is a palpable sense that an agreement is possible for him to take the helm, signaling a swift move by Nottingham Forest to usher in new leadership. This development aims to bring a fresh direction to their football team after the recent managerial change.</p>

          <p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has entered the Labour deputy leader contest, becoming the most senior figure to put her name forward, joining Dame Emily Thornberry and Bell Ribeiro-Addy. The race follows Angela Rayner's resignation after admitting tax errors related to her £800,000 flat in Hove. Candidates face a tight three-day window to secure nominations from at least 80 Labour MPs, with the winner announced on October 25. The contest highlights internal party divisions, with Ribeiro-Addy representing a more critical voice on issues like Gaza and welfare cuts, while Phillipson aims to project a supportive image for the current government's policies and values.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. court ruled against breaking up Google in a major antitrust challenge, a decision significantly influenced by the rapid emergence of generative AI, which the judge acknowledged could fundamentally disrupt the search engine market. The ruling requires Google to share some information with rivals to increase competition and establish an oversight committee to manage compliance, rather than forcing it to divest its lucrative Chrome browser or Android operating system. This landmark decision reflects the judiciary's struggle to keep pace with fast-evolving technology, as AI chatbots threaten to fundamentally change how users access information online, challenging Google's long-held dominance and market position.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed following a tech-led rally on Wall Street, with Japan's Nikkei 225 retreating after hitting a record high earlier in the day, influenced by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation.

Investors are also anticipating key U.S. inflation reports, including the producer price index and consumer price index, with hopes for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts fueled by recent weaker hiring data.

The campaign focused on rising living costs, the oil industry, and reforming a wealth tax. While coalition building is expected to take several weeks, the outcome demonstrates that social democratic parties can still win despite the rise of right-wing forces across Europe.</p>
