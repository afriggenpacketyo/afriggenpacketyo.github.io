          <p>Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka was left out of the England squad for their World Cup qualifier against Andorra after only completing one full training session during the week. Head coach Thomas Tuchel indicated that Saka's omission was likely related to his fitness, as the 23-year-old had missed Tuchel's first camp due to injury. Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins was also excluded and returned home with a minor injury, while the reason for Conor Gallagher's omission remains unclear. England remains unbeaten in World Cup qualifying, having won their opening two matches. The optimism score for this article is 75.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow colleges and universities to directly pay their athletes, starting next month. The settlement, stemming from antitrust cases challenging NCAA compensation rules, permits each school to share up to $20.5 million with athletes over the next year. Additionally, $2.7 billion will be distributed over the next decade to former players who were previously barred from receiving such revenue. Payouts will vary based on the sport and length of athletic career, with some football and basketball players potentially receiving nearly $135,000 each.
