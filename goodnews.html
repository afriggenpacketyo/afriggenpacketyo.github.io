          <p>Wesleyan University President Michael Roth, in an interview, expressed concern over increasing scrutiny of Chinese students and intimidation tactics aimed at universities. Roth believes these actions are designed to instill fear and enforce conformity to the current administration's ideologies, which he argues undermines academic freedom and the open exchange of ideas. He acknowledged legitimate criticisms of higher education, such as a lack of intellectual diversity, but emphasized that improvements should come through internal reforms rather than external pressure. Roth also addressed protests related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, distinguishing between legitimate criticism and antisemitism, while defending the importance of free speech on campus. The discussion highlights the challenges universities face in maintaining academic independence amidst political pressures.</p>

          <p>AB Hernandez, a teenage transgender athlete in California, won two track events, the high jump and triple jump, amidst ongoing political attacks from right-wing figures and the Trump administration. This occurred after the California Interscholastic Federation changed its rules to award duplicate medals if a transgender athlete places in a girls' event. Despite protests, Hernandez expressed joy and shared the podium with fellow athletes, who voiced their support. The Justice Department is investigating the federation and school district for potential violations of federal sex-discrimination law, as Hernandez's participation has sparked national debate about transgender athletes in youth sports.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri won the Spanish Grand Prix after Max Verstappen received a 10-second penalty for causing a collision with George Russell during the final laps of the race.

Stewards penalized Verstappen for accelerating and colliding with Russell, also adding three penalty points to his license. Piastri's victory extends his championship lead over Lando Norris by 10 points, while Verstappen now trails Piastri by 49 points following the eventful race.</p>

          <p>Investors are increasingly focusing on short-term Treasury bonds, mirroring Warren Buffett's strategy of investing in T-bills, with Berkshire Hathaway owning 5% of all short-term Treasuries. The iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 T-Bill ETF (BIL) are among the top ETFs in investor flows this year, attracting over $25 billion in assets. This trend reflects a preference for stable yields and less volatility in the short and middle segments of the fixed-income market. The 3-month T-Bill currently offers an annualized yield above 4.3%, making it an attractive option for investors. (not investment advice)</p>
