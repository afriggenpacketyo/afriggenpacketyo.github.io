          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, indicated that the U.S. is increasingly recognizing Japan's economic significance following trade discussions with U.S. officials.

The discussions included trade, nontariff barriers, and economic security, but officials remained silent on Nippon Steel Corp.'s acquisition plans for United States Steel Corp. Akazawa believes there is a deepening recognition of Japan's contribution to the U.S. economy, and both sides are committed to ongoing ministerial discussions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is significantly restructuring the National Security Council, reducing its staff by at least half, according to sources. This downsizing is expected to streamline foreign policy decision-making, aligning with President Trump's preference for top-down approaches. Some NSC officials are returning to their original agencies, while others are being placed on administrative leave, and certain teams focusing on specific regions or issues will be eliminated or consolidated. Andy Baker, Vice President Vance‚Äôs national security advisor, will take a top role in the restructured NSC as deputy national security adviser.</p>

          <p>Four top partners at Paul Weiss, including Karen Dunn, Bill Isaacson, Jeannie Rhee, and Jessica Phillips, have announced their departure to form a new law firm, a significant blow following the firm's controversial deal with the Trump administration. The deal, brokered by firm chairman Brad Karp, aimed to prevent an executive order restricting the firm's business, but it drew widespread criticism from associates, other firms, and Democrats. The departing partners did not directly address the deal in their announcement, but their exit follows other prominent lawyers leaving the firm in recent weeks. Dunn played a key role in debate preparation for prominent Democratic figures.</p>

The study found that beaks became longer and more slender to better access nectar from feeders, and males' beaks grew pointier for fighting off competitors. This adaptation has also allowed the hummingbirds to expand their range northward. The study highlights how human actions can rapidly influence the evolution of organisms, and scientists suggest monitoring these changes.</p>
