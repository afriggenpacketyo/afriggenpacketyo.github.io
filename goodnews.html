          <h2>Chinese Mineral Tellurium Offers Hope for Restoring Vision</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-08 00:00:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have successfully used tellurium, a rare mineral, to create an artificial retina that restored sight in blind animals, even granting them the ability to see infrared light. The nanowire implants, made from tellurium, convert both visible light and infrared radiation into electrical signals, effectively replacing damaged photoreceptor cells in the retina. This breakthrough holds significant potential for treating human blindness, as tellurium's photoelectric properties eliminate the need for auxiliary equipment. The study, published in Science, demonstrates a promising avenue for restoring vision and expanding visual capabilities. The research provides a potential future direction in treating blindness with the use of photoelectric properties of the tellurium to send electrical signals converted from light signals to the brain.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 23:00:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that subsidizing men's involvement in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, indicates that subsidies for fathers yield greater long-term fertility gains compared to solely subsidizing mothers. This innovative policy proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The study highlights the persistence of traditional expectations that place the burden of childcare on women, clashing with rapid economic changes and contributing to a fertility rate well below the replacement level.</p>

The Cardinals broke the scoreless tie in the eighth inning, and although the Dodgers tied it in the ninth, St. Louis secured the win with a single. Despite the loss, Yamamoto expressed a positive outlook, acknowledging the unpredictable nature of baseball.

          <p>European startup founders are resisting pressure to adopt China's grueling '996' work culture, which involves working from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. Venture capitalists sparked a debate by suggesting that European startups need to embrace overwork to compete globally. However, many founders argue that this 'fetishization of overwork' is counterproductive and clashes with European values and regulations. Instead, they emphasize the need for more funding, resources, and a focus on sustainable innovation to strengthen Europe's startup ecosystem. They believe that prioritizing worker well-being and work-life balance is essential for long-term success and talent retention.</p>
