          <p>The UK jobs market continues to show signs of weakening, with the unemployment rate increasing to 4.5% and the number of workers on company payrolls falling. Job vacancies have also declined, suggesting a cooling labor market. Analysts believe that the recent increase in employer National Insurance contributions and the National Living Wage may be contributing to this trend. Wage growth remains relatively strong, which may cause the Bank of England to proceed cautiously with future interest rate cuts.</p>
