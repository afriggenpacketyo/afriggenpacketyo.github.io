          <p>Ippei Mizuhara, the former interpreter for Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani, has reported to federal prison in Pennsylvania to begin serving a 57-month sentence for stealing nearly $17 million from Ohtani to cover gambling debts. Mizuhara pleaded guilty to bank fraud and filing a false tax return, admitting to placing approximately 19,000 bets with a bookie over two years and accumulating over $40 million in debt. Ohtani publicly stated that he never placed a sports bet and that Mizuhara's story about paying off his gambling debt was fabricated. Federal prosecutors also requested Mizuhara to pay $16.9 million of restitution to Ohtani and another $1.1 million to the IRS.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in Colorado has found MyPillow founder Mike Lindell, a prominent election conspiracy theorist, liable for defaming Eric Coomer, a former employee of Dominion Voting Systems, after the 2020 presidential election. Coomer was awarded $2.3 million in damages after Lindell called him a traitor and streamed accusations about him stealing the election on his online platform. Dominion Voting Systems previously won a $787 million settlement in a defamation lawsuit against Fox News over airing false claims against the company. Lindell said he went to trial to draw attention to the need to get rid of electronic voting machines, claiming he used to be worth about $60 million before speaking out about the 2020 election and is now $10 million in debt.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has secured a $200 million contract to provide artificial intelligence tools to the U.S. Defense Department. This one-year contract follows OpenAI's announcement of collaboration with defense technology startup Anduril to deploy advanced AI systems for national security missions. Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, has expressed pride in engaging in national security areas, and the work will primarily occur in the National Capital Region. The contract represents a small portion of OpenAI's revenue, which is generating over $10 billion in annualized sales, and comes as the company is working to build additional computing power in the U.S.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 2019, all 13 of Yosemite National Park's campgrounds will be open to visitors this summer, adding an extra 500 campsites. Maintenance and staffing challenges had kept several campgrounds closed since 2020, but White Wolf Campground will open on June 20, Tamarack Flat Campground on June 23, and Yosemite Creek Campground on July 1. Reservations are available at Recreation.gov, but finding a camping spot is highly competitive, often filling up minutes after reservations open. The park's reservation system, introduced in 2020 amid the pandemic, was temporarily halted before being reinstated in late March.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has reduced the hours of a nightly curfew in downtown L.A., allowing businesses to remain open later, citing the success of the curfew and crime prevention efforts in protecting businesses and residential communities. The curfew, which now begins at 10 p.m. instead of 8 p.m., was enacted following protests in response to President Trump‚Äôs immigration crackdown in Southern California. Arrests have dropped in downtown over the past few days, and the LAPD will maintain a strong presence in the area to ensure safety. Since protests began on June 7, the LAPD has arrested 575 people, including 14 for looting.</p>

          <p>President Trump displayed a trade agreement signed with the United Kingdom while standing next to Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the G7 summit in Canada. Trump accidentally dropped the document and misspoke, stating the agreement was with the European Union, before the White House clarified it was with the UK. The agreement addresses steel and aluminum, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick determining a quota of products that can enter the U.S. without being subject to the 25% Section 232 tariff. Trump praised Starmer, stating that he had done a "great job."</p>

The judge noted that he had ‚Äúnever seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable.‚Äù The ruling follows the Trump administration's February decision to slash billions in NIH funding, influenced by Elon Musk, amid efforts to cut 10,000 jobs from federal health agencies.</p>

          <p>A new proposal in California would make it a misdemeanor for local, state, and federal law enforcement officers to cover their faces while conducting official business. The bill, proposed by Democratic state senators Scott Wiener and Jesse Arreguin, aims to boost transparency and public trust in law enforcement. It would require all law enforcement officials to show their faces and be identifiable by their uniform, with their name or other identifier visible. The proposal is in response to recent incidents where federal officers have conducted raids while covering their faces and badges, leading to concerns about accountability.</p>

The announced attendance for Chelsea's 2-0 win was 22,137, far below the stadium's capacity of 71,000, with the entire top tier closed. Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca noted the strange environment due to the almost empty stadium, while LAFC were late replacements for disqualified Leon in the tournament and their 150 ultras dominated the atmosphere. The newly expanded Club World Cup is being treated as a dress rehearsal for the international World Cup next summer, which will be held in the USA, Canada and Mexico.</p>
