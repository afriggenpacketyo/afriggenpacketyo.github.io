          <p>Chinese technology giant Alibaba reported better-than-expected net income for its fiscal first quarter, causing its U.S.-listed stock to climb 10%. The strong performance was primarily fueled by a 26% year-over-year revenue increase in its cloud computing division, which has seen robust demand for its artificial intelligence services. While overall revenue slightly missed forecasts, investors were encouraged by the cloud unit's acceleration and continued recovery in its e-commerce business. The company continues to invest heavily in competitive areas like instant commerce, which has impacted profitability in its core retail division. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of the Interior has drafted an expansion of its critical minerals list, adding 51 commodities including copper, silicon, and silver, to prevent potential supply-chain disruptions. This updated list is designed to guide government strategy, including investment incentives and permitting decisions, to secure resources vital for the U.S. economy and national security. The move is widely seen as an effort to onshore more production for key sectors like semiconductors, automotive systems, and solar panels. This strategy aims to reduce the nation's strategic dependence on foreign sources, particularly China, for these essential materials.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD reported a nearly 30% drop in profits for the second quarter, as a fierce price war in its home market offset a dramatic surge in overseas sales. The company's revenue grew 14% year-on-year, but earnings fell short of analyst expectations due to what it described as "increased price competition and excessive marketing" in China. In contrast, BYD's international deliveries grew by almost 145% compared to the previous year, demonstrating the brand's growing appeal to foreign consumers seeking affordable electric vehicles. The results highlight the challenging domestic environment for even the largest Chinese EV makers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold remains a popular investment commodity, often viewed as a safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty and a hedge against inflation. Its price is subject to constant fluctuation based on a variety of complex factors. Key drivers include fundamental supply and demand, prevailing economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability, all of which can increase its appeal. Additionally, the value of the U.S. dollar, changes in interest rates, market sentiment, and the purchasing or selling policies of central banks worldwide play significant roles in determining the precious metal's day-to-day market price.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 09:20:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve signals potential interest rate cuts, savers looking for high-yield Certificates of Deposit (CDs) may need to act strategically. While the peak rates of over 6% are gone, it is still possible to find CDs with rates around 4.50%. To find these competitive rates, experts suggest considering online-only banks, which typically offer higher yields due to lower overhead costs. It is also recommended to utilize online marketplace sites to easily compare offers from multiple institutions. Currently, short-term CDs of one year or less are generally providing the highest annual percentage yields in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new book, "Such Great Heights," chronicles the evolution of indie rock during the 2000s, an era when bands like Grizzly Bear and Modest Mouse blurred the lines between niche and mainstream music. This article reviews the book, reflecting on how the internet and music blogs like Pitchfork fueled the genre's explosion, creating a movement defined by musical complexity and a departure from polished pop. While the term "indie" eventually became a lifestyle brand, its core values of authentic self-expression and sonic exploration went on to influence a generation of listeners and even shape the direction of mainstream pop music.</p>

          <p>An Italian website named Phica, which posted digitally altered, explicit images of prominent women including Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, has shut down following a widespread political backlash. The site, which had been active for two decades, featured a section with photos of female politicians and celebrities with obscene commentary and was accused of inciting sexual assault. The closure comes amid growing public anger in Italy over the non-consensual sharing of intimate images online. Meloni expressed her disgust with the site and called for those responsible to be punished with the "utmost firmness."</p>

          <p>India's economy expanded at an annual rate of 7.8% in the April-June quarter, surpassing economists' forecasts of 6.7% growth. The strong performance was driven by the manufacturing, construction, and service sectors. However, some underlying indicators point to a potential slowdown, as nominal GDP growth, which does not account for inflation, has decreased. Economists note that a soft inflation deflator played a role in boosting the real GDP figure. The robust growth comes as the country faces economic headwinds, including the recent implementation of steep U.S. tariffs on Indian imports. (not investment advice)</p>
