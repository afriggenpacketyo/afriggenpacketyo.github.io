          <h2>Skomer Island Puffin Numbers Reach Record High Despite Global Decline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 01:09:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A record number of puffins, 43,626, have been recorded on Skomer Island off the Pembrokeshire coast, marking a conservation success story amidst global population declines. The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales attributes the thriving population to an abundance of food and the absence of predators like rats, cats, and foxes on the island. Skomer Island, managed by the WTSWW, is an internationally important seabird island located less than a mile from the Pembrokeshire coast, attracting around 25,000 visitors annually. While puffins are thriving in Pembrokeshire, they remain listed as vulnerable to extinction on the IUCN Red List due to pollution, food shortages, and climate change elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Onosato has been promoted to sumo's highest rank of yokozuna after just 13 professional tournaments, setting a new record. The 24-year-old from Ishikawa Prefecture is the 75th yokozuna and the first Japanese-born grand champion since his stablemaster Nishonoseki in 2017. Onosato secured his promotion by winning the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament, achieving the required benchmark of back-to-back championships as an ozeki. He joins Wajima as the only wrestler to become a grand champion after entering the professional ranks from university, and he is set to forge a rivalry with Mongolian yokozuna Hoshoryu.</p>

          <p>Dearica Hamby and Kelsey Plum led a strong second-half rally for the Los Angeles Sparks, but their efforts fell short in an 88-82 loss to the Atlanta Dream. Plum finished with 27 points, five assists, and four steals, while Hamby contributed 28 points, eight assists, and four steals. The duo's chemistry and energy helped the Sparks nearly overcome a halftime deficit, but ultimately they needed more support from the rest of the team. Rickea Jackson's return provided a boost, but she played limited minutes as she reacclimated to live play.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has enacted a law that requires 300 to 400 major firms to participate in a carbon emissions trading system starting in April 2026. The law targets companies producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually across industries including steel and car production, accounting for nearly 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Companies will be allotted a maximum emission allowance, and those exceeding the threshold must purchase carbon credits from companies with a surplus. This system aims to incentivize companies to reduce emissions, but decarbonization costs may be passed on to consumers through price increases.</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's upcoming IPO has an unusual characteristic, similar to Facebook's 2012 IPO, with more shares being sold by existing shareholders than by the company itself. Circle will sell 9.6 million shares, while existing shareholders will sell 14.4 million shares. This is likely due to venture capital firms needing liquidity after a period of meager returns. Despite the large insider sales, Circle is profitable and has a significant amount of cash, indicating a strong financial position.</p>
