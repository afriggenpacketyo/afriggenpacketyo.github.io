          <p>Former MLB pitcher Steven Register, diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer, received a life-saving liver transplant from Kristin Johnston, a high school classmate he hadn't seen in 20 years. Johnston volunteered after seeing a Facebook plea from Register's wife, Beth, and discovered they shared the same blood type. The surgery involved transplanting 70% of Johnston's liver into Register, with both livers expected to regenerate. The Register family launched a fundraiser to help with medical expenses, and both families expressed gratitude and faith in the outcome.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has reached an agreement with City Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson to restore police officer hiring that was cut by the council. The deal ensures that funds will be identified for an additional 240 recruits within 90 days, reversing the council's decision to reduce the number of new officers from 480 to 240. Restoring the positions requires an additional $13.3 million for the coming year and $60 million in 2026-27. The move comes after Bass voiced concerns about slowing down recruitment at the LAPD and considered vetoing the budget.</p>
