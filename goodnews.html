          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized Walmart for considering raising prices due to tariffs on imported goods, urging the company to "eat the tariffs" instead. Walmart had warned that prices on various items could increase, despite reduced tariff levels on China. Trump, who insists that foreign producers should bear the cost of tariffs, stated that Walmart should sacrifice profits to maintain low prices for consumers. A Walmart spokesperson responded that the company will strive to keep prices as low as possible, acknowledging the limitations imposed by retail margins. (optimism score 60)</p>

Gove emphasized that the UK government must continually demonstrate the union is working and cautioned against complacency. First Minister John Swinney has expressed a similar sentiment, stating that "demonstrable support" for independence is necessary, akin to the 1997 referendum for a Scottish parliament. Gove, however, stressed that the likelihood of a second vote is linked to the SNP's ability to improve public services and maintain public confidence. (optimism score 55)</p>

          <p>Federal courts have consistently challenged the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies, emphasizing due process rights for immigrants. The Supreme Court rebuked the administration for providing insufficient notice to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation. Courts have generally insisted on the right to challenge deportations, particularly when the administration invokes extraordinary powers. Legal scholars have praised the courts' defense of due process, while also expressing concern that such intervention was necessary in the first place. (optimism score 65)</p>
