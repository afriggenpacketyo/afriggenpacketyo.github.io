          <p>Ford Motor Company is recalling over 197,000 Mustang Mach-E vehicles due to a potential issue with the door latches. The issue could trap passengers inside if the car's battery level is too low, preventing them from unlocking the doors from the inside. Ford will notify owners of the safety risk and issue a software update to address the recall. This recall follows a previous one in May for over 1 million Ford and Lincoln vehicles due to a software glitch with the rearview camera, indicating ongoing quality control challenges for the automaker.</p>

Cramer noted that the global energy market has changed due to increased U.S. oil production, reducing the potential for substantial oil supply shocks.

          <p>Sampdoria will remain in Serie B after being awarded a 3-0 victory over Salernitana, following the abandonment of the second-leg relegation play-off due to fan violence. The game was called off in the 65th minute with Sampdoria leading 2-0 on the night and 4-0 on aggregate. The decision by Serie B's sports judge secured a 5-0 aggregate win and guaranteed their escape from relegation to Serie C. Salernitana have been relegated and ordered to play two matches behind closed doors next season.</p>
