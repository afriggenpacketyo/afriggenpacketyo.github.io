          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region saw gains on Thursday, mirroring a rally on Wall Street led by the technology sector that boosted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Japan's Nikkei 225, Australia's S&P/ASX 200, and South Korea's Kospi all traded higher in early sessions. The positive movement came despite underlying fears about the broader economy, with global bond markets remaining a key area of focus for investors. A recent U.S. court ruling against Trump-era tariffs has raised questions about future revenues, causing the U.S. 30-year Treasury yield to briefly rise above 5%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares for fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters experienced a significant 25% jump after the company credited its successful ad campaigns featuring celebrities Sydney Sweeney and Travis Kelce for driving strong sales. The company's CEO noted that its second-quarter performance exceeded expectations and that the fall season has started positively due to increased customer engagement. The campaign with Sweeney, which sparked public debate, and a clothing series with Kelce, launched around his engagement to Taylor Swift, have successfully boosted brand awareness. President Trump also commented on the Sweeney ad, praising the actress in a social media post.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants, ruling that the current situation does not constitute an "invasion or predatory incursion." The administration had invoked the obscure wartime law to expel hundreds of individuals accused of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang. The Fifth Circuit court's decision marks a significant legal setback for the White House's strategy, with judges rejecting the argument that mass illegal migration is equivalent to an armed incursion. The American Civil Liberties Union praised the ruling as a crucial check on executive power.</p>

          <p>In an effort to stimulate its local economy, the Chinese city of Shaoxing is offering financial incentives to residents who host large banquets. The municipal government announced that it will provide subsidies of up to 5,000 yuan (US$700) for dining events with five or more tables and a total cost exceeding 10,000 yuan. This policy is part of a broader strategy to boost consumer spending in key sectors like catering, housing, and retail. The measure highlights the challenge local officials face in balancing the national priority of encouraging consumption with Beijing's ongoing anti-corruption campaign, which discourages extravagance.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has ruled that the Trump administration acted illegally when it froze over $2.2 billion in research funding for Harvard University. The funds were withheld in response to allegations of antisemitism on campus, but Judge Allison D. Burroughs stated the administration used the issue as a "smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault." The ruling noted that the freeze was implemented without considering the steps Harvard had already taken to address the problem. The suspended funds supported over 900 critical research projects, including studies on Alzheimer's, cancer, and heart disease, and the White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision.</p>

          <h2>Montana Ranchers Embrace Regenerative Practices and Direct-to-Consumer Sales to Ensure Survival</h2>

          <p>In Montana's Blackfoot Valley, ranchers are adopting innovative strategies to combat the economic and environmental threats facing their industry. The Mannix family, who has worked their land for 143 years, co-founded the Old Salt Co-op to process livestock locally and sell beef directly to consumers, bypassing large industrial meatpackers. This model aims to improve profit margins for producers and enhance food security. The cooperative is also committed to regenerative ranching, a practice that involves rotating cattle and allowing land to rest for extended periods to improve soil health and resilience against extreme weather like droughts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A former police detective, who recently experienced a head-on collision firsthand, outlines the critical actions to take immediately following a car crash. The first step is to stop the car, turn off the engine, and check for injuries. If possible and safe, vehicles should be moved out of traffic with hazard lights on; otherwise, occupants should exit and stand a safe distance away. It is crucial to call 999 if anyone is injured, if the other driver leaves the scene, or if the road is blocked. The article emphasizes the importance of staying calm and prioritizing safety in the chaotic moments after an accident.</p>

          <p>Democrats and voting rights groups in North Carolina have successfully negotiated an agreement to prevent approximately 98,000 voters from being removed from the rolls. The settlement resolves a lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice under the Trump administration, which had demanded the state deny ballots to voters who registered without providing a driver’s license or partial social security number. The new agreement, which still requires court approval, will allow these voters to provide the necessary information via a provisional ballot at the polling place. Critics had argued the DOJ's lawsuit was a partisan effort that violated the National Voter Registration Act.</p>

          <p>The public affairs network C-SPAN has reached agreements to be carried on major streaming platforms YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, expanding its reach to millions of new viewers. The deals come two months after C-SPAN made a public appeal for wider distribution, citing financial strain from the decline of traditional cable and satellite television subscriptions. The U.S. Senate had also passed a resolution urging streaming services to carry the nonprofit, privately funded network. The addition of C-SPAN's three channels to these platforms is seen as a crucial step in securing its future and continuing its mission of providing unfiltered coverage of the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>A federal judge's ruling in a major antitrust case spared Google from being forced to sell its Chrome web browser, causing parent company Alphabet's stock to surge 9%. While the judge had previously deemed Google a "monopolist" in online search, the remedies imposed were less severe than feared. The decision rejected the divestiture of Chrome as "incredibly messy and highly risky" but did place other limits on the tech giant, including requiring it to share some search data with rivals to foster competition. The ruling comes as the rise of AI chatbots presents a new competitive challenge to Google's long-standing dominance in the search market.</p>
