          <p>Apple has released its new iPhone 17 series globally, drawing significant attention in key overseas markets like China, where it faces intense competition from local brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi. While initial consumer interest appears strong, driven by new designs and features, the launch occurs as Apple is under pressure to demonstrate meaningful progress in artificial intelligence. The company's success in competitive international markets and its ability to deliver on its AI promises are being closely watched by investors and consumers alike.</p>

          <p>Washington D.C.'s veteran non-voting House delegate, 88-year-old Eleanor Holmes Norton, is facing a primary challenge from city council member Robert White. The challenge comes amid growing concerns about Norton's ability to effectively represent the district, particularly as it confronts increased federal interference from the Trump administration. White's campaign suggests it is time for new leadership to provide a stronger defense for the city's autonomy during a period of heightened vulnerability.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish governments have unveiled a new framework to handle the legacy of the Northern Ireland Troubles, replacing the widely opposed 2023 Legacy Act. This new deal aims to provide "maximum truth, justice and accountability" for victims by restoring inquests and establishing new investigative bodies with independent oversight. While hailed by officials as a significant improvement, some victims' groups have expressed concern over a lack of consultation in the development of the agreement.</p>

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency grant aims to help secure a direct supply chain of these metals, which are vital for electric vehicles and military technology. This move is part of a broader geopolitical strategy by Washington to challenge Beijing's near-monopoly on the processing and supply of essential raw materials.</p>

          <p>The UK government has successfully sent a second migrant back to France under its new "one in, one out" pilot scheme designed to deter small boat crossings. The removal took place after the government won a significant High Court case by adjusting its guidance on modern slavery claims, preventing them from being used for last-minute delays. This legal victory strengthens the government's hand in implementing its returns policy, which it hopes will disrupt the business model of human smuggling gangs.</p>

          <p>McLaren drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri finished first and second respectively in the opening practice session for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in Baku. The session was interrupted for approximately 20 minutes by a red flag after a piece of kerbing at the final corner came loose. This delay incidentally benefited Piastri, as it gave his team time to resolve a power-unit issue on his car that was detected on his initial lap, preventing a more significant disruption to his practice time.</p>

          <p>The secondhand apparel market has transformed into a major global industry, driven largely by Gen Z and millennial consumers seeking sustainable and unique fashion choices. While thrifting helps reduce waste and lower the carbon footprint of the fashion industry, this article explores its complexities. The influx of low-quality fast fashion is diminishing the quality of available secondhand goods, and some online resale platforms are adopting aggressive marketing tactics that could inadvertently encourage the same overconsumption habits they aim to counter.</p>

          <p>This article profiles José Bordalás, the manager of Spanish football club Getafe, whose intense, direct, and highly structured style of play is often labeled "anti-football" by critics who favor aesthetic, possession-based ideals. Despite the purists' complaints, Bordalás has a remarkable record of success, consistently guiding teams with modest budgets to overachieve against wealthier rivals. His methods, rooted in defensive solidity and relentless pressing, have made his teams formidable opponents and earned him a reputation as a master pragmatist.</p>
