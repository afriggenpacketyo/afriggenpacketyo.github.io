          <p>Hundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics and their families participated in a Holy Year pilgrimage in Rome, an event officially listed in the Vatican's calendar that signals a significant shift in their relationship with the Church. Many pilgrims credit the late Pope Francis for fostering a more welcoming environment, a stark contrast to previous pontiffs and a time when they felt shunned. A vice president of the Italian bishops conference celebrated Mass for the group, stating it is time to restore dignity to all who have been denied it.</p>

          <p>In response to new state mandates and classroom distractions, school districts across the United States are turning to Yondr pouches to enforce cellphone bans. Students are required to place their phones in these magnetically sealed pouches, which they carry throughout the day and can only be unlocked at designated stations upon exiting the school. While educators hope the system will improve student engagement and focus, reactions from students have been mixed, with some welcoming the change and others attempting to circumvent the system.</p>

The discovery, described as "the ultimate cold case," has launched an effort to identify these forgotten soldiers using forensic genealogy. By building genetic profiles from the 240-year-old bones and matching them with living descendants, researchers hope to restore the names and stories of some of the first American soldiers who were hastily buried on the battlefield.</p>
