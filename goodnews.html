          <p>England's manager, Thomas Tuchel, has indicated a strategic shift for the national team, suggesting a greater emphasis on using long throw-ins and long-ball tactics ahead of the next World Cup. Despite a successful qualifying campaign so far, Tuchel noted that the team has used significantly fewer long balls compared to their strategy in Euro 2024. He stated that while training time is limited, such tactical elements become crucial in major tournaments. This potential change in approach reflects a pragmatic adaptation to different styles of play needed for success on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council and a potential candidate for Federal Reserve Chair, asserted that the central bank's monetary policy must be "fully independent of political influence," including from President Trump. His comments follow President Trump's recent pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates and his inclusion of Hassett on a shortlist to replace current Chair Jerome Powell. Hassett warned that historical examples show that when political leaders control central banks, it often leads to inflation and economic hardship for consumers, reinforcing the importance of institutional autonomy.
