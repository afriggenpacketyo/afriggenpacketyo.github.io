          <p>President Trump promoted his "big, beautiful bill" by featuring a third-generation Michigan autoworker, a lifelong Democrat who now supports him due to a proposed tax benefit. The plan would make interest on vehicle loans tax-deductible up to $10,000 annually, but only for passenger vehicles with final assembly in the United States. This policy is designed to incentivize domestic manufacturing and directly appeal to workers in the American auto industry. The provision is part of a larger legislative package that the administration is pushing to pass before the July 4th holiday.</p>

          <p>In an interview with NPR, Dr. Allen Frances reflected on his contribution to the dramatic rise in autism diagnoses over the past several decades. As a key figure in the development of psychiatric diagnostic criteria, his work had unintended consequences that led to a significant expansion of what is classified as autism spectrum disorder. The discussion explores how changes in diagnostic manuals and a broader understanding of the condition have contributed to what he describes as a sixty-fold increase in reported rates. This conversation provides context on the evolving nature of psychiatric diagnosis and its societal impact.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old in Norfolk has become the first patient in Europe to receive leniolisib, a newly licensed drug that offers a potential cure for Activated PI3-kinase Delta Syndrome (APDS). This rare, life-threatening inherited disorder, which claimed the lives of her mother and other relatives, severely weakens the immune system. The treatment was developed after Cambridge researchers identified the faulty gene responsible for the condition in 2013, a discovery in which the patient's family played a key role. The drug, taken as a twice-daily tablet, works by blocking an overactive enzyme, allowing the immune system to function properly.</p>

          <p>Brendan Foley, the CEO of spice manufacturer McCormick, stated that the company is actively working to mitigate the impact of new tariffs, particularly on its agricultural supply chain. While 90% of McCormick's products sold in the U.S. are made domestically, many key ingredients like black pepper are sourced internationally from countries such as Brazil and Vietnam. Following a strong earnings report that beat estimates, Foley noted that consumers continue to prioritize flavor despite economic pressures. The company's focus remains on managing its global sourcing to absorb the costs associated with the new trade policies.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer argued against the notion of a narrowly-led market by highlighting a diverse range of top-performing S&P 500 stocks. He pointed to gains in sectors including solar energy (Enphase Energy), materials (Freeport-McMoRan), and cryptocurrency (Coinbase) as evidence of a broadening rally. Other successful companies mentioned were data center-related stocks like Arista Networks and Super Micro Computer, as well as utility NRG Energy and biotech firm Incyte. Cramer asserted that this wide-ranging leadership indicates a bullish and robust market, challenging the narrative that recent gains were too concentrated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time since its launch, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has captured direct images providing evidence of a previously undiscovered exoplanet. The planet, named TWA 7b, is believed to be roughly the mass of Saturn and orbits a young, nearby star. Scientists used high-contrast imaging with a coronagraph to suppress the star's glare and reveal the faint object. While a small possibility remains that the image is of a background galaxy, researchers state that the evidence strongly points to it being a planet, potentially shaping the debris disk of its host star.</p>

          <p>A financial analysis suggests that the monthly income for an upper-class retiree in the U.S. typically falls between $7,000 and $20,000. This figure is derived from a combination of Social Security benefits, investment withdrawals, and other passive income streams like rental properties or dividends. While the median income for retirees over 65 is around $4,190 per month, the upper-class threshold is closer to $8,380. The article breaks down how affluent retirees build these income streams, often combining maximum Social Security payouts with disciplined withdrawals from substantial investment portfolios to fund their lifestyle.

Adams, who is now running as an independent, touted his administration's success in lowering crime, creating jobs, and building housing.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican lawmakers have agreed to remove a controversial "revenge tax" provision from President Trump's major legislative package. The decision came after a request from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who cited a new agreement with G7 countries on a global tax deal that defends U.S. interests. The removed provision, Section 899, would have allowed taxes on companies with foreign owners from countries deemed to have unfair tax practices, which critics argued would deter foreign investment in the U.S. This change complicates Republican efforts to offset the cost of the bill as they rush to meet a July 4th deadline.</p>
