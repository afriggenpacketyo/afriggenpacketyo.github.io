        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic lawmakers have introduced a bill aimed at preventing illegal price gouging by large corporations. The proposed legislation would grant the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general increased authority to litigate against companies that excessively raise prices, particularly in response to market shocks like new tariffs. The bill, which would require companies with over $100 million in revenue to report detailed pricing data, is a response to rising inflation and concerns that corporations are using economic conditions as cover for unfair price hikes.

          <p>Texas Senator John Cornyn, facing a primary challenge from State Attorney General Ken Paxton, revealed he has discussed a potential endorsement with Donald Trump. Cornyn stated that if Trump were to endorse him, the primary race would effectively be over, highlighting the former president's significant influence within the Republican Party. While Trump has not yet made an endorsement, Cornyn's campaign emphasized his strong alignment with Trump's voting record. This situation underscores the critical role Trump's backing plays in GOP primary contests across the country.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and Germany have signed a new treaty aimed at deepening their bilateral relationship, featuring plans for a direct rail link between London and Berlin. The agreement, signed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, also includes measures to streamline travel, enhance school exchanges, and bolster defense cooperation. A key security component involves Germany criminalizing the facilitation of illegal migration to the UK, targeting smugglers' supply chains for small boats. The treaty signals a significant reset in post-Brexit relations between the two European powers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on the GENIUS Act, a historic bill to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The vote proceeds after a group of conservative Republicans temporarily blocked the legislation, demanding the inclusion of a ban on a central bank digital currency. A deal was eventually reached to advance the bill, which President Trump has urged Congress to pass quickly to position the U.S. as a leader in digital assets. The legislation has faced criticism from some Democrats over consumer protection and potential conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is speeding up its volume production timeline in the U.S. by several quarters due to "strong interest" from its major American customers. The world's largest contract chip manufacturer is investing $165 billion in Arizona, constructing multiple fabrication and packaging facilities. During its second-quarter earnings call, where it reported record profits, CEO C.C. Wei addressed potential tariff impacts, stating the company has not yet seen changes in customer behavior but is aware of the risks. This acceleration underscores the strategic importance of localizing advanced semiconductor manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giants Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer have announced they will sell their blockbuster blood thinner, Eliquis, directly to patients at a significant discount. The new program, which bypasses insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, will reduce the monthly cost from about $606 to $346 for uninsured or self-pay patients. This move comes amid increasing pressure from the Trump administration to lower drug prices. However, the discounted price is still substantially higher than the negotiated Medicare price set to take effect next year.</p>

The settlement was announced on the second day of the trial, just before prominent board member Marc Andreessen was scheduled to testify.

          <p>United Airlines reported second-quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates and issued a new, more confident forecast for the remainder of 2025. CEO Scott Kirby noted that travel demand is strengthening after a weaker-than-expected start to the year, stating the "world is less uncertain today." The airline now expects adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share for the year. While quarterly revenue was slightly below expectations and unit revenue declined, the positive outlook suggests the carrier sees stabilizing demand, particularly in the premium travel sector.

          <p>Citing concerns that market expectations are too high, Jim Cramer's CNBC Investing Club has sold a small portion of its shares in GE Vernova. The move is intended to lock in profits from the stock's significant year-to-date run of 75% ahead of its upcoming earnings report. The article explains that while the long-term outlook for the company remains bright due to the AI-driven demand for power, a stock that enters earnings "too hot" is at risk of profit-taking even with strong results. The sale represents a tactical decision to manage risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Lawmakers Propose Bill to Classify Extreme Heat as a Major Disaster for Federal Aid Eligibility</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 11:13:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers has introduced legislation to amend the Stafford Act, aiming to classify extreme heat as a major disaster. This change would allow state and local governments to request federal funding from FEMA to respond to and prepare for deadly heat waves, which are currently not explicitly covered. Proponents argue the move is critical as heat kills more Americans than any other weather event, and funding could support cooling centers and heat adaptation projects. However, the bill faces opposition, with some arguing that extreme heat is already implicitly eligible for disaster declarations.</p>

The duo spent the night in their car for safety and were found unharmed, then assisted back to their waiting family.</p>
