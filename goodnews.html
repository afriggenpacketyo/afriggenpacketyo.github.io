          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 01:09:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A record number of puffins, 43,626, have been recorded on Skomer Island off the Pembrokeshire coast, marking a conservation success story amidst declining global populations. Skomer's isolation protects the birds from predators and human impact, contributing to their thriving population, with conservationists attributing the success to an abundance of food and the absence of predators. The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales conducts annual seabird counts to monitor the population, despite the fact that puffins are listed as vulnerable to extinction on the global IUCN Red List due to pollution, food shortages, and climate change.</p>

          <p>Onosato has been promoted to sumo's highest rank of yokozuna after competing in just 13 professional tournaments, setting a record pace. The 24-year-old from Ishikawa Prefecture is the 75th yokozuna and the first Japanese-born grand champion since 2017. He secured his promotion by winning the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament, achieving the benchmark of back-to-back championships as an ozeki. Onosato joins Wajima as the only wrestler to become a grand champion after entering the professional ranks from university, and he is set to compete against Mongolian yokozuna Hoshoryu at July's Nagoya meet.</p>

          <p>Ilham Ahmed, a chair of the foreign relations department of the Democratic Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, argues that while the fall of the Assad regime and the suspension of economic sanctions are positive steps, Syria's new interim Constitution does not adequately protect the rights of minorities or women. Ahmed advocates for a new constitutional process that guarantees power sharing, safeguards political freedoms, and decentralizes governance. She presents her region, Rojava, as a model of multiethnic direct democracy where ethnic groups are legally protected and women hold leading roles, suggesting this system could serve as a blueprint for Syria and the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Dearica Hamby and Kelsey Plum demonstrated their potential as a dynamic duo, combining for 39 points in the second half, but their efforts were not enough to secure a win for the Sparks against the Atlanta Dream. The Sparks showed signs of a comeback in the fourth quarter, with Hamby and Plum leading the charge, but ultimately fell short in the 88-82 loss. Despite the loss, the chemistry and energy between Plum and Hamby provided a glimpse of the franchise's potential, though the team still needs more depth to ease the burden on its starters and rookies.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a plan to upgrade its information technology (IT) manufacturers to achieve self-sufficiency in technologies like semiconductors, batteries, satellite navigation, and artificial intelligence (AI), while sidestepping US tech curbs.

By 2030, China intends to complete a core industrial database to allow IT manufacturers to achieve 'new breakthroughs' and scale the 'high end of the global value chain'.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has enacted a law requiring 300 to 400 major firms to participate in a carbon emissions trading system, set to begin in the fiscal year starting April 2026. The law targets companies producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually across various industries, accounting for nearly 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. The trading system will allot maximum emission allowances, with companies needing to purchase carbon credits for emissions exceeding their threshold, creating an incentive for emissions reduction. While designed to lower emissions, companies may pass on decarbonization costs to consumers through price increases.</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's upcoming IPO is notable for its unusual structure, as existing shareholders are selling more shares (60%) than the company itself (40%), a pattern seen in only a few tech IPOs, such as Facebook's. Circle, the company behind USDC, has not provided a reason for this decision, though the company is profitable with nearly $850 million in cash and equivalents. This move is likely driven by venture capital firms seeking liquidity after a period of meager returns and a drought in IPOs, reflecting a desire by early investors to realize gains (not investment advice).</p>
