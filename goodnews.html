        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a preseason game against the New England Patriots, Minnesota Vikings head coach Kevin O'Connell inadvertently used an expletive on a live television broadcast. While mic'd up for an interview with Fox 9, O'Connell was reacting to an illegal motion penalty on his team when he dropped an F-bomb in frustration. The incident highlighted why NFL coaches are typically not broadcast live without a delay, as their unfiltered reactions can contain strong language. The Vikings ultimately lost the game 20-12, but the moment provided an amusing, candid glimpse into the intensity of coaching, even during exhibition matches.</p>

          <p>Jon Rahm has been named the LIV Golf individual champion for the second year in a row, earning the season-long award and an $18 million prize. The title was secured despite Rahm losing in a playoff to Sebastian Munoz at the event in Indiana. Both players finished at 22 under par, but Munoz won the playoff with a birdie on the first extra hole. Rahm's performance was sufficient to edge out Joaquin Niemann for the season title. The event also saw former Ryder Cup players Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter avoid relegation from the tour for the upcoming season.</p>

The discussions involved high-level officials, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng. Qian's research focuses on the intersection of domestic politics and foreign policy in both nations, framing their rivalry as a manageable one.</p>

          <p>Financial commentator Jim Cramer reaffirmed his confidence in Amazon, noting it is the largest holding in his trust despite recent investor concerns over a slowdown in its AWS cloud computing business. Cramer suggests that worries about AWS are overshadowing the strength of Amazon's retail and logistics operations, which are transforming how consumers receive goods like food and drugs. He argues that the company's innovative, automated warehouses signify a fundamental shift in the economy. Cramer advises looking beyond the short-term decline in web services to appreciate the company's broader dominance in the evolving retail landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Tower Hamlets council in London has announced it will remove St. George's and Union flags attached to lampposts by a group promoting a patriotism campaign called "Operation Raise the Colours." This decision follows a similar action by Birmingham's council, which cited safety risks. Critics, including Reform UK MP Lee Anderson, have condemned the removals as disgraceful. The move by Tower Hamlets, run by the Aspire Party, has drawn accusations of bias, as Palestinian flags were previously allowed to fly for months before being taken down, sparking a debate over national symbols and local governance.</p>

          <p>Manchester United suffered a 1-0 defeat to Arsenal in their season opener, with a critical error from goalkeeper Altay Bayindir leading to the decisive goal. United's manager, Ruben Amorim, chose Bayindir over the recently fit Andre Onana, a decision that drew scrutiny after the Turkish keeper failed to handle a corner kick, allowing Riccardo Calafiori to score for Arsenal. Despite an improved attacking performance from United, the team could not find an equalizer. The mistake has renewed debate about the club's goalkeeping situation, a position that has been a source of concern for some time.</p>

          <p>According to U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Russia has agreed to allow the U.S. and Europe to provide Ukraine with "robust" security guarantees as part of a potential peace deal.

The concession was made during the recent Alaska summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin.
