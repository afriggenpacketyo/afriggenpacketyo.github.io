          <h2>China's Retail Sales Growth Disappoints in April Amid Consumption Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's retail sales growth in April slowed to 5.1%, falling short of analysts' expectations and indicating ongoing concerns about consumption in the world's second-largest economy. However, industrial output grew by 6.1%, exceeding forecasts. This data emerges amidst trade tensions between China and the U.S., though recent talks have eased some fears. Despite these challenges, global investment banks have raised their forecasts for China's economic growth this year, while paring back expectations for more proactive stimulus as Beijing strives to reach its growth target of around 5%.</p>

          <p>Despite facing the full impact of high tariffs before a recent agreement to pause them, China's economy demonstrated resilience in April. Industrial output grew by 6.1%, surpassing economists' estimates, while retail sales increased by 5.1%, though falling slightly short of expectations. The Chinese government has affirmed its commitment to bolstering domestic consumption amid global trade uncertainties. These measures suggest an effort to stabilize the economy despite external pressures and trade fluctuations.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones, according to a statement from his office.

          <p>Rory McIlroy finished the PGA Championship tied for 47th place and declined to speak with the media throughout the tournament. Speculation suggests that McIlroy's silence was due to a controversy involving his driver, which the USGA ruled as non-conforming, forcing him to make a switch. Xander Schauffele hinted that Scottie Scheffler also had to make an equipment change, emphasizing the importance of testing clubs to protect the integrity of the field. Scheffler ultimately won the PGA Championship.</p>
