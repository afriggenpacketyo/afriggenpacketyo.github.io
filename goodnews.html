          <p>Mark Teixeira, a former MLB slugger renowned for his career with the Texas Rangers and New York Yankees, has officially announced his candidacy for Congress in Texas's 21st Congressional District for the 2026 midterm elections. Running as a Republican, Teixeira articulated his commitment to conservative principles and pledged to fight for the strength of Texas and the exceptionalism of America. After a successful 14-year baseball career, which included a World Series title, Teixeira moved back to Central Texas in 2021 with his family. He will compete against Daniel Betts for the Republican nomination, as the incumbent Rep. Chip Roy is not seeking re-election for this seat.</p>

"Customer A" contributed 23% and "Customer B" 16% of total revenue, representing a substantial increase from the previous year. While large cloud service providers comprise approximately 50% of Nvidia's data center revenue, the specific identities of these direct customers remain undisclosed. Analysts are closely monitoring cloud capital expenditure commitments to model Nvidia's future growth, as the company forecasts a multi-trillion-dollar AI infrastructure market by the decade's end.

          <p>Intel's CFO David Zinsner confirmed that the semiconductor giant received $5.7 billion from the U.S. government on Wednesday evening, an investment stemming from the White House's recent decision to acquire a 10% stake in the company. While Intel has acknowledged the substantial capital infusion, the White House stated that the specifics of the deal are still actively "being ironed out" by the Department of Commerce. Intel had previously issued a corporate filing warning of potential "adverse reactions" from investors, employees, and other stakeholders regarding the government's significant involvement. Zinsner also hinted at the possibility of seeking outside investment for Intel's foundry business to further fund its growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Microsoft has initiated public testing of its new homegrown artificial intelligence model, MAI-1-preview, signaling a strategic move to reduce its reliance on OpenAI and escalate competition in the rapidly evolving AI space. This advanced model is specifically intended to significantly enhance Microsoft's Copilot assistant for consumers, with developers now able to request early access to the technology. Despite being a major investor and strategic partner to OpenAI, Microsoft explicitly listed the startup as a competitor in its annual report last year. The article highlights Microsoft's ambitious plans in AI development, led by Mustafa Suleyman, and its substantial investment in compute resources, including Nvidia's H100 and GB200 chips, for the new model.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is taking direct control of Washington D.C.'s Union Station, a major transportation hub and national landmark, shifting management from a local nonprofit and Amtrak. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy cited the station's disrepair and the necessity to restore it, framing the move as part of the administration's broader crackdown on crime in the city. While the federal government already owns the historic building, this intervention aims to address its estimated $8 billion in repair needs and maximize its commercial revenue potential. Mayor Muriel Bowser has expressed support for federal investment to facilitate the station's much-needed total transformation, despite the underlying political tensions surrounding federal intervention in D.C. affairs.</p>

          <p>Reverse mortgages, specifically designed for homeowners aged 62 and older, enable retirees to access their home equity without incurring traditional monthly payments, serving as a valuable financial tool to manage expenses in retirement. This article explicitly clarifies that these loans do not directly reduce or interfere with existing Social Security or Medicare benefits, as Social Security payments are calculated based on earnings history and Medicare is not means-tested. However, it importantly cautions that substantial withdrawals from a reverse mortgage could potentially impact eligibility for certain need-based programs, such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Medicaid, which do consider available income and assets. Consulting with a qualified financial advisor is highly recommended for individuals relying on such programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an era saturated with digital devices and wellness gurus promoting mindfulness, poetry offers a timeless and analog solution for living more vividly in the present moment. This article posits that poetry, predating meditation apps, immerses readers in the experience by tracking internal and external observations without the intention of creating an optimized version of a human. Citing poet and teacher Linda Gregg, the article emphasizes poetry's profound ability to connect with the "resonant sources" of human life, addressing the root cause of unwellness by fostering self-awareness and alignment with the surrounding world. Gregg's poem "The Last Night in Mithymna" is presented as an example of this capacity for deep contentment and presence.</p>

          <p>Best Buy surpassed Wall Street's revenue and earnings expectations for its recent quarter, signaling a modest sales recovery driven by strong demand for mobile phones, video gaming equipment, and computing items. Despite this positive performance, the retailer maintained a cautious full-year forecast, citing "tariff uncertainty" as a significant factor that could impact both consumers and the business in the latter half of the year. CEO Corie Barry noted that Best Buy has already implemented price increases on some items due to tariff-related costs and is actively implementing new strategies, including a third-party marketplace and innovative in-store experiences, to spur continued growth.
