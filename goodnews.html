          <p>NBA teams have seen an 8% increase in sponsorship revenue this season, reaching $1.62 billion, largely due to the popularity of sponsor patches on team jerseys and the opening of the Los Angeles Clippers' Intuit Dome. Jersey patch deals have more than doubled year over year, contributing over $80 million in new spending. The new arena also drove up overall sponsorship revenue, equivalent to adding three new teams to the league. Rakuten and JPMorgan Chase are the top-spending brands in the league, reflecting the growing financial interest in NBA sponsorships. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of an Ohio woman, Marlean Ames, who alleges she was discriminated against by her employer, the Ohio Department of Youth Services, due to her heterosexual orientation.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson stated that Ames was unfairly held to a higher legal standard as a member of a majority group.
