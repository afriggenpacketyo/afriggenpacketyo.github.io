          <p>High-profile figures from England's Football Association (FA), including former technical director Kay Cossington and general manager Anja van Ginhoven, are moving to Bay Collective, a new US-based multi-club ownership group. This shift highlights a trend of experienced leaders being attracted to the opportunity of building a women's football ecosystem from the ground up in the United States. The new leadership team emphasizes a player-centric, high-performance culture, comparing the move from the established FA to a nimble "speedboat" capable of rapid, innovative change.</p>

Figures like Saikat Chakrabarti, who is challenging Nancy Pelosi in San Francisco, and Tennessee's Justin Pearson are running on platforms that include Medicare-for-all, wealth taxes, and climate justice. These candidates argue that the Democratic establishment has failed to address the country's underlying economic anxieties and are positioning themselves as a fresh alternative to the party's current leadership.</p>

          <p>An analysis of federal data by the Pew Research Center reveals that two-thirds of divorced Americans eventually remarry, with men being slightly more likely to do so than women. The study highlights the significant economic benefits of remarriage, showing that the median household wealth of remarried individuals is comparable to those in their first marriage and substantially higher than that of divorced, single adults. While remarriage is common, experts note that second marriages have a higher rate of divorce, particularly among older adults.</p>

          <p>A collection of advice from nearly 600 caregivers offers practical wisdom for those looking after ill or elderly adults, a role described as a marathon rather than a sprint. The guidance is organized into key themes, including navigating the complex healthcare system, adjusting to the "new normal" of a caregiving life, and the critical importance of asking for and accepting help. A central piece of advice is the necessity of self-care, which is framed not as a luxury but as an essential practice of setting boundaries to protect one's own health.</p>

          <p>Despite being dismissed by some as ineffective or "cringe," the opposition movement against Donald Trump has re-emerged with renewed purpose during his second term, exemplified by the large-scale "No Kings" protests. This article analyzes the movement's evolution, arguing that its earnest belief in American democracy is a powerful counter to the cynicism of the current administration. While early efforts were sometimes mocked for their aesthetics, their underlying idealism fueled significant on-the-ground organizing that achieved tangible political results, a model that continues with a new focus on local action.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner has confirmed that team captain Marc Guehi will leave the club next year after declining to sign a new contract. The 25-year-old England defender's current deal is set to expire at the end of the season. This decision means the club will either need to sell him during the January transfer window to receive a fee or risk losing him on a free transfer next summer when his contract concludes.</p>

          <p>Players from Oviedo and Espanyol staged a protest during their match by remaining motionless for the first 15 seconds, opposing La Liga's decision to host a game between Villarreal and Barcelona in Miami. The Spanish Footballers' Association (AFE) coordinated the symbolic action, citing a lack of transparency and dialogue from the league, with similar demonstrations planned for other matches. The decision to play a league game in the US has drawn criticism from players and coaches, including Barcelona's, who expressed unhappiness with the travel.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that the Galleri blood test can successfully detect over 50 different types of cancer, often at an early stage when treatment is more effective. The test, which identifies fragments of cancerous DNA in the blood, found cancer in nearly one in 100 adults tested, with a high accuracy rate in pinpointing the cancer's origin. Three-quarters of the cancers detected were types that currently have no routine screening programs, suggesting the test could significantly improve the approach to cancer diagnosis if further trials prove successful.</p>
