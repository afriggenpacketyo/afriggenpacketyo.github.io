          <p>The UK government is collaborating with medical influencers on TikTok to raise awareness about the dangers of cosmetic surgery abroad. This initiative is a response to a growing number of Britons traveling for procedures like dental work and hair implants, often attracted by lower costs. The campaign aims to educate potential patients on necessary precautions, such as consulting a UK doctor first and securing proper travel insurance, to prevent botched procedures that can lead to life-altering injuries and place a burden on the NHS for corrective treatments.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has invalidated two Trump administration directives that aimed to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in schools and universities. The ruling found that the Department of Education acted unlawfully by threatening to withdraw federal funding from institutions with DEI initiatives. The judge, a Trump appointee, determined the guidance constituted a major policy shift that was implemented without following proper legal procedures. This decision is seen as a significant victory for educational groups who argued the memos amounted to government censorship and created a chilling effect on protected speech.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama held a virtual meeting to support Texas House Democrats who left the state to prevent a Republican-led effort to pass new, GOP-favorable congressional maps. Obama praised their actions as a crucial stand against partisan gerrymandering, emphasizing the importance of protecting democratic processes. The meeting, also attended by former Attorney General Eric Holder, signals high-level party support for the Texas legislators' protest. This development comes as California Democrats, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, prepare a responsive redistricting plan to counteract the Texas proposal.</p>

The recordings were discovered by her daughter after she donated the late singer's record collection to the British Library's Sound Archive. The previously unheard tracks will be released by Decca, with the first single scheduled to mark the 80th anniversary of VJ Day. This discovery offers a new glimpse into the early career of the "Forces' Sweetheart," who became a symbol of hope for Britain during the Second World War.</p>

          <p>The England women's rugby team, the Red Roses, has become the first UK sports team to partner with Barbie, aiming to inspire more girls to take up the sport. The collaboration, launched ahead of the Rugby World Cup, will initially feature merchandise like t-shirts and replica balls rather than dolls. As part of the deal, Barbie's parent company Mattel will donate £20,000 to the Rugby Football Union to fund grassroots initiatives and improve access to coaching. The partnership seeks to leverage Barbie's brand to increase the visibility of women's rugby and support the RFU's outreach programs.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors not to exit the market, even though he acknowledges signs of "froth" or irrational exuberance. He contrasted the current situation with the dot-com bubble, arguing that today there are enough strong, rational stock stories to balance out the speculative activity. Cramer pointed to recent explosive IPOs and speculative stocks as examples of irrationality but highlighted companies like Amazon and Eli Lilly as representing legitimate, fundamental strength. He believes that the positive movements in well-founded companies are significant enough to warrant staying invested. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The American auto industry, particularly Ford, is facing an existential threat from the rapid advancement and low cost of Chinese electric vehicles. Ford CEO Jim Farley has announced a drastic overhaul of the company's EV strategy, starting with a new $30,000 electric truck to be produced in 2027 using a redesigned, more efficient assembly process. This new approach aims to reduce parts and speed up production to compete with Chinese automakers like Xiaomi and BYD. The success of this strategy is critical as the global auto market is increasingly dominated by these formidable new competitors.</p>

Ouattara had a productive previous season, scoring nine goals in 37 appearances for the Cherries.

          <p>As economic growth slows and spending habits tighten in China's major metropolitan areas, the country's smaller, lower-tier cities and counties are becoming a key driver of consumption. Residents in these areas often face lighter economic burdens and have faster-growing incomes, leading to stronger purchasing power and a greater willingness to spend. This "consumption upgrade" in overlooked markets is fueled by an expanding middle class with access to goods through robust e-commerce networks. Experts believe this trend represents a significant untapped potential for China's goal of shifting towards a more consumption-driven economy.</p>

Her lawyers filed a lawsuit arguing the attempt to deport her without a court hearing was illegal, as expedited removal is legally restricted to immigrants who have been in the country for less than two years. After a judge temporarily halted the deportation, the government agreed to move her to regular proceedings. The case raised concerns that the administration was testing a new policy to accelerate deportations of long-term residents.</p>

The company's valuation has reached levels that dwarf those of tech giants with much larger revenues, trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio above 280.
