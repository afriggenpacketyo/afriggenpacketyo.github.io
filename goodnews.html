        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a conservative backed by President Trump, narrowly won Poland's presidential election against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski, revealing deep divisions in the country. The outcome suggests Poland will likely take a more populist and nationalist path under Nawrocki's leadership, succeeding Andrzej Duda. While most day-to-day power rests with the prime minister, the president influences foreign policy and can veto legislation, hindering Prime Minister Donald Tusk's ability to fulfill promises to reverse laws politicizing the court system. Nawrocki, endorsed by Trump, has echoed some of Trump's language on Ukraine, promising continued support but criticizing President Zelenskyy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to modernize its airspace, potentially leading to quicker flights and fewer delays for passengers by creating the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS). This initiative aims to redesign flight paths, many of which were established 70 years ago, allowing planes to climb and descend more smoothly. Aviation Minister Mike Kane said that modernizing airspace is a simple way to reduce pollution from flying and will set the industry up for a sustainable future. The changes would be the largest redesign of UK airspace since the 1950s, accommodating the significant increase in flights over the years.</p>

          <p>Opposition party leader Lee Jae Myung is projected to win South Korea's snap presidential election, triggered by the impeachment of Yoon Suk Yeol. Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 election to Yoon, holds a sizable lead in opinion polls, and is expected to contend with reviving South Korea's economy and completing a tariff agreement with the U.S. While both Lee and his rival share goals like economic growth and housing affordability, they differ on economic policy platforms. Goldman Sachs notes that fiscal policy under Lee is likely to be more expansionary, while monetary policy by the Bank of Korea will likely offset the gap.</p>

The disruption caused by the wildfires has taken a toll on children's mental health, with some experiencing panic, nightmares, and separation anxiety. The camp aims to restore a sense of safety and normalcy, allowing children to process their experiences and begin the healing process.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have engineered a new type of rice, dubbed "tea rice," enriched with antioxidant compounds found in green tea. This rice contains catechin, a micronutrient known for its antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and cardioprotective properties. The researchers claim that this innovation could provide the health benefits of tea without the side effects of caffeine. Catechins are thought to play a role in regulating blood pressure, aiding in weight loss, and lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease.</p>

While birth order archetypes are often simplistic, siblings act as vivid mirrors, challenging flaws and providing a unique perspective on oneself.</p>

          <p>India anticipates only a "minor impact" from President Trump's plan to increase tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, as its exports to the U.S. are relatively low. Steel Minister HD Kumaraswamy stated that India is not a major exporter to the U.S. However, ratings agency Fitch has suggested that Indian steelmakers could be affected if countries with higher exposure to the U.S. redirect their shipments to India. This potential influx could impact domestic steel prices and market dynamics.</p>
