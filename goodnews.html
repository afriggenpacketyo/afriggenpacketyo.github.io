          <p>The United States and Britain have announced a preliminary trade agreement to lower tariffs and create export opportunities for American agricultural products. However, differences in food production standards, particularly regarding hormone-treated beef and chlorine-washed chicken, could hinder a more comprehensive trade deal. While U.S. officials aim to increase access for American products, British consumers are wary of American food safety and animal welfare practices. The article notes that British regulations, largely inherited from the European Union, prioritize animal welfare and environmental protection, leading to public resistance against lowering food production standards.</p>

          <p>Walmart reported strong sales growth, particularly in its e-commerce division, but cautioned that tariffs imposed by President Trump will soon lead to higher prices for consumers. The retail giant stated that it cannot absorb the full impact of the tariffs due to narrow retail margins. While Walmart will try to keep food prices low, shoppers may see price increases on general merchandise items as early as the end of the month. Despite these challenges, Walmart maintained its full-year financial forecast, but refrained from projecting profits for the current quarter due to tariff policy uncertainties.</p>

Online banks often offer more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs.
