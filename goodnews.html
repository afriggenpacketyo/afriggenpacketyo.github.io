          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $750 million for the upcoming Monday drawing after no ticket matched all six numbers on Saturday night. This prize now stands as the tenth-largest in the history of the lottery, with a cash value option of approximately $338.6 million. While there was no grand prize winner, several tickets won smaller prizes, including three tickets that matched five numbers for $1 million each, with one doubling to $2 million due to the Power Play option. The drawing marks the 37th consecutive round without a jackpot winner since May.</p>

          <p>The animated Netflix movie "KPop Demon Hunters" is experiencing massive success, transitioning from the streaming platform to sold-out singalong screenings in nearly 1,800 theaters for a special weekend event. The film, about a fictional all-girl rock band fighting evil spirits, is on track to become Netflix's most-watched movie ever, with its soundtrack dominating music charts. This unusual move for a streaming-first film is seen as both a reward for its dedicated fanbase and a strategic promotion to broaden its audience. Analysts suggest the property has significant franchise potential, including merchandise and sequels.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that China must adopt a more pragmatic approach and view India as a partner rather than a rival to reset bilateral relations at a critical juncture. Recent high-level diplomatic exchanges, including a visit by Foreign Minister Wang Yi to New Delhi, have shown encouraging signs of re-engagement after a period of tension marked by unresolved territorial disputes. The piece suggests that global economic uncertainties and shifting geopolitics, such as new US tariffs on India, present a strategic opportunity for the two nations to find common ground. Restarting talks on India's participation in the RCEP is proposed as a crucial step towards constructive collaboration.</p>

          <p>Germany is moving forward with plans to build a national memorial in Berlin to honor the victims of the communist dictatorship in the former East Germany. The project, approved by the Bundestag in 2019, is expected to receive necessary funding in the 2026 federal budget, allowing a design competition to launch. Victims' associations have described the memorial as "long overdue," emphasizing its importance for survivors and for remembering those who died opposing the authoritarian regime. The memorial aims to educate future generations about the differences between democracy and dictatorship, serving as a prominent reminder of the repression under the German Democratic Republic.</p>

          <p>Argentina's national rugby team, the Pumas, made history by securing their first-ever home victory against New Zealand's All Blacks with a 29-23 win in Buenos Aires. The landmark achievement came in the 16th attempt on home soil, 40 years after their first official home test against the powerhouse team. Argentina capitalized on an ill-disciplined performance from New Zealand, which saw three players sent to the sin-bin. Key performances included two tries for Argentina and 13 crucial points from the boot of Santiago Carreras, delighting the raucous home crowd and marking a significant milestone for Argentinian rugby.</p>

          <p>In a milestone for cultural heritage collaboration, a Chinese archaeological team from the Shanghai Museum will lead an excavation project at the ruins of the Sekhmet Temple in Egypt. The temple is part of the ancient Memphis archaeological site, which dates back over 5,100 years and was once the capital of ancient Egypt.

          <p>In Estonia, citizens are increasingly participating in civil defense organizations like the Women's Voluntary Defense Organization (Naiskodukaitse) to prepare for a potential Russian invasion. Since Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine began, membership has surged, with volunteers learning skills in first aid, military tactics, and safety. Despite the proximity to Russia and recent acts of sabotage like GPS jamming in the Baltic Sea, residents express a sense of preparedness rather than fear. Analysts note that Estonia's deep-rooted defense culture, significant defense spending (3.4% of GDP), and crucial NATO membership provide a strong deterrent against a direct military assault.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of French citizens are joining the military reserves, driven by growing security concerns in Europe, particularly the threat from an aggressive Russia. The number of operational reservists has soared from 28,000 in 2014 to over 46,000 today, with the government aiming to reach 105,000 by 2035. This trend reflects a broader European effort to bolster defense capabilities, as young people and professionals volunteer for rigorous part-time military training. Recruits cite a patriotic duty to protect their country in a complicated geopolitical context, signaling a renewed public interest in national defense more than two decades after France ended compulsory military service.</p>
