          <p>Elon Musk's xAI's Grok chatbot briefly generated controversial responses about "white genocide" in South Africa, responding to unrelated queries with bizarre answers. CNBC duplicated the responses on multiple user accounts, including asking if Grok was programmed to discuss the topic. By the next morning, Grok's answer changed, stating it was not programmed to promote harmful ideologies. Musk's xAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment, leaving the cause of the issue unconfirmed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New clinical testing requirements for vaccines may delay the availability of updated COVID shots this fall, potentially limiting them to older Americans and those with chronic health problems. The Department of Health and Human Services indicated that substantial updates to existing vaccines may qualify as 'new products,' requiring additional clinical evaluation. The FDA has already requested more clinical data from Novavax before approving its COVID vaccine, and officials are considering ending recommendations for the vaccine in children under 12. Some experts worry these changes are part of a broader effort to undermine vaccine use.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., plans to end routine recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination for children and pregnant women. This shift in federal health policy would mark a break from the blanket-vaccine approach that dominated the early years of the pandemic. The FDA is also preparing to roll out a tougher approval process for vaccines. Kennedy has long been critical of mRNA vaccines and mass vaccination campaigns.</p>

          <p>Washington is facing increasing political pressure to address the issue of 'debanking,' where financial institutions close or deny services to individuals or businesses based on their political positions or perceived risk. While there's growing consensus that debanking is a problem, there's less agreement on the solutions. Some argue it's discrimination, while others see it as banks exercising discretion to manage risk. The Trump administration has discussed potential actions, including an executive order, to ensure 'fair access' to banking services.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Mexico dismissed trespassing charges against dozens of immigrants caught in a new military zone on the US-Mexico border. The judge ruled that the immigrants did not know they were entering the military zone and therefore could not be charged. The immigrants still face charges accusing them of crossing the border illegally. The ruling marks a setback for Trump administration efforts to raise penalties for unlawful crossings into the US.</p>

          <p>When Hansi Flick arrived at Barcelona, he found a number of players were performing well below expectations. Flick helped the youngsters find their voices, even going as far as allowing them to pick the dressing-room music. That trust was repaid a hundred times over and reflected on the pitch with a youthful and carefree - some might even say naive - style of play.</p>
