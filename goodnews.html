          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised its growth forecast for the UK economy in 2025 to 1.2%, increasing to 1.4% in 2026, citing an economic recovery underway. However, the IMF warns that the Chancellor must adhere to tax and spending rules to maintain stability. While praising the government's planning reforms and infrastructure investment plans, the IMF notes that global trade tensions and volatile financial market conditions pose challenges. The IMF also suggests changes to the government's fiscal rules, such as reducing the frequency of assessments by the Office for Budget Responsibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is considering acquiring a "golden share" in United States Steel Corp. to gain veto power over major decisions amid Nippon Steel Corp.'s planned acquisition of the U.S. steelmaker. This move aims to address national security concerns by providing the U.S. government with special rights to block certain actions by Nippon Steel, such as reducing production capacity. President Trump stated that U.S. Steel would remain under American control even after a partnership with Nippon Steel, emphasizing the importance of U.S. oversight. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States is conducting another review of the plans.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions board is considering a proposal for sudden-death extra time, known as "golden point," if the deciding third Test against Australia this summer ends in a draw. Rugby Australia chief Phil Waugh suggested the idea, aiming to provide a more decisive outcome for fans. The proposal needs approval from the Lions board and both participating teams. Super Rugby Pacific has already implemented golden point for regular season games, but knockout games use standard extra time followed by golden point if necessary.</p>

Leander claimed the 8th position with a high median household income, while Pflugerville and Cedar Park followed closely. Austin, on the other hand, dropped to 164th place, potentially due to factors like traffic and housing affordability. These rankings emphasize the appeal of suburban living in Central Texas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated that the government is considering abolishing the two-child benefit cap, but cautioned that it would "cost a lot of money". The policy, which restricts means-tested benefits for third or additional children born after April 2017, has been criticized for pushing families into poverty. The decision on the cap is expected in the autumn when the government releases its child poverty strategy. The Child Poverty Taskforce is examining the cap, and "nothing is off the table," Phillipson said.</p>
