          <p>Major U.S. stock indexes, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, have achieved record highs, driven by investor optimism regarding a potential U.S.-China trade agreement and anticipated interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. This rally marks a significant recovery from a bear market earlier in the year, fueled by a rebound in technology stocks and easing concerns over tariff policies. Despite the positive momentum, some analysts express caution, suggesting that market complacency about trade deals could lead to future volatility. The market also digested new data showing a slight increase in inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist assemblyman, has won the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City. His victory on June 24th is seen as a significant win against the party's establishment. Mamdani's campaign style, which included walking the entire length of Manhattan to engage with voters, has drawn comparisons to former mayor Ed Koch. His progressive platform and grassroots approach have positioned him as a formidable new figure in New York politics, though the article suggests his confrontational style could be a double-edged sword.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has modified his government's proposed welfare reforms after facing significant opposition from his own Labour Party MPs. The initial plan aimed to tighten eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to reduce spending, but the stricter criteria will now only apply to new claimants. The government also reversed a planned freeze on the health-related component of Universal Credit for existing recipients and will fast-track a support package to help people find work. The changes are a concession to backbenchers who threatened to defeat the bill.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt at $1.17 trillion, many consumers are exploring debt settlement, but this strategy has its limits. While there is no official cap, experts suggest that debt settlement becomes less effective for balances exceeding $100,000. At this level, creditors are more likely to pursue legal action, the lump-sum funds required for settlement become unrealistic for many, and fees from debt relief companies can become prohibitively expensive. For those with overwhelming debt, alternatives like debt consolidation, credit counseling, or even bankruptcy may be more viable options to consider. (not investment advice)</p>

She fought to publish works that were uncompromising in their vision for Black people, resisting industry pressure to cater to white audiences. The essay argues that Morrison's editorial work redefined legacy, proving that literature written for a specific community could achieve universal acclaim through its sheer quality and humanity.</p>

In a 6-3 decision, the court rejected a challenge from conservative groups who argued that Congress had unconstitutionally delegated its legislative and taxing powers to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which administers the fund. Justice Elena Kagan, writing for the majority, affirmed that the delegation was constitutional. The ruling ensures continued funding for telecommunications access for schools, libraries, and rural healthcare providers across the country.</p>

This trend is also reflected in retirement savings, with 401(k) contribution rates hitting a record high.

          <h2>Stellantis Unveils Aggressive Turnaround Plan for Ailing Ram Trucks Brand</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 11:59:41 EDT</div>

          <p>Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis has launched an aggressive turnaround plan to revive the Stellantis truck brand, which has seen sales decline 38% since 2019. The strategy includes reintroducing Hemi V-8 engines, offering a new industry-leading powertrain warranty, and returning to NASCAR. Kuniskis, who returned from a brief retirement, acknowledged that issues with pricing and a problematic redesign of the Ram 1500 contributed to the brand's slump. The plan aims to reclaim significant market share in the highly profitable full-size pickup segment, a crucial component of Stellantis's overall business. (not investment advice)</p>
