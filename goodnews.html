          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended to land on Venus in 1972, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after spending 53 years in space due to a failed rocket booster, according to Roscosmos. The spacecraft, a relic of the Cold War space race, splashed down in the Indian Ocean near Jakarta, Indonesia, potentially remaining intact during its descent. The mission serves as a reminder of the Soviet Union's ambitious Venera program, which achieved several firsts in Venus exploration, including the first probes to enter another planet's atmosphere and transmit data from its surface. While modern missions focus on Mars and other celestial bodies, a Japanese probe remains the only vehicle orbiting Venus, highlighting the historical significance of the Soviet efforts.</p>

          <p>A bronze sculpture representing the attempted assassination of President Donald Trump in Butler, PA, last year has been placed on display in the Oval Office. The artwork portrays the moment when then-candidate Trump was pulled off stage by Secret Service agents after shots were fired from a nearby rooftop, an event that became a defining image of his resilience during the 2024 election. The sculpture is believed to be a maquette for a larger statue planned by artist Stan Watts of the Trump Statue Project, intended to symbolize Trump‚Äôs confidence, strength, and hope. The White House has not released a statement as to why the statue was there on that day or whether it had been presented to the president.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his new memoir, "Who Knew," media executive Barry Diller reflects on his career, emphasizing the importance of instinct over excessive data in decision-making. Diller recounts his time at ABC, where he championed the "Movie of the Week," and how relying on gut feelings rather than research led to successes like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker." He argues that overtraining on data can hinder creative and business judgments, and that a good idea should make simple common sense. Diller also shares anecdotes about recognizing promising projects and trusting his instincts to bring them to fruition.</p>
