          <p>A Florida-based multi-agency task force, Joint Inter-Agency Task Force – South (JIATF-S), has seized a record one million pounds of cocaine during fiscal year 2025, an amount estimated to be worth $11.34 billion to cartels. This massive haul, enough for 378 million lethal doses, significantly disrupts transnational criminal organizations operating in the transit zone between South America, Central America, and the Caribbean. The effort, which also includes the U.S. Coast Guard, underscores intensified counter-narcotics strategies by the Trump administration. Officials emphasize that these disruptions are crucial for saving lives and protecting the homeland.</p>

          <p>YouTube has agreed to a $24.5 million settlement in a lawsuit filed by former President Donald Trump and other plaintiffs, stemming from his suspension from the platform in 2021. Of the settlement, $22 million will be allocated to the Trust for the National Mall for a White House State Ballroom, with the remaining $2.5 million going to other plaintiffs. YouTube, owned by Google, reinstated Trump's channel over two years after the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, citing the need for voters to hear from major candidates. This settlement follows similar agreements by Meta and X with Trump over his social media suspensions.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets are poised for a higher opening on Tuesday, with significant attention on the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) upcoming interest rate decision. Analysts, based on a Reuters poll, widely expect the RBA to maintain its cash rate at 3.6%, as persistent high inflation limits the central bank's capacity for monetary policy loosening. Any shift in the RBA's tone or forward guidance could influence AUD crosses, especially given recent volatility in building approvals. Futures for Australia's S&P/ASX 200 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index both indicate an upward trend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserts that the current artificial intelligence boom fundamentally differs from the 2000 dotcom bubble, highlighting the robust financial health and substantive operations of today's leading tech companies. He argues that giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon possess ample cash reserves, enabling them to absorb poor investments or pivot, unlike many overleveraged dotcom-era firms. Cramer also notes that these wealthy companies are primarily responsible for building AI infrastructure, ensuring greater stability. Despite his confidence in Big Tech's potential, he advocates for ongoing investor skepticism to prevent market irrationality. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has launched a new action plan to restrict output growth in the non-ferrous metals sector, targeting a 1.5% increase for primary metals this year, a decrease from last year's 4.3%. The strategy shifts focus from sheer volume to optimizing industrial structure, aiming for a 5% average annual growth in value-added output. This move seeks to combat intense competition and bolster the exploration of crucial resources like copper, aluminum, and lithium. The plan also promotes the development of ultra-pure metals and advanced rare earth materials, alongside enhanced recycling efforts for used batteries and solar panels.</p>

          <p>New West Ham manager Nuno Espirito Santo has declared that fostering closer ties between the club's fans and players is his "main priority" following a 1-1 draw against Everton. In his first game in charge, Nuno acknowledged fan protests and chants of "sack the board," but after Jarrod Bowen's equalizer, he led his players to acknowledge the traveling supporters. The former Tottenham and Nottingham Forest boss emphasized the need for the team to "deliver" on the pitch to earn fan appreciation.

          <p>Matthew McConaughey shared that he maintained an eight-year period of secrecy from his mother, Kay, during their weekly phone calls due to her tendency to share personal information with the media. This "hiatus" began after Kay gave a media tour of his childhood home without his consent, driven by her pride. McConaughey explained that he couldn't trust her with substantive details during his rise to fame. The actor eventually lifted the restrictions once he felt more stable in his public life, now allowing his mom to "say whatever the hell she wants." The two are set to co-star in the upcoming film "The Lost Bus."</p>
