          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney has robustly defended his generation of players against recent criticism from Steven Gerrard, who characterized them as "egotistical losers" lacking team cohesion. On his BBC podcast, Rooney countered that his squad worked diligently and genuinely attempted to achieve success, but ultimately "didn't quite manage to get over the line" in major tournaments. He acknowledged that relationships between players from rival clubs, like Liverpool and Manchester United, were more challenging then compared to today's era, which he attributes to improved media coverage and off-field camaraderie. Rooney emphasized that despite their lack of silverware, the team was always united in their effort and belief.</p>

          <p>Rhun ap Iorwerth, leader of Plaid Cymru, has declared his party ready to replace Welsh Labour in the upcoming Senedd election, promising a "new government, with new energy and new ideas." Labour has governed Wales since devolution began in 1999, but recent polling suggests Plaid Cymru is now vying for leadership, alongside Reform UK. Ap Iorwerth aims to position Plaid as the leading anti-Reform party and a credible alternative government, even though forming a majority might require coalition. The party plans to offer "radical" yet financially cautious policies, like a payment to tackle child poverty, appealing to a broader electorate beyond its traditional Welsh-speaking strongholds.</p>

          <p>Prince William was visibly moved during the launch of a new National Suicide Prevention Network, becoming emotional as he heard firsthand about the devastating impact of suicide from Rhian Mannings. Mannings' husband took his own life shortly after the death of their infant son, and she later founded a bereavement charity. The Prince of Wales's Royal Foundation is contributing £1 million over three years to establish this UK-wide network, aiming to foster a "bold, unified national response" to the preventable tragedy of suicide. The initiative seeks to understand root causes, offer accessible support, and encourage collaboration among various agencies, addressing the pervasive stigma surrounding mental health and suicide.</p>

She had recently retired from her official duties due to health concerns, just a month after celebrating her 106th birthday.

          <p>The identity of a woman whose body was found on a Dutch beach in 2004 has finally been revealed after 21 years as 35-year-old German citizen Eva Maria Pommer, thanks to the international police campaign Operation Identify Me. Her body, found in sand dunes near Wassenaar, presented no obvious signs of injury, and her unusual attire and a key linking her to Bottrop, Germany, had long puzzled investigators. A crucial tip-off following a German TV appeal, combined with DNA testing, led to her identification. This success marks the fourth person named through the Interpol-coordinated initiative, which aims to solve cold cases of women who died in suspicious circumstances across Europe.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Discover Salt-Laced Ice Can Generate Electricity Through Bending</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 00:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists from China and Spain have made a significant breakthrough, discovering that salt-laced ice can generate electricity when subjected to bending, offering a novel approach to harnessing clean power in cold environments. This innovative research found that salt-doped ice produces an electrical response comparable to some of the best ceramic materials known for their electrical properties. The underlying mechanism is flexoelectricity, which involves the generation of an electrical charge when a material experiences non-uniform strain. This discovery builds upon earlier work by the same team on pure ice and holds promise for developing low-cost energy sources, particularly in regions where ice is plentiful.</p>

          <p>China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) have announced new joint policies to tackle "disorderly price competition" prevalent in several industries. This concerted effort aims to mitigate the negative impacts of price wars and aggressive cost-cutting, which harm industry development, product innovation, and overall quality and safety. The regulatory bodies will collaborate with industry associations to assess average production costs and help businesses establish fair pricing. Authorities are now empowered to issue warnings, conduct thorough cost investigations, and intervene directly when price wars are suspected, ensuring compliance with pricing laws and fostering a more stable and healthy national economy.</p>

          <p>The Israeli government has formally approved a deal for the release of hostages and a ceasefire, marking a significant and hopeful development in the protracted conflict. This decision follows intensive negotiations and President Trump's earlier announcement of a first-phase peace plan, aimed at de-escalating hostilities. While specific details of the agreement are still being finalized, the approval signals a potential pause in fighting and offers considerable hope for the safe return of captives. The United States is reportedly deploying approximately 200 troops to Israel to support the implementation of this ceasefire deal, underscoring international efforts to ensure stability and facilitate its successful execution.</p>

          <p>Maine Governor Janet Mills, a Democrat, is expected to officially launch her campaign for the US Senate next week, aiming to unseat long-serving Republican Senator Susan Collins. Mills, who is term-limited as governor and previously served as the state's attorney general, is a highly sought-after recruit for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Her entry into the race will intensify an already expanding primary field and presents a significant opportunity for Democrats to potentially flip a GOP-held seat, given Maine's recent lean-Democratic voting trends.

          <p>Sanae Takaichi's victory in Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership race is poised to reshape the nation's domestic economy and foreign policy, marking the rise of Japan's first female prime minister-in-waiting. Her arch-conservative and nationalist stance signals a departure from previous centrist pragmatism, favoring fiscal expansionism, protectionist undertones, and state-led investment in defense and technology. While this approach aims to reduce reliance on China and bolster security, it risks increasing public debt and alienating moderates. Takaichi's leadership could also shift economic engagement with Southeast Asia, tying aid and investment more closely to strategic cooperation rather than mutual development.</p>

          <p>Battlefield 6, the latest installment in the military shooter series, is launching with immense buzz and significant investment from Electronic Arts (EA), aiming to challenge rival Call of Duty. Developed by four EA-owned studios, the game is touted as "unbeatable" by general manager Rebecka Coutaz, building on lessons learned from the negatively received Battlefield 2042. The new title reintroduces a single-player campaign and has engaged fans early through playtests, receiving "explosively positive" feedback. Despite a recent $55 billion acquisition of EA by a Saudi-led group, the development team confirms plans for ongoing updates, with generative AI used in preparatory stages to boost creativity.</p>
