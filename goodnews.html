          <p>The UK Parliament is set to debate a law change aimed at decriminalizing abortion, with two Labour MPs proposing rival amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill. Current law states that abortion is illegal but allowed up to 24 weeks of pregnancy under certain conditions, with approval from two doctors. One amendment seeks to prevent women from being investigated or prosecuted for terminating their own pregnancies, while maintaining punishments for medical professionals or violent partners who cause a pregnancy to end unlawfully. Recent data indicates a rise in investigations related to suspected abortion offenses. </p>

While Japan's arms exports are currently low compared to other nations, building domestic capacity is seen as essential for ensuring its security and reducing dependence on the U.S. </p>

Red light is used to induce sleep, while blue light suppresses melatonin to wake the body up.
