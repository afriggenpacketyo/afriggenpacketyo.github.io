          <p>Palisades Charter High School's graduation ceremony was relocated to the Hollywood Bowl after a fire damaged the school. The event was bittersweet for the 740 graduating seniors, who missed celebrating at their traditional Stadium by the Sea. The January fire destroyed homes of students and faculty, causing significant disruption. The Hollywood Bowl was offered as a venue by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, with speakers like Steve Kerr and Billy Crystal offering messages of resilience. The ceremony included student performances and a message from Governor Gavin Newsom, highlighting the students' ability to overcome adversity.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers trapped in Burmese amber has provided new insights into the evolution of flight feathers. The study reveals how feathers evolved during the Cretaceous period, enabling early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences conducted a detailed structural study of feathers dating back 99 million years. They determined that the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift was an essential feature of bird evolution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria to colonize a newborn's gut could protect against dangerous infections. The study showed that the presence of Bifidobacterium longum in newborns seemed to halve the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute analyzed stool samples from 1,082 newborns and tracked their health for two years. The protective bacteria were more commonly found in babies born via vaginal delivery, but not always, suggesting potential for therapies to boost good bacteria in infants.</p>

          <p>A judge has sided with environmental groups, issuing a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp., delaying the restart of offshore oil operations near Santa Barbara. The ruling halts work on the onshore pipeline system, which suffered a major rupture in 2015, until at least July 18. Environmental groups argued that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without proper environmental review or public input. Sable officials now target August 1, 2025, for first sales due to this delay, sparking celebration among environmental activists and concern from state officials.</p>

          <p>Alicia and Chu Gomez, a couple outside Boston, are experiencing retirement fears amid uncertain market conditions. The couple is part of the sandwich generation, supporting multiple sets of relatives under one roof, making retirement savings challenging. Market volatility has caused them to adjust their retirement timeline, now considering working until at least 67. They are currently maximizing their retirement accounts but worry about the future of Social Security. Labor economist Teresa Ghilarducci advises against making rash decisions and stresses the importance of seeking expert financial advice (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Health experts are advising women using weight-loss injections to stop if they are trying to conceive, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding. UK drug safety experts state that the effects of medicines like Wegovy and Mounjaro on unborn babies are unknown. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommends using contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward before attempting pregnancy. There are concerns that the increasing popularity of these drugs means many women are not using them safely or receiving proper medical advice.</p>
