          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is alerting travelers to the potential cybersecurity risks associated with using public USB charging ports at airports. Hackers can install malware on USB ports, a practice known as 'juice jacking,' to access personal information on connected devices. The TSA recommends using TSA-compliant power bricks or battery packs instead of plugging phones directly into USB ports. Cybersecurity expert Kurt Knutsson advises travelers to use charging blocks plugged into outlets rather than USB ports, emphasizing the risk of malware installation and data theft. The agency also advises against using free public Wi-Fi for sensitive online activities.</p>

Markram shared an unbroken 143-run partnership with captain Temba Bavuma, who was hampered by a hamstring injury. South Africa needs 69 runs to win, potentially ending their wait for a major men's final victory. The match is poised for a dramatic conclusion on day four.</p>

          <p>Many countries face blood donor shortages, prompting research into artificial, lab-made blood. Animal blood is currently not a viable alternative due to immune system rejection. Scientists are exploring various methods, including genetically modifying red blood cells, neutralizing blood types with gut bacteria enzymes, and creating microscopic artificial blood cells. The US military is also backing research to enhance red blood cell performance for soldiers. Researchers at Japan's Nara Medical University have begun testing artificial hemoglobin in humans, with promising results. Safe artificial blood production at scale is still years away, making human blood donations essential.</p>
