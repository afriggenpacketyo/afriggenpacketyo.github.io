          <p>Ncuti Gatwa has left his role as the Doctor after two series on Doctor Who, regenerating into Billie Piper, who previously played the Doctor's companion, Rose Tyler.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Mookie Betts was sidelined after sustaining a fractured toe while walking to the bathroom in the dark.

It clarifies the rules for delaying Medicare enrollment without penalties for individuals covered by employer-provided health insurance. The article also distinguishes between the home sale exemption, which allows homeowners to exclude up to $500,000 of profit from taxation, and 1031 exchanges, which allow investors to defer capital gains on investment properties, explaining how these tax laws can be used separately but not simultaneously.

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities initially reported a much higher number but corrected the figure after consulting with a beekeeper. The incident prompted warnings for the public to avoid the area and stay at least 600 feet away. More than two dozen beekeepers assisted with the rescue, aiming to re-hive as many bees as possible, and the road was closed for about 24 hours to facilitate the effort.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article examines how inflation is impacting the cost of a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, a staple in New York City bodegas. At El Vacilon Grocery in Brooklyn, the price recently increased from $4.50 to $5 due to soaring egg costs and other rising expenses. The bodega owners, Freddy and Yovanna Melo, are closely monitoring their costs to maintain a profit margin of 20-30% per item. The Melos emphasize that owning their building is crucial for their business's survival, as revenue has declined while expenses have increased.</p>

Grupo Firme stated that the visas of the band and their team are under "administrative review by the U.S. Embassy," making it "impossible" to perform at the La Onda Fest. The suspension is the latest move by the Trump administration targeting Mexican artists in the genre, who in some cases have glorified cartel leaders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article humorously critiques the overuse of corporate buzzwords, arguing that they impede trust and create a culture of exclusion. Studies have shown that employees who feel lower-status tend to use more jargon, and Gen Zers may cling to buzzwords as corporate life rafts. The author suggests that buzzwords are often used to distract from the primary goal of making money, and encourages people to speak in real, human terms. The piece advocates for radical candor and clear communication over the use of meaningless metaphors.</p>
