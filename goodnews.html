          <p>Robinhood has expanded its cryptocurrency offerings in the European Union by launching tokenized shares of private companies, including OpenAI and SpaceX, causing its stock to surge to an all-time high. This move makes equity in these unlisted, high-demand companies accessible to a broader audience in Europe, where accredited investor rules do not apply. The company is promoting the launch by giving away tokens to new users, aiming to democratize access to private equity through blockchain technology. However, due to regulatory hurdles, a similar rollout for U.S. users is not expected in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent launch of Robinhood's ambitious crypto product suite in Cannes, France, marks a surreal homecoming for its crypto general manager, Johann Kerbrat. Fifteen years ago, Kerbrat was living in a small apartment nearby, teaching himself to code while working at McDonald's before launching his first fintech startup. Now, he is overseeing the rollout of tokenized U.S. stocks, crypto staking, and a new Layer 2 blockchain, a move that blends traditional finance with blockchain infrastructure. This feature article highlights his personal journey as a backdrop to Robinhood's major strategic push to make crypto more accessible and seamlessly integrated for mass adoption.</p>

          <p>At a significant economic meeting, Chinese President Xi Jinping highlighted the strategic importance of creating a "unified national market." This priority aims to bolster domestic demand as the country faces a more challenging and uncertain global environment. According to a readout from the meeting, the Communist Party's economic commission stressed the need to better integrate domestic and foreign trade. The plan includes facilitating the sale of export-oriented goods within China and supporting firms that operate in both markets, signaling a continued focus on internal economic resilience.</p>

          <h2>Jewelry Sales Remain a Bright Spot as Overall US Luxury Goods Spending Declines, Citi Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 08:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite expectations for a rebound, U.S. spending on luxury goods fell in the first five months of 2025 compared to the previous year, according to a Citigroup report. While categories like leather goods and ready-to-wear faltered, jewelry has consistently outperformed, with spending surging 10.1% year-over-year in May. Analysts suggest this resilience is driven by the perception of jewelry as a tangible investment, especially with rising gold prices, and its sentimental value for commemorating milestones. In contrast, other luxury sectors have seen demand wane amid significant price hikes without corresponding innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has charged 324 defendants in what it calls the largest healthcare fraud enforcement action in its history, disrupting schemes that attempted to defraud federal programs of $14.6 billion. The operation targeted complex fraud operations, some run by transnational criminal organizations, that submitted false claims to programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Officials reported that the actual loss to the government was about $2.9 billion, and the enforcement action led to the seizure of over $245 million in assets. Among those charged are 93 doctors and other medical professionals.</p>

          <p>A 92-year-old man, Ryland Headley, has been convicted for the sexual assault and murder of 75-year-old Louisa Dunne in her home in 1967, resolving one of the United Kingdom's longest-running cold cases. Headley was found guilty after new forensic testing in 2024 linked his DNA to evidence preserved from the crime scene 58 years ago. Investigators used Dunne's original clothing to obtain a DNA profile, which matched Headley's profile on the national database. Headley, who was also convicted of sexually assaulting two other elderly women in the 1970s, has been sentenced to life in prison.</p>

          <h2>Understanding the Dangers of Heat Exhaustion and Heat Stroke</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the critical differences between heat exhaustion and the more dangerous heat stroke, offering guidance on how to recognize and respond to each. Heat exhaustion, an earlier stage of overheating, presents with symptoms like headache, heavy sweating, and dizziness, and can be treated by moving to a cool place and rehydrating. If left untreated, it can progress to heat stroke, a life-threatening emergency where the body's temperature regulation system fails, sweat production stops, and body temperature can rise rapidly. For heat stroke, immediate emergency medical attention is crucial, along with rapid cooling measures.</p>

          <p>A novel titled "Parting," written in 1932 by a 24-year-old Sebastian Haffner before he fled Nazi Germany, has become a bestseller nearly a quarter-century after its manuscript was discovered. Haffner, a renowned journalist and historian, shelved the autobiographical love story, which was found by his son after his death in 1999. The book, which captures a sense of hope and joie de vivre amidst the looming threat of fascism, tells the story of a young couple torn between Berlin and Paris. Its publication offers a new perspective on Haffner, revealing a talent for fiction that was overshadowed by his later, more serious historical works.</p>

By using reverse image search and verifying coordinates on Google Maps, the location was confirmed to be the Iranian military facility.
