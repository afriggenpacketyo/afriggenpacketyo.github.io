          <p>Transport for London (TfL) is initiating a campaign to address the "disruptive behavior" of passengers playing music and making calls on mobile phone loudspeakers. Research indicates that 70% of commuters find such noise a nuisance, with some experiencing significant stress, especially individuals with heightened sensitivities like autism. Posters and social media messages will encourage headphone use and consideration for fellow travelers, particularly as 4G/5G coverage expands across the Tube network. This article highlights efforts to improve the public transport experience through promoting passenger etiquette.</p>

          <p>China plans to expand its carbon market to include major polluting industries by 2027, three years ahead of schedule, demonstrating a strong commitment to climate targets. The new guidelines also introduce absolute emission limits, a tougher standard than the current carbon intensity-based caps. This expansion is expected to significantly boost demand within the often-sluggish carbon market, potentially leading to a more aggressive emissions reduction pathway for the world's largest carbon polluter. This article highlights China's intensified efforts to combat climate change through market mechanisms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley is in a significant quandary regarding whether to play or sit out the upcoming tournament, a decision he describes as "the biggest of my life."

Despite his strong recent form and high world ranking, Bradley must weigh the potential criticism of self-indulgence if he plays and the team loses, versus not contributing on the course if he sits out. This article explores the unique challenges of his leadership role.</p>
