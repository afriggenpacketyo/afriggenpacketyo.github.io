          <p>A UK court has dismissed the terrorism case against Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, a member of the Irish rap group Kneecap. He was charged for allegedly displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah, a proscribed organization, during a 2024 concert. The chief magistrate ruled the charge was "unlawful" and "null" due to a technical error in how it was brought forward by prosecutors. Supporters, including Northern Ireland's First Minister Michelle O'Neill, celebrated the decision, framing the case as a politically motivated attempt to silence criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza and a victory against political policing.</p>

          <p>An Interpol-coordinated operation across 14 African nations has resulted in the arrest of 260 individuals suspected of running large-scale romance and "sextortion" scams. The sting, funded by the UK, targeted criminal networks that used digital platforms to defraud over 1,400 victims out of an estimated $2.8 million. During the crackdown, authorities seized numerous devices, forged documents, and dismantled 81 cyber-crime groups. The operation highlights the rising threat of digital-enabled crimes in Africa, which cause significant financial and psychological harm to a wide range of victims, including the elderly.</p>

          <p>Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair is reportedly involved in high-level discussions to potentially lead a post-war transitional authority in Gaza. The proposal, said to have White House support, would see Blair head a UN-backed body named the Gaza International Transitional Authority for approximately five years before handing control back to Palestinians. This plan is modeled on past international administrations in East Timor and Kosovo and comes as various parties table different proposals for Gaza's future governance. Blair, who previously served as a Middle East envoy, has been part of planning talks with the U.S. and other stakeholders.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto is currently moving over the Atlantic, and while it is not expected to make landfall, meteorologists are monitoring its potential interaction with another nearby developing storm. This interaction could lead to a rare phenomenon known as the Fujiwhara effect, where two storms become entangled around a common center. The outcome depends on the storms' relative strengths; they could either merge or spin around each other before separating. Forecasters note this outcome is unlikely but possible, and it could cause slight alterations to the storms' predicted paths as they move through the region.</p>

          <p>The NFL is hosting a regular-season game in Dublin, Ireland, featuring the Pittsburgh Steelers against the Minnesota Vikings, marking a significant homecoming for the Steelers' founding Rooney family. The family's ancestors emigrated from County Down, Ireland, during the Great Famine in the 1840s before eventually settling in Pennsylvania. The late Dan Rooney, a former team president and U.S. Ambassador to Ireland, was instrumental in bringing the NFL to Ireland for a pre-season game in 1997. The event is described as being "bigger than football," celebrating the deep cultural ties between Ireland and the many Americans of Irish heritage.</p>

          <p>An ash tree located on a busy road in Glasgow has been named the UK's Tree of the Year for 2025 after winning a public vote. The Argyle Street Ash was nominated as a wildcard entry and gained significant local support, celebrating its cultural and historical significance to the community. The tree was referenced in a 1951 book and is a well-known local landmark, with stories of people meeting under its branches. As the winner of the Woodland Trust competition, the Glasgow tree will now represent the UK in the European Tree of the Year finals in 2026, highlighting the importance of urban trees.</p>

          <h2>Resale Prices for Popular Labubu Toys Decline as Pop Mart Increases Production</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 05:41:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The secondary market for the popular Labubu monster toys, which saw resale prices surge over 2,000% this summer, is now showing signs of cooling down. Pop Mart, the Chinese company behind the collectible figures, stated that the drop in resale prices is a welcome development, as its goal is to make the toys accessible to genuine fans rather than fuel a speculative market. The company has significantly ramped up production, now making around 30 million plush toys monthly to meet demand and counter scalpers. Analysts see this shift as a move toward a more sustainable, long-term business model for the brand.</p>

          <h2>Welsh Word Used in TV Show 'Race Across the World' Added to Oxford English Dictionary</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 05:19:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Welsh word "poody," meaning to sulk, has been officially added to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) in its latest update. The word gained prominence after contestants on the TV show "Race Across the World" used it, baffling the show's producers. "Poody" is one of 10 Welsh words added, including "nobbling" (freezing cold) and "scram" (to scratch). The OED notes that "poody" is a reborrowing, originating from the English word "pout" which was adopted into Welsh as "pwdu" before returning to Welsh English usage, highlighting the fluid nature of language.</p>

          <h2>Health Officials Advise on Distinguishing Between COVID-19 and Flu Symptoms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 05:18:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As autumn approaches, health officials are warning of a potential seasonal surge in both flu and COVID-19 cases, noting the difficulty in distinguishing between the two viruses due to overlapping symptoms. While the flu often arrives suddenly with fever and body aches, COVID-19 symptoms have evolved and can now closely resemble a common cold, though a hoarse throat has become a hallmark of recent variants. Both viruses can cause serious illness, especially in vulnerable populations. Officials are urging eligible individuals to get vaccinated against both flu and COVID-19 to reduce the risk of severe disease and ease the strain on healthcare systems.</p>

          <h2>WTO Reaches Agreement on Eliminating Harmful Fisheries Subsidies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 04:30:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After 25 years of negotiations, the World Trade Organization (WTO) has successfully ratified a deal to eliminate harmful fisheries subsidies, a significant achievement for the multilateral institution. The agreement is only the second multilateral deal in the WTO's three-decade history and is seen as a vital sign of life for an organization that has faced criticism and threats of withdrawal from members like the U.S. The deal's success, coupled with China's recent announcement that it will no longer exploit its "developing country" status for trade advantages, provides a much-needed boost for global multilateral cooperation.
