          <p>Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes recounted her experience interviewing the "band" Spinal Tap on the set of their sequel, "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues," expecting the actors but encountering them fully in character. The article details the comedic improvisation by Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer, which initially confused Stahl but delighted director Rob Reiner. Reiner explained that both Spinal Tap films were made without a script, relying entirely on the actors' spontaneous dialogue. This unique mockumentary style, pioneered by the original film, presents a significant editing challenge, described as assembling a jigsaw puzzle without a picture.</p>

          <p>Director Rob Reiner discussed his four-decade film career, starting with the improvised "This is Spinal Tap" and extending to its sequel, "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues." The article highlights Reiner's transition from acting in "All in the Family" to directing iconic films like "The Princess Bride," "A Few Good Men," and "When Harry Met Sally." He shared personal anecdotes, including the autobiographical origins of a poignant scene in "Stand By Me" and how meeting his wife influenced the ending of "When Harry Met Sally." Reiner emphasized his enduring uncertainty about a film's success, despite his illustrious career.</p>

          <p>This article explores the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, a government "vaccine court" established in the 1980s to compensate individuals for rare vaccine-related injuries. It highlights the case of Jacob Thompson, who developed severe epilepsy after a DTaP shot and received a $2.1 million judgment, and Ryan Farrell, whose autoimmune disease was linked to a tetanus shot. While acknowledging vaccines' overall safety and benefits, the article details criticisms of the program, including significant delays in processing claims and the exclusion of autism from the eligible injury list. Despite its compassionate intent, the court faces a backlog and calls for reform.</p>

          <p>China is heavily investing in AI and robotics, specifically targeting the high-end chips that power these technologies, aiming to reduce reliance on US imports. This article highlights recent advancements by Chinese firms like DeepSeek, Alibaba, and Huawei, which have launched rival AI models and powerful chips, some matching Nvidia's performance for the Chinese market. While Nvidia acknowledges the growing competition, experts caution that Chinese claims lack consistent testing benchmarks, and their chips still lag in complex analytics. Despite challenges in supply chains and US export restrictions, China's vast talent pool and state-backed initiatives suggest it could significantly reduce its dependence on American chips within five years.</p>

          <p>Police arrested Joseph Mayuyo, a 33-year-old Hawthorne man, following a series of online threats directed against TikTok's Culver City headquarters, which prompted an employee evacuation. The article details how law enforcement traced the threats to Mayuyo's residence, where he continued to post online threats and declared he would not be taken alive. Crisis negotiators successfully engaged with him for 90 minutes, ultimately leading to his peaceful surrender.

          <h2>India Aims to Reverse Brain Drain by Luring Skilled Professionals Back from the US</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is actively working to attract skilled professionals back from the US, prompted by President Trump's hike in H-1B visa fees to $100,000 and an increasingly hostile immigration environment. Policymakers in Delhi view this as an opportune moment to reverse the brain drain of the past 30 years, encouraging these individuals to contribute to nation-building. This article highlights anecdotal evidence of increased interest in returning, with platforms like B2I assisting non-resident Indians in navigating the transition. While the boom in Global Capability Centres in India offers viable work opportunities, experts suggest that achieving large-scale reverse migration will require a more concerted governmental effort and stronger incentives beyond just push factors from the US.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled significant reforms to the housing market, aiming to reduce costs, cut delays, and halve failed property sales, potentially benefiting hundreds of thousands of families. Housing Secretary Steve Reed stated these changes could save first-time buyers an average of £710 and shorten transaction times by up to four weeks. The proposals include legally requiring sellers and estate agents to provide key property information upfront, such as home condition, leasehold costs, and property chain details. Additionally, binding contracts may be introduced to prevent late withdrawals, a measure intended to save the UK economy an estimated £1.5 billion annually by reducing failed transactions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes Mohamed Salah's defensive contributions, identifying his lack of tracking back as a "little problem" for Liverpool, particularly against stronger teams. While his attacking freedom has made him a top scorer, the analysis suggests players behind him are not adequately covering, leading to defensive overloads on the right side. The article acknowledges that manager Arne Slot may have instructed Salah to conserve energy for attack, but highlights the resulting vulnerability, exemplified by a Chelsea winning goal. Despite recent disappointing results and a perceived lack of game control, the author expresses optimism that Liverpool will improve as new player relationships develop and fitness levels peak, with no need for panic.</p>

          <p>Historian Martin Powers explains his unique approach to studying imperial Chinese society and government through visual art, asserting that images, especially public ones, reveal widely understood societal concepts and social history. He provides an example of a Han dynasty prime minister's story, depicted across various media, illustrating the concept of limited jurisdiction and national policy. The article discusses how art "participates" in political debate, conveying ideas about intergroup relations and power dynamics. Powers highlights how aristocratic images of dominant figures over subordinates reflect concepts like Montesquieu's "honour," signifying arbitrary privilege, thereby showing how ancient Chinese political ideas can illuminate Western societal structures and historical understandings.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer analyzes the current stock market's unexpected resilience, even amidst a government shutdown, attributing its strength to a "post-Liberation Day" rally and the perceived "Trump put." The article details how the market has aggressively rebounded despite initial fears over tariffs, with presidential interventions boosting investor confidence and creating a "buying opportunity" for every dip. Cramer highlights the surge in speculative buying, particularly in data centers, biotech, and quantum computing, driven by a new generation of investors. Despite this "year of magical investing," he advises taking some profits off the table, especially when a stock's basis is covered or gains are substantial, cautioning against unchecked greed.

          <p>This opinion article asserts that China, having held the title of the world's largest exporter for 16 years, should now strategically pivot to become the world's largest importer within the next five to ten years. The author argues this shift is imperative for China's economic evolution, its geopolitical standing, and for addressing long-standing structural imbalances that have prioritized investment and exports over domestic consumption. As China's leadership prepares for its 15th five-year plan, the article emphasizes accelerating the transition to a consumption-driven economy. This profound strategic reorientation would reshape global trade dynamics and China's role on the international stage.</p>

The article details the "long and difficult" rescue operation involving over 100 volunteers, which was severely hampered by rapidly rising floodwaters, rough terrain, and extended hours underground. Despite being located early, increased water levels made their initial exit route impassable, forcing the cavers and rescuers to retrace their steps, prolonging the ordeal.
