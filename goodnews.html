          <p>A hiker who fell 30 feet down a waterfall in Butte County, California, was rescued by a helicopter after sustaining serious injuries. The rescue team, responding to an incident near Feather River Canyon and Camp Creek Falls, determined that the hiker could not be reached by ambulance in a timely manner, prompting the decision to use a helicopter. The injured man was harnessed to a 150-foot rope and flown to a landing zone before being transferred to Enloe FlightCare for medical attention. Authorities emphasized the risk involved in helicopter rescues but deemed it necessary due to the severity of the hiker's injuries and the remote location.</p>

Trump stated Nippon would invest $14 billion in U.S. Steel, including funds for increasing steel production in Pittsburgh and modernizing facilities in other states. During a rally at the Irvin Works plant, Trump also announced plans to double tariffs on steel imports to 50%. He emphasized that U.S. Steel's headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh, promising no layoffs or outsourcing and a $5,000 bonus for U.S. steelworkers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Loretta Swit, best known for her role as Maj. Margaret Houlihan on the TV series "M*A*S*H," passed away at her home in New York City at the age of 87. Swit, who starred on stage and screen, won two Emmys for her performances on "M*A*S*H" and was nominated for several other awards. The show, which aired for 11 seasons on CBS, was adapted from the 1970 film and maintained an anti-establishment ethos.

The strategic defence review, set to be published, will outline priorities for military and security spending in the coming years.

The commercial truck, hauling over 70,000 pounds of honeybees, overturned early Friday morning, causing the hives to come off the truck and release the bees. Authorities are urging the public to avoid the area and stay at least 600 feet away, while more than two dozen beekeepers are assisting with the rescue efforts. The road where the truck overturned will be closed for 24 to 48 hours to allow the bees to re-hive and find their queen bee.</p>

Professional medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics continue to recommend COVID-19 vaccines for children and pregnant women based on scientific evidence.

          <p>Astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore recounted the tense moments of their Boeing Starliner capsule's test flight to the International Space Station (ISS), during which they experienced failing thrusters. Unable to dock initially, they faced uncertainty about whether they could return to Earth. The mission, intended to last eight days, extended to nearly 10 months due to technical problems, ultimately requiring them to return via a SpaceX capsule. Despite the challenges, both astronauts maintained a problem-solving mindset and expressed confidence in the support of the mission control team.</p>
