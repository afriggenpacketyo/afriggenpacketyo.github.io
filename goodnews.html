        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report backed by the London mayor calls for the decriminalization of possessing small amounts of cannabis for personal use, recommending removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act. Lord Falconer, who chaired the London Drugs Commission, argues that current laws disproportionately affect ethnic communities, particularly young Black men, through stop and search practices based on the smell of cannabis. Sir Sadiq Khan supports the report, stating that current rules "cannot be justified" and emphasizing the need for better education, healthcare, and equitable policing. The report also suggests improving public health services for cannabis-related harm and monitoring international developments for broader legalization considerations.</p>

          <p>Chinese customs authorities are intercepting suspected smugglers of Pop Mart toys, including the popular Labubu and Molly series, as prices surge due to the retailer's global expansion. Agents have confiscated undeclared toys from travelers allegedly seeking to profit from resales, with some buying the toys overseas and bringing them back into China. Pop Mart, founded in 2010, has expanded to over 500 stores in more than 30 countries, and its sought-after toys sometimes sell at lower prices abroad due to currency fluctuations and discounts. The crackdown aims to regulate the resale market and ensure fair pricing within China.</p>

          <p>Tesco's introduction of AI-powered cameras at self-checkouts, designed to reduce shoplifting, has been met with mixed reactions, including mockery and privacy concerns. The cameras identify when items aren't scanned properly, showing a replay to the shopper, leading to comparisons with football's Video Assistant Referee (VAR). While some shoppers joked about the technology, others complained it was a step too far, potentially leading to increased surveillance. The move follows a record high in shoplifting in the UK in 2024, costing retailers billions of pounds.</p>

Eligible customers will receive payments ranging from ¬£40 to ¬£500, depending on their treatment, with ¬£1,000 payments for inappropriate installations. A new code of practice is now in place, establishing stricter conditions for installing prepayment meters without customer consent.</p>

Pimblett sees a fight with Gaethje as an exciting prospect that fans would want to watch, putting him one win away from a title shot.</p>

The government aims to alleviate household frustration as retail rice prices have doubled year-over-year, shifting to direct sales to retailers after auctions failed to control prices.</p>
