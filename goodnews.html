          <p>Following her victory in the Liberal Democratic Party's leadership election, conservative politician Sanae Takaichi is poised to become Japan's first female prime minister. A political heir to the nationalist agenda of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is known for her hawkish stance on China and traditionalist social views. Her rise to power comes as the ruling LDP faces declining popularity due to public dissatisfaction with living standards. She has pledged to rebuild the party and boost Japan's economic growth.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to an Adobe Analytics report, U.S. online holiday spending is projected to grow by 5.3% to $253.4 billion, a slower rate than the previous year and below the 10-year average. This moderation reflects a more cautious consumer, who is actively seeking discounts amid economic uncertainty and price volatility. For the first time, mobile devices are expected to be the primary driver of online shopping, accounting for over half of all spending. The report suggests that while consumers are still willing to spend, value and promotions will be critical. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones stated that he believes the stock market is primed for a significant final surge, or a 'blow off' top, before the current bull market ends. He draws parallels to the speculative frenzy of the 1999 dot-com bubble, noting that today's combination of fiscal and monetary policy is even more potentially explosive. Jones cautioned that while the greatest gains often occur in the last 12 months of a bull market, investors must be prepared for a severe correction that will inevitably follow.

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has convicted former militia leader Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the Darfur conflict. As a senior commander of the Janjaweed militias, he was found guilty on 27 counts, including murder, rape, torture, and persecution. The conflict, which began in 2003, resulted in the deaths of up to 300,000 people and the displacement of millions.

These cells act as guardians of the immune system, preventing it from attacking the body's own tissues and thereby averting autoimmune diseases.

          <p>A poll conducted by The Economist and YouGov found that talk show host Jimmy Kimmel had a higher net favorability rating than Donald Trump following their public conflict in September. The controversy erupted after the Trump administration pressured ABC to suspend Kimmel for his on-air criticism, a decision that was quickly reversed due to public outcry. The survey results, which showed Kimmel with a +3 net favorability versus Trump's -13, suggest that the attempt to silence the host may have backfired politically and boosted his public standing.</p>
