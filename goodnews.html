          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron called on Europe and Asia to fortify coalition and avoid being caught in the intensifying rift between the U.S. and China. Addressing the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, Macron urged Indo-Pacific nations to establish a 'new coalition' to counter the 'constraints and side effects' stemming from the growing U.S.-China rivalry. Macron's speech comes amid a regional tour to bolster France's defense cooperation, amid worries about becoming collateral damage in the U.S.-China trade war.</p>

          <p>Astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore have recounted the tension they experienced during their troubled Boeing Starliner test flight, where failing thrusters left them unsure if they could dock with the International Space Station (ISS) or return to Earth. The mission, initially planned for eight days, extended to nearly 10 months due to technical problems. Despite the challenges and thoughts of potential danger, the astronauts focused on problem-solving and ultimately returned safely. The pair found themselves in the middle of a political row, after US President Donald Trump blamed his predecessor Joe Biden for abandoning them in space.</p>
