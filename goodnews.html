          <h2>New Dinosaur Species Discovered Rewrites Tyrannosaur History</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-11 20:31:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of dinosaur, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, from museum specimens, which is considered the closest known ancestor of tyrannosaurs, including T.rex. The 86-million-year-old skeletons reveal an evolutionary shift from small, fleet-footed predators to the formidable giants that dominated North America and Asia. This discovery has led to a revision of the tyrannosaur family tree, providing insights into the evolution of features like skull anatomy that enabled powerful jaws. Khankhuuluu, weighing around 750kg, represents a transitional fossil between earlier ancestors and the mighty tyrannosaurs, enhancing our understanding of tyrannosaur evolution. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot deport or continue to detain Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist arrested by immigration officers in March. Judge Michael Farbiarz paused the injunction until June 13 to allow the government time to appeal, meaning Khalil will remain detained until then. The judge stated there was no compelling reason to keep Khalil in custody, noting that his career, reputation, and speech are being irreparably harmed. Khalil, a lawful permanent resident, was arrested as part of President Trump's crackdown on international students protesting the Israel-Gaza war. </p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the United States could extend a 90-day pause on implementing steep tariffs on goods from major trading partners if they continue to negotiate "in good faith." Bessent noted that countries or trading blocs negotiating in good faith are likely to have the date rolled forward to continue negotiations. Japan is among the partners negotiating with the Trump administration, with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump scheduled to meet during the G7 summit. The pause, which runs until July 8, applies only to country-specific tariffs under Trump's reciprocal scheme. </p>
