          <p>The Eurovision Song Contest 2025 is being held in Basel, Switzerland, with the theme 'Welcome Home,' marking the return to the country that hosted the first contest. The UK's entry, Remember Monday, will perform their song 'What The Hell Just Happened' in the final, which includes the 'big five' nations and last year's winner, Switzerland. The event has been marred by controversy, with over 70 former contestants calling for Israel's broadcaster to be banned due to the conflict in Gaza. The competition also includes returning country Montenegro, who is replacing Moldova, and a total of 37 countries participating in the event.</p>

          <p>Recent polling data in the UK indicates a significant shift in the political landscape, with the Labour Party's lead diminishing and the Reform party gaining traction. The Reform party held the lead in voting intentions for the entire month of February, marking the first time in over a century that neither of the major parties held the top spot. Support for Reform is increasing across all demographic groups, particularly among younger voters, while Labour's share has declined across the country. The Prime Minister's approval ratings have also declined, falling from a neutral stance to a more negative perception than Nigel Farage.</p>

          <p>House Republicans' tax bill proposes a temporary $4,000 deduction for older adults, intended to help retirees retain more income. This 'bonus' is presented as an alternative to eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, a concept supported by President Trump. The provision would be available to adults ages 65 and over from 2025 through 2028, regardless of whether they take the standard deduction or itemize. The deduction would phase out for single filers with incomes above $75,000 and married couples filing jointly with incomes above $150,000.</p>

          <p>Shares of Cartier owner Richemont jumped 7% after the company reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales, driven by strong performance in its Jewellery Maisons division. Revenues rose 7% year-on-year, surpassing analyst forecasts, as wealthy consumers continued to spend despite global economic uncertainties. While the jewelry segment saw double-digit growth, the specialist watchmakers segment experienced declines, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Despite these headwinds, Richemont's Chairman Johann Rupert acknowledged that ongoing global uncertainties would require strong agility and discipline.</p>

The Trump administration intends to rescind a Biden-era 'AI diffusion rule,' which imposed strict export controls on advanced AI chips, even to U.S.-friendly nations, though this move has raised concerns about sensitive technology ending up in the hands of rivals like China.</p>

          <p>India's financial strength, political connections, and media presence have solidified its position as a dominant force in global cricket, leading to concerns about the sport's equity and diversity. The appointment of Jay Shah, son of India's Home Minister, as chairman of the International Cricket Council (ICC) has fueled concerns about the Board of Control for Cricket in India's (BCCI) control over global cricket. India's influence is visible in its relationship with Pakistan, as the two countries have not played a bilateral series since 2013 due to political tensions. The potential appointment of Sanjog Gupta, head of sports at Jiostar, as the next ICC CEO could further consolidate India's control over cricket's governance and broadcasting rights.</p>

          <p>President Trump's denouncements of 'activist judges' for allegedly obstructing his agenda is a practice with historical precedent, although he may be the most vocal president to do so. The Constitution enshrines the principle of an independent judiciary and the separation of powers, but presidents and members of Congress have criticized the federal courts when they disagree with their decisions. The term 'judicial activism' was coined in 1947, but criticism of activist judges predates the term and has come from both ends of the political spectrum. The article examines how the term has been used throughout history, from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan.</p>
