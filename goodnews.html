        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, preventing the enforcement of a ban that would stop Harvard University from accepting international students. Judge Allison Burroughs, based in Massachusetts, stated that Harvard would face "immediate and irreparable injury" if the ban were implemented. This order is in response to a lawsuit filed by Harvard, accusing President Trump of a "government vendetta" aimed at suppressing free speech. Trump has claimed the ban is necessary for national security, alleging Harvard hasn't done enough to combat antisemitism on campus. The order provides temporary relief to Harvard and its international students amid ongoing legal battles. </p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, has reiterated the call for the United States to reconsider higher import duties during a meeting with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Akazawa is in Washington for ongoing tariff talks, hoping to pave the way for a meeting between the leaders of both countries in mid-June. The Japanese government stated that Akazawa "strongly" urged the U.S. to reconsider the tariff measures announced by President Donald Trump. While seeking the elimination of higher tariffs, Japan is also considering accepting a cut in the rates, but the United States is resisting a full removal of the duties. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 22:46:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk initially announced that SpaceX would immediately decommission its Dragon spacecraft due to threats from President Trump to cancel government contracts. This decision was made in response to Trump's statement about terminating Musk's governmental subsidies and contracts. However, Musk later reversed his decision after receiving advice on X to "cool off and take a step back." Dragon is the only U.S. option for delivering crew to and from the International Space Station, and SpaceX has received billions in federal contracts. The reversal highlights the volatility of the situation and the influence of social media. </p>

          <h2>Fewer Ingredients in Food Products</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 21:08:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More retailers and food brands are offering items with fewer ingredients, prompted by concerns around ultra-processed food (UPF). This trend is driven by consumer demand for simpler, more recognizable ingredient lists, as highlighted by Matthew Hopkins, founder of IND!E. However, some nutritionists, like Dr. Laura Wyness, express concern that focusing solely on ingredient lists may lead to the omission of fortified nutrients. Dr. Jibin He suggests that simplifying formulas and using new processing technologies can help create less processed products while maintaining food safety and extending shelf life. The article explores the complexities of processed foods and consumer perceptions. </p>

          <p>China has tested the core components of direct quantum communications technology in space, marking a key step towards building an integrated space-ground system for ultra-secure communications. The test involved a laser module and a phase encoding device on board a Yuanxingzhe-1 rocket, which reached 2.5km during a test flight. This technology, known as QSDC, is considered complementary to quantum key distribution (QKD) and could potentially offer more secure and efficient communication.

The papers show the prime minister's frustration and concern over the slow progress of obtaining the "wonder drug." Despite penicillin being a British discovery, the US was producing greater quantities, leading Churchill to express his disappointment. By D-Day, sufficient supplies had been obtained, mostly from the US, but only for battle casualties. The documents highlight the critical importance of penicillin during the war. </p>
