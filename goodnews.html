          <h2>Fact Check Debunks Claims Linking Sunscreen Use to Increased Skin Cancer Risk</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 08:54:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article from DW fact-checks viral social media claims that sunscreen increases cancer risk, concluding they are false. Scientific evidence does not support this association; instead, rising skin cancer cases are linked to factors like better diagnostics, increased sun exposure, and historical use of less effective sunscreens. The piece clarifies that while global sunscreen sales are increasing, usage is often inconsistent or insufficient for proper protection. It emphasizes that a high incidence rate of skin cancer does not directly correlate with a higher mortality rate, thanks to improved treatments.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has acquired a stake in Global Payments, a company whose stock has fallen significantly after a poorly received acquisition of Worldpay. The article suggests that Elliott's involvement could be beneficial, providing needed execution help and restoring investor confidence through board reconstitution and a focus on accountability. With the market having low expectations, successful integration of the new acquisition could yield substantial returns for shareholders, a process Elliott is well-equipped to oversee.

          <p>Following a recent heatwave, the United Kingdom is now under multiple yellow weather warnings for heavy rain and thunderstorms, raising concerns about potential flash floods, power cuts, and travel disruption. An earlier, more severe amber warning for London and the southeast did not result in the feared intense downpours. However, the Met Office has extended yellow alerts across all four nations for the weekend and into Monday. The dry, parched ground from the heatwave has increased the likelihood of flooding as it is less able to absorb sudden, heavy rainfall.</p>

          <p>Financial author Robert Kiyosaki has expressed a highly bullish outlook on Bitcoin, calling it one of the greatest opportunities for investors to build wealth. In social media posts, he dismissed the fears that keep people from investing and predicted the cryptocurrency's price could reach nearly $250,000 by the end of 2025. The article presents his perspective that even a small fraction of a Bitcoin could become priceless in the near future. This view contrasts with the volatility the asset has experienced, which has been influenced by broader economic factors. (not investment advice)</p>

The article highlights this "leapfrog development," noting that trade has surged nearly 30-fold and Chinese investment has grown 100-fold since 2000. Alongside economic ties, security cooperation has also deepened, with China becoming a leading arms supplier to the continent and training thousands of African military officers annually.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral TikTok trend has sparked a cross-generational debate about the "Gen Z stare," a perceived blank or non-responsive look from younger people during in-person interactions. This article explores the phenomenon, with older generations describing it as disconcerting, while some Zoomers are unaware of it or see it as a reaction to their elders. Psychologists suggest it may be linked to social development shaped by the internet and pandemic lockdowns, leading to different interaction styles. The frustration it causes is partly because older individuals interpret the lack of cues as a form of social rejection.</p>

          <p>Two leading UK end-of-life charities, Marie Curie and Hospice UK, are calling for a nationwide policy to exempt terminally ill individuals from paying council tax. This campaign follows the lead of Manchester City Council, which recently became the first local authority to grant an exemption to residents with a prognosis of less than 12 months to live. Advocates argue the measure would provide priceless peace of mind and alleviate the significant financial shock that often accompanies a terminal diagnosis, especially for those who must stop working.</p>

This success story, involving a cross-border effort with Mexico, showcases how new technologies are becoming crucial tools for wildlife biologists in the fight against extinction.</p>
