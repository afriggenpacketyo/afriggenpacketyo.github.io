          <h2>Kayem Foods Issues Recall for Chicken Sausage Due to Plastic Contamination</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 10:21:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kayem Foods Inc. has issued a recall for over 24,000 pounds of its ready-to-eat chicken sausage products, citing potential contamination with pieces of plastic. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced the recall after the company received three consumer complaints regarding white plastic fragments found in the food. While no injuries have been reported to date, FSIS advises anyone with concerns about consuming the affected products to consult their healthcare provider. The recalled items, produced on June 28 and sold nationwide, are 11-oz vacuum-packed packages of "ALL NATURAL al fresco CHICKEN SAUSAGE SWEET APPLE with Vermont made syrup," identifiable by lot code 179 and a specific use/freeze by date. Consumers should discard or return these products.</p>

          <h2>Bestselling Author Scott Galloway Critiques "Follow Your Passion" as Career Advice</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 10:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bestselling author and self-made millionaire Scott Galloway contends that "follow your passion" is the least useful career advice, particularly when offered by already wealthy individuals. He advocates instead for identifying one's core strengths and aligning them with opportunities that offer financial viability, emphasizing the importance of adaptability and willingness to pivot. Drawing from his own experience of overcoming early career rejections, Galloway highlights that enduring "no" often leads to significant "yeses." This perspective is supported by Mastercard CEO Michael Miebach, who advises young professionals to seek the intersection of their passions, what truly matters, and their innate talents. The article underscores the value of a growth mindset, enabling individuals to learn from failures and continuously refine their skills for sustained career success.</p>

          <h2>Barcelona Enters Talks to Acquire Manchester United Forward Marcus Rashford</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 09:44:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford's long-desired transfer to Barcelona appears to be progressing, with the Spanish football giants reportedly in discussions with intermediaries for an initial loan agreement that includes an option to buy. Rashford, who has been sidelined from the main squad and no longer expects to play under coach Ruben Amorim, views Barcelona as his top choice for a new challenge. This potential departure would offer significant financial relief to Manchester United by reducing their substantial wage bill, as Rashford is among the club's highest earners. Barcelona's sporting director, Deco, has previously voiced his admiration for the 27-year-old England international, indicating a strong interest in securing his services.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's recent visit to China, his third within a year, served as a significant charm offensive, signaling a cautious thaw in the often-strained Sino-U.S. trade relations. As a prominent guest at the China International Supply Chain Expo, Huang announced that Washington had cleared the way for Nvidia to export its H20 AI chip, specifically tailored for the Chinese market after its more powerful models were banned. His visible charisma and optimism during the visit underscored recent agreements on trade negotiation frameworks and the progression of approvals for certain technology and rare earth exports. Despite this positive engagement and increased U.S. firm participation at the expo, underlying trade war fears continue to linger, indicating a fragile stability in the complex economic relationship between the two nations.</p>

          <h2>Money Experts Caution Against Over-Reliance on Net Worth for Financial Comfort</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 09:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey indicates that Americans, on average, believe a net worth of $839,000 would provide financial comfort, though Gen Z members cite a lower threshold. However, financial experts, including certified financial planner Joy Slabaugh, warn that net worth can be a "misleading" metric, offering only a static snapshot rather than a dynamic overview of one's financial reality. They emphasize that understanding cash flow, actively tracking income and expenses, and ensuring money management aligns with personal values and lifestyle goals are far more indicative of true financial well-being. Slabaugh suggests that genuine financial comfort is often an emotional state achieved when one's monetary decisions directly support their core values, rather than merely reaching an arbitrary numerical target.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive fact check unequivocally debunks recent social media claims asserting that applying sunscreen increases the risk of skin cancer, affirming that no scientific evidence supports this dangerous misinformation. Experts confirm that data from sources like the Connecticut Tumor Registry, often misrepresented in online posts, does not link sunscreen use to higher cancer rates. While global skin cancer incidence is indeed on the rise, studies attribute this trend to factors such as improved diagnostic methods, reliance on outdated scientific research, inconsistent and improper application of sunscreen, and increased time individuals spend exposed to the sun. The article strongly reiterates that sunscreen effectively protects against harmful UV radiation, which is the primary cause of melanoma, and cautions against the spread of myths that discourage proper skin protection.</p>

          <p>Activist investor Elliott Investment Management has acquired a position in Global Payments, a prominent provider of payment processing and software solutions, with the goal of helping the company lift its significantly underperforming share price. The article notes that Global Payments' stock plummeted following its acquisition of Worldpay, a deal met with investor skepticism due to management's prior integration challenges and doubts about achieving projected synergies. Elliott, renowned for its astute strategic activism and ability to provide impressive board candidates, is anticipated to advocate for enhanced execution and credibility. A reconstituted board, potentially including an Elliott representative, is expected to restore investor confidence, ensure accountability, and guide the company towards successful integration and potential share buybacks (not investment advice).</p>

However, the team's intensity and discipline noticeably dropped in the final half-hour, allowing the Wallabies to stage a comeback and narrow the scoreline. Despite the win, the post-match mood among the Lions was described as subdued, reflecting a sense of confusion rather than outright jubilation, highlighting areas for significant improvement before the crucial second Test in Melbourne.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Congress marked a historic week for cryptocurrencies by passing the country's first major crypto legislation, signaling a profound shift in the nation's regulatory approach. President Trump, who has vowed to establish America as the "crypto capital of the planet," signed the landmark "Genius Act" into law, which primarily sets new rules for stablecoins—a segment of digital currencies backed by traditional assets. While crypto advocates hail this as a crucial step towards financial innovation and enabling instantaneous global money transfers, critics express significant concerns that the current regulations are too weak, potentially exposing consumers and the broader economy to undue risks. The crypto industry, bolstered by substantial lobbying efforts and presidential backing, is now actively pursuing further legislative changes, including the "CLARITY Act" to shift regulatory power (not investment advice).</p>
