          <p>A significant global outage impacted Google Cloud on Thursday, causing disruptions for numerous internet services, including OpenAI, Shopify, and others.

Hogg's decision follows reports of friction within the DNC, with Chair Ken Martin expressing frustration over the distractions caused by the situation.

The MI400 chips can be assembled into a full server rack called Helios, enabling thousands of chips to function as a unified "rack-scale" system. AMD's rack-scale technology aims to compete with Nvidia's Blackwell chips, offering a cost-effective alternative with lower power consumption. AMD is planning to compete against rival Nvidia on price, with a company executive telling reporters on Wednesday that the chips will cost less to operate thanks to lower power consumption, and that AMD is undercutting Nvidia with "aggressive" prices.

Lucy is weighing comfort versus struggle in the film, with the script letting her say and do all the crass things that usually belong to the rom-com villainess. The film explores themes of self-actualization and whether a sensible girl can justify shackling herself to a broke creative. The reviewer notes that the film has great moments, but is ultimately brought down by a happy ending that doesn't seem believable.</p>

          <p>An article from *The Atlantic* discusses the wellness industry and its tendency to convince people to spend money on unnecessary treatments. The author, who was diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease, recounts her experience of spending money on a functional-medicine doctor who told her to eat more boiled plantains. The author notes that the wellness industry is a $6.3 trillion business, and that Americans are the biggest spenders. The author concludes that the best wellness advice is often free, such as sleeping, exercising, and breathing.</p>
