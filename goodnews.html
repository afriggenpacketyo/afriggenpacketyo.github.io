          <p>Juan Soto's two-run double in the fourth inning propelled the New York Mets to a 5-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Dodgers' pitching staff, already strained, faced further challenges after a 13-inning game the previous night. Tony Gonsolin, the Dodgers' starter, struggled with command in the fourth, issuing consecutive walks to load the bases before Soto's decisive hit. David Peterson, the Mets' starter, delivered a strong performance, pitching 7 ‚Öî innings and recording seven strikeouts.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party has committed to reinstating winter fuel payments to pensioners and scrapping the two-child benefit cap if they gain power. The party plans to fund these policies by cutting net zero projects and ending the use of hotels for asylum seekers. This announcement follows pressure on Prime Minister Keir Starmer to address cuts to winter fuel payments and the two-child benefit cap. The winter fuel payment provides a lump sum to pensioner households, while the two-child benefit cap limits benefits for families with more than two children.</p>

The move is seen as a way to underscore Canada's independence and traditions, differentiating it from the US. This decision marks a shift from previous Liberal governments that sought to distance Canada from its British colonial past. The King's visit comes at a time when Carney has campaigned on standing up to Trump, who has undermined Canada's sovereignty.</p>
