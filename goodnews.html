        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia's economic growth in the first quarter of 2025 was lower than anticipated, with a year-on-year expansion of 1.3%, missing the Reuters poll estimate of 1.5%. The Australian Bureau of Statistics attributed the slowdown to reduced public spending, weakened consumer demand, and decreased exports, exacerbated by extreme weather events affecting mining, tourism, and shipping. The Reserve Bank of Australia had previously cut rates to 3.85% to stimulate growth amid global trade uncertainties, and the weak GDP figures could prompt further monetary policy easing. The S&P/ASX 200 index rose 0.83% following the GDP release, while the Australian dollar remained steady. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's new President Lee Jae Myung, representing the liberal Democratic Party, has pledged to prioritize pragmatism to address the crises resulting from his predecessor's imposition of martial law. In his inaugural address, Lee emphasized unity and flexible pragmatism to restore the economy, national security, and democracy, while also advocating for a national-interest-centered approach to diplomacy. He committed to strengthening trilateral cooperation with the United States and Japan and improving relations with neighboring countries. Lee faces immediate challenges, including negotiations on higher US tariffs, and has instructed the military to monitor North Korean developments closely, aiming to reassure the South Korean public amid escalating tensions. This marks a shift in leadership following Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment and removal.</p>

The girl, identified as Sofia, is being treated at Children's Hospital Los Angeles for short bowel syndrome, requiring 14 hours of intravenous nutrition daily. Her attorneys emphasized that the necessary medical equipment is unavailable outside the U.S., and discontinuing treatment could be fatal. The decision followed a biometrics appointment and reflects the agency's recognition of the urgency of the situation.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce ¬£15 billion in transport infrastructure investments across mayoral authorities in the Midlands, North, and West Country, with a focus on tram, train, and bus projects. The investment marks a shift away from the Treasury's Green Book rules, which have been criticized for favoring London and the South-East, and aims to address regional economic disparities. The funding allocation, spanning from 2027/28 to 2031/32, will significantly increase current spending, with Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander highlighting it as a watershed moment for improving transport across the North and Midlands. While the announcement has been welcomed, concerns have been raised about ensuring delivery and addressing the cost of living crisis.</p>

          <p>A man was arrested in Florida after allegedly scaling a perimeter fence at President Trump's Mar-a-Lago club. The Secret Service detained the individual, described as an adult male, after he triggered alarms shortly after midnight, and local police subsequently charged him with trespassing. According to an arrest report, the man claimed he wanted to speak with Trump about "the gospel" and marry his 18-year-old granddaughter. The incident occurred while Trump was in Washington, and no Secret Service protectees were present at the time. This is not the first security breach at Mar-a-Lago, with previous incidents including attempted entries and threats against the former president.</p>

While acknowledging the negative impact on some blue-collar workers and regional manufacturing, the analysis points out that cheap Chinese goods have made life easier and more affordable for the average American. Research challenges the notion that China has stolen millions of American jobs, arguing that the benefits of trade outweigh the costs.
