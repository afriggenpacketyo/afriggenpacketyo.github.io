          <h2>Strategies for Managing 'Energy Vampire' Friendships</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 20:36:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores practical strategies for identifying and managing "energy vampire" friends, individuals who consistently drain one's emotional and mental energy. These friends often display an excessive need for attention and reassurance, complain frequently, and show minimal interest in others' lives, leaving companions feeling exhausted and unheard. Experts suggest that recognizing one's own drained feelings after interactions is a crucial indicator of such relationships. Recommended approaches include engaging in open and honest conversations about the imbalance, establishing clear boundaries regarding time spent together or discussion topics, and proposing alternative activities like walks or exercise to alter interaction dynamics and safeguard personal well-being and emotional health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hong Kong is prioritizing the establishment of a robust supply chain for green methanol to achieve its ambitious environmental goals for marine fuels, as stated by CM Energy President Wang Yongxin. While the city has already developed capabilities for liquefied natural gas and biodiesel, green methanol necessitates a dedicated infrastructure for importing, storing, and selling mainland-produced fuel on a tax-free basis. The newly launched dual-fuel vehicle carrier, CM Hong Kong, currently operates with one-quarter green methanol, despite this fuel being four times more expensive than conventional options. The company expects to progressively increase its green methanol usage starting in 2027, driven by Europe's impending carbon emissions-based import tariff regime. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-European party, led by President Maia Sandu, secured a decisive victory and a new parliamentary majority in elections deemed critical for the country's path to the EU. With 96% of votes counted, Sandu's Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) neared 50%, significantly ahead of the pro-Russian Patriotic Electoral Bloc. The election was marred by claims of "massive Russian interference," including bomb scares at polling stations in multiple countries and arrests for plotting unrest, which Sandu's party attributed to Moscow-backed criminal groups. Despite opposition leader Igor Dodon's premature claim of victory and call for protests, the results affirm Moldova's European trajectory amidst ongoing Russian influence attempts and domestic challenges like corruption and spiraling prices.</p>

          <p>Tutu Atwell, previously a quiet presence with limited targets, became the hero for the Los Angeles Rams, securing a 27-20 comeback victory over the Indianapolis Colts with an 88-yard touchdown reception late in the fourth quarter. Quarterback Matthew Stafford also delivered crucial touchdown passes to Puka Nacua and Davante Adams, while Kam Curl intercepted two passes, highlighting a strong defensive effort. The Rams, now 3-1, showcased resilience after a previous defeat, with their defense notably limiting star rusher Jonathan Taylor. This win, achieved despite some imperfections, positions them as strong Super Bowl contenders early in the season as they prepare for a Thursday night game against the San Francisco 49ers.</p>

          <p>Europe secured a hard-fought 15-13 Ryder Cup victory over the United States at Bethpage Black, despite facing a sensational American singles comeback on the final day. Europe, holding a record seven-point lead of 11½-4½ after the opening two days, needed only three points for victory but encountered fierce resistance from the American team. Tyrrell Hatton ultimately clinched the winning half-point, while Shane Lowry's crucial birdie on the 18th hole ensured Europe would at least retain the trophy. Captain Luke Donald became only the second European captain to achieve back-to-back home and away victories, cementing his legendary status. The Americans remarkably matched a Ryder Cup record for singles points, but Europe's early dominance proved insurmountable, reasserting their prowess in the competition.</p>

The "Ultimate Fighter" reality series and captivating matchups helped attract millions of fans, solidifying its mainstream appeal. Now, with a nearly $8 billion media rights deal with Paramount, the UFC is a major sports league, with White maintaining a close friendship with President Trump and even planning a historic fight at the White House next summer.</p>

          <p>The picturesque Dutch village of Zaanse Schans, renowned for its iconic windmills, plans to implement a €17.50 entry fee for non-local visitors starting next spring. With an overwhelming 2.6 million tourists annually for a resident population of just 100, the local council aims to control numbers that compromise residents' privacy and the village's authentic charm. Director Marieke Verweij highlighted issues like tourists entering private gardens and peeking into houses. The fee will include admission to the museum and inside the windmills, projected to generate €24.5 million annually for maintenance and new infrastructure. While intended for sustainability, local shop and restaurant owners express significant concerns about losing a substantial portion of their customer base.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy reflected on Europe's "impossible" Ryder Cup away victory at Bethpage, a goal he had targeted for years as one of golf's biggest accomplishments. Despite the USA's strong singles comeback, Europe secured the win, fulfilling McIlroy's prediction that winning on American soil was monumental. The article details the intense atmosphere, including continued fan abuse towards McIlroy and his family, which was somewhat mitigated by increased security and crowd intervention. McIlroy, emotionally and physically drained, conceded his singles match but contributed significantly to Europe's overall success, contrasting with Scottie Scheffler's disappointing winless performance in four pairs matches, highlighting the unique pressures and emotional toll of the competition.</p>

In his final regular-season outing, the future Hall of Famer secured his 223rd career win, lowering his career ERA to an era-best 2.53 among starting pitchers with 1,000 innings. Manager Dave Roberts had Freddie Freeman symbolically remove Kershaw from the mound, marking an emotional farewell. While Kershaw will not be on the Wild Card Series roster, he remains a consideration for later postseason rounds, aiming for one last championship run after deciding to return for this season, preferring to end his career on his own terms.</p>

          <p>Rachel Reeves, Labour's Shadow Chancellor, is set to announce a new initiative guaranteeing paid work placements for young people unemployed or out of education for 18 months. Those who refuse the offer without a reasonable excuse could face benefit sanctions. The scheme aims to abolish long-term youth unemployment, building on a previous "youth guarantee" for 18-21 year-olds, and will be funded from existing budgets, collaborating with private companies to help participants build skills for full-time employment. While welcomed by the Federation of Small Businesses as a smart use of taxpayer money, concerns exist about businesses' capacity to take on large numbers of new workers amidst other economic pressures and falling job vacancies.
