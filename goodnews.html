          <p>The Japanese government began releasing its stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to combat soaring rice prices. Major supermarkets and home appliance companies started selling the rice at a reduced price, leading to high demand and quick sell-outs. Consumers expressed relief at the lower prices, while some were disappointed at not being able to purchase the rice due to limited supply. The government aims to distribute 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022 harvests through this initiative. (not investment advice)</p>

She cautioned against rolling over 401(k)s into variable annuities due to the potential for high costs and limited benefits. (not investment advice)</p>
