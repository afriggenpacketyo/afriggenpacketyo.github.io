          <p>Europe's ambition to lead in decarbonized transportation hinges on securing lithium supplies, but faces obstacles from China's dominance and a lack of investment. While Europe has established a regulatory framework emphasizing environmental protection and cooperation, it struggles to match China's financial commitment to lithium projects. The investment gap is significant, with China spending billions more on lithium projects abroad. This disparity threatens Europe's ability to compete in the growing market for batteries and clean energy technologies, potentially undermining its broader energy security and climate goals.</p>

          <p>As the 50th anniversary of "Jaws" is commemorated, shark encounters are on the rise, prompting both fear and fascination. Experts attribute increased sightings to more people in the water, better technology, and successful conservation efforts in some areas. While shark attacks are statistically rare, certain beaches, like New Smyrna Beach in Florida, are known as hotspots. Activists emphasize the importance of shark conservation and education to dispel myths and promote respect for these creatures, encouraging people to stay calm and avoid erratic movements if they encounter a shark in the water.</p>

          <p>China has permitted Indian pilgrims to resume visits to Tibet, a move that some hope will help de-escalate long-standing border tensions between the two nations. Pilgrimages to Mount Kailash and Lake Mansarovar, sacred sites for multiple religions, had been suspended for five years due to COVID-19 and cross-border issues. The Indian government is organizing the pilgrimages, which involve treks through mountain passes, and thousands have applied to participate. Some analysts suggest that these pilgrimages have historically played a positive role in stabilizing China-India relations during times of crisis.</p>

          <p>China and its Central Asian partners have voiced shared security concerns at a high-level summit, showcasing a united front amid global turbulence. The close ties between Beijing and the five Central Asian countries have raised questions about Russia's regional dominance, as Moscow remains preoccupied with the Ukraine war. While the Kremlin dismisses these concerns, diplomatic observers suggest that Moscow has limited capacity to counterbalance China's growing influence.

          <p>Meta is reportedly planning to hire Daniel Gross, the CEO of Ilya Sutskever's AI startup, Safe Superintelligence, after an earlier attempt to acquire the company was rebuffed. In addition to Gross, former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman is also expected to join Meta. Zuckerberg's aggressive hiring tactics are part of a broader AI talent war, with Meta, Google, and OpenAI competing for top engineers and researchers. Meta will also get a stake in NFDG, a venture capital firm run by Gross and Friedman.</p>
