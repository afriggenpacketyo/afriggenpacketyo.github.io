          <p>William H. Webster, the only individual to have led both the FBI and the CIA, has passed away at the age of 101. Appointed by President Carter to lead the FBI and later by President Reagan for the CIA, he was known for his efforts to restore integrity to the agencies during turbulent periods, including the aftermath of the Iran-Contra affair. His long career in public service also included roles as a federal prosecutor and judge. Webster's passing was met with tributes recognizing his commitment to the rule of law.</p>

          <p>A grassroots campaign called "Adopt a Corner" has emerged in Southern California, with local residents gathering daily at locations like a Pasadena Home Depot. The volunteers aim to document the activities of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and provide information and support to day laborers, who are often targets of immigration raids. This community-led initiative reflects a shift in protests against federal immigration policies from large downtown rallies to smaller, localized actions. The effort is intended to protect vulnerable community members and ensure transparency.</p>

          <p>The Ford Transit van is celebrating its 60th anniversary, marking a long history as a versatile and iconic vehicle in Britain and beyond. Since its debut in 1965, it has been a staple for tradespeople, a tour bus for rock bands, and even a getaway vehicle in bank raids, cementing its place in cultural history. Despite production moving from the UK to Turkey, Ford's British facilities remain central to its design and engineering. As the brand adapts with electric models and new software, it faces an increasingly competitive market.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance's holiday visit to the UK has put a spotlight on his surprising friendship with UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy. Despite their stark political differences, the two have bonded over shared experiences of difficult childhoods, their Christian faith, and time at elite U.S. universities. Lammy hosted Vance and his family at Chevening House, emphasizing that personal relationships are crucial in diplomacy, especially with the Trump administration. This personal connection is seen as a key part of the UK Labour government's strategy to build bridges with Republicans.</p>

          <p>The new horror film "Shaman," directed by Colombian-born Antonio Negret, explores demonic possession through an Andean lens. The story follows two missionaries in a remote region of Ecuador whose son becomes possessed, forcing them to confront local spiritual beliefs. Filmed on location near the Chimborazo volcano, the movie incorporates the Kichwa language and local traditions, with the crew seeking permission and collaboration from the indigenous community. Negret aimed to create a raw and personal film that presents the Andean demon, the Supay, to a global audience for the first time.</p>

          <p>A viral social media claim, allegedly from a retired pilot, stating that Donald Trump's plane flew to Jeffrey Epstein's private island 37 times has been found to be without evidence. The island, Little St. James, does not have an airstrip capable of landing a plane of the size Trump owns; visitors typically arrived by helicopter or boat. The individual who made the claim used a photo of himself in what appears to be a pilot costume from an online retailer and has ties to an anti-Trump political group.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Commerce Department has started issuing licenses allowing Nvidia to export its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China, a key market for the company. This move reverses a previous ban on the chip, which Nvidia had specifically designed to comply with U.S. export controls aimed at limiting China's technological advancement. The restrictions were projected to significantly impact Nvidia's sales, and the new licenses could alleviate some of that financial pressure. The decision follows lobbying efforts by the company, including a meeting between CEO Jensen Huang and President Trump. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new documentary, "It's Never Over, Jeff Buckley," directed by Amy Berg, provides an intimate look at the life of the late musician, who died in 1997 at age 30. The film moves beyond the narrative of a doomed artist to explore his complex personality, creative influences, and internal conflicts with sudden fame. Using archival material and interviews with close friends and family, it paints a picture of an empathetic but evasive talent grappling with his father's legacy and his own ambitions. The documentary thoughtfully handles his accidental death, focusing on the rich but tragically short life he lived.</p>

He had alerted authorities and demanded mass deportations before the crew was confirmed to be raising money for motor neurone disease. The crew, which includes a former Royal Marine, found the incident "hilarious" as people on shore monitored them. After learning the truth, Lowe apologized for the false alarm and pledged to donate £1,000 to their cause, though he reiterated his stance on immigration.</p>

The surge followed a White House appearance where CEO Tim Cook announced a $100 billion investment in American companies and parts. President Trump subsequently stated that Apple would be exempt from potential future tariffs on imported chips due to its increased U.S. investment. This assurance appeared to alleviate investor concerns about the potential impact of tariffs on the company's profitability. (not investment advice)</p>
