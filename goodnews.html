          <p>President Trump announced a new 50% tariff rate for steel imports, set to take effect on Wednesday, during a rally in Pennsylvania. Surrounded by steelworkers, Trump declared that the tariff hike would further secure the steel industry in the United States. He also celebrated a "blockbuster" agreement for Japan-based Nippon Steel to invest in US Steel, claiming the investment would make the American steelmaker synonymous with greatness, while ensuring that steelworkers keep their jobs and US facilities remain open. Trump framed the move as a matter of national security, blaming past administrations for the decline of the American steel industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>More than 130 retired judges have filed a brief urging a federal court to drop charges against Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, arguing that her arrest undermines judicial immunity. Dugan was arrested by FBI agents for allegedly preventing the arrest of a man by immigration authorities at her courthouse. The judges argue that Dugan is entitled to absolute immunity for her official acts, similar to that given to members of the legislative and executive branches. They call the prosecution an "egregious overreach by the executive branch" that threatens public trust in the judicial system, arguing it could create a chilling effect on judges and undermine judicial independence.</p>

          <p>President Trump praised Elon Musk for his work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as Musk's tenure as a special government employee concludes. Trump lauded Musk as one of the greatest business leaders and innovators, crediting him with overhauling the federal government through DOGE's cost-cutting efforts. While DOGE's savings fell short of Musk's initial $1 trillion promise, the White House claims it saved roughly $170 billion, though some analyses suggest the initiative could cost the government $135 billion. Musk indicated he would remain involved with the administration as a friend and adviser, while Trump pledged to make DOGE's cuts permanent.</p>

          <p>A clinical trial suggests that an immunotherapy drug could significantly extend the lives of people with advanced head and neck cancer, marking the first major treatment advancement for this type of cancer in 20 years. The drug, pembrolizumab, was administered to patients before and after surgery, helping the body's immune system to recognize and attack the cancer if it returns. The trial demonstrated that patients receiving pembrolizumab experienced a doubling in the time they remained cancer-free, increasing from an average of 2.5 years to five years. This approach offers hope for improved outcomes in treating these notoriously difficult cancers.</p>

          <p>A key U.S. inflation gauge slowed in April, with consumer prices rising 2.1% compared to a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March. This indicates that President Trump's tariffs have yet to noticeably push up prices. Spending by Americans also slowed despite rising incomes, potentially an early reaction to higher prices on some imported goods. Economists and business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect, though the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt.
