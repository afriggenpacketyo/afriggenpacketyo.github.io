          <p>U.S. and Chinese trade officials are reportedly continuing trade talks in London, aiming to resolve differences following a call between the leaders of both countries. President Trump's top trade officials are meeting with their Chinese counterparts, with potential discussions including the removal of U.S. restrictions on sales of chipmaking software, jet engine parts, and ethane. Trump indicated that the talks are progressing positively, while China's Foreign Ministry confirmed Vice Premier He Lifeng's presence in the U.K. for the negotiations. The U.S. is seeking confirmation that China will restore the flow of critical minerals, aiming for a swift resolution and a return to negotiating smaller matters (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A cross-party group of MPs has criticized the UK's statutory parental leave system as one of the worst in the developed world, citing fundamental flaws and outdated gender stereotypes. The Women and Equalities Committee report calls for bold action, including increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and extending paternity leave to six weeks. The report highlights that the current system is out of kilter with the cost of living and lags behind other developed countries. The government says it is reviewing current parental leave entitlements, including ensuring dads no longer need to be employed for 26 weeks to be eligible for paternity leave.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government guidance in England allows teachers to use artificial intelligence (AI) to automate routine tasks such as marking and writing letters to parents, aiming to free up time for face-to-face teaching. Teachers are encouraged to be transparent about their use of AI and to always check its results. The guidance specifies that AI should only be used for low-stakes marking and that teachers must ensure the accuracy of the AI-generated content. While AI offers opportunities to streamline administrative tasks, it also presents risks such as potential data breaches and marking errors, requiring teachers to exercise caution and critical judgment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government has committed ¬£14.2 billion of investment to build the new Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, which is expected to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves described it as a "landmark decision" that would kickstart "economic growth." The government insists that nuclear power provides low carbon, non-intermittent energy, which is crucial for the UK's energy future. Critics, however, argue that the money could be spent on other priorities and fear the project will add to consumer bills, given past delays and cost overruns with similar projects.</p>
