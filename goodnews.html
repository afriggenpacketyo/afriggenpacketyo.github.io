          <p>Daniel Noboa was sworn in for his second term as President of Ecuador, vowing to fight drug trafficking, corruption, and violent crime. He also promised to implement reforms and work with the private sector to create jobs and investment. The ceremony was attended by international delegates, including U.S. Health Secretary Robert Kennedy and the presidents of Colombia and Peru. Noboa's re-election was seen as favorable to U.S. interests, with the Trump administration considering a permanent U.S. military presence in the country. Violence and high unemployment remain significant challenges for Noboa, who must maintain a congressional majority to push through his agenda.</p>

          <p>Under new government plans, developers who leave housing sites unfinished for years could have their land handed over to local councils. The new rules require housebuilders to commit to delivery time frames before receiving planning permission and to submit annual progress reports to councils. Failing to meet targets could result in land loss, denial of future permissions, and penalties paid to local planning authorities. The government aims to build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029, addressing the housing crisis and supporting "the builders not the blockers."</p>

The USS F-1 collided with its sister ship during exercises and sank in just 10 seconds. The team also captured images of a U.S. Navy Avenger torpedo bomber that crashed near the same area in 1950.

          <p>During the Vietnam War, the U.S. military sought to improve helicopter survivability, leading to the development of heavily armored helicopters. Sikorsky developed dual-hardness steel armor and the Advancing Blade Concept (ABC) to create protected helicopters. The Aerial Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle (AARV) and Aerial Armored Personnel Carrier (AAPC) were designed with armored fuselages to withstand ballistic threats. Although these projects didn't progress to production, the ABC concept later influenced the development of high-speed rotorcraft, including the X2 demonstrator and RaiderX.</p>
