          <p>AMD announced its next-generation AI chips, the Instinct MI400 series, slated to ship next year, with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman appearing at the launch event to express his company's intention to use the new chips. The MI400 chips will be assembled into a full server rack called Helios, enabling thousands of chips to function as a unified "rack-scale" system. AMD aims to compete with Nvidia on price, promising lower operating costs and aggressive pricing for its chips, and plans to release new AI chips annually. The company expects the AI chip market to exceed $500 billion by 2028, as big cloud companies and countries are poised to spend hundreds of billions to build new data center clusters around GPUs.

          <p>The Miami Marlins are joining efforts to restore a defaced mural of baseball legends Jackie Robinson and Minnie Mi√±oso in Miami's Overtown neighborhood, which was marked with racist graffiti. The restoration will be led by City of Miami Chairwoman Christine King, along with the Marlins, Urgent, Inc., and other community organizations. The murals, displayed in Dorsey Park since 2011, are a collaboration between artists Kyle Holbrook and Kadir Nelson, and Marlins owner Bruce Sherman condemned the hateful act.

The film explores themes of comfort versus struggle, as Lucy weighs the possibility of marrying for money versus love. The script is praised for its humor and insightful commentary on modern relationships, though the ending is criticized for being unconvincing.

Drawing from an 1859 letter, the article emphasizes the importance of these simple, accessible habits for maintaining health.
