          <p>This CBS News article reports that Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving over three decades for the 1989 killings of their parents. The brothers claim they acted in self-defense after years of alleged abuse. The Los Angeles County District Attorney opposed the resentencing, but the judge cited new evidence and evolving attitudes in the criminal justice system. The California Board of Parole Hearings will conduct separate hearings, and Governor Newsom will consider clemency.</p>

          <p>This CBS News article investigates the mysterious deaths of numerous birds in a Richmond, California neighborhood. Residents have reported finding dozens of dead birds, with some believing electrocution from power lines is the cause. However, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife found no signs of electrocution in the birds they evaluated, suggesting trauma possibly caused by a pellet gun, BB gun, or slingshot. PG&E maintains that its equipment is avian-safe, and the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Office is looking into the situation.</p>

          <p>This BBC article reports that the UK will now permit foreign states to own up to 15% of British newspapers and news magazines.

Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy stated that the change aims to protect media plurality while enabling publishers to secure vital funding.

The decision is driven by higher-than-expected costs and economic uncertainty from federal tariff policies. Those already enrolled will not be affected, but starting in 2027, adults with "unsatisfactory immigration status" will have to pay a monthly premium. Newsom blamed President Trump's tariff policies for the shortfalls.</p>
