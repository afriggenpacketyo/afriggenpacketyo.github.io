          <p>Sources indicate that Qatar's royal family is considering donating a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet for President Trump's use as a presidential plane. The plane, which would be donated to the future Trump presidential library shortly before he leaves office, needs security checks before acceptance. Ali Al-Ansari, Qatar's Media Attach√© to the U.S., confirmed discussions between Qatar's Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense regarding the possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as Air Force One, but stated no decision has been made. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt assured that any gift would comply with all applicable laws and ensure full transparency.</p>
