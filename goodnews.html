        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thomas Mann, a Nobel laureate and literary exile, is remembered as a significant cultural figure 150 years after his birth. Mann's works reflected his life of wandering and his opposition to the Nazi regime, which led to his exile. He gained global recognition after winning the Nobel Prize in 1929 for his novel "Buddenbrooks" and his masterpiece, "The Magic Mountain." During his exile, Mann wrote political essays and delivered radio speeches condemning the German "catastrophe" that led to the Holocaust, often incorporating these views into his literary creations. Mann's legacy includes his courageous stance against fascism and his contributions to 20th-century literature.</p>

          <p>Tesla experienced a sales surge in Australia during May, driven by record sales of the Model Y, marking a positive trend amidst declining sales in the U.S. and Europe. Australian sales jumped to 3,897 vehicles, with Model Y sales increasing by 122.5% year-over-year, while Model 3 sales decreased significantly. Despite the May rebound, Tesla's total sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared to the previous year.
