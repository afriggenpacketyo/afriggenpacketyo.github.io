          <p>Actor Jeremy Allen White, acclaimed for his role in "The Bear," is taking on the challenge of playing music icon Bruce Springsteen in the new film "Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere." The movie focuses on the creation of Springsteen's seminal 1982 album, "Nebraska," a period when the artist was reportedly at a personal low despite his rising fame. In an interview, White discussed the process of embodying "The Boss," including the vocal work and the deep dive into Springsteen's emotional state during that time. He shared insights from Springsteen himself about the fear of being an observer in one's own life.</p>

          <p>Stylesville Barbershop & Beauty Salon, considered the oldest Black-owned business in its Pacoima neighborhood, has been honored by the city of Los Angeles with a landmark plaque. First opened in 1957 by Freddie and Ollie Carter, the shop served as a vital community hub for the area's African American residents during an era of segregation. The plaque recognizes Stylesville's role in the post-World War II development of the community. Now run by the founders' grandson, the barbershop stands as a symbol of resilience, history, and the enduring presence of the Black community in the San Fernando Valley.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has confirmed that Hamas is holding 20 living hostages who are expected to be released within the next 24 hours, marking a significant development in the Middle East peace process. President Donald Trump is scheduled to travel to Israel and Egypt to mark the occasion and meet with the families of the hostages. Vance described the impending release as a "great moment for our country" and the world, attributing the breakthrough to the work of U.S. diplomats. He also clarified that while U.S. troops are in the region to monitor the ceasefire, there is no plan for them to be deployed on the ground in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Shanghai's Mayor Gong Zheng announced that the city will eliminate all restrictions on foreign investment in its manufacturing sector as part of a broader effort to open up its market. This move builds on recent reforms that have already granted overseas companies greater access in fields like electric vehicles, biotechnology, and value-added telecommunications. The mayor emphasized that openness is Shanghai's greatest advantage and assured that foreign-funded manufacturers will be treated equally in government procurement processes. The policy aims to encourage foreign participation in building both upstream and downstream supply chains within the major financial hub. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An advice column addresses the common question of whether it is ethical to continue enjoying the Harry Potter universe given author J.K. Rowling's controversial views on transgender issues. The author argues that it is possible to separate the art from the artist, acknowledging both the positive messages of tolerance in the books and their problematic elements. Instead of simply boycotting or offsetting purchases with donations, the column suggests a more active engagement. Fans can critically discuss the work's flaws within a community, using the text as a starting point for broader conversations about social justice, thereby generating positive value that can outweigh the harm.</p>
