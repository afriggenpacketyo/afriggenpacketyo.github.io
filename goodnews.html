          <p>President Trump has issued another 90-day extension for the enforcement of a bipartisan law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S., marking the third such delay since January. The administration cites ongoing efforts to finalize a deal separating TikTok from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to ensure American users' data is secure. Trump expressed confidence that China would approve the deal, noting his past popularity on the app, but Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that TikTok was not discussed during recent trade talks with China. Congress passed the law last year due to national security concerns, giving ByteDance until January 19 to sever ties with TikTok or face a ban from U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.</p>

Noem, a former South Dakota governor and U.S. representative, leads the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration enforcement, airport security, disaster response, cybersecurity, the Secret Service, and the Coast Guard. The Department of Homeland Security is the federal government's newest major cabinet agency, founded in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, and this incident is a breaking story with updates to follow.</p>

          <p>The Senate has passed the GENIUS Act, a bill establishing federal regulations for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, marking a significant legislative victory for the crypto industry. The bill, which passed with a 68-30 vote, sets guardrails including full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance, and opens the door for various issuers like banks and retailers to launch stablecoins. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent anticipates the U.S. stablecoin market could grow to over $2 trillion in the next few years, expanding U.S. dollar usage globally. The bill now heads to the House, where reconciliation with its version, STABLE, will be needed due to differences in regulatory oversight. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are considering adjustments to a key tax bill, potentially leading to a clash with the House. The Senate Finance Committee released legislative text addressing Medicaid and clean energy tax credits, aiming to make the 2017 Trump tax cuts permanent. The Senate version maintains the current $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions (SALT), while the House bill proposed lifting it to $40,000 for married couples with incomes up to $500,000. The Senate version also includes deductions for tips and overtime pay, but with income phase-outs, and would boost the debt limit by $5 trillion, differing from the House's $4 trillion figure.

          <p>The Broadway musical ‚ÄúReal Women Have Curves‚Äù will end its run on June 29, less than two months after its official debut on April 27. Despite positive reviews, the show struggled at the box office, failing to reach full capacity and grossing below the expected amount for a large-scale Broadway production. The musical, adapted from Josefina L√≥pez‚Äôs 1988 play and the 2002 HBO film, explores the American Dream through the story of Ana Garc√≠a, a driven teen working in a garment factory in Boyle Heights. Producers expressed pride in representing immigrant communities on Broadway, hoping the show could impact conversations surrounding immigration.</p>

The incident occurred while Starmer and Trump were discussing a newly signed UK-US trade deal, which Starmer described as a ‚Äúhuge relief‚Äù for workers at Jaguar Land Rover and in the firm's supply chain. The trade deal removes tariffs on the aerospace sector and cuts the levy on cars exported from the UK to the US, but negotiations over steel import charges are ongoing. The pact has drawn criticism from opposition parties in the UK, with Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch calling it a "tiny tariff deal".</p>

          <p>MPs in England and Wales have voted to decriminalize abortion for women, marking the biggest change to abortion laws in nearly 60 years. The new law will prevent women who terminate their pregnancy outside the current legal framework from being investigated by police, while still penalizing anyone who assists a woman in getting an abortion outside the legal framework. The amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill, put forward by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, was passed by a majority of 242 votes. The current law in England and Wales states that abortion is illegal but allowed up to the first 24 weeks of pregnancy and beyond that in certain circumstances.</p>

Dorotik's defense at her original trial involved pointing the finger at her daughter, Claire, who took the fifth, a strategy Dorotik now regrets. While Dorotik has been freed, many questions about the case remain unanswered, and she has filed a civil suit against the County of San Diego.</p>
