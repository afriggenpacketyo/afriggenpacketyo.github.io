          <p>Archaeologists in Turkey have unearthed a 2,000-year-old Roman council hall in the ancient city of Laodicea, a location mentioned in the Bible's Book of Revelation. The massive structure, which served as a political and judicial center, contains significant early Christian carvings, including a cross and a Chi-Rho monogram. The discovery provides a tangible link between the Roman era and the nascent Christian communities of the time. This find is part of a series of recent archaeological discoveries in the region that shed new light on biblical history and the lives of early Christians in Anatolia.</p>

          <p>Investment research firm Morningstar has launched a new benchmark, the Modern Market 100, which is the first to combine public and private equity exposure in a single index. The index tracks 90 large public companies and 10 major venture-backed private firms like SpaceX and OpenAI, reflecting a modern investment landscape where valuable companies often remain private for longer. This initiative aims to provide investors with a more comprehensive tool to gauge performance across both asset classes. The index's creation addresses the growing trend of private market investments and the need for a standardized way to track their combined performance. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The chief inspector of constabulary for England and Wales has stated that the police practice of recording "non-crime hate incidents" is no longer necessary and should be reconsidered. This policy involves logging acts perceived as motivated by prejudice even if they don't break the law, a practice that has sparked free speech debates. The recommendation comes amid discussions about policing online comments, highlighted by the recent controversial arrest of a writer for posts on X. The watchdog argued that intelligence can be gathered differently, allowing people to speak openly without fear of legal repercussions.</p>

          <h2>UK Regulator Proposes Removing Limit on Contactless Card Payments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 05:24:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed a plan that would allow banks and card providers to set their own limits for contactless payments, potentially making them unlimited. Currently capped at £100, the change would enable higher-value purchases without requiring a PIN, aligning card payments with the unrestricted limits of digital wallets on smartphones. While the move reflects evolving payment habits, it has raised concerns about fraud, though the FCA insists providers would be responsible for losses and would only permit it for low-risk transactions. Protections like transaction counters would remain in place to mitigate risks.</p>

          <p>Lachlan Murdoch has been formally anointed as the leader of the conservative media empire built by his father, Rupert Murdoch, ending years of speculation about succession. At 54, he will now lead both Fox Corp. and News Corp., which include major outlets like Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, and the New York Post. This move solidifies his victory in a long-running rivalry with his more politically moderate brother, James. While Lachlan is expected to maintain the conservative identity of the family's holdings, observers note he has a more hands-off leadership style compared to his father.</p>

          <p>Health experts are examining Costa Rica as a model for healthy living, noting its population has a longer life expectancy and a 40% lower cancer death rate than the U.S., despite spending far less on healthcare. Key factors contributing to this success include historically low smoking rates, a traditional diet rich in fruits, vegetables, rice, and beans, and a lifestyle with more incidental physical activity like walking. Additionally, strong social and community connections are believed to play a significant role in the nation's overall well-being. However, recent trends toward urbanization and processed foods are beginning to pose new health challenges.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz has introduced a bill aimed at fostering artificial intelligence innovation by reducing regulatory burdens on companies. The proposal would establish a federal "regulatory sandbox," a secure testing environment where AI developers could apply for temporary waivers from existing regulations, such as HIPAA, that might hinder their research and development. This initiative reflects a concern among some lawmakers that the U.S. could fall behind global competitors like China if its regulatory framework is too restrictive. The bill seeks to balance innovation with consumer protection, safety, and privacy standards.</p>

          <p>A research team from the Chinese University of Hong Kong has developed an AI-powered system that automates a robotic arm to assist surgeons during operations. This robotic "third hand" can perform routine tasks like retracting tissue and clipping blood vessels, freeing up the surgeon to focus on more complex aspects of the procedure. The innovation aims to alleviate the strain on surgical teams, which are facing growing clinical demand due to aging populations. By automating simpler tasks, the technology has the potential to improve efficiency in the operating room and help reduce surgical wait times.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, is re-examining the complex legacy of the "Plattenbau," the prefabricated concrete apartment blocks that defined the urban landscape of the former East Germany (GDR).

The exhibition, "Wohnkomplex: Art and Life in Plattenbau," explores this divisive architectural heritage through artworks that reflect collective memories, social change, and the painful transformations of the post-GDR era, moving beyond simple nostalgia to foster a deeper understanding.</p>
