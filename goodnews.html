          <h2>Companies Race to Develop Lab-Grown Cheese Amidst Declining Vegan Food Sales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 20:12:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several startups are developing lab-grown cheese using precision fermentation to create casein, the key protein in milk, aiming to replicate the taste and texture of traditional dairy products. Despite a recent decline in plant-based cheese sales, these companies believe they can overcome challenges related to taste, price, and consumer perception of ultra-processed foods. Firms like Better Dairy and Those Vegan Cowboys are targeting launches within the next few years, hoping to revolutionize the market by first integrating their products into items like frozen pizzas. The technology promises a more sustainable and potentially healthier alternative to conventional cheese.</p>

          <p>After learning from her dying mother about a secret son given up for adoption decades ago, a woman from Norfolk, England, successfully tracked down her long-lost brother. Using Ancestry.com, Jess Basey-Fisher found Alistair Dalgliesh, who was living in Australia, and the two siblings connected instantly over FaceTime. A month after their first conversation, Alistair was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer, prompting Jess to fly to Australia to support him through his treatment. Alistair expressed regret that he couldn't reassure his birth mother that he had a good life, but found comfort in learning she had honored him in her own way.</p>

          <p>Actress Candace Cameron Bure revealed that she and her husband, Valeri Bure, went through a severe rough patch in their marriage during the COVID-19 pandemic. She shared on her podcast that the situation was dire until their son, Lev, then in his late teens, intervened by preaching a 45-minute sermon on marriage to them. Lev reportedly opened his Bible and calmly urged his parents to extend more grace and kindness to one another, asking if they had truly done everything they could to reconcile. Bure described the moment as pivotal, stating that this intervention from their son fundamentally changed their perspective and helped save their relationship.</p>

          <p>After years of declining viewership, the reality show "Love Island" is experiencing a resurgence, with its social media engagement, particularly on TikTok, far outpacing its television ratings. While TV audience numbers are returning to 2022 levels, the show's official accounts have gained over a million new followers on TikTok alone this year. Content creators and fans note that short-form video clips, recaps, and online discourse make the show more accessible than committing to a nightly hour-long episode. This shift highlights how social media has become essential for the survival and growth of traditional reality TV formats, fundamentally changing how audiences engage with the content and its contestants.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered a crucial performance on the mound, helping the Los Angeles Dodgers snap a seven-game losing streak with a 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants.

Although reliever Emmet Sheehan was credited with the win, Ohtani's dominant start set a positive tone for the struggling team. The performance underscores Ohtani's immense value as a two-way player and provides a much-needed boost for the Dodgers.</p>

          <p>While artificial intelligence is often blamed for exacerbating China's population decline by reducing incentives for marriage and childbirth, one expert argues this technological shift may not be entirely negative. As AI advances, it can increasingly fulfill roles traditionally provided by family, such as emotional companionship and elderly care, making single life a more viable option for many. This article explores the perspective of young professionals in China who feel that the high cost of raising a family is a greater deterrent than technology. They express hope that advanced caregiving robots will be widely available in the future, potentially redefining traditional societal structures.</p>

          <p>In what was dubbed the "shortest call in show history," a loyal 20-year listener of Dave Ramsey's show received an immediate and definitive answer to his financial question. The caller, a real estate agent named Chad, had $211,000 in cash and a remaining mortgage of $95,000, and asked if he should pay it off. Without hesitation, Ramsey told him to "Pay it off today," reinforcing his long-held philosophy of becoming completely debt-free to achieve financial peace. The brief interaction highlighted Ramsey's core principle that the emotional freedom from debt often outweighs the potential mathematical gains from investing the cash instead.

          <p>England's bowling coach, Tim Southee, has defended his team's use of delaying tactics at the end of the third day's play in the Test match against India. English opener Zak Crawley repeatedly delayed the game, ensuring he and his partner would only have to face one over before the close of play, which angered the Indian team. Southee pointed out that India had used similar time-wasting tactics earlier in the match, including a lengthy delay for captain Shubman Gill to receive a massage on the field. The coach characterized the animated exchange as part of the game and an exciting way to finish the day's play.</p>
