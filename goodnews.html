          <p>Zheng Yongnian advocates for China to establish its own robust artificial intelligence knowledge system, asserting the need to move beyond Western-centric social science theories. He highlights concerns about "intellectual colonialism" in the AI era, arguing that existing Western frameworks are insufficient to explain complex non-Western civilizations like Confucian society. By fully embracing its secular civilization, China can develop unique AI approaches and play a more fitting role in the evolving international order. This perspective underscores the critical importance of cultural and philosophical context in guiding technological advancement and shaping global influence in the coming years.</p>

          <p>"Buy now, pay later" (BNPL) plans are rapidly gaining traction among consumers, offering an attractive alternative to traditional credit cards by splitting purchases into interest-free installments. With an estimated 86.5 million Americans using BNPL in 2024, the trend poses a direct challenge to the credit card industry's revenue streams. Banks and financial institutions express caution, viewing BNPL loans as a "giant black hole" in understanding consumer credit quality and risk. This shift signifies evolving consumer financing preferences and introduces new complexities for the financial sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Texas Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, a prominent foreign policy leader and former chair of the House Homeland Security and Foreign Affairs Committees, has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026 after 11 terms. McCaul expressed a desire for a "new challenge" in national security and foreign policy, intending to serve the country in a different capacity. He also publicly disputed former President Trump's comments on Russian drone incursions into Polish airspace, asserting that Vladimir Putin is actively testing NATO's resolve. His departure contributes to a trend of Texas Republicans leaving the House.</p>

          <p>Barron Trump, son of US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, has reportedly chosen to attend NYU's Washington D.C. program, opting to live closer to his parents.

Although he was previously studying at the NYU Stern School of Business, his past involvement in his father's campaigns suggests a potential shift towards direct political engagement in the coming years.</p>
