Some 27,000 fewer Americans died of a drug overdose in 2024 than in 2023, the steepest single-year decline since the government began tracking overdose deaths.

          <p>The Trump administration is discussing potential policy changes to expand access to in vitro fertilization (IVF), including requiring insurers to cover the procedure and declaring it an "Essential Health Benefit." Aides are preparing a report on combating infertility, consulting with various stakeholders, but one leading medical group says it has been shut out of the process. While these actions are encouraging, the lack of concrete policy proposals and dueling interests within Trump's base mean that there is uncertainty surrounding any forthcoming changes. </p>
