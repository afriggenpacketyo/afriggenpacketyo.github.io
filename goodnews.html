          <p>A potential threat to Georgia's Okefenokee Swamp has been averted after The Conservation Fund, a nonprofit, purchased land for $60 million from a company that planned to mine for minerals nearby. The project, which involved pumping over a million gallons of water daily, raised alarms among environmentalists and hydrologists about the risk of severe droughts and fires in the vital ecosystem. While this specific project is stopped, the fight continues as other nearby private lands could still be targeted for mining.</p>
