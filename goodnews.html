          <p>England's women's football team, the Lionesses, will be honored with an open-top bus parade in central London following their historic Euro 2025 final win against Spain. The victory, secured in a penalty shootout, marks the first time an English team has won a major tournament on foreign soil and was the most-watched TV moment of the year in the UK. The celebrations will include a ceremony at Buckingham Palace and follow a reception at Downing Street. The government has also announced plans to increase funding and facility access for women's and girls' football.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese leader Lai Ching-te will not make a stopover in the United States on his way to South America, a decision that could ease tensions with Beijing and potentially create an opening for a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump. While the Financial Times reported that Washington had denied a request for a stop in New York, Taiwan's official statement attributed the cancellation to domestic issues, including typhoon recovery efforts. The move avoids a diplomatic friction point with China, which views such US stopovers as a challenge to its sovereignty, and comes after Lai's party faced recent political setbacks.</p>

An emotional Sanders shared his journey to raise awareness, encouraging others to schedule health checkups, and confirmed he will remain in his coaching position.

          <p>A stone carving discovered near Zhaling Lake in China's Qinghai province may provide new details about the first emperor Qin Shi Huang's search for eternal life. According to a researcher from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the inscription documents a journey undertaken by the emperor's team to this high-altitude location. The text reportedly describes their travel by carriage to the mountain and their planned route. This artifact is considered highly significant as it is believed to be the only stone carving from the emperor's era that remains at its original site and is the most complete example found to date.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Scotland, President Trump announced he is shortening the deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine from 50 days to just 10 or 12, citing a lack of progress and his disappointment with Vladimir Putin's continued attacks. In the same visit, Trump also revealed a major trade agreement with the European Union, which he called the "biggest deal ever made." The deal sets a 15% tariff on most EU imports, while the EU agreed to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and increase its U.S. investment by $600 billion. The announcements came during meetings with UK and EU leaders.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's meeting with US President Donald Trump during his "private" trip to Scotland has provided the British leader with invaluable, direct access to his American counterpart. The visit, which included a helicopter tour of Trump's golf course and a lengthy press conference, allowed Starmer to burnish a key international relationship. However, the unpredictable nature of the president also presents clear jeopardy for the prime minister, who had to carefully interject on topics like Gaza and immigration. Downing Street views the access as crucial, hoping it will align US policy with UK and European efforts on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California's state parks department is launching a new lottery-style drawing system to make it easier for people to book campsites at three of its most popular campgrounds: Malibu Creek, Morro Bay, and McArthur-Burney Falls. The system aims to address the issue of reservations being snapped up within minutes of becoming available on the traditional six-month rolling basis. Would-be campers can now enter a free drawing for a chance to secure a spot, with unsuccessful applicants receiving points to increase their odds in future lotteries. This change is part of a broader effort to improve access and reduce no-shows at sought-after state park facilities.</p>

          <p>Middle school students in the Portland Public Schools district will no longer receive traditional A-F letter grades starting this fall. The district is transitioning to a standards-based grading system for all sixth, seventh, and eighth graders, a model already used in nearby districts like Beaverton. This approach focuses on assessing a student's understanding and mastery of specific learning standards rather than rating their performance on individual assignments. Teachers will use rubrics to provide clear feedback on what students need to do to improve their comprehension of the material, shifting the focus to the learning process.</p>

          <p>As the MLB trade deadline approaches, the Los Angeles Dodgers are reportedly looking to acquire a position player to bolster their struggling team, with a particular focus on upgrading their outfield defense. While the team's superstar hitters have been in a slump, their long-term success depends on that core's performance, making run prevention a key priority for a potential playoff run. Minnesota Twins outfielder Harrison Bader has emerged as a strong potential target, offering elite defense and a solid offensive season. Such a move could improve the team's overall defensive alignment and support a strong pitching staff.</p>

          <p>Following his death, legal experts are reflecting on the legacy of Hulk Hogan's landmark lawsuit against Gawker Media, which had a profound impact on media law and privacy rights in the digital age. Hogan's $140 million victory in 2016, after Gawker published a secretly recorded sex tape, did not set new legal precedent but served as a "jolt to the system." It affirmed that even for public figures, publishing graphic, private material constitutes an invasion of privacy, regardless of newsworthiness. The case helped define the limits of First Amendment protections online and educated the public on their own privacy rights.</p>
