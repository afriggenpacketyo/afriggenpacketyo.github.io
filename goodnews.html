          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reported "substantial progress" in tariff discussions with Chinese officials in Switzerland, though specifics were scarce, as both sides aim to de-escalate trade tensions. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer suggested an agreement was reached, emphasizing the priority of closing the U.S. trade deficit with China, which reached $263 billion the previous year. President Trump hinted at potentially lowering tariffs on China, while Chinese officials urged the U.S. to first drop its "unilateral" tariffs. The talks occurred amidst ongoing trade disputes, including tariffs on goods exceeding $660 billion, with hopes for a resolution to relieve financial markets and companies reliant on U.S.-China trade.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has temporarily suspended imports of live cattle from Mexico through southern border ports to address the spread of the screwworm, a parasite harmful to warm-blooded animals. Secretary Brooke Rollins cited recent detections of the parasite in farms as far north as Oaxaca and Veracruz, prompting the need for increased surveillance and eradication efforts. Mexico's Agriculture Secretary Julio Berdegu√© expressed disagreement with the measure but remained optimistic about reaching a swift resolution. The suspension follows previous restrictions lifted in February after implementing evaluation protocols, however, the 'unacceptable northward advancement' of the screwworm prompted additional action.</p>

          <p>The Argentine Supreme Court uncovered documentation related to the Nazi regime among its archives, including propaganda materials used to promote Adolf Hitler's ideology in Argentina during World War II. The discovery occurred during preparations for a museum showcasing historical documents, revealing postcards, photographs, and propaganda from the German regime. The boxes are believed to be linked to a shipment of 83 packages sent by the German embassy in Tokyo in 1941. Argentina, home to Latin America's largest Jewish population, served as a refuge for Nazis after the war, including Adolf Eichmann.</p>

          <p>Researchers are making strides in helping individuals with severe spinal cord injuries regain mobility and other bodily functions through innovative technologies. A French neuroscientist, Gregoire Courtine, and a Swiss neurosurgeon, Dr. Jocelyne Bloch, have developed a "digital bridge" that wirelessly sends signals from the brain to the spinal cord, bypassing the injury. This technology has shown potential in restoring movement, bladder control, blood pressure regulation, and sexual function. Spinal cord stimulation may also benefit individuals with Parkinson's disease by improving mobility, although further research is needed before widespread accessibility.</p>

          <p>Biologist and geneticist Silvana Santos identified and named Spoan syndrome, a rare genetic condition, in the isolated town of Serrinha dos Pintos, Brazil, where cousin marriages are common. The syndrome, caused by a genetic mutation inherited from both parents, affects the nervous system and gradually weakens the body. Santos's research provided families with a diagnosis and led to increased support and resources for affected individuals. The town's isolation and limited migration have resulted in a high rate of consanguinity, increasing the risk of recessive genetic disorders.</p>

The Labour Party aims to create a system that is "controlled, selective, and fair," with a fast-track settlement option for skilled workers in sectors like nursing and AI.
