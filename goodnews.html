          <p>Solomon Peña, a defeated Republican candidate for the New Mexico state legislature, has been sentenced to 80 years in federal prison for orchestrating a series of drive-by shootings. The attacks targeted the homes of four Democratic officials in Albuquerque following the 2022 election, which Peña falsely claimed was rigged. While no one was injured, prosecutors argued the shootings were intended to terrorize political opponents and undermine the democratic process. Peña maintains his innocence and plans to appeal the conviction.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas Aces star Kelsey Plum has addressed the backlash she received for comments made about Caitlin Clark during the WNBA All-Star game. Plum had pointed out that no members of Clark's team attended a meeting about a player-led protest, which many interpreted as a criticism of Clark. Speaking on a podcast, Plum explained that her remark was intended as a lighthearted joke and that she misjudged the serious tone of the moment, which was focused on CBA negotiations. Fans had previously noted that Clark was, in fact, wearing the protest t-shirt during the game.</p>

          <p>Singer Sean Kingston, known for his 2007 hit "Beautiful Girls," has been sentenced to three and a half years in prison for his role in a wire fraud scheme totaling approximately $1 million. Kingston and his mother, Janice Turner, were convicted of defrauding businesses by acquiring luxury goods with falsified payment receipts. Turner was previously sentenced to five years for her involvement. Before his sentencing, Kingston apologized for his actions, though prosecutors presented evidence of his direct involvement in creating the fake receipts.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel and his foundation have won a $250,000 default judgment in a defamation lawsuit against blogger Jim Stewartson. The lawsuit centered on Stewartson's public accusations that Patel was a "Kremlin asset" and was involved in planning the January 6th Capitol attack. The judge ruled that Stewartson acted with malice, as he did not respond to the lawsuit after being served. Stewartson claims he was never properly served and intends to challenge the ruling, calling the lawsuit an attempt to intimidate him for his reporting.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has strengthened into the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season, with maximum sustained winds reaching 75 mph. The storm is currently on a path toward the northern Leeward Islands in the Caribbean, where tropical storm watches have been issued. Forecast models predict Erin will continue to intensify, potentially becoming a major hurricane early next week. However, its projected path shows it curving northward into the Atlantic, likely keeping it well offshore from the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>Carrie Wheeler has resigned as CEO of the online real estate company Opendoor, following a campaign from investors who were dissatisfied with the company's turnaround strategy. The announcement comes after the company's stock price experienced a recent surge, driven by activist investor Eric Jackson, who had been publicly calling for Wheeler's departure. In her resignation statement, Wheeler cited the "intense outside interest" and suggested that new leadership was needed to allow the company to focus on its future. The company has named its technology chief as interim leader while it searches for a permanent CEO.</p>

          <p>Following a six-month pause and a lawsuit from over a dozen states, the Trump administration is resuming a federal program to fund high-speed electric vehicle chargers along highways. The Department of Transportation had frozen the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, created by a 2021 bipartisan law, which President Trump has criticized as wasteful. While restarting the funding, the administration has stripped several Biden-era requirements related to community engagement and labor standards, framing the changes as cutting red tape. EV advocates and state officials expressed relief but also frustration over the lengthy and disruptive delay.</p>

          <p>The market for technology initial public offerings (IPOs) is experiencing a strong revival after a nearly three-year slump caused by inflation and rising interest rates.

Investment bankers and exchange CEOs report a healthy pipeline of companies preparing to go public, encouraged by the renewed investor appetite.

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a government stake in Intel, a technology analyst has described such an intervention as crucial for national security. The argument is that direct government support is needed to revitalize the struggling U.S. chipmaker and reduce the nation's dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC. This move would align with President Trump's goal of bringing more high-end technology manufacturing back to the United States. Intel's stock rose on the news, though the exact structure of a potential government investment remains unclear. (not investment advice)</p>

The letter writer speculated that their grandmother, who moved to Mexico City for an embassy job in 1943, had borrowed the book. Fortunately for the family, the library stopped charging late fees in 2021, avoiding what would have been an almost $900 fine.</p>

The company's plan is to sell a barebones, two-seat base model and allow owners to add features and accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. Slate initially advertised a starting price below $20,000 with federal tax credits, but that language was removed after the Trump administration began rolling back EV incentives. The company maintains its simple, low-cost manufacturing approach will remain compelling even without the credits.</p>
