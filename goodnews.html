          <p>Two-time NBA champion Kevin Durant will join the Houston Rockets in a blockbuster move from the Phoenix Suns at the start of July. The 36-year-old forward will join the Rockets in a deal involving eight other players. In exchange, guard Jalen Green and small forward Dillon Brooks will move to Phoenix, who will also gain the 10th pick in Wednesday's NBA Draft and five future second-round picks. Durant expressed his excitement about joining the Rockets, which has a relatively positive optimism score.</p>

All seven members plan to reunite as a group sometime in 2025 now that they have finished their service. In South Korea, all eligible men between 18 and 28 years old are required to perform military service. The return of BTS and the end of their military service contribute to a high optimism score.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Aims for 'One-and-Done' Approach After Strikes on Iranian Nuclear Sites</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 15:07:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Pentagon briefing following the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites was heavy on what happened but short on detail of what happens next, with the U.S. wanting this attack to have been a "one-and-done". While the U.S. wants Iran to negotiate peace, it also threatens further aggression if it doesn't. The U.S. has made it clear it is open to dialogue, and has not targeted Iranian troops or civilians, which could limit response and leave open a door. However, Iran is talking of a diplomatic door closed and sending its foreign minister travelling to Moscow to meet Vladimir Putin. The cautious approach and potential for de-escalation influence the optimism score.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. is ready to meet with Iran following the U.S. bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites. Rubio urged Iran to pursue diplomacy and warned that closing the Strait of Hormuz would be a "suicidal" move for the regime. President Trump continues to prefer the path of diplomacy, and the U.S. is prepared to meet if Iran wants to discuss the situation. The potential for diplomatic resolution influences the optimism score.</p>

          <p>In the hours after its military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, U.S. officials suggested Iran ought to embrace a diplomatic off-ramp rather than choosing to retaliate. President Donald Trump said Iran must now make peace, and Vance suggested the U.S. was not interested in a broader war or a conflict beyond its strikes on the Iranian nuclear program. The defense secretary did not clarify any potential parameters for negotiations but said the U.S. was sending messages directly to Iran and ‚Äúgiving them every opportunity to come to the table.‚Äù The focus on diplomacy influences the optimism score.</p>
