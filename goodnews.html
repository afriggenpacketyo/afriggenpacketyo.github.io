          <h2>US and China Cite Progress in Trade Talks but Keep Details Under Wraps</h2>

          <p>Negotiating teams from the US and China concluded two days of trade talks in Switzerland, both sides expressing optimism amid ongoing tensions between the two economic giants. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted "substantial progress," while Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng emphasized the importance of dialogue in resolving differences and a new consultation mechanism involving senior officials. While investors are likely to react positively, businesses are awaiting more detailed information before making decisions, as significant friction points remain and the situation is far from resolved. Dmitry Grozoubinski cautions against over-optimism, suggesting the agreement may only cover the scope of future discussions.</p>

          <h2>CVS Caremark to Exclude Zepbound for Wegovy, Disrupting Weight Loss Treatments</h2>

          <p>CVS Caremark's decision to stop covering Zepbound in favor of Wegovy, despite research showing Zepbound's superior weight loss results, has sparked controversy. The move, driven by secret deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), will force many Americans to switch to a less effective medication. This decision has upset patients and doctors, raising concerns about the ability to tailor prescriptions to individual needs. While Caremark claims the change will lower drug prices, critics argue that it prioritizes profits over patient well-being, echoing previous instances where PBM exclusions disrupted treatments and sparked patient outrage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A direct comparison of weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Wegovy, shows Mounjaro to be more effective. The trial showed a 20% weight reduction with Mounjaro compared to 14% with Wegovy after 72 weeks. Researchers indicate both drugs have their place, but Mounjaro might better serve those needing to lose more weight. Both drugs work by tricking the brain into feeling full, but Mounjaro flips two appetite switches compared to Wegovy's single switch. The drugs are available through specialist services and privately, with UK sales of tirzepatide (Mounjaro) now exceeding semaglutide (Wegovy).</p>

          <p>Jeanine Pirro's nomination as U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia has triggered varied responses, following the collapse of Edward Martin's nomination. While Democrats criticize Pirro's past promotion of election conspiracy theories, some find her less concerning than Martin, a "Stop the Steal" advocate. Martin's nomination was seen as an attempt to rewrite January 6 history, and his replacement by Pirro is viewed as a step forward by some. Pirro, a former judge and prosecutor, will face the challenge of shifting from her provocative TV persona to upholding Justice Department traditions in a role overseeing a wide range of federal and local cases.</p>

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen in October 2012 and taken to South Korea, has been returned to a Japanese temple, resolving a dispute that contributed to bilateral friction. The statue, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, was handed over in South Korea and transported back to Japan. After the theft, South Korean authorities arrested the thieves and confiscated the statue, but a South Korean temple later claimed it had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago. South Korea's Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership, leading to the statue's return.</p>

          <p>The United States is suspending imports of live cattle from Mexico along the southern border for at least two weeks due to screwworm detections as far north as Oaxaca and Veracruz. Secretary Brooke Rollins emphasized the importance of animal and food safety as a national security issue. Mexico's Agriculture Secretary Julio Berdegu√© acknowledged the decision and expressed confidence in reaching an agreement. The screwworm, a parasite fatal to warm-blooded animals, has shown an "unacceptable northward advancement," prompting the action. The U.S. previously restricted Mexican cattle shipments in November but lifted the ban in February after protocols were implemented.</p>

The technology sends wireless signals from the brain to the healthy part of the spinal cord, bypassing the injury.

Spinal cord stimulation may also show promise in helping people with Parkinson's Disease regain mobility.

The plane will be donated to the future Trump presidential library. Qatar's Media Attach√© confirmed the transfer is under consideration, but no decision has been made.

A "fast-track" settlement will be established for skilled workers contributing to Britain's growth. Critics warn the rules may split families, but research suggests migrants consider language important. Reform UK's rise in local elections prompted the move.</p>
