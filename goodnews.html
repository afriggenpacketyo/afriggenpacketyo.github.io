          <p>During a meeting in Qingdao, Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh called for a permanent solution to the ongoing border dispute with his Chinese counterpart, Dong Jun.

          <p>Recent conflict between Iran and Israel has highlighted the vulnerability of global energy supplies, reinforcing the argument for transitioning to renewable energy sources. Experts suggest that homegrown renewables offer a stable and secure alternative to fossil fuels, which are often subject to price volatility and supply disruptions from geopolitical instability. While the green transition presents its own challenges, such as mineral dependency and grid stability, diversifying power with domestic wind and solar is seen as crucial for strengthening national and economic security.</p>
