          <h2>Social Security Recipients May Qualify for Credit Card Debt Forgiveness</h2>

          <p>Americans relying on Social Security for income can still qualify for credit card debt forgiveness programs, which typically involve negotiating a reduced lump-sum payment with creditors. While a fixed income can demonstrate the financial hardship required for eligibility, the ability to save for a settlement offer remains a significant challenge. Federal law protects Social Security benefits from being garnished by most creditors like credit card companies, providing leverage in negotiations. However, individuals should weigh this against the stress of collection efforts and compare it with other debt relief options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>High-yield savings accounts continue to offer attractive interest rates, easily surpassing those of traditional savings accounts and providing a straightforward way for savers to grow their money. However, with the Federal Reserve expected to cut rates later this year, the high rates on these accounts are variable and could fall preemptively, unlike the fixed rates of CDs. A key advantage is the flexibility to access funds without penalty, which is valuable in an uncertain economic climate. Potential savers should also consider that the best rates are typically offered by online banks. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price has soared to a new record high, exceeding $118,000, driven by a significant surge in institutional investment. On Thursday, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced their largest single day of inflows for the year, totaling $1.18 billion. The rally was also fueled by expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve and the potential for an increased federal deficit, which can be a positive catalyst for the cryptocurrency. The sharp price increase triggered over $650 million in short liquidations, further accelerating the upward momentum as traders rushed to cover their positions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is pioneering the use of advanced artificial intelligence on Wall Street by testing "Devin," an autonomous AI software engineer developed by the startup Cognition. The bank plans to integrate Devin into its workforce of 12,000 human developers, initially using it for tasks like updating internal code to newer programming languages. Marco Argenti, Goldman's tech chief, stated that this "agentic AI" can execute complex, multi-step jobs and has the potential to boost worker productivity significantly. This move signals a major shift toward a "hybrid workforce" where humans supervise AI agents, potentially reshaping roles across finance.</p>

          <p>GE Vernova, the manufacturer of a wind turbine blade that disintegrated off the coast of Nantucket, has agreed to a $10.5 million settlement to compensate local businesses for economic losses. Last summer, fiberglass fragments from the massive blade, part of the Vineyard Wind project, washed ashore during the peak tourist season, requiring extensive cleanup efforts by crews and volunteers. The company attributed the failure to a manufacturing defect at a Canadian factory and has since inspected or removed other blades made there. The settlement will establish a fund to process and distribute payments to affected businesses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers with a significant sum like $10,000, choosing the right Certificate of Deposit (CD) term is crucial for maximizing returns in the current economic climate. While short-term CDs currently offer slightly higher annual percentage rates, long-term CDs ultimately generate substantially more interest due to the extended compounding period. For example, a 1-year CD at 4.40% on $10,000 earns $440, whereas a 5-year CD at 4.20% earns nearly $2,300. The decision requires balancing the desire for higher overall earnings against the need for liquidity, as funds are locked away for longer. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the national conversation about boosting birth rates, including debates around IVF, consistently overlooks a critical factor: male infertility. Despite male factors contributing to roughly half of infertility cases among heterosexual couples, men are often not evaluated, and treatments for them are less likely to be covered by insurance. The author suggests that instead of focusing solely on female-centric solutions, a more effective approach would be to expand access to male-infertility care. This could include funding more specialists, reforming telemedicine laws, and mandating insurance coverage for male-specific treatments, reducing the medical burden on women.</p>
