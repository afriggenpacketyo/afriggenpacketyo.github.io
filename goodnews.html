          <p>In an interview, Stephen Miran, chair of President Trump‚Äôs Council of Economic Advisers, addressed the economic volatility resulting from the administration's trade policies, including tariffs on China. Miran argued that short-term market fluctuations do not necessarily indicate long-term economic problems, and that firms are merely awaiting the outcomes of trade negotiations and tax bill decisions. He also mentioned the administration's focus on deregulation to boost domestic production and competitiveness. Miran defended the president's understanding of trade deficits, stating that a decline in trade with China would indeed reduce the deficit.</p>

          <p>The Channel Islands, often called California's Galapagos, are home to a diverse underwater ecosystem that thrives due to marine protected areas (MPAs). These MPAs, which cover roughly 21% of the islands' waters, are now under review by the California fish and game commission, sparking debate over expanding or reducing protections. Scientists and conservationists emphasize the economic and ecological benefits of preservation, noting increased biodiversity and spillover effects for the fishing industry.

          <p>China is hosting a delegation of nearly 100 young and mid-career African military officers from 40 countries to deepen defence ties across the continent. The officers will visit top military academies in China to learn about the country's military systems and modern technologies. By engaging with future leaders of African armed forces, China aims to build lasting relationships and influence, according to observers. This marks the fourth time the Chinese defence ministry has organized such an event.</p>

          <p>Negotiations are intensifying regarding President Donald Trump's tax agenda, with key issues being debated by lawmakers. The House Ways and Means Committee has released a preliminary partial text of its portion of the bill, but the final version could undergo significant changes. Republican lawmakers aim to pass Trump's package without Democratic support through a process known as "reconciliation." Competing priorities and the need for a fiscally responsible package could impact individual provisions, according to experts.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, which failed to launch to Venus in 1972, has reentered Earth's atmosphere after 53 years in orbit. The European Union Space Surveillance and Tracking confirmed the uncontrolled reentry, and the European Space Agency's space debris office also indicated that Kosmos 482 had reentered. The spacecraft, weighing half a ton, was built to withstand a landing on Venus, but it was not immediately known where it came down or how much survived the descent.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily halted the Trump administration's government overhaul, citing that Congress did not authorize large-scale staffing cuts and agency restructuring. The ruling sides with a group of unions, non-profits, and local governments in blocking mass layoffs known as ‚Äúreductions in force‚Äù for 14 days. The judge stated that the president may broadly restructure federal agencies only when authorized by Congress. A hearing is scheduled to consider a longer-lasting preliminary injunction.</p>
