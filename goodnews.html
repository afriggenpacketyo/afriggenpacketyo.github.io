          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 23:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba Cloud has unveiled Aegaeon, a computing pooling solution that reportedly cut Nvidia GPU usage by 82% for its AI models. Beta-tested for over three months, the system reduced the need for H20 GPUs from 1,192 to 213 to serve dozens of models. This innovation addresses resource inefficiency in serving concurrent large language model (LLM) workloads, where many GPUs are often underutilized. Researchers from Peking University and Alibaba Cloud presented these findings, highlighting Aegaeon as a pioneering effort in optimizing AI inference costs on the market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A popular Chinese spy drama, 'Silent Honour,' has inspired a surge of public appreciation for real-life intelligence agents, particularly a historical figure named Wu. Visitors have flocked to Wu's tomb, laying flowers and thank-you notes, despite it not being a traditional grave-sweeping festival. Wu, an underground Communist Party member, served as a Kuomintang lieutenant general in Taiwan in 1949, and is now being hailed as an 'unsung hero.' This outpouring of sentiment reflects the drama's impact on public perception of historical espionage and patriotism in China.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Bill Ackman has intensified his involvement in the New York City mayoral race, asserting that Republican Curtis Sliwa's continued candidacy boosts democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani's victory chances to 90%. Ackman, who supports independent candidate Andrew Cuomo, argued that Sliwa's refusal to drop out is detrimental to Cuomo's prospects. Sliwa's campaign, however, rejected Ackman's influence, insisting that voters, not billionaires, will decide the outcome. The race, also featuring Mamdani and Cuomo, has garnered national attention and significant trading volume on prediction markets.</p>

          <p>Eugenio Suárez's eighth-inning grand slam, his second home run of the game, propelled the Seattle Mariners to a 6-2 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. This crucial win gives Seattle a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven American League Championship Series. Cal Raleigh initiated the rally with a leadoff homer, tying the game before Suárez's decisive blast. The Mariners are now one win away from their first-ever World Series appearance, with Game 6 scheduled in Toronto. Blue Jays' George Springer exited the game after being hit by a pitch.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is solidifying its position as a leading offshore yuan trading center through new measures designed to facilitate easier and cheaper yuan borrowing. The Renminbi Business Facilitation (RBF) scheme, which offers lower interest rates compared to Hong Kong dollar loans, is a key component. This initiative aims to encourage more international investors and companies to utilize the Chinese currency. The scheme will soon expand to include direct investments, allowing mainland firms to secure yuan loans for overseas investments and foreign firms to access yuan funding for mainland expansion.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed a proclamation imposing 25% tariffs on imported medium- and heavy-duty trucks and their parts, along with 10% tariffs on imported buses. This move aims to protect U.S. companies from foreign competition and incentivize domestic vehicle manufacturing. The administration will offer credits to manufacturers who import parts to assemble vehicles in the U.S., offsetting tariff liabilities. Officials stated the program is designed to help American automakers remain cost-competitive and expand production domestically, supporting U.S. labor and wages.</p>

          <p>The annual Orionid meteor shower is set to peak next week, offering a spectacular display of bright, fast-moving meteors visible until November 7. Originating from Halley's Comet, these meteors create long streaks of light as tiny particles burn up in Earth's atmosphere. The best viewing conditions are expected between midnight and dawn, away from city lights, with up to 15 meteors per hour during the peak around October 22. Stargazers are advised to look towards the constellation Orion, identifiable by its distinctive belt of three bright stars, for optimal viewing without optical aid.</p>

          <p>India's jewellery market is bustling ahead of Diwali and Dhanteras, traditional festivals for buying precious metals, despite gold prices topping $1,440 per 10g. Soaring prices have led to a shift in consumer behavior, with many buying smaller, lighter jewellery pieces or prioritizing gold and silver for investment rather than adornment. Bullion market data and reports from the World Gold Council indicate a steady increase in investment demand, including through ETFs and digital gold. The Reserve Bank of India is also significantly influencing prices by diversifying its foreign exchange holdings with gold, aiming for stability amidst geopolitical stress.

          <p>The United States is experiencing a remarkable turnaround in its fentanyl crisis, with fatal overdoses falling by approximately 25% in 2024, saving nearly 30,000 lives. This significant decline is attributed to a commitment to harm reduction strategies, particularly in states like North Carolina, where overdose fatalities are down by 35%. Key initiatives include law enforcement assisted diversion (LEAD) programs, widespread access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT) like methadone, and the availability of naloxone to reverse overdoses. The article highlights a generational shift away from opioids among young people and the impact of the $60 billion Opioid Settlement funding prevention, treatment, and recovery efforts.</p>
