          <p>The article provides an overview of the current price of gold, noting it stands at $3,638.08 per ounce as of September 11, 2025, according to American Hartford Gold. It also discusses the various factors that influence gold prices, including supply and demand, economic conditions, inflation rates, interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty, currency movements, market sentiment, and central bank policies. Gold is traditionally seen as a safe-haven asset, especially during times of economic uncertainty, and as a hedge against inflation. The price of gold is subject to constant fluctuations due to a variety of factors, so it's important to monitor these changes when considering investing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The increasing popularity of weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Zepbound is impacting the apparel retail market, with resale businesses seeing a surge in larger sizes being donated as people transition to smaller sizes. Retailers are reportedly putting fewer extended sizes on racks, offering them primarily online. While the shift is mainly within the larger size range, some brands are experiencing increased demand for smaller plus sizes. Some worry that the plus-size segment, which was already underserved, could be further neglected if retailers overreact to the weight-loss drug trend.</p>

French retirees enjoy longer retirements than Americans, but the US Social Security trust fund is projected to be depleted in eight years. Raising the retirement age is a common proposal, but it disproportionately affects lower-income workers due to lifespan inequality. The article proposes raising the retirement age only for the top 40 percent of earners as a more equitable solution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are experiencing soaring demand as investors seek lower-cost options, but experts warn of common mistakes. Investors may not understand the underlying assets of ETFs, "chase performance" based on past returns, or trade too frequently, eroding returns. ETFs should align with an investor's risk tolerance, goals, and timeline. Frequent trading can negate the benefits of low cost and tax efficiency, as poor timing can hurt returns.</p>

          <p>The article explores the issue of grade inflation in American colleges, linking it to teacher evaluations. Professors are incentivized to lighten workloads and give better grades to improve their evaluation scores, which factor into pay, hiring, and tenure. Studies show that student evaluations are not correlated with objective learning assessments and are vulnerable to biases. Some schools are trying to reduce reliance on evaluations, but they are hard to eliminate due to student expectations and the need for accountability.</p>
