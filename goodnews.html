        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Medical and psychological experts are offering precautionary guidelines for children's screen time, emphasizing that less is generally better, especially in early development stages. Recommendations range from "screen-free until age three" to a maximum of two hours for teenagers, with a focus on supervised, quality content over passive consumption. Researchers express concern that excessive screen time can replace crucial activities for motor, social, and language skill development, potentially leading to poorer outcomes. Parents are advised to engage with their children about their digital activities and establish clear rules, including for themselves, to foster healthy media habits.</p>

          <p>Footballer Jack Grealish is experiencing a career revival since joining Everton on a season-long loan from Manchester City, delivering consecutive man-of-the-match performances. His creative prowess, including multiple assists in recent games, has made him a central figure for his new club after being sidelined for much of last season. This resurgence has raised questions about his exclusion from the latest England squad under manager Thomas Tuchel, who faces stiff competition for spots. With the World Cup approaching, Grealish's revitalized form is putting pressure on the national team's selection process and giving him a chance to prove his value.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Coco Gauff has advanced to the fourth round of the US Open for the fourth consecutive year after a convincing 6-3, 6-1 victory over Magdalena Frech. Following two tense, three-set matches earlier in the tournament, Gauff displayed a more settled and confident performance, particularly with her serve, which has been a point of concern recently. Having recently brought on a new biomechanics specialist to her coaching team, she showed improved mental fortitude and aggressive play. Gauff will next face either Daria Kasatkina or two-time champion Naomi Osaka as she continues her campaign at her home Grand Slam.</p>

          <p>Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has announced that he was recently diagnosed with Basal cell carcinoma, a common type of skin cancer. In a social media post, he shared a photo of his face bandaged after having a cancerous growth removed and thanked his medical team for their swift action. Ramsay, 58, used his diagnosis as a public service announcement, strongly urging his followers to use sunscreen, especially during the holiday weekend. Basal cell carcinoma is typically caused by long-term exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun and often appears on sun-exposed areas like the face and neck.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has reportedly made an improved transfer bid of £35 million, plus a 10% sell-on clause, for Crystal Palace's central defender, Marc Guehi. Crystal Palace has countered, seeking the £35 million fee plus an additional £5 million in performance-related bonuses. With the transfer deadline approaching, negotiations are ongoing as Guehi has indicated he will not sign a new contract, and his current deal expires next summer. Palace is actively looking to sign two new central defenders, a move that could facilitate Guehi's departure to Liverpool before the window closes.</p>

          <p>A major auction of over 1,000 famous Hollywood props and costumes is set to take place, featuring iconic items such as Darth Vader's lightsaber from "Star Wars" and Indiana Jones' bullwhip. The lightsaber, which has a presale estimate of $3 million, was authenticated by Propstore, the auction's host, by tracing its origins to a modified vintage camera flash. While some items are expected to fetch millions, the auction also includes more accessible memorabilia with starting bids as low as $200.

          <p>New York City health officials have officially declared the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem over, as no new cases have been reported since August 9. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. The source of the Legionella bacteria was traced to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been cleaned and disinfected. In response, the city administration has proposed new measures to enhance prevention, including more frequent testing of cooling towers and increased inspection capacity to avert future clusters of the disease.</p>

          <p>A new stethoscope enhanced with artificial intelligence could significantly improve the early detection of heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms. The device records an ECG and analyzes heart sounds with a microphone, sending the data to an AI system trained on thousands of patients' data to spot subtle abnormalities the human ear cannot. A large-scale study in London GP surgeries found that patients examined with the AI stethoscope were diagnosed with heart conditions far more frequently than those in a control group. Researchers believe this tool could be a "game-changer" for cardiovascular care, enabling earlier treatment.</p>

          <p>The new remake of the 1984 cult classic "The Toxic Avenger," directed by Macon Blair, offers a more polished and emotionally grounded take on the Troma original. Starring Peter Dinklage as the janitor-turned-mutant-hero, the film retains the gratuitous gore and blunt parody of its predecessor but with higher production values and a well-known cast including Kevin Bacon and Elijah Wood. The story centers on Winston Goose, a janitor who, after being transformed by toxic waste, seeks revenge on a villainous pharmaceutical company. The review suggests that while it's diverting and fun, its slickness may feel at odds with the intentionally cheap aesthetic of the original.</p>

          <p>Cellist Yo-Yo Ma and Afropop star Angélique Kidjo collaborated for "Sarabande Africaine," a concert at the Hollywood Bowl that explored the African origins of Baroque musical forms like the sarabande.

Kidjo commanded the stage with powerful vocals, while Ma's cello provided a complementary, often subtle, foundation. The review highlights a particularly moving rendition of a Philip Glass piece, "Move On," which showcased the deep musical connection between the two distinct artists.</p>
