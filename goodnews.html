        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article highlights the societal pressure on young people in China to follow traditional academic and career paths, often determined by a single high-stakes exam. It uses the story of Gong Sheng, a student who chose a culinary program over a more conventional academic route, as an example of a positive shift. The author argues that in the current economic climate, it is beneficial for society and families to support young individuals who pursue their passions, even if they are unconventional. The piece suggests that this growing trend indicates a greater certainty among Chinese youth about their personal goals and aspirations.</p>

          <p>Ohio State University has launched a new initiative called "AI Fluency," which will require all undergraduate students to incorporate artificial intelligence lessons into their studies, regardless of their major. Starting with the class of 2029, all freshmen must take a course in generative AI and attend workshops on its real-world applications. The university aims to prepare its graduates for a job market where AI skills are increasingly in demand, citing a Brookings Institution analysis showing a 619% increase in such job listings over the last decade. The program is designed to teach students how to use AI effectively as a tool for brainstorming and organization without replacing critical thinking.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index surged to a new record high, driven by gains in technology and real estate sectors, following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to lower its benchmark interest rate. The Fed's anticipated quarter-point cut was framed as a "risk management" move, with indications of two more potential cuts by year-end. While the Nikkei rose, other Asia-Pacific markets had mixed reactions, and U.S. markets closed unevenly after a volatile session. The Bank of Japan is also beginning its policy meeting, where it is expected to maintain its current rates for now. (not investment advice)</p>

The device can be controlled using hand gestures via a neural-technology-powered wristband, allowing users to watch videos or respond to messages. This product serves as a bridge between Meta's audio-only smart glasses and its more advanced, experimental augmented reality projects. The company also debuted new Oakley-branded smart glasses for athletes and an updated version of its original Ray-Ban Meta glasses, continuing its long-term partnership with eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica.</p>

          <p>American tennis star Taylor Townsend has issued a public apology after facing backlash for social media posts criticizing some of the food offered at a tournament in Shenzhen, China. Townsend had expressed shock at seeing dishes that included bullfrogs and turtles, rating the experience a "2 out of 10." After her comments went viral and were criticized as culturally insensitive on Chinese social media, she removed the posts and shared a video apology. In her new message, Townsend stated she was privileged to experience different cultures and that her previous comments were not representative of her positive experience in the country.</p>

          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. Currently, the storm is tracking northwest with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph and is not expected to pose an immediate threat to land. However, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center anticipate that Gabrielle will intensify over the weekend and could potentially become a low-grade hurricane by Sunday. While its long-term path remains uncertain, the system could approach Bermuda next week as it continues to strengthen over open waters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire regularly consume the equivalent of nearly two human alcoholic beverages per day through their diet of fermented fruit. Scientists from UC Berkeley measured the alcohol content in figs and plum-like fruits favored by the primates, finding it averaged around 0.3% by weight. While this low concentration prevents the chimps from becoming intoxicated, it exposes them to a steady dose of ethanol. The research provides direct chemical evidence supporting the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that the human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in our primate ancestors' fruit-eating habits.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to hold interest rates at 4% when it meets on Thursday. This follows a rate cut from 4.25% in August, which brought the rate to its lowest level in over two years. Analysts believe that with UK inflation still running at 3.8%, nearly double the official 2% target, policymakers are unlikely to risk another cut this year. The decision comes after the U.S. Federal Reserve recently cut its own interest rates, while the European Central Bank chose to hold its rates steady, highlighting different economic pressures across major economies.

He argued that the move was widely expected and does not fundamentally alter the major themes driving the market, suggesting the mixed reaction might even present buying opportunities. Cramer stated that the Fed is in a difficult position, balancing a weaker job market against persistent inflation, and that Chair Jerome Powell's cautious approach is prudent. He suggested that sectors like technology and banking can continue to perform well regardless of minor shifts in Fed policy. (not investment advice)</p>

The Fed's decision to cut its rate was prompted by signs of a softening U.S. labor market.
