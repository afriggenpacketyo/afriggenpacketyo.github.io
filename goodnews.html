        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As tariffs rise, companies are increasingly using 'tariff engineering' to reduce duties, which involves altering products' materials or dimensions to fit into lower-tariff categories. This practice, while not new, has become more prevalent during Trump's second term due to broad-based tariffs and exemptions. For example, some manufacturers initially bundled steel and aluminum to qualify for lower duties, but reversed course when tariffs on those materials increased. Customs lawyers emphasize that strategic design choices to reduce duty liability are acceptable, with over 5,000 product classification codes available for tariff assessment. Winnebago Industries, a recreational vehicle manufacturer, also plans to employ tariff mitigation strategies, including tariff engineering. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sean 'Diddy' Combs' defense team signals a change in strategy as prosecutors wrap up their case in the federal trial, requesting significantly less time for their presentation. Legal experts suggest this shift indicates perceived weaknesses in the government's case, which relies heavily on testimony from ex-girlfriends and ex-employees. The defense emphasizes the prosecution's burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, while the judge has reprimanded both sides for violating a gag order. The trial includes testimony and videos related to alleged sexual encounters, with Combs maintaining his innocence amidst charges of racketeering, sex trafficking, and prostitution.</p>

The test included a zero-altitude escape trial at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, where the spacecraft's escape engines ignited to simulate an emergency during lift-off. The return capsule reached its designated altitude, separated cleanly, and landed safely using parachutes and an airbag system. The Mengzhou spacecraft, designed for both near-Earth and deep-space missions, represents China's first test of this kind since 1998, marking a significant advancement in its space program.</p>

While blood donation rules will still require a three-month wait for those engaging in anal sex with new or multiple partners, plasma donation will be more accessible.

          <p>As the US security focus shifts towards countering China, European leaders must recognize they are living on borrowed time and should take greater control of NATO. Diplomats suggest building the European pillar of NATO, where European governments maximize NATO's chain of command and experience in collective defense planning to prepare for acting without the US. This involves a managed transition of crucial capabilities from the US to Europe over the next five to ten years, rather than sudden unilateral announcements. The best option is to extend and pretend until the Europeans are ready to grab the NATO steering wheel.</p>
