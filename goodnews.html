          <p>NBA star Luka Doncic has signed a contract extension with the Los Angeles Lakers, ending speculation about his potential departure. The 26-year-old guard, who was acquired in a trade from the Dallas Mavericks, announced the deal himself, expressing his commitment to bringing championships to the franchise. The Lakers organization lauded him as a "transcendent player" and the future of the team in the post-LeBron James era.

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana are launching a new left-wing political party in the UK but have yet to decide on a name. They are inviting their reported 600,000 registered supporters to suggest a title, aiming for a name that encapsulates the party's essence. This unconventional approach highlights the challenges of branding in modern politics, where a name must resonate with voters and be distinct enough for registration with the Electoral Commission. The article notes the importance of branding in a digital age and the risks of choosing a name that could be ridiculed.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has shared that the death of his stepfather at age 54 was a key factor in his decision to leave his career as a doctor for comedy. Hill, who qualified in 1988, felt unsuited for medicine and recalled feeling "completely out of my depth" when breaking tragic news to a patient's family. He explained that his stepfather's passing made him realize he didn't want to spend his life in a profession he wasn't passionate about. The article also touches on his famous show, "Harry Hill's TV Burp," and the stress involved in its weekly production.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a prominent advocate for open-source AI with its Llama models, is now indicating a more cautious approach to its open-source strategy. This shift contrasts with China's vigorous embrace of open-source AI, where companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI are rapidly releasing advanced models. AI expert Andrew Ng has suggested that China's competitive, "Darwinian" open-source ecosystem could be its path to surpassing the U.S. in the field. The article highlights recent releases from Chinese tech giants, which claim to have developed some of the world's top open-source AI models.</p>

          <p>An annual mountain cleanup at Breckenridge Ski Resort in Colorado resulted in the collection of 780 pounds of trash and lost items. The effort, involving 150 employees, uncovered a variety of strange objects dropped from ski lifts, such as a hamburger flipper, an iPod Nano, and a message in a bottle containing a COVID-19 vaccination card. The resort noted that most of the weight came from larger items that were recycled or upcycled. In a wholesome encounter, staff also came across a family of moose, reminding them of the importance of preserving these natural spaces.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the 25-year-old wife of a Marine Corps veteran, has been released from an ICE detention facility in Louisiana after being detained for two months. She was arrested in May during what she believed was a routine green card application interview, despite having just given birth and still breastfeeding her infant daughter. Her case drew attention due to her husband's military service and the family's circumstances, with her attorney calling the detention an example of a "hyper-enforcement environment." Clouatre is now reunited with her family but must wear an ankle monitor as she continues her immigration proceedings.</p>

          <p>A group led by Boston Celtics minority owner Steve Pagliuca has reportedly reached a deal to buy the WNBA's Connecticut Sun for a record-setting $325 million. The deal, which is pending league approval, includes plans to relocate the team to Boston for the 2027 season and contribute $100 million for a new practice facility. The Sun, currently owned by the Mohegan Tribe, has been one of the league's most successful teams on the court but lacks a dedicated modern training facility. This sale reflects the WNBA's rapid growth, with the price far exceeding previous franchise sales and expansion fees.</p>

          <p>The long-standing mystery surrounding the death of a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill during World War II has been solved by researchers. The platypus, named Winston, was sent from Australia in 1943 as a diplomatic gift but died just before reaching the UK. For decades, it was rumored that the creature died from shell-shock after its ship encountered a German U-boat. However, recent archival research by students at Monash University and the University of Sydney revealed that the platypus likely died from heatstroke, as logbooks showed water temperatures well above the safe threshold for the animal as the ship crossed the equator.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell made a strong return from a four-month injury layoff, but the Tampa Bay Rays secured a 4-0 victory. In his five-inning outing, the two-time Cy Young winner recorded eight strikeouts and issued no walks, flashing the dominant form the Dodgers hoped for when signing him. However, he surrendered three runs on two home runs by Yandy Díaz, who took advantage of the short right-field wall at the Rays' temporary ballpark. Despite the loss, Snell's performance was seen as a promising step forward for the Dodgers' late-season rotation depth.</p>
