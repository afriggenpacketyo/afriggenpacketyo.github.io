          <p>Australian stocks experienced a downturn after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese secured a second term, marking the first time in 21 years an Australian Prime Minister has achieved consecutive terms. The S&P/ASX 200 index fell by 0.83%, reversing previous gains, as most Asian markets remained closed for holidays. This decline reflects investor apprehension amid global macroeconomic uncertainty, though the Australian dollar saw a slight increase against the U.S. dollar. The article notes the strengthening of the New Taiwanese dollar and a drop in oil prices following OPEC+'s decision to increase production.</p>

          <p>Silent book clubs are experiencing a surge in popularity, offering a unique social experience centered around reading in a shared space.

          <p>Experts are debating the impact of artificial intelligence on the job market, with concerns raised about its potential to exacerbate inequality. While some, like CIMB Group's Pedro Uria-Recio, emphasize the need for companies to equip employees with AI skills and create new employment opportunities, others, such as Prudential Singapore's Tomasz Kurczyk, suggest adapting to inevitable changes rather than resisting them. The article also addresses ethical considerations, particularly the risk of AI amplifying existing biases present in data, and the need for humans to remain at the forefront of AI implementation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from the Health and Social Care Select Committee warns that failing to address England's social care system for older and disabled adults is unsustainable, costing the country financially and in human terms. The report highlights that taxpayers are currently paying ¬£32 billion a year for a broken system propped up by unpaid carers. The committee recommends investing in the system to improve care quality and drive economic growth, suggesting that an extra ¬£1 billion spent on social care could create 50,000 jobs. The government acknowledges the need for deep reform and states that it has already taken action on social care.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that China's ongoing anti-corruption campaign targeting high-ranking officials in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) should not be interpreted as a sign of President Xi Jinping's weakened control over the military. They argue that the campaign's impact on military readiness and modernization is limited, and that internal competition among Xi's supporters may be a contributing factor. In the past two years, several members of the Central Military Commission (CMC) have been targeted, indicating a significant effort to address corruption within the military.</p>

          <p>President Trump's policies and presence are shaping global politics, as seen in recent elections in Canada and Australia where parties borrowing from the MAGA playbook were punished. In both countries, center-left incumbents surged ahead of conservative oppositions. Canada's prime minister, Mark Carney, campaigned on an explicitly anti-Trump message, while Australia's leader, Anthony Albanese, did not, but both benefited from an anti-Trump sentiment. In Germany, the effect of the Trump factor has been less direct, but has still been felt.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is becoming increasingly popular among young women as a way to preserve their fertility and delay motherhood. The procedure involves hormone injections to stimulate egg production, followed by egg retrieval and freezing in liquid nitrogen. While egg freezing offers women the option of delaying childbearing, it is not a guarantee of future pregnancy and involves financial and medical costs. The article explores the perspectives of women who have frozen their eggs, fertility specialists, and bioethicists, discussing the benefits, risks, and ethical considerations surrounding this technology.</p>
