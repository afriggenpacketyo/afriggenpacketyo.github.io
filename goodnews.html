          <p>Powerful winds in Washington state are stirring up volcanic ash from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, leading to hazy skies and diminished air quality. The U.S. Geological Survey has clarified that this phenomenon, known as ash resuspension, is due to severe drought conditions and is not indicative of new volcanic activity. Officials have confirmed the volcano's alert level remains at "Normal." However, the resuspended ash poses a potential hazard to aircraft and human health, prompting warnings for pilots and residents in the affected areas.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay sustained a torn plantar fascia during his team's 33-19 victory against the Tennessee Titans. McVay, known for his energetic sideline presence, confirmed the injury but downplayed its severity, joking that it might add a "cool limp" to his swag. The injury is not expected to significantly impact his coaching duties as the now 2-0 Rams prepare for their upcoming game against the Philadelphia Eagles. The team's strong second-half performance secured their undefeated start to the season.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the global competition for AI dominance will ultimately be decided by a nation's commitment to education and reskilling its workforce. The author suggests that countries must move beyond simply producing machine-learning engineers and focus on democratizing AI knowledge across all sectors. By embedding AI principles into national education strategies, citizens can be trained to transition from low-value tasks to higher-level roles augmented by artificial intelligence. This approach is presented as essential for boosting national productivity and competitiveness in fields from healthcare to manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Google's AI application, Gemini, has claimed the top spot for free apps on Apple's App Store, overtaking its rival ChatGPT. The surge in popularity follows recent updates to Gemini, including a new image-editing feature that reportedly attracted 13 million new users in just four days. This milestone reflects Google's growing traction in the consumer AI space after initially lagging behind OpenAI.

          <p>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has officially announced his campaign for a third consecutive term, a rare feat in the state's history. The Democrat, who served as Kamala Harris's running mate in the 2024 presidential election, highlighted his administration's progressive achievements, such as legalizing recreational marijuana and codifying abortion rights. Despite his national profile, Walz faces political headwinds, including polling that suggests half of Minnesotans oppose a third term and ongoing scrutiny over his administration's handling of a major COVID-19 fraud case.</p>

          <p>A growing number of high-income consumers are turning to discount stores like Aldi and Walmart, a trend driven primarily by persistent inflation that has eroded their financial cushions. Since 2021, the percentage of affluent households shopping at budget retailers has risen from approximately 20% to nearly 28%. In response, discount chains are actively courting these wealthier shoppers by refurbishing stores, improving presentation, and expanding their selection to include more upscale and popular brands. This shift reflects a broader consumer search for value as the cost of living remains elevated.</p>
