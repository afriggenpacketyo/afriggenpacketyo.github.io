          <p>Indian writer Banu Mushtaq has won the International Booker Prize for her short story anthology, 'Heart Lamp,' marking the first Kannada language book to receive the honor. The stories, translated by Deepa Bhasthi, explore the hardships faced by Muslim women in southern India. Mushtaq's work, influenced by her own experiences with religious conservatism and patriarchal society, focuses on the value of attention to marginalized lives and unnoticed choices. This recognition has brought increased attention to Mushtaq's life and literary contributions, highlighting the challenges faced by women in conservative societies.</p>

          <p>Delaware Governor Matt Meyer signed the End-of-Life Options Act, legalizing physician-assisted suicide for terminally ill patients with six months or less to live, making Delaware the 11th state to permit the practice. The law, effective next year, allows mentally capable adults to request a prescription to end their lives. Before obtaining the prescription, patients must be presented with alternative end-of-life care options, undergo two waiting periods, and receive a second medical opinion on their prognosis. This signing concludes nearly a decade of debate on the issue, reflecting a growing trend in recognizing patient autonomy in end-of-life decisions.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has decided to temporarily halt its bonus scheme for senior executives, following criticism that it was trying to circumvent rules banning bonuses for water company bosses. The scheme, which could have amounted to 50% of senior executives' pay packets, was linked to securing a ¬£3 billion rescue loan for the troubled company. The decision comes after Downing Street stated that rewarding executives for mismanagement was unacceptable. Thames Water will await guidance from the regulator Ofwat to ensure its approach aligns with public expectations and turnaround objectives.</p>

          <p>Japan's agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned after facing criticism for stating he "never had to buy rice" because he received it as gifts, a comment seen as insensitive amid rising rice prices. The resignation poses a challenge for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government, which faces a crucial national election. Eto clarified that he does buy white rice and his comment referred to brown rice, which he wants to promote. Shinjiro Koizumi, a popular former Environment Minister, will succeed Eto, aiming to address public concerns over rising rice prices.</p>

Research shows that young people hold more progressive values than previous generations, with young women being more supportive of issues like abortion rights, feminism, environmental protection, and redistribution. This shift presents a political opportunity for center-left parties to focus on the priorities and values of female voters, rather than pandering to reactionary politics.</p>
