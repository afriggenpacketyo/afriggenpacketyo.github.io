          <p>The U.S. Senate has advanced a package of three spending bills, breaking a partisan stalemate and taking a significant step toward avoiding a potential government shutdown. The bills, which fund military construction, Veterans' Affairs, agriculture, and the legislative branch, now move to the House, where they face opposition from Republicans over spending levels. This marks the first time since 2018 that the Senate has passed appropriations bills before September. The move is seen as a victory for Senate leadership as the September 30 government funding deadline approaches.</p>

The group, which began its career playing at social protests, is performing to oppose authoritarianism and show solidarity with immigrants and communities of color. This follows a recent mobile concert they performed during a previous demonstration, reinforcing their commitment to using music as a tool for mobilization and social commentary. The band's statement emphasizes the power of music to speak truth and unite people during critical times.</p>

          <p>After five years of strained relations following a deadly border clash, India and China are taking steps toward a diplomatic thaw, prompted by shifting global geopolitics and trade dynamics. Recent positive moves include China allowing Indian pilgrims back into Tibet and New Delhi resuming the issuance of visas to Chinese citizens, with direct flights expected to restart soon. Experts believe these measures could lead to deeper cooperation between the two Asian economic giants. However, the unresolved Himalayan border dispute remains a significant obstacle to fully normalizing the relationship and rebuilding trust.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Supreme Court's recent ruling on hidden car finance commissions has elicited mixed feelings from the claimants who brought the case. While the court closed a major avenue for mass compensation, it did award over £1,650 to one claimant, Marcus Johnson, on the grounds that his specific lending relationship was unfair. Johnson described the outcome as a "bitter pill to swallow" for the many who will now miss out on claims. The decision highlights the complexities of consumer finance law and leaves the door open for future claims based on unfairness rather than a breach of fiduciary duty.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made several moves before the trade deadline to strengthen their roster for the final stretch of the season, acquiring relievers Brock Stewart and Paul Gervase and outfielder Alex Call. Manager Dave Roberts stated that these additions will "raise the floor for our ballclub," providing needed depth for the bullpen and lineup. Stewart, a former Dodger, returns as a high-leverage relief option, while the 6-foot-10 Gervase adds a unique look from the mound. The team hopes these new players will complement their existing star-studded core as they push for the playoffs.</p>

          <p>At an internal town hall meeting, social media giant ByteDance revealed that the median service length for its current 120,000 employees is 2.9 years, with an average tenure of three years. The disclosure, which followed online speculation about high turnover, suggests that the owner of TikTok and Douyin has a relatively stable workforce compared to the high-pressure Chinese tech industry. The company abandoned the infamous "996" work culture in late 2021, shifting to a more standard five-day work week. These figures indicate that ByteDance remains an attractive employer in the competitive tech sector.</p>

In a social media post, Bessent indicated that he believes the two nations have the "makings of a deal" that would be mutually beneficial. While China's vice-minister of commerce suggested that a pause on new tariff increases would be extended, the Trump administration has not yet confirmed this. The official U.S. stance remains cautious, with mixed messages being delivered following the conclusion of the talks.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary order preventing the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals who were facing the loss of their legal status and deportation protections. In her order, Judge Trina Thompson stated the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing that the administration's decision was "preordained" and potentially motivated by racial animus.

          <p>An Ohio woman, Tiah McCreary, took a unique form of revenge after Taylor Kia of Lima repossessed her car a month after purchase. Upon discovering the dealership had let its business name registration lapse with the state, she registered "Taylor Kia of Lima" for herself and sent the business a cease-and-desist letter. While a lower court initially sided with the dealership, an appeals court has now ruled that the dispute over the trade name is separate from the car purchase agreement. The case regarding the name will now proceed in court, highlighting a creative consumer response to a business dispute.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Supreme Court has narrowed the path for mass compensation claims over hidden commissions in car finance deals, ruling against the idea that dealers have a "fiduciary duty" to buyers. However, the court upheld one claim where a large commission was deemed "unfair" under the Consumer Credit Act, setting a precedent for similar cases. While this decision averts a potential £30bn+ payout scenario, lenders may still face billions in redress, particularly concerning now-banned Discretionary Commission Agreements. The Financial Conduct Authority is still considering a formal redress scheme for affected consumers. (not investment advice)</p>
