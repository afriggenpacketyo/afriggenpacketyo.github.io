          <h2>Millions More on Benefits to Receive ¬£150 Off Energy Bills This Winter</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 17:30:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British government is expanding the Warm Home Discount scheme, providing ¬£150 off energy bills to millions more households this winter. The change scraps the previous qualification based on property size and energy score, allowing 2.7 million additional homes, including nearly a million with children, to benefit. Energy companies will fund the expansion, potentially leading to a slight increase in bills for all customers through the Standing Charge. While debt charities and energy groups welcome the move, some argue the scheme still excludes vulnerable individuals on non-means tested benefits, and Simon Francis from the End Fuel Poverty Coalition suggests the discount should be even higher given current energy costs.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate, continuing a "wait-and-see" approach while evaluating the impact of economic policies. The central bank anticipates inflation to rise in the coming months but still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the economy's relative strength, citing a low unemployment rate and improved sentiment, while also acknowledging that tariffs could increase inflation and slow economic growth. The Fed's decision reflects a cautious approach amid mixed economic signals and ongoing trade developments (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of murdering her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe, in a retrial, nearly a year after her first trial ended in a mistrial. The jury acquitted her of second-degree murder, manslaughter, and leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death, but found her guilty of operating under the influence of liquor, for which she received one-year probation. Prosecutors alleged Read hit O'Keefe with her car after a night of drinking and left him to die in a blizzard, while the defense argued O'Keefe was attacked and beaten by others. Read thanked her supporters and stated that no one fought harder for justice for John O'Keefe than she did.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved lenacapavir, a twice-yearly injection for HIV prevention, hailed as a potential "breakthrough" in curbing the HIV epidemic. Clinical trial data indicates that the injection provides near-complete protection against HIV infection, offering a more convenient alternative to daily pills. However, the drug's high cost, roughly $28,000 a year, could limit access, particularly in countries with the highest HIV burden. While Gilead Sciences is taking steps to broaden access, cuts to foreign aid could hinder the drug's reach in these areas.</p>

The injection will be marketed under the name Yeztugo and has an annual list price of $28,218 in the U.S. before insurance, which is in line with existing medications approved for the same use.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that if the U.S. were to strike Iran's Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, the risk of widespread radioactive contamination is low. The plant primarily processes uranium in the form of uranium hexafluoride, a heavy gas molecule that is unlikely to travel far. Edwin Lyman of the Union of Concerned Scientists notes that the uranium isotopes found at the facility are at the low end of hazard, and any environmental release would likely result in relatively low-level contamination. However, the gas can react with water in the air to form hydrofluoric acid, an acutely hazardous material.</p>
