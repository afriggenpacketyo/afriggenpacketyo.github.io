Negotiators agreed on a framework to implement the consensus reached in Geneva and the first official call between the two state leaders since President Donald Trump's return to office. Discussions addressed rare earths, Chinese student visas, and U.S. exports of jet engine parts to China, with Trump calling it ‚Äúa great deal‚Äù.

          <p>The Asian needle ant, first detected in the U.S. in 1932, continues its spread across 20 states, prompting concerns about its potential impact on ecosystems and human health. While not aggressive, the ant's sting can cause anaphylaxis in some individuals, leading to increased hospitalizations. The ants colonize undisturbed forest areas and can also be found near homes and businesses, nesting under mulch, pavers, and landscape timbers. Experts recommend wearing gloves and shoes when gardening and cleaning up woody debris to avoid contact, while also encouraging people to report suspected sightings to local extension offices for identification.</p>

          <p>The trial of Gjert Ingebrigtsen, father of Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen, for alleged abuse, has sparked debate about the role of parents in youth sports. Experts emphasize the importance of balancing performance improvement with the safety and well-being of young athletes. Psychological violence is prevalent in sports, and creating a safe environment requires athletes to have voice, choice, and exit options. Parents should be active members of their child's sporting environment and prioritize their autonomy in decision-making, especially in talent scouting systems where exploitation is a risk.</p>

For the Met Office to declare a heatwave, threshold temperatures must be reached for at least three consecutive days, ranging from 25C in the north and west to 28C in eastern England. While warm spells have occurred recently, they haven't lasted long enough to qualify as a heatwave, but that is anticipated to change.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Hawaii are using drones to release live mosquitoes as a method to combat avian malaria and save endangered honeycreepers. The mosquitoes are male and contain a bacteria called wolbachia that prevents their eggs from hatching when they mate with local females. This strategy aims to reduce the population of disease-carrying mosquitoes in the forests where the birds live. The drones offer a safer and more efficient alternative to helicopters, which have been used to release the mosquitoes in the past.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Owen Farrell has agreed to rejoin Saracens on a two-year deal, just a year after leaving for French side Racing 92. The 33-year-old has signed a two-year deal after the Premiership club came to an agreement with Paris-based Racing to end his stint in Top 14 a year early. Farrell previously spent 16 years at Saracens, helping the club win six Premiership titles and three European Champions Cups. He expressed his excitement to return to Saracens and contribute to the club's potential.</p>
