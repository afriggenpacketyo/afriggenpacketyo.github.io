          <p>BTS members Jimin and Jung Kook were discharged from South Korea's military, marking a significant step towards the group's anticipated reunion in 2025, which is expected to greatly impact global music sales and concerts. The pair were greeted by thousands of cheering fans, some of whom traveled from across the globe to see their idols. All seven members of BTS have now either completed or are nearing completion of their mandatory military service, with SUGA set for discharge later this month. Before their hiatus in 2022, BTS generated substantial revenue for South Korea's GDP, and analysts predict their comeback will revitalize the global music scene. The group's 12th anniversary celebrations are already underway in Seoul, signaling their imminent return.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reached a framework agreement to implement the Geneva trade consensus following high-level talks in London. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Chinese trade representative Li Chenggang both confirmed the agreement, which now awaits approval from President Trump and President Xi Jinping. The agreement aims to stabilize the relationship between the two countries, which had been strained by accusations of violating the Geneva trade agreement. If approved, the framework will implement a 90-day suspension of reciprocal tariffs and a rollback of certain other measures agreed upon in Switzerland in mid-May. While the agreement signals a commitment to de-escalation, some unresolved details still require internal discussion.</p>

He argues that the death penalty goes against the spirit of democracy, which respects human rights and the sanctity of life. Elbegdorj also notes that there is always the danger of wrongly convicting individuals and executing them.
