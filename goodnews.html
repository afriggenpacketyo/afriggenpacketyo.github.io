          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. government has acquired a 10% stake in Intel, making it one of the company's largest shareholders. This deal, valued at approximately $11 billion, converts previously pledged government grants under the CHIPS and Science Act and Secure Enclave program into equity. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated the agreement strengthens U.S. semiconductor leadership and technological edge. The move follows Trump's previous criticism of Intel's CEO and is part of his strategy to boost domestic chip production and leverage power over tech companies, though the government will hold non-voting shares.

          <p>An article argues that preparing for extreme weather is crucial for safeguarding the Greater Bay Area's prosperity, a region with 86 million people and a $2 trillion GDP. As Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangdong integrate, they face shared climate risks, making a coordinated adaptation framework vital for trade, investment, and growth. Key recommendations include establishing a cross-border early warning platform for meteorological and oceanographic data, similar to the EU's Copernicus service, and implementing common resilient infrastructure standards. This proactive approach could make the bay area a global benchmark for coastal megaregions.</p>

          <p>Wall Street experienced a significant rally, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing 845 points, after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested potential interest rate cuts. In his Jackson Hole address, Powell indicated that current economic conditions, including slowed job growth and rising downside risks to employment, "may warrant adjusting our policy stance." This statement, despite pressure from President Trump to cut rates, is seen as a strong signal for policy changes, with traders now assigning an 83% likelihood of a cut at the next FOMC meeting.

          <p>Stocks rallied after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled potential interest rate cuts, but he also warned that long-term "neutral" rates might be higher than in the 2010s, indicating persistent economic instability. Powell's speech at Jackson Hole suggested a shift towards bolstering the labor market due to slowing job growth and rising employment risks, despite inflation remaining above the Fed's 2% target. The article notes that President Trump's tariffs have begun to push up prices, complicating the Fed's "Goldilocks balance" and limiting its ability to counteract executive policies that destabilize the economy.

          <p>The North Carolina Supreme Court has issued favorable rulings for bar owners, allowing their lawsuits seeking compensation for COVID-19 restrictions to continue. The lawsuits argue that then-Gov. Roy Cooper's orders, which closed bars while allowing restaurants to serve alcohol, unfairly impacted their businesses. The court's majority rejected state arguments for immunity, affirming that bar owners have a right to pursue claims that their constitutional right to earn a living was violated. This decision means a trial judge can now hear evidence on these allegations, despite dissenting opinions from the court's Democratic justices.</p>
