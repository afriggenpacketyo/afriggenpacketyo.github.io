          <h2>Measles Vaccination Rates Decline in Most U.S. Counties, Study Reveals</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by Johns Hopkins University highlights a decline in measles vaccination rates among children across 33 U.S. states, with 78% of the counties studied showing a decrease from the 2017-2018 to the 2023-2024 school year. The MMR vaccination rate dropped from 93.92% to 91.26% during this period, with significant variations within and across states. This decline comes amid the largest measles outbreak in the U.S. since 2019, with 1,088 cases reported nationwide, primarily in West Texas. Experts emphasize the vulnerability of communities with vaccination rates below the 95% herd immunity threshold, as highlighted by the outbreak's epicenter in Gaines County, Texas.</p>

          <p>The Broadway play ‚ÄúJohn Proctor Is the Villain,‚Äù set in a high school during the MeToo movement, is generating intense emotional responses, particularly among women, with many leaving performances in tears. The play revolves around an honors English class studying Arthur Miller‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Crucible‚Äù and explores the complexities and tensions surrounding the MeToo movement through the experiences of high school girls. Playwright Kimberly Belflower was inspired by the MeToo movement and her own experiences growing up in rural Georgia, aiming to capture the moment before the backlash against the movement. The play's power lies in its ability to transport viewers back to a time when MeToo felt full of potential, offering a glimpse of hope that is now scarce.</p>

          <p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is planning to hire more than 100 people after nearly 600 employees were laid off or retired as part of government-wide budget cuts earlier in the year.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a strong stock market rally in May, U.S. exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows indicate lingering investor skepticism about the strength of U.S. equities. While equity ETFs saw roughly $3 billion in daily inflows at the start of 2025, these inflows have more than halved to $1.4 billion since the market recovered from April losses. Investors are primarily seeking refuge in ultra-short duration assets, such as the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 T-Bill ETF (BIL). This trend suggests a cautious stance on stocks, potentially reflecting a "reset year" pattern from bull market history, where the third year often sees more cautious trading and a wider dispersion in returns across equity sectors.</p>

          <p>Leaders from the fashion industry, including Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour, the Council of Fashion Designers of America CEO Steven Kolb, and the American Apparel & Footwear Association CEO Stephen Lamar, met with White House officials to discuss potential tariff relief. The fashion industry supports ten million American jobs and has historically paid high tariffs, prompting the discussion about balanced trade and maintaining these jobs in the U.S. The industry representatives aimed to address how tariffs have burdened the fashion sector, leading to increased prices on goods. There has been long-standing tension between Anna Wintour and Melania Trump, as the former First Lady was never featured on the cover of Vogue.</p>

          <p>Iowa state Representative J.D.

Scholten, a former congressional candidate and current baseball player, criticized Ernst's leadership and plans to make the race a referendum on President Trump's trade policy. Scholten previously ran for higher office, coming close to unseating Representative Steve King in 2018, and currently serves in the state house representing the Sioux City area.</p>

The sun is currently in the maximum phase of its 11-year activity cycle, leading to more frequent and widespread light displays.

          <p>President Trump has pardoned two South Florida divers, Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr., who were convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a giant grouper from a fisherman's longline. The divers spotted the line off the Jupiter Inlet in August 2020 and, believing it was illegal, released the marine animals. Federal prosecutors charged them with theft, arguing the line belonged to a licensed fisherman. The pardons erase the felony convictions, restoring the men's voting rights, firearm ownership, and freedom to travel outside the U.S.</p>

Energy Secretary Chris Wright believes securing commercial offtakers will facilitate financing, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum says the Department of Defense is prepared to support the project.

Under the settlement, the Water Authority will pay a fixed price to MWD for delivering these supplies, starting at $671 per acre-foot in 2026, with annual adjustments for inflation.

          <p>Senators are increasing calls for a severe Russia sanctions bill to advance, with Senator Lindsey Graham stating that the Senate will move forward with legislation imposing strict tariffs on Moscow. The bill, co-sponsored by Senator Richard Blumenthal, would impose 500% tariffs on any country buying Moscow's energy products. Graham, after visiting Ukraine and meeting with President Zelenskyy, expressed support for the sanctions as a means of holding Russia accountable for its actions. The bill has bipartisan support and is currently being discussed with the White House.</p>
