          <p>David Sacks, President Trump's crypto advisor, anticipates the stablecoin legislation, GENIUS Act, will pass with bipartisan support in the Senate. He claims that providing a legal framework for stablecoins could create trillions of dollars in demand for U.S. Treasuries. Sacks notes that there is already over $200 billion in stablecoins that are currently unregulated. The bill has cleared a key procedural vote, indicating strong support, although concerns remain about safeguards preventing the president and his family from profiting from the legislation.

          <p>The Trump administration has expedited refugee status for Afrikaners, a White ethnic minority from South Africa, citing violence and discrimination. This decision has sparked debate, with some Afrikaners claiming a 'White genocide' is occurring, a view supported by Elon Musk. However, other Afrikaners, like commentator Piet Croucamp and cattle farmer Nick Serfontein, dismiss these claims as untrue, stating that Whites remain economically strong and that crime affects all races. Ramaphosa pushed back against Mr. Trump's repeated claims of Whites being targeted. They also highlight government efforts to train Black farmers and share land, emphasizing that the real issue is general crime, not racial targeting.</p>

          <p>Craig Steinley, the vice president of the Appraisal Institute, has been ousted from his position following allegations of improper touching and sexual harassment from multiple women. The New York Times reported on these allegations, leading to an emergency meeting where the national board voted to remove Steinley. Steinley denies the accusations, calling the decision retaliatory. The Appraisal Institute had previously paid $412,000 to settle a sexual harassment claim against him.
