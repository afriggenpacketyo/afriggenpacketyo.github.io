        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed a memorandum aimed at tightening regulations on direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertisements, including those on social media and digital platforms. The initiative directs the Health and Human Services department and the FDA to enhance transparency and ensure ads accurately convey product risks. While stopping short of an outright ban, the administration plans to issue thousands of warning letters to enforce existing rules, targeting misleading ads that fail to properly disclose side effects. This move follows previous efforts by the administration to rein in pharmaceutical advertising and addresses concerns from physicians about the ads' influence on patient relationships.</p>

          <p>England delivered a commanding performance with a 5-0 win against Serbia in Belgrade, strengthening their position for World Cup qualification. Manager Thomas Tuchel praised the team for their attacking flair and cohesion, a significant improvement from their previous match. The victory was achieved without key players like Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka, allowing rising talents such as Noni Madueke and Morgan Rogers to shine and score their first international goals. The decisive win silenced the typically hostile Serbian crowd and provided Tuchel with positive selection challenges as England continues its successful competitive streak.</p>

          <p>New York Giants starting quarterback Russell Wilson has affirmed his commitment to leading the team, even as rookie Jaxson Dart gains attention on the depth chart. Wilson, a 14-year NFL veteran, acknowledged Dart's work ethic but emphasized that his primary goal is to secure daily wins for the Giants. Despite a strong preseason from Dart, who earned the backup role, head coach Brian Daboll has confirmed that Wilson will remain the starter for the upcoming game against the Dallas Cowboys. The situation draws parallels to Wilson's own rookie season when he famously won the starting job over a veteran quarterback in Seattle.</p>

Despite narrowly missing quarterly earnings and revenue estimates, the company reported its remaining performance obligations skyrocketed to $455 billion, largely due to new multi-billion dollar deals, including one with OpenAI. Chairman Larry Ellison highlighted the increasing demand for AI, stating he now deals directly with CEOs and heads of state. The company projected its cloud infrastructure revenue will grow exponentially, aiming to reach $144 billion annually within five years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australian regulators have approved a groundbreaking vaccine developed by scientists at the University of the Sunshine Coast to protect endangered koalas from chlamydia. The disease, which can cause blindness, infertility, and death, is a primary driver of population decline, with infection rates reaching 70% in some colonies. After more than a decade of research and successful clinical trials, the single-dose vaccine has been shown to reduce mortality by at least 65%. Researchers are now seeking funding for a national rollout to wildlife hospitals and clinics, offering a critical tool to save the iconic species from extinction.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Researchers Develop 'Brain-Like' AI That Runs on Domestic Chip Technology</h2>

          <p>Scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences have developed a new AI model, SpikingBrain 1.0, designed to mimic the human brain's efficiency by only activating necessary neurons. This innovative approach allows the model to learn from less than 2% of the training data required by conventional systems and process long texts up to 100 times faster. Crucially, the system operates entirely on China's homegrown MetaX chip platform, representing a strategic advancement in the country's efforts to build an independent AI ecosystem. This development is particularly significant as the U.S. continues to tighten export controls on advanced AI hardware like Nvidia's GPUs.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Friar, issued a stark warning at a Goldman Sachs conference, stating that companies and professionals not adopting artificial intelligence quickly enough will "get left behind." She emphasized that the biggest competitive threat comes from individuals and businesses that are deeply integrating AI into their operations to disrupt established industries. Her comments come as OpenAI significantly increases its spending to develop its AI models, reportedly tripling its revenue to $13 billion this year. Friar also highlighted the immense demand for computing power as a major constraint, prompting partnerships with Oracle and others beyond Microsoft. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel has announced it is suspending its restaurant remodeling plans, caving to customer pressure just weeks after reversing a controversial logo change. The southern-style restaurant chain had faced intense criticism from conservatives for its modernization efforts, which included a minimalist logo and more contemporary interior designs. After reinstating its classic "Old Timer" logo following public outcry, the company confirmed it will also halt the interior redesigns. In a statement, Cracker Barrel acknowledged that customers did not feel the modern look reflected what they love about the brand and reassured them that its vintage Americana aesthetic is "Here to Stay."</p>
