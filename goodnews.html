        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government has announced that free school meals will be extended to an additional 500,000 pupils in England starting September 2026. This change will allow any child whose parents receive Universal Credit to qualify, regardless of their household income, saving parents ¬£500 a year and potentially lifting 100,000 children out of poverty. The Department for Education has allocated ¬£1 billion to fund this initiative until 2029, alongside ¬£13 million for food charities to combat food poverty by redistributing food from farms. While welcomed by the education sector and anti-poverty organizations, some critics argue that other measures, like lifting the two-child benefit cap, would be more cost-effective in reducing child poverty. The government is expected to announce its decision on the two-child benefit cap in the autumn when it publishes its child poverty strategy. </p>

          <p>The UK's medicines regulator, the MHRA, has issued a warning to women using weight-loss jabs, stating that these medications may affect the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. It is believed that the jabs can interfere with the absorption of the pill due to common side effects like vomiting and diarrhea, or because they slow the emptying of the stomach. The MHRA advises women to use effective contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterwards before trying to become pregnant. The agency has received reports relating to unintended pregnancies made to its Yellow Card scheme, prompting concerns about the safe use of these popular medications.</p>

The evacuation included homes, hotels, schools, a hospital, nursing homes, museums, office buildings, and the Messe/Deutz train station.

Despite the weighty topics, Merz's spokesman said the chancellor was looking forward to his first in-person meeting with Trump with calmness and joy. The meeting also comes amid concerns about support in Trump's circle for the far-right German party Alternative for Germany (AfD), which has been declared "right-wing extremist" by Germany's domestic intelligence agency. Merz has dismissed these criticisms as absurd observations from Washington and urged the American government to stay out of German domestic politics.</p>

Over the last several years, the Utah Lake Authority and its partners have eliminated over 60% of the carp biomass in Utah Lake. The Utah Lake Authority has used methods such as hiring commercial fishermen and traps with cameras and sensors to control the carp population.</p>

          <p>The charity Thin Blue Paw is advocating for pensions for retired police dogs to help cover their often complicated medical needs. Many of these dogs face chronic health issues and injuries from their service, which can lead to high veterinary costs. Each year, 50 to 70 dogs retire and are adopted by members of the public or their former handler, but the financial burden can be significant. The charity estimates that adopting a retired police dog costs an average of ¬£3,000 more a year compared with taking on an equivalent dog.</p>
