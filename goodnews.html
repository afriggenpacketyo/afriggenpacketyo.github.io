          <p>The UK government plans to move thousands of civil servant jobs out of London to save money and distribute government roles across the country. The aim is to reduce the number of roles in London by 12,000 and close 11 offices, saving ¬£94m annually by 2032. New government campuses will be established in Manchester and Aberdeen, with additional roles created in other cities. The government aims for 50% of senior civil servants to be located in regional offices by 2030, expecting to bring ¬£729m to the local economy.
