          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced an agreement to establish a Qatari Emiri Air Force facility at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho, allowing Qatari pilots to train with American military personnel. This move aims to enhance combined training, increase lethality, and improve interoperability between the two nations, deepening the US-Qatar relationship. The announcement faced backlash from some right-wing activists and a past comment from President Trump regarding Qatar's alleged terrorism funding resurfaced, though Hegseth later clarified Qatar would not have its own base. The facility is part of a broader strengthening of ties, including a recent US executive order assuring Qatar's security and a gift of a Boeing 747 jet from the Qatari royal family.</p>

          <p>The US Men's National Team secured a 1-1 draw against Ecuador in Austin, Texas, with Folarin Balogun scoring the equalizer in the 71st minute. Despite controlling much of the game and displaying improved performance, the US team felt they deserved more from the match. Coach Mauricio Pochettino reiterated that immediate results are less important than preparation for the 2026 World Cup. The team demonstrated comfort in a three-man backline formation, creating promising attacking moves, and Balogun's goal marked his second consecutive appearance with a score, solidifying his role as starting striker.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced that Britain is prepared to utilize the entire value of frozen Russian assets, totaling over £25bn, to support Ukraine's war effort. This decisive action, coordinated with France, Germany, and the US, aims to intensify pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin and compel a return to the negotiation table. Previously, only profits and interest from these assets were used, but the new commitment signifies a stronger stance. The move comes amidst renewed Russian missile and drone strikes across Ukraine, causing power cuts and casualties, and follows similar calls from US President Trump for G7 allies to seize Russian assets.</p>

          <p>Senior US officials have provided a detailed timeline outlining the monthslong diplomatic efforts that culminated in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and the first phase of President Trump's peace plan. The agreement involves Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of Gaza, a 72-hour countdown for Hamas to release remaining Israeli hostages, and Israel's release of Palestinian prisoners, alongside humanitarian aid for Gaza. Key moments included Hamas accepting a new proposal in August, intensive "wordsmithing" by US envoys with Qatari officials, and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's apology to Qatar for a past airstrike. The negotiations, described as comprehensive and trust-building, led to a two-phase deal aiming for an "almost permanent ceasefire."</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a deal with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca to offer discounted prescription drugs to Medicaid patients at "most-favored-nation" prices, matching the lowest rates in other high-income countries. AstraZeneca will also list primary care medications on the new government website, TrumpRx, offering up to 80% discounts for eligible patients. This follows a similar agreement with Pfizer, as the administration pressures drugmakers to reduce prices and invest in US manufacturing to avoid tariffs. Experts, however, caution that the impact on Medicaid patients may be muted due to existing "best price" protections and that TrumpRx might primarily serve as a branding opportunity.

Despite undergoing surgery for bleeding and a small break, Quaker was deemed unable to return to duty, unlike the other four horses.

          <p>Apple is in advanced discussions to acquire key talent and technology from computer vision startup Prompt AI, a move aimed at bolstering its AI research and development. Prompt AI, an 11-person company, had raised a $5 million seed round and developed the Seemour app, which enhances home security cameras with sophisticated detection capabilities. While the technology was effective, the business model proved unsustainable, leading to the app's retirement. This "acqui-hire" reflects Apple's strategy of acquiring smaller teams for talent and technology integration, likely for its HomeKit division, amidst criticisms of its relatively slow progress in generative AI.</p>
