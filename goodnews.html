          <p>Hamas has indicated a "positive response" to the latest ceasefire framework proposed by mediators, expressing readiness for immediate negotiations. The development follows President Trump's announcement of an Israeli-agreed two-month ceasefire, a statement neither side had initially confirmed. While Trump expressed optimism for a deal, Israeli sources indicated support but no firm commitment yet, and Palestinian officials noted Hamas's insistence on guarantees for an Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war. The ongoing conflict has resulted in over 57,000 Palestinian deaths, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.</p>

          <p>Trinidad and Tobago has bestowed its highest civilian award, the Order of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, upon Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This marks the first time a foreign leader has received the honor, symbolizing the deep friendship between the two nations. The visit focused on strengthening bilateral ties in sectors like energy, health, and security, building on a historical connection that began with Indian indentured laborers in the 19th century. During his visit, Modi also announced that sixth-generation citizens of Indian origin in the nation would now be eligible for Overseas Citizen of India cards.</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles Dodgers to Maintain Trade Strategy Despite Max Muncy's Knee Injury</h2>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers do not plan to alter their trade deadline strategy despite a knee injury to third baseman Max Muncy, who is expected to miss about six weeks. Initial fears of a season-ending injury were allayed when tests revealed only a bone bruise with no ligament damage. The team's management expressed relief and confidence that Muncy will return with more than a month remaining before the playoffs. In the interim, the Dodgers will rely on internal options like Tommy Edman, Kiké Hernández, and Miguel Rojas to cover the third base position.</p>

          <p>Several beaches in the Rockaway peninsula in Queens, New York, were temporarily closed on the Fourth of July after multiple shark sightings occurred dangerously close to shore. Officials used drone technology to monitor the sharks' activity and ensure the safety of beachgoers, reopening the waters after about an hour. The incidents occurred just days after New York's governor announced enhanced shark surveillance measures for the holiday weekend at state beaches, particularly on Long Island. The city's emergency management and public safety departments coordinated the response to keep the public informed and safe.</p>

          <p>South Korea's new presidential administration is planning to bolster its shipbuilding sector, which it describes as being in a "major crisis," as the U.S. increases pressure on China's industry. President Lee Jae-myung has campaigned on creating a "maritime power" that leads the world. While specific policies are still forthcoming, government guidelines focus on developing advanced, eco-friendly, and autonomous vessels through improved technology and better working conditions. This strategic push aims to reclaim a leading position in the global shipbuilding market by focusing on innovation and high-value production.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu expressed disappointment but also a sense of progress after her third-round loss to world number one Aryna Sabalenka at Wimbledon. Though she lost in straight sets, the former US Open champion pushed the top seed in a competitive match, a performance she feels demonstrates she is closing the gap with the sport's elite. Raducanu, who has struggled with injuries and form, noted the display gives her motivation and proves she is moving in the right direction. Sabalenka praised her opponent's performance, predicting Raducanu would soon return to the top 10.</p>

          <p>A couple who moved from Salt Lake City, Utah, to the small town of Justin, Texas, for a career change shared their experience adjusting to a new life. They cite a slower pace of life, a more diverse community, and a stable job schedule as major benefits of the move. However, they were shocked by the high property taxes in Texas, which are three times what they paid in Utah for a smaller home, and noted the different culture and hotter climate. Despite missing the mountains and friends in Utah, the family says they have been welcomed by the community and are happier in their new home.</p>

          <p>A recent public display of emotion by a UK politician has reignited the conversation about crying at work. While some still view it as a sign of weakness or instability that could harm career prospects, many experts and workers argue it is simply a human response. Executive coaches suggest that in modern workplaces, emotional intelligence is increasingly seen as a strength, and employers who show compassion are more likely to have motivated staff. The article shares anecdotes from both men and women who have cried at work due to stress, frustration, or personal issues, highlighting a shift towards accepting emotional expression in professional settings.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates that zooplankton, tiny marine animals, play a far more significant role in mitigating global warming than previously understood. According to the study, these creatures gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the ocean's surface in Antarctica before sinking deep into the ocean to hibernate. This process, known as the seasonal vertical migration pump, effectively locks away vast amounts of carbon from the atmosphere, equivalent to the annual emissions of about 55 million cars. This discovery forces a reassessment of the Southern Ocean's carbon storage capacity and highlights the importance of these overlooked "unsung heroes" of the marine ecosystem.</p>

          <p>An Arizona-based economics professor, Dr. Bishara Bahbah, has emerged as a key backchannel negotiator between Hamas and the Trump administration. After being contacted by Hamas in April due to his connections as president of "Arab-Americans for Trump," he has been working from Qatar to facilitate communication. Dr. Bahbah's involvement, which he claims was instrumental in the release of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, represents an unconventional diplomatic effort. This unique channel operates alongside official Qatari mediation, highlighting the complex and multi-layered efforts to secure a permanent ceasefire and hostage release.</p>

          <p>At the Chester Zoo in the United Kingdom, a same-sex pair of male Humboldt penguins named Scampi and Flounder are successfully raising a chick. Zoo experts gave the pair one of two eggs laid by another penguin couple to increase the chances of both chicks surviving. This practice is part of the zoo's efforts to support the population of Humboldt penguins, which are listed as a vulnerable species. While this is the first chick for Scampi and Flounder, same-sex penguin parenting has been observed in other zoos, with both parents typically sharing incubating, feeding, and parenting duties.</p>

          <p>Germany began its Women's Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory over Poland, thanks to goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. While the win was deserved, the team's performance was marred by wastefulness in front of goal and a significant injury concern. Captain Giulia Gwinn left the field in tears during the first half with an apparent knee injury, a major blow for the eight-time champions given her history of two previous ACL tears. The extent of the injury is not yet known, casting a shadow over the team's otherwise successful start to the tournament as they prepare to face tougher group stage opponents.</p>
