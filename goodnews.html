        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The World Trade Organization has increased its global trade volume growth forecast for 2025 to 2.4%, a significant rise from its previous 0.9% estimate. This growth is attributed to strong U.S. import demand ahead of tariff hikes and a surge in demand for AI-related goods, particularly from Asia. However, the WTO has sharply downgraded its outlook for 2026, cutting the expected growth from 1.8% to just 0.5%, citing a cooling global economy and the delayed impact of trade tariffs. The organization warns that trade-restrictive measures and policy uncertainty remain key downside risks for the global economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the second quarter of 2025, real estate investors purchased one-third of all single-family homes sold in the U.S., marking the highest share in five years, according to a report from CJ Patrick Co. While the overall number of homes bought by investors decreased compared to last year, their market share grew due to a weaker overall sales market. Small investors, owning ten or fewer properties, continue to dominate the market, while large institutional investors have been selling more homes than they buy for six consecutive quarters. This trend is adding much-needed inventory for both renters and traditional homebuyers. (not investment advice)</p>

The former couple, who finalized their divorce in August 2024, posed for photos together in a friendly display. During the event, Lopez publicly thanked Affleck for his essential role in getting the movie made. Affleck had previously praised her performance in the film, calling her "amazing." The reunion comes after Lopez described the period of filming while their marriage was ending as both the best and worst time of her life.</p>

          <p>Qualcomm has announced its acquisition of Arduino, an Italian company known for its inexpensive and popular programmable circuit boards used widely in robotics prototyping. The move is a strategic effort by Qualcomm to connect with the developer and startup community at the grassroots level of the hardware and robotics industry. By integrating its own powerful chips into Arduino's accessible platforms, Qualcomm aims to foster loyalty among innovators who may later become commercial customers. This acquisition is part of Qualcomm's broader strategy to diversify its revenue streams beyond the slowing smartphone market and compete with rivals like Nvidia in the growing robotics and IoT sectors.</p>

          <p>The Nobel Prize in Physics has been jointly awarded to John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret, and John M. Martinis for their pioneering experiments in quantum mechanics. Their work in the 1980s on electrical circuits demonstrated macroscopic quantum phenomena like tunneling, which has become a fundamental basis for developing modern quantum computers.

          <p>Alternative asset manager Ares Management has increased its three-year fundraising targets by 25%, driven by unexpectedly strong demand from individual wealthy investors. CEO Michael Arougheti noted that this "retail revolution" is a key growth area, with Ares already managing over $50 billion from retail-focused vehicles. Arougheti pushed back against concerns that retail investors receive lower-quality deals, stating that Ares allocates investments based on available capital across both institutional and wealth platforms. He believes individual investors are turning to alternatives like private equity and real estate for diversification that is increasingly difficult to achieve in concentrated public markets.

          <p>Shares of Canadian minerals explorer Trilogy Metals skyrocketed in premarket trading after the White House announced it was taking a 10% stake in the company through a $35.6 million investment. The partnership is part of a U.S. initiative to develop domestic sources of critical minerals, such as copper and cobalt, located in Alaska's Ambler mining district. This move reverses a previous administration's rejection of the Ambler Road project, signaling a renewed federal commitment to resource development. The project aims to secure domestic supply chains for minerals essential for energy, defense, and manufacturing, though it faces opposition over environmental concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Laura Modi, co-founder and CEO of infant formula startup Bobbie, is working to disrupt the U.S. market, which has long been dominated by a few major companies like Abbott and Reckitt. Inspired by her own frustrating experience as a new mother, Modi launched Bobbie in 2018 to offer a higher-quality, direct-to-consumer product and change the culture around formula feeding. The company has gained significant traction, especially following the 2022 nationwide formula shortage that highlighted the risks of market concentration. Bobbie focuses on product innovation, such as its USDA Organic Whole Milk formula, and mission-driven marketing that advocates for issues like paid family leave.</p>

          <p>For homeowners seeking financing, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become a more affordable option due to recent declines in interest rates. A $75,000 HELOC now carries an approximate monthly payment of $712 for a 15-year term, down from around $777 in the summer of 2024 when rates were higher. With the Federal Reserve having cut rates and more cuts anticipated, the variable rate of a HELOC makes it an attractive borrowing tool, as payments could decrease further without the need for refinancing.

Overall holiday travel continues to rebound toward pre-pandemic levels, with Spain remaining the top international destination for UK travelers. While the travel industry sees AI as both an opportunity and a challenge, most consumers are not yet comfortable handing over full control of their booking to the technology.</p>

The company, known for its distinctive R1T pickup and R1S SUV, built its brand around outdoor adventure, a theme reflected in its unique design choices, including its controversial but iconic headlights. In a rare look inside its California design lab, Chief Design Officer Jeff Hammoud explained the process of creating the new, more affordable models through "subtraction" while retaining the brand's core ethos. The R2 is expected to start production by the end of the year at Rivian's Illinois factory.</p>

          <p>Michaela Del Barrio, a 37-year-old mother with a family history of breast cancer, was diagnosed with the disease after insisting on early screening. Despite being told she was too young for a mammogram, her persistence led her to a high-risk clinic, where a breast MRI detected two suspicious masses that were confirmed to be early-stage invasive ductal carcinoma. Her case highlights the importance of self-advocacy and understanding personal risk factors, especially as breast cancer rates are rising in women under 50. Thanks to the early detection, her prognosis is excellent, and her oncologist credits her awareness with preventing a much more advanced diagnosis.</p>

          <p>A new study in Uganda has found that treating baby wraps with insecticide can dramatically reduce malaria infections in young children. The randomized controlled trial showed a 65% reduction in malaria cases among babies carried in permethrin-soaked wraps compared to a control group. This simple, low-cost intervention is inspired by the U.S. military's practice of treating uniforms to repel mosquitoes. Researchers believe this method could be a critical new tool in the fight against malaria, which kills a child under five nearly every minute in sub-Saharan Africa, by providing protection during daytime hours when bed nets are not in use.</p>

However, the progress is uneven, with developing nations like China and India driving the clean energy expansion. In contrast, the U.S. and the EU saw an increased reliance on fossil fuels during the same period due to factors like higher demand and poor wind performance.</p>
