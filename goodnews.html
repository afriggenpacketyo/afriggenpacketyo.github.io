          <p>The White House has confirmed that Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to a future meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to advance peace negotiations. President Trump, who spoke with both leaders separately, indicated he wants them to meet first before potentially joining a trilateral summit to finalize a deal. This development follows Trump's recent diplomatic push to end the war, although Russian officials have publicly stated that any such high-level summit must be prepared with extreme care. The direct confirmation from the White House marks a significant step in the ongoing diplomatic process.</p>

Home to 3,800 biopharma companies, Suzhou is offering significant subsidies to attract top-tier international firms and aims to host over 10,000 companies by 2030. As part of this strategic push, local institutions like Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University have partnered with the government to create specialized academies to train future leaders in drug innovation. This initiative reflects China's broader goal of becoming a global leader in scientific research and development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece argues that China's commemoration of the 80th anniversary of its victory over Japan in World War II should be understood as an act of historical remembrance, not an effort to incite hatred. The author contends that remembering the brutality of the Japanese invasion is about reflecting on truth and sacrifice, not dictating modern feelings. The article suggests that it is possible for Chinese citizens to condemn the actions of wartime Japan while simultaneously appreciating modern Japanese culture, which has been influential in China for decades. This distinction separates historical reflection from cultivated hostility.</p>

          <p>A Chinese national, Shenghua Wen, has been sentenced to eight years in a U.S. prison for illegally exporting firearms and military-related items to North Korea. According to the Justice Department, Wen was directed by North Korean officials to procure the goods in the U.S. and smuggle them via China, receiving $2 million for his efforts. He purchased many of the weapons in Texas and shipped them from California, falsifying export documents to conceal the contents. Wen had overstayed his student visa and remained in the U.S. illegally while carrying out the smuggling operation for Pyongyang.</p>

          <p>President Trump has clarified that the United States will not send ground troops to Ukraine as part of any security arrangement but suggested that air support is a possibility. This statement came after his meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and European leaders, where he emphasized that European nations are willing to provide on-the-ground personnel. While the specifics of potential U.S. air support remain undefined, the commitment is seen as a key component of the security guarantees being negotiated to ensure a durable peace. Planning for a direct summit between the Ukrainian and Russian presidents is reportedly underway.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old Oregon man, Ethan Foltz, has been federally charged for allegedly creating and operating a powerful botnet known as "Rapper Bot." Prosecutors claim the network, comprised of malware-infected devices like routers and DVRs, was used to conduct large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks for hire since at least 2021. The botnet, described as one of the most sophisticated in existence, allegedly targeted victims in over 80 countries, including a U.S. government network. Law enforcement officials disabled the botnet after executing a search warrant at Foltz's home earlier this month.</p>

Draper, in particular, played with aggressive intent, showcasing his readiness after a recent injury layoff. The top-seeded pair of Draper and Pegula later advanced to the semi-finals, emerging as strong contenders for the tournament's $1 million prize.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's stock increased by 3% after the home improvement retailer maintained its full-year financial outlook, despite narrowly missing Wall Street's quarterly earnings and revenue estimates. The company still expects total sales to grow by 2.8% for the year, signaling confidence in the market. Officials noted encouraging signs, including a 2.6% rise in big-ticket transactions and improving sales trends throughout the quarter. While acknowledging a "deferral mindset" among homeowners due to economic uncertainty, the company's performance suggests resilience and continued momentum in its core business categories.

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD has registered a local unit in Argentina, a move that could signal future plans to produce cars in the country. The filing authorizes BYD Auto Argentina not only to import and sell vehicles but also to manufacture them, along with batteries and other parts. While the company has not officially announced a manufacturing plant, it follows BYD's broader regional expansion strategy in Latin America. If realized, this would be BYD's second vehicle factory in the region, complementing its major production base currently under development in Brazil.</p>
