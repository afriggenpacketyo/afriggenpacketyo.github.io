          <p>Manchester United has submitted an improved bid of over ¬£60m for Brentford striker Bryan Mbeumo, following a rejected bid of ¬£45m plus add-ons earlier this month. Talks are set to continue this week for the Cameroon forward, who would become the club's second signing of the summer after Matheus Cunha. New Tottenham manager Thomas Frank also expressed interest in Mbeumo, while other Champions League clubs are also keen on the forward. Mbeumo's Premier League experience is viewed as a major positive, and he scored a career-best 20 goals for Brentford last season.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump demanded that "everyone" keep oil prices down to avoid playing "into the hands of the enemy" amid escalating conflict in the Middle East following U.S. strikes on Iran. He also urged the Department of Energy to increase domestic drilling. The message follows U.S. bombing of Iran's key nuclear sites, raising concerns about potential disruptions to Middle East energy supplies. Crude oil prices closed about 7% lower on Monday after Iran fired missiles at a U.S. airbase in Qatar without causing casualties, signaling investors' hopes for de-escalation.</p>

          <p>Super Micro Computer's shares fell about 10% after the server maker announced plans to offer $2 billion in convertible notes maturing in 2030. The decline is attributed to the potential dilution of existing shareholders' stakes upon conversion to equity. The company plans to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding working capital for growth and business expansion, and will repurchase $200 million of its stock from note issuers. Despite the recent slide, Super Micro shares are still up nearly 40% in 2025, driven by high demand for its AI-optimized infrastructure and a major contract with a Saudi Arabian data center.

Efforts include establishing a common standard for electronic submissions by 2027 and reducing the types of claims subject to prior authorization requests by 2026.
