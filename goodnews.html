          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from using the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to expedite the deportation of Venezuelans alleged to be gang members. The court rejected the administration's claim of a "predatory incursion," a condition required to invoke the wartime statute. Legal advocates have praised the 2-1 decision as a significant victory for the rule of law and a check on the expansion of presidential power.</p>

While high-yield savings accounts currently offer slightly higher rates for most terms, their variable nature means returns could decrease with anticipated Fed rate cuts. In contrast, CDs offer a guaranteed, fixed rate of return, which may provide more security for savers in a cooling rate climate. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, long-term studies of survivors reveal a phenomenon known as post-traumatic growth, where individuals report positive psychological changes following a traumatic event. While many survivors still experience PTSD and depression, a significant percentage also report a greater appreciation for life, improved relationships, and increased personal strength. Researchers found that factors like financial resources, social support, and a sense of self-efficacy were crucial in fostering this growth, offering lessons for disaster recovery efforts.</p>

The company has managed to absorb most tariff costs so far by shifting its supply chain and securing exemptions, but it still incurred significant expenses. With the cost of smartphone components rising globally, a price increase could be attributed to market factors rather than directly to tariffs, potentially by altering storage configurations on new models.</p>
