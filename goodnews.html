          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 08:50:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail companies are utilizing a 'tariff hacking' strategy known as the B2B2C model to lessen the financial impact of the ongoing trade war on consumers. This method involves routing online sales through a middleman company that purchases the goods at a wholesale price, thereby paying a significantly lower U.S. tariff. While this approach has helped brands like Yours Clothing and Tod's Group avoid price hikes, some logistics experts caution that it may be a risky, short-term solution that could face future scrutiny and audits.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping held a crucial phone call to finalize an agreement aimed at preventing a ban on the social media platform TikTok in the United States.

          <p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari has expressed his support for two additional interest rate cuts before the end of the year. He argues that the inflationary impact from President Trump's tariffs is likely a temporary, one-time effect, which provides the central bank with the flexibility to pursue easier monetary policy. This dovish stance comes as the Fed navigates a weakening labor market while inflation remains above its 2% target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article challenges the increasingly common and gloomy projections regarding China's future population decline. The author argues that forecasts predicting a drastic fall in China's population, while the U.S. population is expected to grow, lack clear justification and should be viewed with skepticism. The piece highlights alternative data from Chinese academic institutions which suggest a more moderate demographic shift, urging a more nuanced understanding of the country's long-term societal trajectory.</p>

The author suggests that these sensationalized fantasies of apocalypse or utopia are distractions from the more immediate, practical dangers of current AI technology and primarily serve the interests of tech oligarchs.</p>

By using modern 3D scanning to reconstruct the fossil, researchers determined it belonged to a large, carnivorous theropod from the late Triassic period. This discovery is significant as it challenges the long-held scientific consensus that large predatory dinosaurs did not emerge until the following Jurassic period, reshaping our understanding of dinosaur evolution.</p>
