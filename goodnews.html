          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged seven Chinese nationals in Massachusetts in a multimillion-dollar marijuana trafficking operation that spanned the U.S. Northeast. The organization allegedly used a network of grow houses and smuggled people into the U.S. to work in them to pay off smuggling-related debts. Authorities seized hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, over 240 pounds of marijuana, and luxury items during searches. The case is part of a broader Department of Justice initiative, "Operation Take Back America," aimed at combating transnational criminal organizations.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to become a new hub for global public goods as the United States scales back its international development efforts. The piece contrasts the dismantling of the independent USAID agency in the U.S. with China's launch of the International Organisation for Mediation (IOMed) in Hong Kong. The author suggests that the "America First" policy prioritizes short-term gains over long-term soft power, creating a vacuum that China is eager to fill. Hong Kong's cosmopolitan status could allow it to harness this shift and gain prominence in international cooperation.</p>

          <p>Mandonna “Donna” Kashanian, an Iranian woman who has lived in the U.S. for 47 years, was released from ICE detention following advocacy from Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. Kashanian was detained last month despite having no criminal record and regularly checking in with immigration authorities as required. After a surge of community support and letters from neighbors, Scalise requested that the Department of Homeland Security review her case, leading to her release. Her attorney noted that while her release is a positive outcome, many others in similar situations lack access to political power.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Song Kum Hyok, a member of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau, for his involvement in a scheme that uses IT workers to generate funds for the regime's weapons programs. Song is accused of recruiting North Korean cyber operatives who posed as American remote workers, using stolen U.S. identities to secure jobs at global companies. This sprawling operation allows North Korea to earn hundreds of millions of dollars that are funneled back to support its nuclear and ballistic missile development. The sanctions are part of a broader U.S. effort to disrupt these illicit funding channels.</p>

          <p>With forecasters predicting an above-average hurricane season, more homeowners along the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts are investing in climate-resilient home designs. These homes feature aerodynamic shapes, reinforced roofs, and flood vents to withstand powerful storms, which are becoming stronger due to climate change. One Florida homeowner's round house is rated to withstand 190-mph winds and has already survived six hurricanes. While these designs can cost more upfront, they can lead to long-term savings, such as lower insurance premiums, and provide greater peace of mind in storm-prone areas.</p>

          <p>Bhagavan "Doc" Antle, known for his appearance in the Netflix series "Tiger King," has been sentenced to one year and one day in federal prison. The sentence follows his guilty plea to charges of wildlife trafficking and money laundering. Prosecutors stated Antle was a key player in the illegal trade of endangered animals, including chimpanzees, and laundered over half a million dollars to facilitate these purchases. Despite his lawyers' request for probation, the judge imposed jail time, though it was less than federal guidelines suggested, acknowledging Antle's care for the animals at his zoo.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly expanding its offshore wind capacity, adding over 4.4 gigawatts in the first half of the year, equivalent to its total for all of 2024. A new report from Global Energy Monitor projects China will install at least 9 GW this year, over half of the global total. This surge is driven by strong government support, including subsidies and strategic planning, as part of a broader initiative to develop the country's marine economy. The nation's farthest offshore wind project recently became operational, highlighting China's push to develop a robust domestic industry for deep-sea wind technology.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an Instagram post by TV personality Gemma Collins for illegally promoting a prescription-only weight-loss drug. In the ad for the brand Yazen, Collins claimed she lost two dress sizes using its app and medication. It is illegal to advertise prescription-only medicines to the public, and the ASA ruled that her post breached this code. The ban was part of a broader crackdown by the regulator, which also banned eight other similar adverts from various companies for promoting weight-loss injections and treatments to consumers.</p>
