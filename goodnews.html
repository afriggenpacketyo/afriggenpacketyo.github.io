          <p>UK Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has admitted to underpaying stamp duty tax on a flat she purchased, attributing the error to incorrect legal advice. The issue relates to the sale of her stake in a family home, which involved a complex trust established for her disabled son. Rayner has now contacted tax authorities to settle the amount owed and has referred herself for an investigation by the Prime Minister's standards adviser. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has publicly supported her, while the opposition has called for her dismissal from her roles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average monthly Social Security benefit for retired workers is projected to be $1,976 in 2025, though actual payments can vary significantly based on earnings history and claiming age. While the maximum possible benefit can reach $5,108 for high earners who delay until age 70, many retirees receive amounts closer to $1,000. The article highlights that these benefits alone are often insufficient for a comfortable retirement, suggesting strategies like annuities, reverse mortgages, and part-time work to supplement income. Annual cost-of-living adjustments help benefits keep pace with inflation, but proactive financial planning is crucial. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NBCUniversal has announced its highest-grossing NFL season to date for advertising revenue and has already sold out all commercial spots for Super Bowl LX, which is scheduled for February. The company reports that 90% of its ad inventory for the regular "Sunday Night Football" season is also sold, with major spending from the automotive, insurance, and technology sectors. This success underscores the continued dominance of live sports, particularly the NFL, in attracting significant advertising investment for both traditional broadcast and streaming platforms. The high demand has reportedly pushed the price for a 30-second Super Bowl commercial to as much as $8 million.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan group of House members has introduced new legislation aimed at banning lawmakers, their spouses, and dependent children from trading individual stocks. The bill would require current members to sell all individual stocks within 180 days and new members to do so before being sworn in, with a 10% fine for non-compliance. This renewed effort seeks to address long-standing concerns about potential conflicts of interest and insider trading, gaining momentum with support from House Speaker Mike Johnson, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and President Trump. Despite growing backing, the proposal faces significant opposition from some lawmakers in both chambers.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has advised investors to disregard prevailing market narratives about an impending recession and the necessity for Federal Reserve rate cuts. He argued that with bond yields falling, investors should be buying stocks, not selling them or retreating into recession-resistant assets. His comments came as markets rallied, partly due to a favorable antitrust ruling for Alphabet, which he said was a significant win for the company. Cramer also noted that Salesforce's stock has been disappointing but expressed optimism about its AI product, Agentforce, ahead of the company's earnings report. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has publicly supported an interest rate cut at the central bank's next meeting in September. Waller, considered a potential candidate for Fed chair, argued that action is needed as the labor market can deteriorate quickly, and he believes rates are currently 1.0 to 1.5 percentage points above the neutral level. He suggested that multiple cuts could occur over the next three to six months, with the pace remaining flexible and data-dependent. While declining to comment on President Trump's attempt to fire Governor Lisa Cook, Waller emphasized the critical importance of maintaining the Fed's independence. (not investment advice)</p>

To incentivize this, the company is offering a discounted first-year Prime membership for $14.99 to those affected. Amazon is now directing users to its Amazon Family feature, which allows benefit sharing with one other adult and up to four teens or children who reside in the same household.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has ruled that evidence from advanced DNA testing can be used in the trial of Rex Heuermann, the accused Gilgo Beach serial killer, setting a new precedent for the state's courts. Prosecutors used whole genome sequencing to link hairs found with victims' remains to Heuermann and his family members. This cutting-edge method allows DNA to be extracted from degraded or rootless hair samples, which was previously not possible with standard forensic techniques. The defense has challenged the ruling, arguing the lab that conducted the tests is not licensed in New York, and a decision on that challenge is pending.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces, Henning Otte, has called for the reintroduction of mandatory national service for both men and women. His proposal suggests a year of service that could be fulfilled not only in the military but also in emergency services, cultural institutions, or other volunteer work. This recommendation comes as the German government debates a draft law that currently only proposes voluntary service, with a compulsory questionnaire for young men. Otte argued that the security situation has changed significantly since mandatory service was abolished in 2011, and that the military urgently needs more recruits, particularly women.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers considering a $50,000 certificate of deposit (CD), the "best" rate depends on their financial goals, as higher rates do not always yield the highest returns. Currently, short-term CDs of three to six months offer the highest interest rates, around 4.25% to 4.45%, but their shorter duration limits total earnings. In contrast, longer-term CDs, such as a two-year option, may have a slightly lower rate of around 4.10% but can generate significantly more interest over time due to compounding. Savers must decide whether their priority is securing the highest possible rate or maximizing their overall interest earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

Fans vocally supported the last remaining American man in the tournament, cheering Djokovic's faults and creating a hostile atmosphere. Djokovic openly expressed his frustration to the chair umpire and mocked the crowd before ultimately winning in four sets. Despite the challenging environment, he prevailed by winning key long rallies and saving 11 of 13 break points. His victory extends the drought for an American men's Grand Slam singles champion, which dates back to 2003.</p>

The update was announced to coincide with the release of the second part of the new season of its hit show "Wednesday." This move is part of Netflix's broader strategy to enhance user engagement and capitalize on viral moments, similar to how a dance scene from the show's first season became a social media trend.</p>

          <p>Manchester United and England midfielder Grace Clinton is reportedly close to completing a transfer to rival club Manchester City before the deadline. With only one year left on her contract, United appears willing to sell the promising 22-year-old to avoid losing her on a free transfer next year, a situation that occurred with other high-profile players. In a separate but related move, Manchester City's England midfielder Jess Park is expected to transfer to Manchester United. Park is seen as a high-quality replacement for Clinton, providing United with a strong addition to their squad while allowing the Clinton deal to proceed.</p>
