          <p>The UK and the US have reached a tariff deal that reduces or removes tariffs on some goods traded between the two countries, including cars, steel, and aluminum. While President Trump declared it a "major trade deal," it's actually a narrow agreement reversing some tariffs, requiring further negotiations. Car tariffs have been cut to 10% for up to 100,000 UK cars, while tariffs on steel and aluminum imports have been scrapped, subject to quotas. Pharmaceuticals remain a key unknown, and the UK's digital services tax remains a sticking point, with the US deeming it discriminatory. Food standards will remain the same. Optimism score is based on the increased trade flow between the two countries, despite it not being a comprehensive deal.</p>

          <p>Following the US-UK trade deal, the UK government insists that hormone-treated beef will not enter the UK market, despite concerns from farmers and consumers. The government states that border checks will prevent such beef from entering, ensuring food standards are maintained. The deal allows up to 13,000 metric tonnes of US beef imports tariff-free, while the UK can also sell more beef to the US at lower tariffs. The optimism score is based on the government's assurance and the potential for increased trade, although some concerns remain.</p>

          <p>President Trump signaled a potential willingness to lower tariffs on China, suggesting an 80% tariff "seems right" before trade talks. This conciliatory tone comes as US and Chinese negotiators are set to meet in Switzerland to discuss the ongoing trade war. Wall Street analysts speculate that tariffs may be reduced even further, potentially to 50%-60%.
