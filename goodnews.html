        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is defending a plan to accept a luxury jumbo jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One, calling it 'a gift.' However, Qatari spokespeople are pushing back on the use of the term 'gift,' instead calling it a temporary transfer of an aircraft. This raises legal and ethical questions, particularly concerning the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which restricts gifts from foreign governments. While the White House insists any gift would comply with applicable laws, critics call for investigation into what could be the most valuable gift ever conferred on a president by a foreign government.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is pushing cities to implement bans against homeless encampments, releasing a model ordinance and announcing new funding for treatment and housing. Newsom emphasized the need for cities and counties to take action, stating that the state is providing ample resources to address the crisis. The model ordinance stresses prioritizing shelter and services while allowing local authorities to clear encampments, with Newsom asserting that allowing people to die on the streets is not compassionate. This initiative is supported by $3.3 billion in new Prop 1 funding, as Newsom approaches the end of his term amid speculation about his political future.</p>

          <p>An auction of the Riggio family's art collection at Christie's in New York revealed a cautious art market, with presold objects and quiet bidding. Experts cited economic uncertainty related to President Trump's tariffs as a factor impacting the global art market. While the collection totaled $272 million including fees, it fell short of pre-sale expectations, indicating a shift from the enthusiastic buyer activity seen in 2022. Despite some successful sales, including a Monet painting, the auction highlighted a need for auction houses to work harder in a healthy, but more challenging, market environment.</p>

The Liberal-National coalition suffered a significant defeat in the recent election, attributed to divisive leadership and policies. Ley's appointment comes as Anthony Albanese was sworn in as Prime Minister after Labor's landslide victory.

President Bola Tinubu's government implemented reforms including ending petrol subsidies and devaluing the naira, but these have led to a cost-of-living crisis.

          <h2>Federal Railroad Administration Considers Elon Musk's Boring Company for Amtrak Project</h2>

          <p>The Federal Railroad Administration is consulting with Elon Musk's Boring Company to assess the costs and progress of the Frederick Douglass Tunnel program, an Amtrak project connecting Baltimore to Washington. The project's estimated cost has increased to $8.5 billion, prompting the FRA to seek ways to build the tunnel more efficiently. The talks have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, given Musk's role as an advisor to President Trump and his ownership of companies regulated by federal agencies. Musk has previously criticized Amtrak and promoted his own transportation ideas.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) did not release its annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions report, but the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) obtained and published the data. The report, which examines greenhouse gas data from 1990-2023, found that the U.S. has reduced its gross greenhouse gas emissions by about 17% since 2005. Carbon dioxide, primarily from burning fossil fuels, made up most of the greenhouse gas emissions in 2023. The transportation sector is responsible for the most carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels, producing 39%, and the electric power sector was second with 31%, according to the report.</p>

          <h2>Trump Invokes Golfing Analogy to Justify Accepting Qatari Plane</h2>

          <p>President Trump defended his plan to accept a $400 million plane from Qatar for use as Air Force One, invoking a golfing analogy to dismiss ethical concerns. He likened the situation to a golfer accepting a 'gimme' putt, arguing that it would be foolish to refuse such a gift. This justification reflects Trump's broader view of ethical matters, as his family engages in various business deals with foreign entities. Critics point to potential conflicts of interest, but Trump maintains he would be 'stupid' to turn down the Qatari plane.</p>
