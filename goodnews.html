        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Walmart has announced a plan to eliminate synthetic dyes and 30 other additives, such as artificial sweeteners and preservatives, from its private-label food products by 2027. This change will impact approximately 1,000 items, primarily under the Great Value brand, responding to consumer demand for simpler and more transparent ingredients. The move is seen by consumer advocates as a significant step that could influence the broader food market, given Walmart's massive scale and customer base. This decision aligns with similar initiatives by other major food manufacturers and increasing federal scrutiny on food additives.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is reportedly in the final stages of a deal to acquire Occidental Petroleum's petrochemical division, OxyChem, for approximately $10 billion. This potential acquisition would mark Berkshire's largest since its 2022 purchase of Alleghany and would utilize a portion of its record $344 billion cash reserve. The move comes as Buffett prepares to step down as CEO, with his successor, Greg Abel, having deep expertise in the energy sector. Berkshire already holds a significant 28.2% stake in Occidental Petroleum, a position Buffett began building in 2022.</p>

          <p>Neptune Insurance Holdings, the largest private flood insurance provider in the U.S., has launched its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, a debut that coincides with the federal government shutdown. The timing is notable because the shutdown has halted the operations of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), preventing it from processing new applications and potentially delaying real estate closings. Neptune's CEO highlighted that the company remains open for business, offering an alternative for homeowners requiring flood insurance. The company utilizes advanced AI to assess risk, distinguishing its model from the government's broader approach.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details a decision by Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust to sell 300 shares of Bristol Myers Squibb, reducing its holding in the pharmaceutical company. The sale capitalizes on a recent relief rally in drug stocks following a deal between Pfizer and the Trump administration on drug pricing, which has eased investor concerns. The author explains the rationale for trimming Bristol Myers over Eli Lilly, citing it as more of a "show-me story" dependent on uncertain drug trial outcomes. The move also aims to raise cash to invest in what are perceived as stronger opportunities, such as Boeing and Nike. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>General Motors and Ford both reported an approximate 8% increase in their third-quarter U.S. auto sales, largely driven by a surge in demand for electric vehicles. The strong performance was fueled by consumers rushing to purchase EVs before the expiration of a $7,500 federal tax incentive at the end of September. Both automakers, along with Hyundai, announced record quarterly sales of their all-electric models, with GM's EV sales more than doubling compared to the previous year. This trend helped the overall industry achieve a higher-than-expected sales pace for the quarter, with EVs reaching a record market share.</p>

          <p>A team of volunteers in Woodbridge, England, including a former U.S. Navy submariner, is meticulously rebuilding a full-scale replica of the historic Sutton Hoo longship. The original 7th-century vessel, believed to be the burial ship of an Anglo-Saxon king, was discovered nearly a century ago and is one of Britain's most significant archaeological finds. The reconstruction project aims for historical accuracy, using the same tools and methods as the original builders, from hand-crafting planks to forging iron nails. The ambitious goal is to make the 90-foot ship seaworthy by its planned completion in 2027.</p>

          <p>The UK government has mandated that all general practitioner practices in England must provide online appointment booking services throughout the workday, from 8:00 AM to 6:30 PM. This new requirement aims to eliminate the "8am scramble" where patients overwhelm phone lines seeking appointments. While the government argues this will modernize the NHS and improve access, the British Medical Association has opposed the move, warning of a potential "online triage tsunami" that could overwhelm practices without proper safeguards. The change is part of a broader push to digitize NHS services and improve patient convenience.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has agreed to offer significant discounts on some of its prescription drugs for American consumers and provide medications to Medicaid at lower prices. The agreement was motivated by the administration's threat of 100% tariffs on drugs manufactured abroad, with Pfizer receiving a three-year grace period in exchange for moving more production to the U.S. The discounted drugs will reportedly be available through a new government-operated website to be called "TrumpRx." This deal is part of a broader White House initiative to align U.S. drug prices with the lower costs paid in other developed nations.</p>

          <p>A major oil workers' union in Nigeria, PENGASSAN, has called off its two-day strike at the Dangote refinery, Africa's largest, following a meeting with company management and government officials. The dispute began after the union accused the company of firing 800 unionized workers and replacing them with foreign labor, a claim Dangote refuted by stating the dismissals were part of a reorganization. Under the agreement, the company will work to reassign the disengaged staff to other positions within the Dangote Group without any loss of pay.
