          <p>A TikTok trend suggests that a McDonald's Coca-Cola and fries combination, dubbed the 'McMigraine,' can alleviate headache symptoms. Doctors note that the caffeine and carbonation in Coke, along with the sodium and carbohydrates in fries, may provide temporary relief by constricting blood vessels, settling the stomach, and correcting electrolyte imbalances. However, they caution that this is not a cure and may worsen migraines for some individuals, recommending hydration and alternatives like matcha or green tea. The article emphasizes the importance of understanding personal migraine triggers and seeking professional medical advice.</p>
