          <p>A major power outage struck Cannes and its surrounding areas on the final day of the Cannes Film Festival, affecting 160,000 homes due to a fire at a substation. Police suspect arson as the cause, but a connection to the film festival is unconfirmed. The festival organizers switched to an alternative power supply, ensuring the closing ceremony proceeded as planned, although morning screenings were briefly interrupted. The incident caused traffic disruptions and shop closures in the resort town, with teams working to restore the network; the cause of the pylon falling is still being investigated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is weighing the possibility of returning Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to the public market, potentially ending 17 years of federal conservatorship. This move has garnered support from investors like Bill Ackman, who believes it could benefit taxpayers and the housing market. Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, express concerns that it could drive up housing prices. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play a crucial role in the U.S. mortgage market by guaranteeing trillions of dollars worth of mortgages, and their privatization could have significant implications for homebuyers and investors (not investment advice).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece on Fox News alleges that broadcast networks exhibit bias in their coverage of political books, favoring negative "tell-all" books about Trump while downplaying similar books about Democrats. The article cites examples from 2018, when ABC, CBS, and NBC dedicated significant airtime to Michael Wolff's "Fire and Fury" and Omarosa Manigault-Newman's "Unhinged." The author contrasts this with the limited coverage of Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's book about Biden, suggesting the networks actively promoted a favorable narrative during Biden's presidency. The piece claims networks downplayed concerns about Biden's fitness, reflecting a broader pattern of biased reporting.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a significant breakthrough in underwater communication, successfully transmitting acoustic data across 600km of ocean with zero errors. The project, led by Professor He Chengbing at Northwestern Polytechnical University, developed a self-tuning system capable of mapping signal clusters in noisy environments without prior knowledge of seabed topography. This advancement has profound implications for both civilian and military applications, potentially enabling reliable long-range undersea messaging for tasks such as coordinating underwater drones.</p>

Austin has increased investment in homeless services after diverting funds from the police budget. While backlash followed the 2020 protests, these initiatives demonstrate a shift towards reimagining public safety and addressing community needs beyond traditional policing.</p>
