          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller indicated that the central bank might consider lowering interest rates as early as July, contingent on inflation remaining under control. In a CNBC interview, Waller stated that the Fed should move slowly to ease rates to avoid a potential slowdown in the labor market. He emphasized the importance of acting preemptively rather than waiting for a significant economic downturn before cutting rates. Waller's comments led to gains in stock market futures, although it remains uncertain whether his position will garner widespread support within the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).

          <p>Tokyo police and prosecutors have apologized to two men for their wrongful arrest and indictment in 2020, related to the suspected unauthorized export of sensitive equipment. The apology follows a high court ruling ordering compensation for Masaaki Okawara and Junji Shimada. The men were arrested and indicted on suspicion of exporting spray dryers that could be used to produce biological agents, but the indictment was later withdrawn. The family of a third man involved, who died during detention, expressed dissatisfaction with the apology.</p>
