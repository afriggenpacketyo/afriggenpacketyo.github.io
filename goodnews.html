          <p>Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) has levied a 530 million euro fine against TikTok for violating the EU's GDPR data protection law by transferring European user data to China. The DPC found that TikTok failed to adequately ensure that the personal data of EEA users accessed by staff in China received an equivalent level of protection as guaranteed within the EU. The regulator has given TikTok six months to bring its data processing into compliance, threatening to suspend transfers to China if this is not achieved. The article notes that TikTok was not immediately available for comment.</p>

          <p>Despite criticism and low approval ratings, Donald Trump's core supporters remain steadfast in their faith, viewing his first 100 days positively. Interviews with Trump fans at a rally in Michigan reveal a belief that he is fulfilling campaign promises, bolstering the economy, and securing the border. They express admiration for Elon Musk's efforts to streamline government and dismiss concerns about Trump's authoritarian tendencies. Supporters contend that any short-term economic pain is a necessary sacrifice for long-term benefits and that Trump is saving the country.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues for the importance of reindustrialization in the United States, citing a recent poll indicating that 80% of Americans believe the country would benefit from more manufacturing jobs. It contends that a strong manufacturing sector is essential for wage growth, economic health, and national self-sufficiency. The author suggests that even unionized service workers benefit from a robust manufacturing sector and that reindustrialization is politically advantageous, potentially winning back working-class voters. The article concludes by highlighting the opportunity to rebuild better than before, learning from the deindustrialization of the past.</p>

          <p>California Secretary of State Shirley N. Weber denounces the SAVE Act, recently approved by the House, as a thinly veiled attempt to disenfranchise millions of voters across the country. Weber argues the act, which aims to prevent nonexistent illegal voting, would disproportionately affect unserved and underserved populations, those who have changed their last names, and military personnel. She asserts that the SAVE Act is Jim Crow 2.0, designed to suppress voter turnout by adding unnecessary documentation requirements. Weber also highlights her partnership with California Attorney General Rob Bonta in a lawsuit against President Trump‚Äôs executive order requiring documentary proof of citizenship on federal mail voter registration forms.</p>

          <p>Following the Eaton fire that destroyed thousands of homes in Altadena, a group of nonprofits are working to prevent gentrification by purchasing burned lots and rebuilding affordable housing for displaced residents. Eshele Williams, who lost her rental home in the fire, is benefiting from this effort, as Neighborhood Housing Services of Los Angeles County purchased her burned lot and plans to build a new home for her. The goal is to keep long-standing community members, particularly Black residents, from being priced out by developers building expensive new houses.

          <p>Euro zone inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in April, according to flash data from Eurostat, missing expectations for a decrease. However, core inflation increased to 2.7%, and services inflation rose to 3.9%. Experts suggest the increase in services inflation is temporary, influenced by Easter timing effects, and expect it to decline later in the year. Despite the mixed data, analysts believe the ECB is likely to consider further interest rate cuts, although caution is advised due to tariff uncertainty. Christine Lagarde, ECB President, stated that the ECB would be "data dependent to the extreme" when making interest rate decisions.</p>
