          <p>European destinations are experiencing a notable increase in tourists from China, with a 13% year-on-year rise recorded in the first half of 2025. According to the European Travel Commission (ETC), this trend is expected to continue, as a recent report found that 72% of Chinese tourists are willing to travel long-haul to the continent. This figure is substantially higher than the global average and surpasses interest from traditionally strong markets like the US and Japan.

          <p>Astronaut Jim Lovell, celebrated for his command of the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97. Lovell famously guided his crew back to Earth safely after an onboard explosion aborted their 1970 moon landing attempt, a crisis that captivated a global television audience. He was also a member of the Apollo 8 crew, making him the first person to journey to the Moon twice, though he never landed on it. NASA and his family remembered him as an optimistic and heroic figure who turned a potential catastrophe into one of space exploration's greatest successes.</p>

          <p>The England women's rugby team, the Red Roses, are preparing for a crucial match against France as a key step in their journey towards the World Cup final. Wing Abby Dow describes the team's mindset as climbing "Everest," an analogy reinforced by a speech from mountaineer Jo Bradshaw. The team is focused on learning from their narrow Six Nations victory over France, where they nearly lost a significant lead. Dow, who has recovered from a hand injury, emphasizes the team's collective focus on peaking at the right time for the tournament, viewing the upcoming match as vital preparation.</p>

          <p>In a highly anticipated duel between two pitching legends, Clayton Kershaw led the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 5-1 victory over Max Scherzer and the Toronto Blue Jays. Both future Hall of Famers delivered strong performances, each pitching six innings, but Kershaw was slightly better, allowing only one run. The key moment came in the fifth inning when Mookie Betts hit a go-ahead, two-run homer off Scherzer. The game was a nostalgic showcase for the two veterans, who continue to pitch effectively for first-place teams late in their careers.</p>

          <h2>US Tariff Threats May Push India Closer to an EU Trade Deal Despite Sanctions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-09 00:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The EU's recent sanctioning of an Indian refinery for processing Russian crude is unlikely to derail long-term EU-India free trade negotiations. Experts suggest the move is largely symbolic and that a greater pressure on India is the US threat of imposing high tariffs on Indian goods. This American pressure could paradoxically benefit the EU by increasing India's desire to diversify its economic partnerships and secure a predictable trade relationship with the bloc. An EU-India deal could be mutually beneficial, providing stability for both amid global economic volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has achieved a significant breakthrough by creating a high-purity hexagonal diamond in a laboratory setting. This rare type of diamond, known as lonsdaleite, was first discovered in a meteorite in 1967 and is believed to form under extreme heat and pressure. While research teams worldwide have attempted to synthesize it, previous efforts resulted in impure or mixed-phase samples. The Chinese team successfully produced pure hexagonal diamond crystals, confirming the material's macroscopic existence and opening new possibilities for its application.</p>

Despite being a fifth-round draft pick and fourth on the depth chart, he was given the start due to injuries and led three touchdown drives, demonstrating significant poise.
