          <p>France is leading a significant investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, aiming to establish a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. Despite the French state becoming the largest shareholder, experts express skepticism about Eutelsat's ability to match Starlink's scale in the near future. Eutelsat's OneWeb constellation has only 650 low-Earth orbit satellites compared to Starlink's more than 7,000, and it faces challenges in replacing aging satellites. Analysts suggest Eutelsat is better positioned to serve specialized government and enterprise markets that prioritize European sovereignty over raw capacity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Quemoy, a group of islands administered by Taipei but located less than 10 kilometers from mainland China, serves as a unique case study in cross-strait relations. Once a heavily militarized front line, the island has transformed into a quiet community caught between two political systems. Despite its history as a symbol of Taipei's governance, the island's unique position reveals the practical limitations of influence for both Beijing and Taipei. Its residents navigate a reality shaped by close proximity to the mainland while being governed from afar, illustrating a complex geopolitical dynamic.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a new ban on smoking in many public areas, including all beaches, parks, and near schools and swimming pools, in an effort to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032. The rules are designed to protect children from passive smoking, which authorities say kills thousands annually. While the ban does not apply to e-cigarettes or the terraces of bars and restaurants, violators could face fines up to ‚Ç¨700. The move comes as France, which has one of Europe's higher smoking rates, sees a gradual decline in tobacco use, supported by high taxes on cigarettes.</p>

Organizers have adopted themes like ‚ÄúRise Up: Pride in Protest‚Äù in response to these challenges.

The legislation, which still faces a final vote and another passage in the House, has exposed deep divisions within the Republican party.

Major retailers will report on their healthy food sales to increase accountability, though no specific targets are being imposed. The policy is part of a broader strategy to improve national health and relieve pressure on the NHS, as data shows obesity rates continue to climb, particularly among children.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave affects the UK, this article explains the science behind the "urban heat island effect," which causes cities to be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. This phenomenon is caused by the prevalence of hard, dark surfaces like roads and buildings that absorb and retain the sun's energy, releasing it slowly as heat. The lack of vegetation and water sources, which provide natural cooling in the countryside, exacerbates the effect. With climate change making heatwaves more frequent and intense, the growing populations of urban centers are expected to bear the brunt of extreme heat.</p>

The initiative teaches children as young as five how to read UV indexes and apply sunscreen, with plans for a nationwide rollout into the curriculum by 2026. Experts emphasize that sunburn in childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma later in life, and educating children early is key to prevention.

Budapest's mayor defied the ban, and the event proceeded peacefully, with many attendees carrying banners mocking Orban and celebrating human rights.

The zoo's director had warned that the proposed budget cuts would harm the visitor experience and strain employees. This marks the first major price increase since 2012, though L.A.
