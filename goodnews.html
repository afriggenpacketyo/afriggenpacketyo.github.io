          <p>The UK is set to experience temperatures of up to 30C on Bank Holiday Monday, marking another warm spell in what is projected to be one of the hottest summers on record. However, this will be short-lived, as the remnants of Hurricane Erin are expected to bring cooler, unsettled weather with wind and rain from Tuesday. Large crowds attending events like Notting Hill Carnival and major music festivals should prepare for travel disruptions due to ongoing rail strikes and engineering works. Prolonged dry periods this summer have already led to hosepipe bans and concerns for a poor harvest, with climate change contributing to more frequent and intense heatwaves.</p>

          <p>An Air Canada flight en route from Toronto to Las Vegas was forced to make an emergency landing at Chicago's O'Hare Airport after a passenger disturbance. The Federal Aviation Administration reported the incident occurred on Friday night, leading to the flight's diversion. Details of the passenger's actions were not provided, but authorities confirmed the situation was resolved without any arrests. The flight subsequently resumed its journey to Las Vegas, arriving three hours behind schedule. This incident contributes to the over 1,000 unruly passenger reports airlines have filed this year, with potential civil penalties reaching $37,000 per violation.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has completed the transfer of England international Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace for a reported £60 million, including add-ons. The 27-year-old forward, a boyhood Arsenal fan, chose to rejoin his former youth club despite Tottenham Hotspur having previously agreed terms with both Palace and Eze. Arsenal's sporting director praised Eze as a "creative and explosive talent," while manager Mikel Arteta highlighted his strong mentality and ambition. Eze shared an emotional farewell message to Crystal Palace fans, expressing gratitude for their support throughout his career, including during his recovery from an Achilles injury.</p>

Other tries came from Leia Brebner-Holden, Evie Gallagher, and Emma Orr, showcasing Scotland's strength in all facets of the game. Wales, who managed only one try, will need to regroup before facing Canada, while Scotland looks to build on this impressive start against Fiji.</p>

          <p>Wall Street experienced a volatile week, ultimately ending with a significant Friday rally after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hinted at potential interest rate cuts. His speech at the Jackson Hole symposium reassured investors, particularly benefiting cyclical, economically sensitive stocks like DuPont and Home Depot, while defensive groups lagged. Although lower rates generally lift all sectors, major tech stocks saw only slight gains, their performance more tied to artificial intelligence advancements than borrowing costs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a new all-time high, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also rallied, with analysts noting consumer discretionary as a leading sector.

          <h2>Racist Berlin Street Name Renamed After Lengthy Legal Battle</h2>

          <p>A central Berlin street, formerly known by a name with overt racist connotations, has been officially renamed Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Strasse after a Black German Enlightenment philosopher. The decision, initially announced in 2020, faced a lawsuit from residents but was upheld by the Higher Administrative Court of Berlin-Brandenburg. The renaming, coinciding with the International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition, addresses decades of lobbying by civil society groups. This change honors Amo, the first Africa-born scholar to receive a European doctorate, and symbolizes a broader movement to decolonize public spaces and acknowledge Black history and resilience in Germany.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has erupted once more, marking its 31st display of molten rock since December, with lava arcing 100 feet into the air within its summit crater. The eruption, contained within Halemaumau Crater, poses no threat to homes, offering a spectacular view for visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain that magma is continuously supplied from a lower chamber, building pressure until it forces out through narrow vents, creating the towering fountains. While the current eruption pattern has featured shorter fountains lately, experts continue to monitor Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, noting its dynamic and unpredictable nature.</p>

          <p>College athletics are undergoing a significant transformation, moving from a casual pastime to a highly professionalized industry, particularly in football and men's basketball, which generate substantial revenue. Recent court decisions now allow athletes to receive compensation from advertisers, fans, and their institutions, fundamentally altering their status and the nature of college-level sports. This shift raises questions about the future of niche sports and the role of athletics in higher education, as discussed in a collection of articles exploring the meaning and implications of these changes. The evolving financial landscape is reshaping both student-athlete careers and the overall collegiate sports experience.</p>

          <p>Restaurateur Tommy Fello, 71, experienced significant recovery from a stroke after receiving the Vivistim System, a new FDA-approved implant that uses vagus nerve stimulation during rehabilitation. After a stroke left him with severe numbness and limited movement in his left side, traditional therapy yielded minor improvements. The Vivistim Therapy system, implanted in a low-risk procedure, delivers gentle pulses to the vagus nerve during exercises, enhancing the brain's neuroplasticity and accelerating motor function recovery. Fello, the first Cleveland Clinic patient to receive it, has made remarkable progress, regaining function and reducing pain, offering new hope for stroke survivors who have plateaued in their rehabilitation.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's choice of attire for his recent White House meeting with President Trump sparked discussion, demonstrating the impact of "wardrobe diplomacy." Following a previous combative meeting where Trump criticized Zelenskyy's casual wear, this time Zelenskyy opted for a black canvas blazer over a collared shirt, conveying a more formal and serious tone. Both Trump and a right-wing reporter, who had previously panned his look, praised the change. This strategic sartorial shift, crafted with a Ukrainian designer, aimed to blend his wartime style with high-stakes diplomacy, contributing to what Zelenskyy described as his "best one" yet with the US president.</p>
