          <p>To encourage more foreign visitors and stimulate its tourism sector, China is relaxing its entry requirements, offering several ways to visit the mainland without a visa. Passport holders from 55 countries can now stay for up to 10 days while transiting through major Chinese cities, a significant extension of previous policies. The government has also been expanding the list of nationalities that can stay for up to 30 days without a visa, with Russian citizens being the latest addition to this program. These measures are designed to lower the barriers of cost and paperwork that have traditionally been associated with obtaining a Chinese visa.</p>

          <h2>England vs. Canada Final Highlights Stark Financial Divide in Women's Rugby</h2>

          <p>The Women's Rugby World Cup final between England and Canada represents more than just a championship match; it's a clash of two vastly different models for supporting women's sports. England's team is the best-funded in the world, with fully professional, contracted players and a robust domestic league, backed by millions in investment from the Rugby Football Union. In contrast, the Canadian team operates on a fraction of that budget, with players earning minimal stipends and the national union relying on fundraising to cover costs. A Canadian victory could challenge the narrative that massive investment is the only path to success, potentially influencing how other nations approach funding women's rugby.</p>

          <p>As England prepares for the Women's Rugby World Cup final, the article highlights the off-field professions of its players, illustrating the sport's recent transition to professionalism. Hooker Amy Cokayne balances her rugby career with her role as a police officer in the Royal Air Force, while veteran Marlie Packer, a member of the 2014 amateur-era winning squad, was a plumber who had to take unpaid leave to compete. Other players recall past jobs as teachers and painters before full-time contracts became available. These stories underscore the dedication required to reach the elite level and the significant changes that have transformed the landscape of women's rugby in England.</p>

          <h2>UK Chancellor Advocates for EU Youth Mobility Scheme to Bolster Economic Forecasts</h2>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is actively promoting an "ambitious" youth migration agreement with the European Union, hoping it will improve the country's economic outlook ahead of the autumn Budget. Reeves argues that a visa exchange scheme for workers aged 18 to 30 would stimulate growth and benefit businesses, and she is urging the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to factor its positive effects into their official forecasts. By getting the OBR to "score" the policy's economic upside, the government hopes to reduce the need for politically difficult spending cuts or tax increases to fill a potential fiscal gap. The proposal faces criticism from conservatives who view it as a partial return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement.</p>

          <p>Director Emerald Fennell, known for "Promising Young Woman" and "Saltburn," is bringing a provocative new vision to her film adaptation of Emily Brontë's "Wuthering Heights." Speaking about the project, Fennell described her goal to capture the "primal, sexual" feeling she experienced when first reading the classic novel as a teenager. The film, starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, has already generated buzz with an erotically charged trailer that suggests a highly stylized and intense gothic interpretation. Fennell explained that she feels a profound connection to the source material, calling it "so sexy, so horrible, so devastating," and aims to translate that raw emotion to the screen.</p>
