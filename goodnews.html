          <h2>Trump-Aligned Legal Group Challenges Federal Hiring Practices Favoring Diversity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 07:30:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The America First Legal Foundation, a group aligned with former President Trump, has filed a federal complaint challenging the Luevano consent decree, which ended merit-based hiring practices for federal government agencies in 1981. The AFL argues that the decree promotes an unfair, race-based hiring system and seeks to restore merit-based evaluations. The lawsuit aims to dismantle what the group calls an illegal effort to promote diversity in federal hiring that sidelines more qualified candidates. This action could reignite debate over race-conscious hiring practices and impact federal agencies already struggling with personnel losses. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new CDC study indicates a dramatic decline in RSV hospitalizations among babies under seven months old, linked to the widespread availability of a maternal RSV vaccine and a monoclonal antibody treatment for infants. Hospitalization rates decreased by as much as 56% compared to pre-pandemic seasons, with newborns experiencing a drop of up to 71%. Emergency physicians have also observed that young children admitted for RSV often require lower levels of care, suggesting the preventatives are effective in reducing the severity of illness. The study underscores the significant public health impact of increased use of RSV prevention products.</p>

          <p>A government minister confirmed that the UK is negotiating a deal with the EU to allow UK passport holders to use EU e-gates at airports, aiming to reduce border queues. The negotiations are ahead of a UK-EU summit in London, with hopes for agreements on youth mobility and lower food prices. However, Conservative MP Alex Burghart expressed concerns that the proposed deal could mean the UK becoming a "rule taker," potentially surrendering sovereignty. The Liberal Democrats advocate for a customs union to further reduce red tape, while Reform UK leader Nigel Farage claims any deal including a youth mobility scheme would betray Brexit.</p>

          <p>Surgeons in Southern California have performed the first human bladder transplant, offering a potentially life-changing procedure for individuals with debilitating bladder conditions. The operation was performed on a 41-year-old man who had lost much of his bladder capacity due to cancer treatments. The doctors plan to conduct bladder transplants in four more patients as part of a clinical trial to assess outcomes and complications before pursuing a larger trial. This advance could provide a better alternative to using bowel tissue for bladder reconstruction, which often leads to complications.</p>

          <p>This New York Times guest essay highlights the story of Desi Arnaz and his efforts to break racial barriers in early television. When CBS intended to transfer Lucille Ball‚Äôs radio show to television, Ball insisted that Arnaz, her husband, play the husband on TV. Network executives resisted because they believed the public would not accept a Latino as the spouse of an all-American girl. The couple undertook a vaudeville tour of major cities around the country, and the positive response from critics and audiences led to CBS agreeing to film a test episode. Arnaz‚Äôs differences became his greatest strengths, breaking new ground in television and making Ricky Ricardo a beloved figure.</p>
