          <p>In a new memoir, singer-songwriter Yusuf Islam, also known as Cat Stevens, discusses his lifelong spiritual journey and complex career. He explains his decision to leave music for nearly 30 years after converting to Islam, a choice influenced by early interpretations of his faith that he later reassessed. Now performing as Yusuf/Cat Stevens, he sees the combined name as a complete picture of his identity, asserting that his songs have always been biographical and remain relevant today.</p>

          <p>A confluence of rising energy demands from data centers and a shift in public perception is fueling a potential renaissance for nuclear power in the U.S. Projects like the reactivation of Michigan's Palisades plant, which will also host new small modular reactors (SMRs), are gaining momentum with support from tech giants and federal loans. While challenges related to cost and regulation remain, a growing number of Americans now see nuclear energy as a viable component of the future power grid. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to psychologist Mark Travers, the most common cause of arguments between couples is not money or chores, but rather the tone of voice used during conversations. Nonverbal cues like a sharp edge or sigh can make a simple question feel like an accusation, escalating tensions more than the words themselves. The article suggests that couples can de-escalate conflicts by becoming self-aware, pausing to rephrase statements made with an unintended harsh tone, and calmly asking a partner to speak differently.</p>

She argues this straightforward, no-cost rule is crucial for protecting sleep, which is vital for the physical and mental health of developing brains. Lack of sleep is linked to numerous negative outcomes, and removing phones at night can significantly improve a child's ability to learn and regulate emotions.</p>

          <p>A JPMorgan report challenges the common retirement savings goal of $1 million, suggesting that most American households can retire comfortably with a smaller nest egg. Using an income-replacement model that includes Social Security, the analysis indicates a household earning $90,000 annually would need around $700,000 by age 65. The report notes that a seven-figure target is typically only necessary for households earning $125,000 or more, but cautions that potential future cuts to Social Security could require higher savings.
