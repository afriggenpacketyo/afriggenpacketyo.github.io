          <p>Nicusor Dan, the liberal, pro-European mayor of Bucharest, was elected president of Romania due to significant support from ethnic Hungarians and Moldovans with dual citizenship. Conservative estimates suggest that over 500,000 of these voters supported Dan, contributing decisively to his victory over hard-right candidate George Simion. The votes from these minority groups were crucial, especially given that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban endorsed Simion, despite his anti-Hungarian stance. This election outcome underscores the importance of minority votes in maintaining liberal democracy in Romania and continuing its Euro-Atlantic trajectory.</p>

          <p>Monarch, a personal finance startup, has successfully raised $75 million in a Series B funding round, valuing the company at $850 million, this is despite a challenging environment for fintech startups. The funding will be used to accelerate subscriber growth, which surged after Intuit shut down its budgeting tool Mint in early 2024. Monarch aims to provide an all-in-one mobile app for tracking spending, investments, and money goals, differentiating itself from Mint by relying on paying subscribers rather than advertising or selling user data.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump announced that Russia and Ukraine had completed a significant prisoner exchange amid their ongoing war, though Ukrainian officials indicated the exchange was still in progress. While Moscow did not immediately confirm the exchange, it represents a rare sign of potential progress in international efforts to halt the conflict. Trump suggested this development "could lead to something big," possibly referring to renewed diplomatic efforts, and this announcement follows recent direct Russia-Ukraine peace talks in Turkey and a phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have identified a new dwarf planet candidate, named 2017 OF201, located far beyond Pluto in the Solar System. The object is estimated to be around 700 kilometers across and has an unusual orbit that extends as far as 1,600 astronomical units from the Sun. Its orbit suggests that there is no giant Planet Nine in the outer Solar System, as simulations show that the presence of Planet Nine would destabilize 2017 OF201's orbit, and the discovery also implies that there are likely many more undiscovered objects in the Kuiper Belt and beyond.</p>

          <p>The article examines the Wages for Housework movement of the 1970s, which advocated for government pay for unpaid domestic labor. The movement sought to provide economic freedom to women and recognize the value of care work, and while it was never mainstream, its ideas offer a counterpoint to current right-wing pronatalist policies. The article draws on Emily Callaci's book, "Wages for Housework: The Feminist Fight Against Unpaid Labor," to explore the movement's goals and challenges, highlighting the importance of providing material support and choice for women.</p>
