          <p>The "Quad" nations‚Äîthe United States, Japan, India, and Australia‚Äîhave announced a new initiative to secure a stable supply of critical minerals essential for modern technology. The move is widely seen as an effort to reduce global reliance on China, which currently dominates the market for these resources. In a joint statement, the group expressed concerns about economic coercion and supply chain disruptions. The announcement came after a meeting of foreign ministers in Washington, D.C., where they emphasized strengthening strategic stability and maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific region.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The ruling prevents the Department of Homeland Security from revoking their legal status and work permits in September, a plan that would have ended protections far ahead of a previously established 2026 deadline. The judge argued that the DHS Secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation in this manner. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision, asserting the executive branch's authority to enforce immigration laws.</p>

          <p>Frederick M. Nicholas, a decorated World War II veteran, attorney, and real estate developer who became a pivotal figure in Los Angeles's cultural landscape, has died at the age of 105.

Nicholas also founded Public Counsel in 1970, which grew to become the largest pro bono law firm in the United States, providing legal aid to vulnerable communities.

          <p>Preliminary government data shows that the number of migrants apprehended for crossing the southern border illegally dropped to a historic low in June, with just over 6,000 recorded apprehensions. This continues an unprecedented decline in illegal immigration that the Trump administration credits to its aggressive deportation policies and enhanced enforcement measures. The figures are a stark contrast to the record highs seen under the previous administration. According to the administration's border czar, no migrants were released into the U.S. for the second consecutive month, a significant shift from prior practices of releasing migrants with court dates.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced Tuesday that Israel has agreed to the terms of a proposal for a 60-day ceasefire in its war with Hamas. In a post on Truth Social, the president urged Hamas to accept the deal, stating it "will not get better" for them. The proposal will reportedly be delivered by mediators from Qatar and Egypt, though neither Israel nor Hamas has publicly commented on the specifics. This development follows previous stalled negotiations and comes as President Trump is scheduled to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week to discuss both Gaza and Iran.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has implemented the nation's most stringent law regulating "forever chemicals," known as PFAS, a move largely credited to the advocacy of Amara Strande. Strande, who died of a rare cancer at age 20, testified before state lawmakers in 2023, linking the public health crisis in her community to PFAS waste from a nearby 3M manufacturing plant. "Amara's Law" will phase out the sale of all nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032. Her family and lawmakers see the landmark legislation as the powerful legacy of a young woman who fought for her community's health even as she faced her own mortality.</p>

Pulisic stated the event was about inspiring the next generation and rediscovering the joy of the game.

The tool allows surgeons to safely and quickly remove metal fragments, even from delicate organs like the heart, through minimally invasive incisions. Developed by a volunteer in response to needs identified by frontline medics, these modern magnetic tools have been distributed to hospitals and field clinics across the country.

Nvidia's rally was driven by the persistent, unrivaled demand for its superior AI semiconductors, overcoming initial concerns about competition and U.S. sales restrictions in China. Cramer suggested Meta's strong performance was fueled by its powerful advertising business, which blew past earnings estimates and allowed it to recover from a broader market dip.

The move could see images like British birds or famous landmarks replacing figures like Winston Churchill. The consultation aims to create designs that serve as a "symbolic representation of our collective national identity," while also being enduring, non-divisive, and incorporating necessary security features.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid's decision to pay a transfer fee for Trent Alexander-Arnold, rather than waiting a month to sign him for free, appears to have been a successful gamble. The club wanted him in time for the Club World Cup, and his performance has already proven valuable. An assist from Alexander-Arnold for a goal by striker Gonzalo Garcia helped secure a win over Juventus, advancing the team and earning the club an extra ¬£10 million in prize money, more than covering the initial fee. The right-back is adapting well to his new team and the tactical system of coach Xabi Alonso, showing promising signs for his future at the club.</p>
