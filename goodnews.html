          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving over three decades for the 1989 killings of their parents. The brothers claim they acted in self-defense due to years of physical and sexual assault. Judge Michael Jesic cited the brothers' efforts to rehabilitate themselves while incarcerated, but emphasized that he was not suggesting their release, leaving their fate in the hands of the parole board and Governor Gavin Newsom. The resentencing followed testimony from family members who believe the brothers have changed, with Erik and Lyle apologizing for their actions and expressing remorse.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are working through the night to advance President Trump's legislative agenda, facing strong opposition from Democrats who accuse them of cutting vital welfare programs like Medicaid. The Energy & Commerce Committee and Ways & Means Committee meetings are expected to last upwards of 20 hours each, with Democrats preparing a barrage of attacks against GOP lawmakers. Tensions arose over Medicaid cuts, with Republicans contending they only seek to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse. Meanwhile, a heated exchange occurred at the Ways & Means Committee over the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, highlighting divisions even within the Republican party, as some representatives threatened to vote against the bill if the cap remains unchanged.

          <p>The future of British television is being debated as US streaming giants gain dominance, with some suggesting mergers among UK broadcasters to compete. Many fear the potential loss of public service broadcasting within a decade or two without a clear survival strategy. Some argue for a single gateway or app for all public service content, possibly under BBC iPlayer, while others emphasize the importance of distinctiveness and competition. The shift to digital-only video on demand by 2035 poses a challenge to British-originated and British-focused TV, with concerns over financial competition and the need to safeguard trusted news and cultural content.</p>

          <p>Jos√© Mujica, the former president of Uruguay known as the world's 'poorest president' for his modest lifestyle, has died at the age of 89. Serving from 2010 to 2015, Mujica was a former guerrilla fighter who championed rural communities and progressive legislation. He refused to live on a presidential estate, choosing instead to live on a farm with his wife, and gave away most of his salary to help build housing for Uruguay's neglected towns. Under his leadership, Uruguay legalized abortion, gay marriage, and marijuana.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump pledged to lift sanctions against Syria and announced a $142bn arms deal with Saudi Arabia during his first major foreign trip. Speaking in Riyadh, Trump lauded the US-Saudi relationship as 'more powerful than ever before' and emphasized the importance of commerce and economic development in the Middle East. Trump was joined by business leaders, including Elon Musk and Sam Altman, who are meeting with Saudi Arabia to increase its artificial intelligence capabilities. Trump also expressed his desire for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, but the crown prince has made it clear that will not happen until there is a permanent end to the war in Gaza and a clear path to Palestinian statehood.</p>
