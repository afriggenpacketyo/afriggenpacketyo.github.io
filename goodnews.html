        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. inflation rose by 0.1% in May, which was less than anticipated, indicating that President Trump's tariffs had not yet significantly impacted inflation. The consumer price index (CPI) showed an annual inflation rate of 2.4%, while core CPI (excluding food and energy) also came in lower than expected. Weakness in energy prices and declines in vehicle and apparel prices contributed to offsetting some increases. Vice President Vance called on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in response to the easing inflation pressures. This article is about finance and the economy (not investment advice). The optimism score is moderate, as benign inflation readings suggest a temporary price shock.</p>

          <p>Vice President Vance has joined President Trump in criticizing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, asserting that the Fed is committing "monetary malpractice" by not cutting interest rates. Vance's comments followed a report indicating that tariffs have not exerted substantial upward pressure on inflation. The statement emphasizes the easing inflation data and a moderating labor market as reasons to lower rates. The FOMC is expected to release its interest rate decision in a week, with markets anticipating a rate cut in September. This article is about finance and the economy (not investment advice). The optimism score is moderate, reflecting a potential shift in monetary policy.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that a trade deal with China "is done," but offered few details. Two days of talks resulted in a "framework" meant to solidify terms of a deal reached in Geneva last month. This situation has moderate optimism due to the potential for improved trade relations between the two countries. The agreement is subject to final approval with himself and China President Xi Jinping, the U.S. president said, adding that he intends to work closely with Xi to open up China to American trade, describing the prospect as "a great WIN for both countries!!!"

          <p>The WTA will protect the ranking of female tennis players who freeze eggs or embryos, allowing them to start a family later without career repercussions. This offer is available to players ranked in the world's top 750 who spend more than 10 weeks out of competition. Sloane Stephens says this rule will reduce pressure on players to return to the court too quickly. She also said that she has twice previously used the off-season to freeze her eggs. The optimism score is high, reflecting positive changes for female athletes' reproductive rights and career flexibility.</p>
