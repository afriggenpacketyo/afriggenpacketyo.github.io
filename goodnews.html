          <p>The debate over women in combat roles has been reignited as the Army implements gender-neutral basic fitness standards for most combat specialties. This decision follows Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's insistence that standards were lowered to accommodate women, a claim disputed by women serving in combat roles. Captain Emelie Vanasse, one of the first women to serve as an Army infantry officer and graduate from Ranger School, shares her experiences and challenges the notion of lowered standards.
