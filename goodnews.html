        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CrowdStrike shares experienced a drop in extended trading after the cybersecurity firm issued a revenue forecast that fell short of expectations. While the company's earnings per share surpassed estimates, revenue remained in line with projections, but costs rose in sales, marketing, research, and development, partly due to a past software outage. For the current quarter, CrowdStrike anticipates adjusted earnings per share of 82 cents to 84 cents on revenue between $1.14 billion and $1.15 billion, which is slightly below analysts' expectations. Despite this, CrowdStrike increased its full-year earnings guidance while maintaining its revenue forecast and also authorized a $1 billion share buyback program. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the emotional impact of the decision, both Kirby and Wiegman respected each other's perspectives.

          <p>A 4-year-old girl from Bakersfield with a rare medical condition has been granted humanitarian protection from deportation, allowing her to continue receiving lifesaving treatment in the United States. The decision came after public outcry and advocacy from dozens of lawmakers, who urged the Department of Homeland Security to reinstate the family's legal protections. The Trump administration had previously rescinded these protections, putting the girl's access to critical medical care at risk. The girl's doctor at Children‚Äôs Hospital Los Angeles stated that she could die within days of losing treatment for short bowel syndrome. </p>

          <p>President Trump is set to waive certain legal requirements, including congressional approval for larger projects, to boost domestic production of critical minerals and weapons. This action applies to the Defense Production Act, which grants the president broad emergency powers during national security emergencies. The waiver aims to expedite projects related to critical minerals, an industry dominated by China. President Biden invoked similar waivers during the COVID-19 pandemic to speed up production of vaccines and medical equipment. </p>
