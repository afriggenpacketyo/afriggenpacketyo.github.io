          <p>A Southern California family has found a grandmother for their twin boys through a Facebook group called Surrogate Grandparents USA, which connects families with seniors seeking grandparent-like roles. The Turner family, feeling a void due to their own parents being distant or deceased, connected with Janet Firestein Daw, who wanted grandchildren her own children were not planning to have. Over two years, "Nana J" has become an integral part of their family, participating in holidays, trips, and daily activities. This arrangement highlights a growing trend of forming unconventional family structures to build intergenerational bonds and create a supportive "village."</p>

The White House is reportedly eager to advance the selection process to replace current Chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May 2026, amid a push for interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy. Bessent reiterated the administration's desire for monetary easing, suggesting that a significant rate cut could boost the housing market and ultimately help control long-term inflation by encouraging more home construction.

          <p>Air Canada announced it will gradually restart flights after reaching a tentative agreement with the union representing its 10,000 flight attendants, ending a strike that began over the weekend. The labor disruption affected approximately 130,000 travelers daily during the peak summer season. A key issue resolved in the new agreement is guaranteed pay for work performed while aircraft are on the ground, a major point of contention for the union. The airline cautioned that a full return to its regular schedule could take a week or more and asked for customer patience as it works to stabilize operations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an inflationary economy, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn returns that can outpace inflation by locking in high interest rates. While national average yields for CDs are modest, top rates from online banks are significantly higher, with some one-year CDs offering yields above 4.30% APY. Financial experts suggest that savers look to online banks, which have lower overhead costs, and consider short-term CDs, as the current inverted yield curve means they often provide better returns than long-term options. Laddering CDs by purchasing them with staggered maturity dates is also a recommended strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Home Depot's stock rose approximately 4% after the company maintained its full-year sales outlook, despite narrowly missing Wall Street's second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations. The retailer anticipates total sales growth of 2.8% for the year, signaling confidence in its performance amid what it calls a "deferral mindset" from homeowners. The company noted encouraging signs, including a 2.6% rise in transactions over $1,000 and improving sales trends throughout the quarter. CFO Richard McPhail stated that the outlook does not factor in potential interest rate cuts, which could further stimulate home improvement spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has issued an emergency regulation to immediately ban the sale of bromazolam, an unregulated synthetic drug known as "designer Xanax." This action classifies the substance as a Schedule 1 controlled substance, empowering law enforcement to arrest individuals for its sale or possession. The move was prompted by a request from Kentucky's attorney general, who is leading a coalition of 21 states urging the DEA to take similar federal action. Bromazolam, which has never been approved for medical use, has been linked to a rising number of overdose deaths, including nearly 50 in Kentucky last year.</p>

Trump emphasized that the two leaders must meet first to establish a baseline for negotiations before he would get involved to finalize a peace deal.

          <p>In response to heightened fear in immigrant communities following a series of ICE raids in Southern California, artists in Los Angeles are organizing fundraisers to provide support. Photographer Thalía Gochez initiated an art show that raised approximately $10,000 for immigrant defense organizations after noticing local street vendors were too afraid to work. Similarly, academic curator Erika Hirugami organized a two-part "Abolish ICE Mercado de Arte," featuring hundreds of artists and raising over $22,500 for various immigrant rights groups. These events demonstrate a growing movement within the local arts scene to use creative expression as a form of mutual aid and solidarity.</p>

          <p>The Human Rights Campaign Foundation and the School Board Integrity Project have published a new guide aimed at helping parents, students, and allies effectively advocate at local school board meetings. The resource, titled "School Boards Matter," was created to counter the organized efforts of far-right groups that have successfully influenced boards to ban books and restrict LGBTQ+ content and discussions on race. The guide provides practical information on understanding board operations, developing talking points, and participating in meetings to promote inclusive and affirming educational environments. Organizers stress the importance of local engagement, as most school board elections are decided by a small fraction of voters.</p>

          <p>According to body language experts, the recent meeting between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy revealed a complex power dynamic communicated through nonverbal cues. Analysts noted that Trump used gestures like a fist pump upon Zelenskyy's arrival and physically guided him, which they interpret as attempts to assert dominance and control. In response, Zelenskyy was observed maintaining his ground, using a two-handed handshake to counter being pulled in, and adopting a composed posture. These interactions suggest a subtle but clear contest for control, with Trump often appearing patronizing while Zelenskyy projected a sense of resistance and composure.</p>

          <p>A happiness expert suggests that long-term contentment is influenced more by personal agency than external circumstances, based on a study of women aged 31 to 77. The research identified key habits, such as embracing one's "felt age" rather than chronological age and focusing on being a reliable friend to others instead of just having one. Other empowering habits include increasing the frequency of social interactions, being open to being a beginner at new skills, and creating meaningful traditions that foster a sense of belonging. These practices are described as counterintuitive yet powerful ways to intentionally build a more satisfying life.</p>
