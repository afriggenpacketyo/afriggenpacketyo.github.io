          <h2>Coastal Homeowners Adopt Resilient Designs to Mitigate Worsening Hurricane Seasons</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid predictions of an above-average hurricane season, some coastal homeowners are investing in climate-resilient construction to protect their properties. One Florida homeowner's round house, designed by Deltec Homes, has withstood six hurricanes due to its aerodynamic shape and reinforced structure. These designs, which can cost about 10% more than traditional homes, feature elements like flood vents and are rated for winds up to 190 mph. Research institutes are also testing building materials and methods to make all homes more resistant to extreme weather.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a meeting to discuss the ongoing war in Gaza and potential ceasefire negotiations. The discussion followed a suggestion from a US envoy that Israel and Hamas were close to agreeing on a 60-day ceasefire, with only one major issue remaining. The proposed deal would involve the release of several hostages. While President Trump expressed optimism about the talks, Qatari mediators indicated that more time would be needed to reach a final agreement.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly expanding its offshore wind power capacity, adding over 4.4 gigawatts in the first half of the year, matching its total for all of 2024. A report from Global Energy Monitor indicates the country is on track to install more than half of the world's new offshore wind capacity this year. This expansion is part of a broader government strategy to advance the "high-quality development" of its marine economy. The initiative is supported by strong central government planning and is seen as crucial for job creation and energy security.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an Instagram post by television personality Gemma Collins for illegally promoting a prescription-only weight-loss drug. The post advertised Yazen, a service that combines an app with medication, and was one of nine similar ads banned in a recent crackdown. While the ad did not name a specific drug, the ASA ruled it breached the code by promoting a prescription-only medicine to the public. Collins accepted the ruling and agreed to follow advertising guidance in the future.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is eliminating its long-standing policy requiring passengers to remove their shoes during security screenings at U.S. airports. The change, announced by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, is effective immediately and is attributed to significant advancements in security technology over the last two decades. While shoes can now stay on, passengers will still need to remove laptops, liquids, and belts, though these rules are also under review. The original shoe-removal rule was implemented in 2006 after a failed bombing attempt.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has appointed Sarah Mahin to lead its new Department of Homeless Services and Housing. Mahin, a veteran executive with two decades of experience, will oversee the new agency tasked with bringing more accountability to the county's homelessness spending. The department was created to take over functions from the much-criticized Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA). Mahin currently directs the county's Housing for Health program, which is seen as a model for the new agency's approach to providing housing and care.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's new forward, João Pedro, made a stunning first start for the club by scoring two goals against his former Brazilian team, Fluminense, in the Club World Cup semi-final. The 23-year-old, who joined from Brighton for a significant fee, showed his class with two impressive strikes that secured Chelsea's place in the final. Despite the importance of the goals, he respectfully chose not to celebrate against the club where he began his career. His performance has generated excitement that he could be the answer to the team's search for a consistent goalscorer.</p>

          <p>Brazil and China have signed a memorandum of understanding to study the feasibility of a massive transcontinental railway. The proposed 2,800-mile railway would connect Brazil's Atlantic coast with a Pacific port in Peru, potentially reshaping South American trade routes to Asia. If constructed, the corridor could significantly shorten shipping times compared to routes that use the Panama Canal. The agreement currently covers only the technical, environmental, and economic studies for the ambitious project, which are expected to take up to five years to complete.</p>
