        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Powerball jackpot for Saturday's drawing soared to an estimated $700 million, marking the largest prize of the year, following 36 consecutive rounds without a grand prize winner since May 31. The winning numbers announced were 11, 14, 34, 47, 51, and the red Powerball 18. While no one claimed the top prize, several participants secured substantial smaller winnings, including a Tennessee player who matched five numbers with the Power Play option for $2 million, and two others who won $1 million each. The potential grand prize winner faces a choice between a full jackpot paid in annual installments over 29 years or a one-time cash option of $316.3 million before taxes, underscoring the life-changing opportunity presented by this lottery.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand has developed in the Atlantic Ocean, situated southeast of Bermuda, marking the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. This follows Hurricane Erin, which formed in a similar region earlier in August. As of Saturday night, Fernand was located approximately 325 miles southeast of Bermuda, sustaining winds of 40 mph and moving north-northeast. Forecasters from the National Hurricane Center anticipate the storm will strengthen over the weekend, possibly becoming a hurricane by Monday, before weakening on Tuesday. It is expected to remain over open ocean waters, passing well east of Bermuda, and currently poses no major threat to the U.S. coast.</p>

This "Get on Board Tour" initiative aims to enhance the quality of life for people with disabilities by demonstrating the transformative power of adaptive sports like surfing, skating, and fishing. The event, which originated from a spontaneous idea in 2001, now impacts hundreds of thousands of lives, fostering a sense of possibility and joy through ocean activities. Participants, including a 4-year-old autistic boy, experienced the thrill of riding waves, celebrating personal victories and community spirit.</p>

          <p>Asus Cloud, a subsidiary of the Taiwanese laptop maker, is constructing a new supercomputer in Tainan, Taiwan, aiming to significantly enhance the island's total computing capacity. The initial phase of this collaboration with the National Centre for High-Performance Computing is expected to launch in December with 80 petaflops, eventually expanding to 250 petaflops. This project is a crucial part of Taiwan's ambition to become one of Asia's top three computing powers, with the government planning to increase overall capacity to 1,200 petaflops by 2029. The initiative underscores Taiwan's strategic investment in advanced technology and AI infrastructure.</p>

          <h2>British Foreign Secretary Receives Warning for Fishing Without License During JD Vance Visit</h2>

          <p>Britain's Foreign Secretary, David Lammy, received a written warning from the UK Environment Agency for fishing without a license during a trip with US Vice President JD Vance at his country estate. Anyone over 13 requires a license for freshwater fishing in the UK. Lammy belatedly purchased a license and reported himself, calling it an "administrative error." The visit also included a bilateral meeting, but the fishing incident drew attention, with Vance jokingly noting that Lammy failed to catch any fish while his children did. This lighthearted misstep highlights the importance of adhering to local regulations, even for high-ranking officials.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A disability charity is advocating for all UK airports to eliminate drop-off fees for blue badge holders, arguing that the current system is inconsistent and often complex. Many of the 20 busiest airports already waive or discount fees for disabled drivers, but some, like Cardiff and Stansted, offer no concessions, charging up to £7 for short drop-offs. Disabled Motoring UK criticizes airports for "fleecing" disabled customers, emphasizing the need for dignity and respect. The article highlights how some airports require online registration for exemptions, creating barriers for those who are not computer literate or need spontaneous access, urging for a more accessible and fair system.</p>

          <p>The No. 1-ranked Mater Dei high school football team commenced its season in Florida with a 26-23 victory against six-time state champions Ft. Lauderdale Aquinas.

Despite the win, Mater Dei faced significant challenges, including a scoreless second half, two interceptions, botched point-after attempts, and 13 penalties for 140 yards. The defense, however, proved strong against the run. This opening game, delayed by lightning, highlighted areas for improvement while securing a crucial win for the top-ranked team.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament's e-petitions system celebrates its 10th anniversary, prompting reflection on its effectiveness in influencing government policy. While some historical petitions led to significant civil rights advances, modern digital petitions often feature a mix of serious calls for change and humorous, tongue-in-cheek campaigns. The system allows petitions with over 100,000 signatures to be debated by MPs, a process that can pressure ministers but rarely guarantees government action. Despite criticisms of it being a "dead end" by some, the system is defended as a vital "bridge between the public and Parliament," demonstrating that "democracy does not end at the ballot box," as seen with "Finn's Law" success.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Madurai Kamaraj University in India, in collaboration with Face Lab in the UK, have digitally reconstructed the faces of two 2,500-year-old male skulls excavated from Kondagai, near the ancient site of Keeladi. This effort aims to understand the region's early inhabitants and their ancestry, revealing features of Ancient Ancestral South Indians with traces of Middle-East Eurasian and Austro-Asiatic ancestries. The findings from Keeladi suggest an independent urban civilization in southern India dating back to 580BC, challenging traditional narratives focused on the north. This scientific endeavor provides profound insights into India's diverse past and the migration routes of its ancient populations.</p>

          <p>Bayern Munich began the 2025-26 Bundesliga season with a resounding 6-0 victory over RB Leipzig, featuring a Harry Kane hat-trick, signaling their continued dominance. This performance highlights the Bundesliga's long-standing criticism regarding a lack of top-level competition, which has hindered its global commercial appeal compared to leagues like the Premier League. In response, the DFL is implementing new strategies, including granting live streaming rights for 10 games to YouTube content creators in the UK and Ireland. This bold move aims to attract a new generation of global fans who consume sports non-traditionally, attempting to bridge the significant financial gap with other top European leagues, despite potential clashes with traditional fan culture.</p>
