        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Temu and Shein are facing increased tariffs in the United States due to the closure of a trade loophole, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers. Despite these challenges, experts believe that these e-commerce giants will remain competitive by implementing localization strategies, such as onboarding American sellers and utilizing local warehouses. Temu has already begun exclusively offering goods shipped from local warehouses, while Shein is expanding its supply chain to countries like Turkey and Mexico. The article suggests that their agile supply chains and ability to operate on thin margins will help them adapt and continue to compete with rivals like Amazon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Emperor Akihito of Japan, aged 91, has been admitted to a Tokyo hospital for a thorough medical examination following signs of myocardial ischemia detected during a previous checkup. The Imperial Household Agency reports that the former emperor is not currently experiencing any symptoms related to the condition, which involves reduced blood flow to the heart muscles. This hospitalization follows a history of heart-related treatments, including a coronary-artery bypass surgery in 2012 and treatment for heart failure in 2022. Akihito abdicated the Chrysanthemum Throne in April 2019, marking the first abdication by a Japanese monarch in approximately two centuries.</p>

          <p>According to this New York Times article, President Xi Jinping's ongoing purge of top military officials in China raises concerns about the competence and reliability of his commanders, potentially weakening his appetite for war, particularly regarding Taiwan. Over the past two years, several high-ranking officers, including defense ministers and leaders of the Rocket Force, have been removed from their positions due to corruption and ideological differences. Despite China's military advancements, a lack of battlefield experience among officers and political interference may hinder their effectiveness. The article suggests that Taiwan and the United States should use this time to strengthen their defenses, recognizing that Xi may be reluctant to send a scandal-plagued military into battle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The trend of children of senior Chinese officials seeking lucrative careers in the private sector is reversing, with more now opting for government jobs. This shift is attributed to the Communist Party's tightened rules around officials and their families as part of its anti-corruption drive, coupled with a slowing economy. Government jobs are seen as secure, albeit lower-paid and more demanding, with more constraints on personal choices compared to the private sector. This article observes that government agencies are increasingly staffed with individuals from privileged backgrounds.</p>

          <p>The European Union is set to unveil a roadmap to eliminate all current and future Russian gas deliveries, aiming to end reliance by 2027. Russia, formerly the EU's top gas supplier, has fallen out of favor due to the conflict in Ukraine. While there's consensus on ending deliveries, the process involves unwinding decades of cooperation, with the EU currently importing approximately 19% of its gas from Russia, down from 40% in 2022. Legal experts note that companies withdrawing from existing contracts could face penalties or arbitration, particularly with "take or pay" agreements.</p>

This criminal conspiracy allowed clients to evade U.S. tax obligations from 2010 through 2021.

          <p>The UK government is allocating ¬£102 million to modernize over 1,000 GP surgeries in England, aiming to expand and upgrade facilities to accommodate more patients. This investment, the largest in five years, seeks to address long waiting times and the "08:00 scramble" for same-day appointments. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the funding will enable better services for patients and help tackle waiting lists. The British Social Attitudes survey revealed a significant drop in public satisfaction with NHS GP services since 2019, attributed to fewer in-person appointments.</p>
