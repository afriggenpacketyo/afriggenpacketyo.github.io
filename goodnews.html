        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a mainland Chinese military magazine, China's developing sixth-generation fighter, unofficially called the J-36, could potentially block airspace up to 1,000km from the Chinese coast, posing challenges to US forces in a conflict over Taiwan. The article suggests this fighter could intercept US warplanes and suppress air defenses of bases in Guam for one to two hours. This development is aimed at countering the US B-21 stealth bomber and could impact the US Navy and Air Force's air superiority in the Western Pacific. Both the US and China are developing sixth-generation fighters, with the B-21 Raider having already completed its maiden flight.</p>

          <p>The deadline for Americans to obtain a Real ID is approaching on May 7th, requiring individuals over 18 to possess one for domestic air travel and access to federal facilities. Dozens of states are behind on compliance, with New Jersey having the lowest rate. A Real ID is a state-issued license or ID card with a black or gold star, while five states offer Enhanced IDs as an alternative. Travelers without a Real ID should arrive three hours early at the airport, and passports are still accepted for travel. Enhanced IDs also allow land and sea travel to Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean without a passport.</p>

          <p>The article emphasizes the critical role of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) in supporting historical research, particularly in colonial California. The author, a history professor, highlights how NEH funding enabled studies of Indigenous Californians and the creation of online databases tracing ancestry to 18th-century California. These projects help people understand their identity and place in contemporary California. The author argues that defunding the NEH would be a significant loss to the nation's cultural fabric and ability to understand its history.</p>

          <p>Learning new languages physically changes the brain and increases cognitive abilities, as neural pathways reshape during language acquisition. Studies show that multilingualism improves memory and problem-solving skills, although it's unclear if this equates to higher intelligence. Young children find it easier to learn new languages due to greater neural plasticity. Learning a new language requires new ways for the participants' brains to encode, store, and retrieve new linguistic information. Regardless, learning languages opens up new cultural experiences.</p>
