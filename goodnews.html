          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly called for oil producers to maintain lower oil prices, warning that high prices would benefit adversaries following U.S. airstrikes on key Iranian nuclear facilities. This message, posted on his social media platform, comes amid heightened concerns that Iran might retaliate by targeting energy supplies in the Middle East, and Trump followed up by urging the Department of Energy to increase domestic drilling. The oil market initially reacted to the U.S. attacks with a price jump, but futures trading largely stabilized, and while oil production decisions in the U.S. are made by private companies, Trump's statements reflect a desire to control energy costs amid geopolitical tensions. His remarks underscore the administration's focus on energy independence and its potential impact on foreign policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, the White House has expressed confidence that the strikes successfully hit enriched uranium stores, and President Donald Trump has publicly demanded that oil prices remain steady. Trump also urged the Department of Energy to increase domestic drilling in response to rising oil prices, and Secretary of Energy Chris Wright responded affirmatively on social media. This directive follows concerns that the conflict could disrupt global oil supplies, and the administration is seeking to mitigate any potential economic fallout by increasing domestic production. The focus remains on maintaining energy stability amid geopolitical uncertainty.</p>

The shop's appearance in 'Wayne's World' drew visitors from around the globe, and Intagliata recalls the store being a creative hub for the community. Cassell's legacy will live on as the 'Wayne's World' guitar will be displayed in a museum in Canada.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major U.S. health insurers, including CVS Health, UnitedHealthcare, and Cigna, have voluntarily agreed to streamline the prior authorization process, aiming to reduce delays and administrative burdens for patients and providers. The changes, benefiting an estimated 257 million Americans, include implementing standardized online submission systems and reducing the number of claims subject to prior authorization. Insurers claim the process ensures medically necessary care and cost control, while critics argue it leads to care delays and physician burnout, and the new measures are expected to take effect across commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid plans. The move reflects an industry effort to improve patient experience and modernize healthcare administration.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman stated that she would favor an interest rate cut at the July policy meeting, contingent on inflation pressures remaining contained. Bowman's remarks echo similar sentiments from fellow Governor Christopher Waller, suggesting a growing consensus within the Fed to consider easing monetary policy. She believes President Trump's tariffs will likely have a temporary and muted impact on prices, paving the way for lower rates, and Bowman's comments indicate a willingness to adjust policy to sustain a healthy labor market. The Fed is closely monitoring economic conditions as administration policies and financial markets continue to evolve. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are cautioning homeowners to carefully assess their debt situation before taking out home equity loans, as attractive rates can lead to excessive borrowing. There is no single formula for determining how much debt is too much, but a high debt-to-income ratio, low credit score, low home equity, unstable income, and lack of an emergency fund are all indicators that a home equity loan may be too risky. Experts recommend keeping the debt-to-income ratio below 36% and having at least 20% equity in the home, and potential borrowers should also have an emergency fund to cushion against unexpected financial difficulties. Taking out a home equity loan requires honest self-assessment and a backup plan in case circumstances change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in May increased slightly by 0.8% from April, exceeding expectations of a decline, but prices hit another record high, according to the National Association of Realtors.

The median price of an existing home sold in May was $422,800, up 1.3% year over year, and homes are taking longer to sell at 27 days versus 24 a year ago.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the strategy intended to "stabilise" and help "mitigate" challenges to the UK from abroad, and the measures aim to boost growth by improving UK workers' skills, attracting global talent, and streamlining planning processes. The government will focus on eight specific sectors where the UK is already strong, including advanced manufacturing, clean energy industries, and digital technologies, and the strategy has received mixed reactions from businesses and trade unions. The plan seeks to provide long-term certainty and direction for businesses to invest and innovate.</p>

          <h2>Experts Discuss Inheriting Credit Card Debt</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 09:28:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are weighing in on the question of whether credit card debt can be inherited, with the consensus being that individuals are not typically responsible for the debt of a deceased loved one unless they were a co-signer or joint account holder. The deceased person's estate is responsible for settling debts, and if the estate lacks sufficient funds, the remaining balance may go unpaid. Spouses in community property states may be responsible for debt taken out during the marriage, and it is important to notify credit card companies and credit bureaus upon a death. Consulting an estate attorney can help clarify legal responsibilities and prevent future financial issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting has announced a national inquiry into maternity care in England, prompted by a series of maternity scandals and failures within NHS trusts. The "rapid" inquiry will urgently investigate the worst-performing maternity and neonatal services in the country, and the inquiry will involve the victims of maternity scandals, giving families a voice into how the inquiry is run. The inquiry will begin this summer and report back by December 2025, and Streeting has apologized on behalf of the NHS to those families who had suffered avoidable harm. The goal is to ensure no parent or baby is ever let down again.</p>

          <p>Brentford set-piece coach Keith Andrews is the frontrunner for the vacant manager's job at Gtech Community Stadium after Thomas Frank's departure, and the club is not putting a timescale on the appointment. Andrews was appointed to Brentford's coaching staff in July 2024, after being part of Sheffield United's backroom team, and this would be the Irishman's first managerial role. Between 2020-23, Andrews was assistant manager to Stephen Kenny for the Republic of Ireland, after winning 35 caps for the country. The appointment reflects a focus on internal candidates.</p>
