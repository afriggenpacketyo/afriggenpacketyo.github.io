          <p>India's central bank unexpectedly cut its benchmark policy rate by 50 points to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022, citing softened inflation and slower growth. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra said the move aims to address growth concerns amid a challenging global environment. While the central bank held its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, it revised its inflation outlook to 3.7%. Despite the rate cut, the RBI shifted its monetary policy stance to "neutral," indicating limited room for further easing. (not investment advice)</p>
