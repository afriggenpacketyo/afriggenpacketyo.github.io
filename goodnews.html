          <p>A recent Zillow analysis reveals that renters now need to earn at least $100,000 annually to comfortably afford rent in eight major metropolitan areas across the U.S., double the number before the pandemic. Cities like New York City and Boston require incomes exceeding $127,000, while more affordable options include Buffalo and Oklahoma City, where incomes around $55,000 suffice. The surge in rents has outpaced wage growth, exacerbating the housing affordability crisis, and experts call for increased housing supply and congressional action to expand affordable housing programs.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are moving forward with a plan to cut $880 billion from Medicaid over the next decade, but they acknowledge they will not receive a full analysis from the Congressional Budget Office before their committee markup. Despite this, the CBO confirmed that the legislative recommendations would meet the $880 billion savings target. President Trump has urged Republicans to unify around the bill, while Democrats criticize the plan, citing prior CBO analyses that millions could lose Medicaid insurance. Republicans are emphasizing the savings anticipated through work requirements for Medicaid recipients, but details await the CBO's pending analysis.</p>

          <p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has suspended all imports of live cattle, horses, and bison from Mexico due to the spread of New World Screwworm (NWS), a flesh-eating pest.

NWS infections have been detected in several Central American countries and recently in Mexico, prompting the US to take action.

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to drastically reduce tariffs on each other for the next 90 days, providing relief to investors and retailers who feared a trade breakthrough was out of reach.

The White House Press Secretary stated that any gift would be accepted in full compliance with applicable laws.

If pharmaceutical companies don't lower their prices, the administration will pursue a host of regulatory options.

The US will lower those tariffs from 145% to 30%, while China's retaliatory tariffs on US goods will drop to 10% from 125%.

          <p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom plans to announce a significant push to address homeless encampments, framing it as a "statewide funding announcement" regarding mental health and homelessness. Newsom will release a model ordinance that cities can use as a basis for their own local ordinances against homeless encampments. The effort is backed by $3.3 billion in new Prop 1 funding, and Newsom cited a recent Supreme Court ruling and a 2024 executive order as part of his call on cities to act.</p>

          <p>Shares of major toy makers, including Mattel, Hasbro, Jakks, and Funko, rallied on Monday following the U.S. agreement to temporarily reduce tariffs on China. The agreement pauses most tariffs and trade barriers for 90 days, reducing the 145% levy President Trump had in place on Chinese imports to 30%. The rally pushed shares of Hasbro above their trading level from early April, before Trump first announced his so-called "reciprocal tariffs" on dozens of trade partners. The stocks had been hammered by Wall Street as investors anticipated manufacturing hiccups and price hikes resulting from the tariff scheme.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump said Monday that he talked to Apple CEO Tim Cook after the U.S. and China agreed to suspend most tariffs for 90 days. Wall Street and Apple investors cheered the pause on Chinese tariffs. Apple stock was up 6% on Monday, versus 4% for the Nasdaq. Trump said Tim Cook is going to build a lot of plants in the United States for Apple and is going to even up his numbers. Any cooling of a U.S.-China trade war is expected to boost Apple, which does the majority of its device production in the country, and also counts the region as its third-largest by sales.</p>

          <p>With gold prices near record highs, investors are considering the benefits of selling their gold investments now. While the price of gold dipped slightly this week, the potential profit could be substantial, especially for those who bought before 2025. However, selling would mean losing a portfolio diversifier and a long-term hedge against inflation. Selling should be relatively easy due to the abundance of gold buyers, but investors need a realistic understanding of their gold's worth. The article suggests weighing the pros and cons carefully before taking any action, and potentially selling some while keeping a portion for portfolio benefits.</p>
