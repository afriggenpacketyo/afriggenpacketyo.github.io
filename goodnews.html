          <p>Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party has elected Sanae Takaichi, a conservative former Economic Security Minister, as its new leader, setting her on a path to become the nation's first female prime minister. A protégé of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is known for her hard-line conservative views and aims to strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance while addressing domestic economic challenges like rising prices. Her election is seen as a move by the party to regain support from its conservative base following recent election losses. Takaichi's leadership will soon face diplomatic tests, including a potential summit with U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>Michaela Del Barrio, a 37-year-old mother with a family history of breast cancer, was diagnosed with early-stage invasive ductal carcinoma after she proactively pushed for screenings before the standard recommended age. Despite initial reassurances from doctors in her 20s, she insisted on a mammogram and subsequent MRI at age 36, which revealed two suspicious masses that were confirmed to be cancerous. Her case highlights the importance of self-advocacy and understanding personal risk factors, as oncologists note the cancer could have been far more advanced if not for her persistence. Del Barrio is now undergoing long-term endocrine therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence.</p>

          <p>The article explores how renowned conservationist Jane Goodall, who passed away at 91, adopted a plant-based diet over 50 years ago, a decision central to her ethical and environmental activism. She famously stopped eating meat after looking at a pork chop and connecting it to the fear, pain, and death of an animal. Goodall cited the environmental damage from meat production and the cruelty of factory farms as her primary motivations. This dietary choice not only aligned with her conservation work but also contributed to her long, healthy life, as research links reduced red meat consumption to lower risks of cardiovascular disease and cancer.</p>

          <p>Following her death at age 91, this opinion article reflects on the monumental legacy of primatologist and conservationist Jane Goodall. It recounts her groundbreaking discovery in 1960 that chimpanzees make and use tools, a finding that fundamentally challenged the definition of what it means to be human. The article emphasizes her ability to foster connection without words, exemplified by her first gentle contact with the chimpanzee she named David Greybeard. Goodall's life's work, which expanded from chimp research to global conservation programs, is celebrated for changing how humans understand their own place within the natural world.</p>

          <p>Certified financial planners recommend using the fourth quarter as an opportune time to conduct a thorough review of personal finances to prepare for the end of the year and the start of 2026. With actual income and spending data available, individuals can engage in more effective tax planning, which is particularly important this year due to recent tax law changes under President Trump. Experts advise strategizing to maximize deductions, such as the temporarily increased state and local tax (SALT) cap, and planning charitable donations around new laws. Additionally, creating a holiday budget now can help prevent starting the new year with financial stress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Praises Federal Judge's Rebuke of Trump's Free Speech Violations Against Immigrants</h2>

          <p>This opinion article commends a recent ruling by U.S. District Judge William Young, who found that the Trump administration violated the First Amendment by targeting and deporting pro-Palestinian foreign scholars for their political speech. The judge's decision forcefully stated that the Constitution's protection of free speech applies to non-citizens and citizens alike, and accused the president of bullying and ignoring the law to silence dissent. The author argues that Judge Young's unusually personal and direct rebuke of the president serves as a vital civics lesson, framing the threat to immigrants' rights as a threat to the constitutional values that protect all Americans.</p>

          <p>Ahti Heinla, a co-founder of Skype, is now leading Starship Technologies, a company deploying autonomous delivery robots in cities across the UK, Europe, and Estonia. Heinla claims the venture is already operating at a small profit, offering deliveries cheaper than human drivers and making the service viable even in smaller towns. The company, which has already completed 8 million deliveries, aims for massive expansion but faces hurdles from inconsistent local regulations, particularly in the UK. Heinla argues that the robots will address the growing demand for delivery services without displacing human workers, who can focus on more complex jobs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The fashion industry is leveraging artificial intelligence to analyze vast amounts of data from social media, runway shows, and consumer behavior to predict upcoming trends more quickly and accurately. Companies like Heuritech use AI algorithms to detect early signals for trends such as specific colors or clothing styles months before they become mainstream. Retailers like Stitch Fix are also using AI for practical design decisions, such as generating on-body images to choose between product variations without the cost and delay of physical samples. While AI provides powerful data analysis, industry experts emphasize that human expertise remains essential to interpret the data and distinguish between fleeting online fads and commercially viable trends.</p>

Investors appear to be treating the cryptocurrency as a safe-haven asset amid the political and economic uncertainty, pushing its price up by 12% within the week. Analysts from Standard Chartered note that this rally is linked to perceptions of U.S. government risks and predict that Bitcoin could soon set a new record, potentially reaching $135,000.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese director Lou Ye's acclaimed movie, 'An Unfinished Film,' offers a semi-documentary look at a film crew quarantined near Wuhan during the initial COVID-19 lockdown in 2020. The film has been praised internationally for its courage in depicting the chaos and confinement of that period, a stark contrast to state-sanctioned narratives. However, this review argues that while the film powerfully captures the early pandemic experience and even includes footage of later anti-lockdown protests, it conspicuously omits the subsequent wave of mass infections and deaths after restrictions were lifted. This silence reflects a broader societal reluctance in China to confront the pandemic's full, unprocessed trauma.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion column pushes back against conservative criticism of Bad Bunny being chosen as the Super Bowl halftime performer, arguing that such objections are nonsensical and ignore basic geography. The author points out that Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens and that the NFL has a long history of featuring non-American acts like The Rolling Stones and U2. The piece frames the outrage as a counterproductive attempt to stir fear over the Spanish language and gaslight the country about its multicultural reality. It concludes that the choice reflects the NFL's commercial interest in global expansion and is an opportunity for cultural growth, not division.</p>

          <p>Michele Mulroney, the newly elected president of the Writers Guild of America West, is taking leadership at a critical time for the industry, marked by studio consolidation, job scarcity post-strike, and the rise of AI. Mulroney plans to build on recent contract gains, particularly in AI protections, and will push studios to contribute more to the union's health plan, which is strained by the industry contraction. Her election coincided with a victory for the guild, as ABC reinstated "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" following writer protests over its suspension. Mulroney emphasized the WGA's commitment to protecting free expression and fighting for fair contracts.</p>
