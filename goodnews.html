        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) has announced its disbandment after 41 years of armed conflict with the Turkish state, a decision welcomed by Turkish government and opposition parties alike. This move could significantly alter Turkey's political landscape, especially for the pro-Kurdish DEM party. Political experts suggest that the peace process with the PKK and the legal situation surrounding jailed Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu will be critical factors in the coming years. However, uncertainties remain regarding the surrender of weapons, potential resistance within the PKK, and the fate of PKK members, making the future of Turkish politics unpredictable. </p>

          <p>Denmark's economy, driven by pharmaceutical exports like Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Ozempic, is projected to moderate in growth, but is expected to be largely unaffected by potential U.S. tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry, according to the IMF. The fund noted that most Danish drug products are neither produced nor do they pass through the country, relying instead on a "merchanting and processing" system. While the U.S. remains a key trading partner, only a small fraction of Danish exports are produced within the country, limiting the direct impact of U.S. tariffs on the Danish economy. </p>

          <p>The Japanese government is considering releasing approximately 100,000 tons of reserve rice per month for three months to address rising rice prices, which have reached near-record highs. This move supplements the 321,000 tons already auctioned between March and April, prompted by a poor harvest in 2023 and increased rice consumption due to a surge in foreign tourists. Lawmakers are also contemplating relaxing buyback requirements for rice distributors to encourage greater participation in auctions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average cost of private school education in the UK has risen by 22.6% in the last year, exceeding government estimates, following the introduction of VAT on fees. The Independent Schools Council (ISC) anticipates a decrease in private school enrollment as a result, but notes that the full impact remains uncertain. Parents are already withdrawing their children from private schools due to rising costs, and some schools have reduced their fees, excluding VAT, to mitigate the impact. The ISC attributes the fee increase to a combination of national insurance changes, the end of charitable business rates relief, and the imposition of VAT. </p>

          <p>A Communist Party journal suggests that China possesses the financial strength to establish a market stabilization fund, citing its robust economy and substantial foreign exchange reserves. The fund aims to mitigate market volatility and protect investors amidst global economic uncertainties stemming from trade tensions. The article highlights the successful interventions by the Hong Kong government during the 1997 Asian financial crisis as an example. China's increased regulatory capacity is also noted as enabling the effective performance of such a fund. </p>

          <p>Japan's antitrust watchdog has unveiled draft guidelines aimed at preventing Google and Apple from stifling competition in the smartphone software market. The new law, set to fully take effect in December, seeks to promote competition from smaller firms by prohibiting the tech giants from unfairly excluding competitors from their app stores. The guidelines also restrict the use of data obtained from app store operations to favor their own products and services. The move aims to benefit consumers by reducing prices and improving access to diverse apps. </p>
