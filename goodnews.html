        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts predict that credit card interest rates are unlikely to decrease significantly in the near future, potentially remaining elevated well into 2026. The Federal Reserve's cautious approach to interest rate cuts, coupled with factors like delinquency rates and lender margins, contribute to this outlook. The average credit card interest rate in the U.S. currently stands at 21.37%, and credit card debt per household rose 3.5% in the third quarter of 2024, reaching $6,730 on average. While waiting for rates to drop, consumers are advised to explore debt repayment strategies and consider options like hardship rate reductions or balance transfer cards. (not investment advice)</p>

The judge asserted that the executive branch cannot conduct large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force without Congressional approval.

Mchunu emphasized that the history of farm murders has been distorted and reported in an unbalanced way. The minister also rejected allegations that the government is expropriating land held by white farmers, asserting that all sections of society are affected by crime.</p>

          <p>A House Republican tax bill aims to repeal subsidies that incentivize electric vehicle (EV) purchases and manufacturing in the United States. If enacted, the bill would eliminate tax credits for battery production, EV purchases, and charging stations, while imposing a new annual fee on EV owners. Analysts suggest this move could slow the growth of the EV market in the U.S. and hinder its competitiveness with China and Europe. Despite the potential setback, some believe the EV industry can still grow due to improving battery technology and falling prices.</p>

          <p>NATO allies are considering a new plan to meet President Trump's demand for increased defense spending by broadening what qualifies as security-related expenditures. The proposal involves a target of 3.5% of GDP for traditional military spending and an additional 1.5% for non-traditional items like infrastructure and cybersecurity. The approach aims to address both Trump's concerns and the need for European countries to invest in hard military power. The proposal reflects efforts to appease Trump and acknowledge the need for increased defense spending in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Experts are advising homeowners on the best and worst ways to utilize a home equity line of credit (HELOC) this summer. HELOCs offer flexibility with variable rates, making them advantageous for consolidating credit card debt or funding home improvements. However, they caution against using HELOCs for non-essential expenses like vacations or pools, which may not generate financial returns or increase home value. It's also wise to use a HELOC for college costs or buying a new house only if other options are not available.</p>
