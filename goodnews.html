          <p>British tennis player Cameron Norrie has advanced to the Wimbledon quarter-finals after a grueling five-set victory over Nicolas Jarry. Norrie secured the win after a four-hour and 27-minute battle, keeping British interest alive in the men's singles tournament. Despite holding a match point in the third set, Norrie had to regroup after Jarry mounted a strong comeback to force a deciding set. The victory marks a significant moment for Norrie, who is now one win away from matching his 2022 semi-final run at the All England Club.</p>

          <p>White House National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett indicated that several trade deals are expected to be finalized ahead of this week's tariff deadline. He suggested that existing agreements with the U.K. and Vietnam are serving as models for ongoing negotiations with other countries. For nations where deals are not yet complete, the administration plans to send letters outlining proposed terms, potentially creating last-minute agreements. Hassett asserted that the administration's tariff strategy is successfully encouraging companies to onshore production and create jobs in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Leaders from the BRICS group of developing nations gathered in Rio de Janeiro, where they reaffirmed their commitment to multilateral diplomacy. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva opened the summit by decrying the "unparalleled collapse of multilateralism" and criticized NATO for fueling a global arms race. The summit was notably missing Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who participated via video link to avoid potential arrest under an International Criminal Court warrant. Putin used his address to declare the model of liberal globalization obsolete and urge for greater cooperation among member nations.</p>

          <p>At their summit in Rio de Janeiro, leaders of the BRICS nations issued a joint declaration condemning recent military strikes on Iran and the rise of unilateral trade tariffs. While the statement did not explicitly name the United States or Israel, its targets were clear. The document expressed "grave concern" over the attacks on Iran and called for an end to the cycle of violence in the Middle East. It also criticized trade measures that distort global commerce and violate WTO rules, reflecting the bloc's commitment to multilateralism and a rules-based international order.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris won a chaotic and rain-affected British Grand Prix, marking his first victory at his home race at Silverstone. Norris benefited after his teammate, Oscar Piastri, who had been leading, received a 10-second penalty for erratic driving during a safety-car restart. The race was packed with action, including a spin by Red Bull's Max Verstappen and a surprise first-ever podium for Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg, who finished third. The victory was an emotional one for Norris, who described it as a beautiful achievement in front of a record-breaking home crowd.</p>

          <p>Thailand is offering a new proposal to the United States aimed at averting a threatened 36% tariff on its imports. According to its finance minister, Thailand plans to reduce its $46 billion trade surplus with the U.S. by 70% within five years, hoping to secure a more favorable tariff rate. The U.S. has set a July 9 deadline for negotiations, after which a 90-day pause on higher tariffs will expire. The Thai government is reportedly aiming for a baseline 10% tariff rate but would find a rate between 10% and 20% acceptable to avoid the more damaging levy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Military experts writing in the official newspaper of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) have argued that China's military needs to undergo structural changes to effectively counter modern drone threats. The article suggests that the increasing use of unmanned aircraft in recent conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine, necessitates the creation of specialized counter-drone units. While this is seen as a long-term goal, the experts propose immediate adjustments, such as integrating advanced counter-drone capabilities into existing electronic warfare units. This reflects an ongoing strategic shift within the PLA to adapt to the evolving nature of aerial warfare.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered a 3,500-year-old city in northern Peru that is believed to have been a crucial trading hub for early American civilizations. The city, named Peñico, likely connected communities from the Pacific coast, the Andes, and the Amazon basin. Researchers suggest the find is important for understanding the fate of the Caral, the oldest known civilization in the Americas, which declined due to climate change. The site contains the remains of ceremonial temples and residential buildings, where artifacts like clay sculptures and seashell necklaces were unearthed, shedding new light on this ancient society.</p>
