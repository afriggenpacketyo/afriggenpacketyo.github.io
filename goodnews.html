          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren S√°nchez held their wedding in Venice, Italy, attended by a host of high-profile celebrities including Leonardo DiCaprio, Oprah Winfrey, and Bill Gates. The multi-day festivities drew significant media attention as guests arrived via water taxis for the lavish events. The celebration, however, also sparked protests from some Venetian residents under the banner "No Space for Bezos," highlighting ongoing local frustrations with over-tourism and its impact on the city. This marks the second marriage for both Bezos and S√°nchez, who finalized their previous divorces in 2019.</p>

          <p>The band The 1975 returned to the stage to headline Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, delivering a slick and crowd-pleasing performance in their only scheduled show of the year. Frontman Matty Healy, known for his unpredictable stage presence, offered a more restrained show, focusing on the band's extensive catalog of hits like "Chocolate" and "Love It If We Made It." The article notes that while the musical performance was tight and well-received, it lacked the wilder, more chaotic energy of their past shows. The day also featured surprise sets from artists like Lorde and an emotional comeback performance from Lewis Capaldi.</p>

          <p>After a six-week manhunt, Antoine Massey, one of the last two inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail, has been recaptured. Authorities located and arrested the 33-year-old at an Airbnb in the city following a tip from a citizen to the Orleans Parish Sheriff. The arrest was made peacefully, and police believe Massey received assistance during his time as a fugitive. His capture leaves one remaining escapee, Derrick Groves, at large. The original jailbreak involved 10 inmates and prompted a massive law enforcement response and scrutiny of the jail's security measures.</p>

He anticipates that the Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index could influence the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates if it indicates a weak industrial economy. Cramer also expressed pessimism about Constellation Brands' earnings, suggesting the company is facing pressure from the rise of weight-loss drugs and consumers' growing preference for cannabis. He noted that the company has also cited President Trump's immigration policies as a factor weighing on its sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The California legislature has passed a measure to more than double the state's annual tax incentives for film and television production, raising the total to $750 million. The move, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, is a strategic effort to combat the exodus of productions to other states and countries offering more generous financial benefits. This legislation aims to reverse a trend that has led to a significant decline in industry jobs and production levels in Los Angeles. Industry unions and local advocates have applauded the decision as a crucial step to bring production back home and revitalize the state's signature industry.</p>

The divers had just nine minutes at the wreck site, where they surveyed and filmed its features, including scattered coal from its final cargo.

          <p>A Riverside County man has been sentenced to over a year in federal prison for tax fraud connected to the sale of memorabilia signed by the late comic book icon Stan Lee. Mac Martin Anderson, 59, pleaded guilty to failing to report over $1.2 million in income earned between 2015 and 2018 from selling autographed Marvel items. Authorities stated Anderson, who had a personal relationship with Lee, owed approximately $482,833 in taxes on the unreported proceeds.

          <p>Prominent financial advisor Ric Edelman has significantly increased his recommended portfolio allocation for cryptocurrencies, now suggesting a range of 10% to 40%. This marks a substantial shift from his previous advice of a low single-digit allocation. Edelman attributes this change to the evolution of crypto into a mainstream asset class, with initial questions about government bans and adoption now largely resolved. He also argues that the traditional 60/40 stock-to-bond portfolio is obsolete due to increased human longevity, making higher-return assets like crypto essential for long-term financial planning.
