          <p>Jimmy Kimmel returned to his ABC show, addressing his recent suspension over comments made about the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. In an emotional monologue, Kimmel stated it was never his intention to make light of the tragedy or blame any specific group for the actions of a disturbed individual. He expressed gratitude for the support he received and underscored the importance of free speech, which allows for shows like his to exist in the United States. The host's return was met with a warm reception and standing ovations from the studio audience.</p>

With this result, the Republican control of the House now stands at 219-214, with two other seats remaining vacant.

          <p>The availability of two key offensive players for the USC football team, wide receiver Ja’Kobi Lane and left tackle Elijah Paige, remains uncertain as they enter a crucial part of their schedule. Lane, who suffered an upper-body injury, returned to practice, but Paige was not seen on the field. Coach Lincoln Riley declined to provide specific updates, referring to the Big Ten's pre-game availability report. The potential absence of both players creates challenges for USC's offense, which had to adjust its lineup significantly after Paige left last Saturday's game against Michigan State early in the second quarter.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: China's National Day Parade Serves as a Symbol of Cohesion and National Destiny</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's decennial military parades are more than just a display of military strength; they serve a deeper purpose in reinforcing national cohesion and destiny. The author suggests that viewing the event solely through a Western lens of "muscle-flexing" misses its significance for the Chinese people, including those in Hong Kong and Macau. The parade is presented as a collective declaration of resilience and unity, intended to help citizens transcend personal anxieties by connecting with a larger national narrative. It functions as a powerful symbol of institutional strength in an increasingly fragmented world.</p>

          <h2>Trump Signals Major Shift, Stating Ukraine Can Win Back All Lost Territory</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 21:00:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant change of stance, U.S. President Donald Trump declared that Ukraine is in a position to "win all of Ukraine back in its original form." This statement, made on his Truth Social platform after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, marks a departure from his previous suggestions that Kyiv might need to concede territory to end the war. Trump attributed his revised outlook to Russia's economic troubles, calling the nation a "paper tiger." Zelenskyy acknowledged the comments as a "big shift" and a positive signal of U.S. support for Ukraine's efforts to restore its original borders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed surprise at President Trump's sudden shift in rhetoric, where Trump argued that Ukraine could win back all territory captured by Russia. The comments came after a meeting between the two leaders at the UN General Assembly and represent a stark contrast to Trump's earlier statements suggesting territorial compromise would be necessary. In an interview, Zelenskyy said he took Trump's new position as a positive sign, believing the U.S. president now understands that Ukraine cannot simply swap its sovereign land. The development adds a new layer of unpredictability to U.S. policy on the conflict.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has dismantled a massive, illegal telecommunications network in the New York area that posed a significant threat to the city's infrastructure and the UN General Assembly. Investigators seized over 100,000 SIM cards and 300 servers from multiple locations, which were capable of sending 30 million texts per minute and could have disabled cell towers. The network was reportedly used for encrypted communications by foreign governments, organized crime gangs, and drug cartels. The investigation began after telephonic threats were made to senior U.S. officials, and while no arrests have been made, the immediate threat has been neutralized.</p>

          <p>This article provides a historical analysis of China's five-year plans, which have been a central pillar of its macroeconomic policy since 1953, despite the country's shift away from a command economy.

The article traces the trajectory of these foundational documents, highlighting key milestones from the first plan's focus on heavy industry to the current ambition of becoming a global innovation hub. The upcoming 15th five-year plan is expected to be crucial in advancing China's position in cutting-edge technological sectors.</p>

          <p>Health agencies and experts from around the world are pushing back against the Trump administration's assertion of a link between acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy and autism. Major regulatory bodies in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Australia have all issued statements confirming there is no new scientific evidence to support the claim, reiterating that the medication remains a safe option for pain and fever during pregnancy. The World Health Organization also stated the evidence remains inconsistent. This international consensus directly contradicts the announcement made by President Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>

          <p>Nineteen-year-old Chelsea forward Tyrique George, who nearly left the club in the summer, made a significant impact by scoring a crucial equalizing goal in a Carabao Cup match. Playing out of his usual position as a lone striker, the academy graduate helped his team avoid an upset, showcasing his potential to manager Enzo Maresca. George's journey is highlighted as unusual for a Chelsea youth player, as he has broken into the first team without a loan spell, a result of intense personal training from a young age. His performance provides a welcome attacking option for the team amid other player injuries and departures.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Oregon believe that recently unearthed remains belong to "Oak Grove Jane Doe," the state's oldest cold case involving an unidentified person. The dismembered body parts of a woman were first discovered in the Willamette River in 1946, but the case went cold in the 1950s after critical evidence, including the remains, went missing. The discovery was made after investigators located a grave marked "Unknown Woman 1946" at a local cemetery. The remains will now undergo advanced forensic testing, offering hope that after nearly 80 years, the victim's identity can finally be restored.</p>
