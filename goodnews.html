          <p>On the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombing, Japan is grappling with the declining number of "hibakusha," or survivors, who can provide firsthand accounts of the tragedy. With the average survivor now over 86 years old, museums and younger generations are taking on the responsibility of passing on their stories. The article highlights the efforts of a 12-year-old boy who guides foreign tourists through Hiroshima's Peace Memorial Park, sharing the history of the bombing and his own family's connection to it. These initiatives aim to ensure the lessons of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not forgotten as direct witnesses pass away.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of the state prison in Norco by fall 2026. The decision is attributed to a significant decline in the state's inmate population and is expected to save the state $150 million annually. The facility, which currently houses nearly 3,000 inmates, will not release prisoners early but will transfer them to other institutions. The closure raises questions about the future of the historic property, which was once a luxury resort before being converted into a prison, and the economic impact on the local community.</p>

          <p>Japan marked the 80th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima with a solemn ceremony at the city's Peace Memorial Park, attended by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and international dignitaries. During the event, Hiroshima's mayor warned against a global trend of military buildup and the continued reliance on nuclear deterrence, calling these developments a threat to peace. The ceremony honored the more than 200,000 people who died as a result of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The event also highlighted ongoing calls for Japan to ratify the international treaty banning nuclear weapons, a divisive issue within the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway among Chinese economists and policy advisors regarding whether to include specific consumption targets in the nation's next five-year plan. Proponents argue that setting a benchmark, such as the household consumption rate as a percentage of GDP, is crucial for strengthening domestic demand and improving living standards. They point to China's relatively low household consumption rate of 39.6% in 2023 as an area needing strategic focus. Opponents, however, question the feasibility of such metrics as operational policy goals, highlighting a key point of discussion as Beijing formulates its future economic strategy.

          <p>After a disappointing start to his MLB career followed by a shoulder injury, Dodgers' rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki is showing signs of a potential comeback. The Japanese phenom, who was a major offseason acquisition, has been progressing in his throwing program and is scheduled for a simulated game. The team is encouraged by adjustments to his delivery and the addition of a new pitch, a two-seamer, to his arsenal. While his return is not essential for the team's title hopes, a healthy and effective Sasaki could provide valuable pitching depth as a starter or reliever for the postseason push.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from redirecting over $4 billion in FEMA funds originally intended for natural disaster mitigation projects. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The judge stated the transfer of funds could cause "irreparable harm" to communities vulnerable to events like flooding. The injunction prevents the government from repurposing the money while the court fully considers the case, marking a legal setback for the administration's attempt to defund the program.</p>

          <p>A massive copper mining project in Afghanistan, backed by a state-owned Chinese company, is reportedly making significant progress towards beginning extraction this year. The Mes Aynak mine, which holds one of the world's largest untapped copper deposits, was awarded to the China Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC) in 2008 but has faced extensive delays. Issues included security challenges, the presence of ancient archaeological sites, and a lack of infrastructure. The project's advancement signals a renewed push by both the Taliban-led government and Beijing to exploit Afghanistan's vast mineral resources, despite lingering concerns over heritage preservation.</p>

Property crimes also fell, with motor vehicle thefts experiencing a significant 18.6% decline.

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has passed a new law requiring landlords in unincorporated areas to maintain their rental units at or below 82 degrees. The ordinance, aimed at protecting vulnerable tenants from the growing threat of extreme heat due to climate change, will take effect next month but won't be enforced until 2027. Officials are encouraging landlords to use "passive" cooling methods like reflective roofing and blackout curtains in addition to air conditioning. The law reflects a growing trend in municipalities to establish temperature standards in housing as a public health measure against increasingly frequent and intense heat waves.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have reportedly been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The policy, which had effectively closed the asylum system to those crossing the border illegally, was found to be in violation of U.S. laws that protect migrants from being sent to places where they could face persecution or torture. This move reopens pathways for migrants to request humanitarian refuge, though they will likely remain detained during the process. The Trump administration had credited the ban for a historic drop in illegal border crossings in recent months.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers are bringing back one of their franchise's most productive players, signing veteran wide receiver Keenan Allen to a one-year contract. Allen, who spent 11 seasons with the team before being traded to the Chicago Bears last year in a salary-cap move, returns to bolster the team's receiving corps. The six-time Pro Bowl selection provides a reliable and experienced target for quarterback Justin Herbert. His return is seen as a key addition, especially following the recent retirement of fellow receiver Mike Williams, as the team looks to strengthen its offense for the upcoming season.</p>

However, injuries to the team's other young quarterbacks, Kenny Pickett and Dillon Gabriel, have created an opportunity for the fifth-round draft pick. Sanders, who had a high-profile college career playing for his father, Deion Sanders, will now have a crucial chance to prove himself and compete for a spot on the final roster.</p>

          <p>The state of New Jersey has secured a historic $2 billion settlement with DuPont and its affiliated companies to resolve claims related to "forever chemicals" (PFAS) and other pollutants. The agreement, described as the largest single-state environmental settlement ever, holds the companies accountable for decades of contamination from four industrial sites. The deal mandates the creation of a $1.2 billion fund for cleanup efforts and requires a direct payment of $875 million to the state for natural resource damages. This settlement marks a major victory for the state in its efforts to make polluters pay for environmental remediation.</p>
