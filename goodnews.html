          <p>Shares of Bitmine Immersion Technologies, a company focusing on an ether treasury strategy, surged over 20% after billionaire Peter Thiel's venture capital firm, Founders Fund, disclosed a 9% stake. The investment has amplified interest in Ethereum-related assets, with similar companies also seeing their stock prices rise. This move follows increased momentum for Ethereum due to new trading options in Europe and progress on U.S. stablecoin legislation, highlighting growing mainstream financial interest in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the function of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, located in The Hague. Comprised of 15 judges from different nations, the court adjudicates disputes between states, distinct from the International Criminal Court which tries individuals. Its jurisdiction depends on states' consent, either through a blanket declaration or specific agreements, such as the UN Genocide Convention, which underpins cases like Ukraine v. Russia and South Africa v. Israel. However, the ICJ lacks an enforcement mechanism, relying on the cooperation of the involved parties for its rulings to be effective.</p>

          <p>Nintendo and Sony have announced the lead actors for their live-action "Legend of Zelda" movie, with Bo Bragason set to play Princess Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth cast as Link. The casting of the young actors, aged 21 and 16 respectively, has led fans to speculate the film might adapt storylines from games like "Ocarina of Time." Directed by Wes Ball, who aims for a "live-action Miyazaki" feel, the film's release has been pushed to May 7, 2027. This project follows Nintendo's highly successful cinematic venture with "The Super Mario Bros. Movie."</p>

          <p>Four years after his last competitive fight, 46-year-old boxing icon Manny Pacquiao is returning to the ring to challenge the reigning WBC welterweight champion, 30-year-old Mario Barrios. The fight, scheduled for Las Vegas, represents a significant test of Pacquiao's endurance and skill against a much younger opponent in his prime. If he wins, Pacquiao would make history as one of the oldest boxing champions ever and the only one to hold titles across four decades. Pacquiao expresses confidence, stating his passion for the sport remains strong and his goal is to retire as a champion.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed a €2 trillion budget for the 2028-2034 period, featuring a significant fivefold increase in funding for defense and space initiatives. The new European Competitiveness Fund would allocate €131 billion to these sectors, reflecting the continent's focus on rearmament amid geopolitical concerns. The overall budget framework also prioritizes climate and biodiversity projects, which will receive 35% of the funds, and triples funding for migration management. The proposal, which must gain unanimous approval from member states, aims to generate new revenue streams to avoid increasing national contributions.</p>

          <p>A Martian meteorite, identified as NWA 16788 and weighing over 54 pounds, has sold for nearly $5.3 million at a Sotheby's auction in New York. It is the largest known piece of Mars to have been found on Earth. The rock was likely ejected from the red planet by an asteroid impact before traveling 140 million miles and landing in the Sahara Desert, where it was discovered in 2023. Martian meteorites are exceptionally rare, constituting only about 0.6% of all meteorites found, making this a significant and valuable specimen for scientific study and collection.</p>
