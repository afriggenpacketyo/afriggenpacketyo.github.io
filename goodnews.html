          <p>Taiwan has placed China's Huawei and SMIC on its trade blacklist, further aligning with U.S. trade policy amidst rising tensions with Beijing. The two Chinese chip firms are now on Taiwan's "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List," requiring licenses for domestic firms to ship products to them. This move is aimed at reinforcing existing policies and tightening loopholes, as both Huawei and SMIC are already on a U.S. trade blacklist and impacted by Washington's chip controls. The new export controls could also increase penalties for potential breaches in the future.</p>
