        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state, allowing the case to move forward. The lawsuit alleges that the social media platform intentionally uses manipulative and addictive design features to exploit its younger user base for commercial gain. This legal challenge is part of a broader trend where states are targeting the design and safety policies of tech companies rather than user-generated content. The ruling comes as TikTok's future in the U.S. remains uncertain amid a federal law requiring its parent company, ByteDance, to divest.</p>

          <p>Spain has emerged as a formidable contender at the women's Euro 2025, winning all its group stage matches with an impressive 14 goals scored. The team's success has been driven by standout performances from several key players. Two-time Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas has been instrumental, contributing numerous goals and assists, while midfielder Patri has controlled the game's tempo. Additionally, 18-year-old Vicky Lopez has shown remarkable flair and maturity, and striker Esther Gonzalez currently leads the tournament's scoring charts with her clinical finishing.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has confirmed that the United States has resumed sending military supplies, ending a temporary pause on critical arms shipments. The development follows a deal announced by President Trump where NATO will purchase U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems and provide them to Ukraine to counter a recent surge in Russian aerial attacks. This renewed support comes after Russia intensified its drone and missile strikes, causing record civilian casualties in June. The U.S. is also urging European allies to provide their existing Patriot batteries to expedite Ukraine's defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>Norman Pennington, 67, has been convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole for the killing of 83-year-old Anthony DiCenzo in Fayette County, Pennsylvania. The murder occurred in April 2024, and DiCenzo was found shot to death in his car. Investigators revealed that the two men were longtime friends involved in a business deal, and the motive was a dispute over $30,000 that DiCenzo had given Pennington for a property purchase. Although Pennington confessed, he claimed self-defense, a claim prosecutors said was not supported by evidence.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military is escalating its development of next-generation air combat capabilities by testing the integration of crewed fighter jets with uncrewed "loyal wingman" drones. In a recent exercise, pilots in an F-16 and an F-15 each controlled two XQ-58A Valkyrie drones, testing real-time coordination between human and semi-autonomous systems. This initiative is part of the Air Force's broader push to explore the loyal wingman concept, where uncrewed aircraft are directed by pilots in crewed fighters. The effort represents a critical step in the technological race with China for future air dominance.</p>

          <p>South Carolina is set to erect a statue of Robert Smalls on its Capitol grounds, making it the first monument to a Black man at the site. Smalls, a formerly enslaved man who became a Civil War hero and later a U.S. Congressman, will be honored among existing statues of white men, many of whom have ties to the Confederacy and the Jim Crow era. During the Civil War, Smalls commandeered a Confederate transport ship, sailed it past Confederate defenses, and delivered it to the Union Navy. His statue will represent a significant step in acknowledging the contributions of Black figures in the state's history.</p>
