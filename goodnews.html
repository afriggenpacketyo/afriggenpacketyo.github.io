          <p>According to a Los Angeles Times article, Justin Halstenberg was convicted of igniting the Line fire, which burned 44,000 acres in the San Bernardino Mountains and injured six firefighters. Halstenberg was found guilty of aggravated arson and possession of flammable materials and faces a maximum life sentence. Prosecutors presented evidence showing he deliberately started three fires within an hour, with the third becoming the Line fire, which forced the evacuation of over 11,000 residents. The article also notes that Halstenberg's mother defended him, claiming he did not start the fire, but prosecutors argued he had practiced starting fires previously.</p>

          <p>CBS News reports that the CDC's airport screening program has detected cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, which is linked to a surge in China. Cases have been found in international travelers arriving at airports in California, Washington, Virginia, and New York. Experts are closely monitoring the variant, which is dominant in China and rising in parts of Asia. Preliminary data suggests it may be more transmissible due to its ability to bind to human cells. The FDA's vaccine advisers are considering updating COVID-19 vaccines to target the JN.1 variant, which may also offer protection against NB.1.8.1.</p>
