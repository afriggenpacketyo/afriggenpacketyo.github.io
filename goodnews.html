          <p>A state-backed Chinese think tank, Xinhua Institute, suggests four core principles to resolve disputes in the South China Sea, emphasizing consultation, rules-based co-management, mutually beneficial cooperation, and opposition to external interference. The report asserts China's commitment to managing tensions and exercising restraint. These principles were initially presented in 2002 through an agreement with Asean. The proposal comes amidst increasing face-offs between Chinese and Philippine vessels, particularly near contested shoals and reefs, exacerbating regional tensions.</p>

          <p>An opinion article discusses how China's perception of the United States' threat of "peaceful evolution" has diminished, referencing Mao Zedong's warnings about American conspiracies to subvert the Communist Party. The author notes that while Mao feared the influence of Western values, China has since become a major economic power. The US has shifted away from nation-building and lecturing other countries on governance. This shift marks a significant change in the dynamics between the two nations, as China increasingly challenges America's superpower status.</p>

Airlines and manufacturers are trying to attract younger people through higher wages and training programs.

          <p>Scotland has called up free agent Ross Doohan and Bournemouth's Callan McKenna to address a goalkeeping crisis ahead of their friendly match against Liechtenstein. The move comes after Angus Gunn and Robby McCrorie left the squad, with Cieran Slicker suffering a difficult debut. Head coach Steve Clarke had previously expressed concern about the lack of options in the position. With several regular squad members missing due to injury, the team is turning to Doohan and McKenna for reinforcement.</p>
