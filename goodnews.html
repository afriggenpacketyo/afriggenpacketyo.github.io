          <p>Former LSU gymnast Livvy Dunne has once again publicly criticized The New York Times for a 2022 article about her that used the headline "Sex Sells." Dunne alleges the newspaper's staff instructed her to wear her team leotard for a photoshoot and then used the image to suggest that female athletes' NIL earnings reward feminine desirability over athletic skill. She described the incident on a podcast, reiterating her view that the publication used her image for "clicks" and misrepresented the situation. Dunne has previously called the article "BS" and noted her social media response led to a modeling offer from Sports Illustrated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article compilation from The Atlantic explores the modern family vacation, arguing that such trips are not a cure-all for life's tensions. It highlights that vacations cannot fundamentally change who people are and often come with their own set of dashed hopes and challenges. The pieces discuss the rise of multi-generational travel as a way to understand relatives better and offer practical advice for a happier trip, such as planning ahead and avoiding over-sharing on social media. The overall theme suggests managing expectations is key to making the most of time with loved ones.</p>

          <p>Kayem Foods Inc. is recalling more than 24,000 pounds of its "al fresco CHICKEN SAUSAGE SWEET APPLE" products due to potential contamination with pieces of white plastic. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced the recall after the company received three consumer complaints. The affected ready-to-eat products were produced on June 28 and distributed nationwide. While no injuries have been reported, the FSIS advises consumers to either throw the products away or return them to the place of purchase.</p>

          <p>Author and entrepreneur Scott Galloway identifies "follow your passion" as the worst piece of career advice, suggesting it's a sentiment typically shared by those who are already wealthy. Instead of pursuing passion alone, Galloway advises finding an intersection between one's talents and what is financially viable. He emphasizes that success often comes from enduring rejection and pivoting when necessary, a path he followed from a Morgan Stanley analyst to a successful entrepreneur. The article echoes similar advice from Mastercard's CEO, who recommends combining passion with personal strengths and practical market needs for a successful career.</p>

          <h2>UK Faces Threat of Flash Floods with Widespread Rain and Thunderstorm Alerts</h2>

          <p>The UK is under multiple yellow weather warnings for rain and thunderstorms, raising the risk of flash flooding, power cuts, and travel disruptions across all four nations. An earlier, more severe amber warning for London and the South East did not result in the feared intense rainfall, but localized impacts are still possible. The unsettled weather follows a recent heatwave that left the ground dry and less able to absorb water, increasing flood likelihood. The Met Office has extended alerts into the beginning of the next week, covering large parts of England and Scotland.</p>

          <p>Spanish football club Barcelona has reportedly opened talks to sign Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, who has indicated a desire for a new challenge. The proposed deal is said to be an initial loan with an option to buy, which would be a significant move for both clubs. Rashford, who has been training separately from the United first team, would fulfill his preference to join the Spanish champions. For Manchester United, his departure would provide significant wage bill savings, aiding their efforts to fund new signings for the squad.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang conducted a high-profile visit to China, signaling a potential thaw in Sino-US tech relations. During the trip, Huang announced that Washington had approved the export of a specialized, less powerful AI chip for the Chinese market, following a ban on more advanced models. His visit and the strong presence of U.S. firms at a major expo underscored a recent push for trade negotiations and approvals. However, despite the charm offensive and signs of cooperation, concerns about the broader U.S.-China trade war and technology competition continue to loom.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While Americans on average believe a net worth of $839,000 would make them financially comfortable, financial experts argue this metric can be misleading. Certified financial planner Joy Slabaugh notes that net worth is just a snapshot in time and doesn't reflect one's actual financial reality or cash flow. True financial comfort, she suggests, comes from aligning money management with personal values and goals, such as security or freedom, rather than chasing a specific number. Experts advise focusing on practical steps like managing debt, building savings, and investing for the future to achieve a genuine sense of well-being. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article debunks social media claims that sunscreen use increases the risk of skin cancer, labeling the assertion as false. Public health officials and scientific studies confirm there is no evidence for this link; in fact, UV radiation is the main cause of melanoma, and sunscreen helps protect against it. The rising incidence of skin cancer globally is attributed to factors like better diagnostics, increased sun exposure, and historical use of less effective products, not modern sunscreens. Experts emphasize that despite rising sales, many people still use sunscreen improperly or infrequently, undermining its protective benefits.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has acquired a stake in payment processor Global Payments, a company whose stock has significantly underperformed since 2021. The article suggests Elliott's involvement comes at a critical time, following Global Payments' poorly received, multi-billion dollar acquisition of Worldpay. With investor confidence in management low, Elliott could push for a reconstituted board with experience in large integrations to restore credibility and ensure accountability. This strategic intervention aims to improve execution of the Worldpay deal and ultimately lift the company's depressed share price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of the devastating Texas floods, a summer camp for youth with disabilities has managed to reopen thanks to a massive volunteer cleanup effort. Camp Camp, located 30 miles downstream from the hardest-hit area, suffered extensive damage to its riverfront property. A social media plea for help brought hundreds of volunteers who cleared debris, hauled supplies, and operated heavy machinery to restore the facility. This community response, described as seeing "the best of humanity," has allowed the camp to welcome back its campers, providing a vital space for children and adults with disabilities.</p>

          <p>A 50-year-old woman who believed a lump in her groin was a pulled muscle was diagnosed with metastatic malignant melanoma that had spread to her lungs and brain. The diagnosis was unusual as she never had a visible mole, a typical sign of the skin cancer. She underwent an aggressive treatment combining gamma knife radiation with two immunotherapy drugs, which caused severe side effects but ultimately proved successful. After 18 months, her cancer has not progressed, and her doctor calls her a "Stage IV miracle," highlighting significant advances in treating late-stage melanoma.</p>
