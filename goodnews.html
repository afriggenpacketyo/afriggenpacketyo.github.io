          <p>This Fox News article analyzes President Trump's Middle East trip, suggesting it presented Israel with a historic opportunity despite the president not landing there. Experts argue that Trump advanced policies aligning with Israeli interests, particularly regarding Iran and normalization with Arab states. The article notes continued U.S. support for Israel's security and commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. However, concerns are raised about Israel potentially missing opportunities to leverage U.S. influence in the region, particularly concerning normalization with Saudi Arabia and addressing the situation in Syria. The piece concludes that Israel must act decisively to shape events rather than merely reacting to them.</p>

          <p>This Guardian article discusses how US cancer researchers are exploring the potential of fecal waste biobanks to understand and personalize cancer treatment. The Mayo Clinic's biobank is part of a broader effort to uncover how the microbiome affects patients' responses to cancer medications, with the goal of predicting which drugs will be most effective for individual patients. Researchers are experimenting with fecal transplants to colonize patients' guts with new bacteria. This research comes amid proposed cuts to scientific institutions, raising concerns about the ability of private funding to fill the void left by government support.</p>

          <p>This Los Angeles Times opinion piece argues that the Los Angeles Lakers should prioritize drafting a mature, experienced college graduate in the upcoming NBA draft, emphasizing the value of resilience and proven ability to handle the temptations of money and fame. The article contrasts the current trend of favoring young, high-potential players with the historical success of drafting older, more seasoned athletes. The author suggests that with advancements in technology and nutrition, players in their late 20s are still in their prime, and the Lakers should seek a 24-year-old college graduate with a good head on his shoulders to fill their need for a big man.</p>
