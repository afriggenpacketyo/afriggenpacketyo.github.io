        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As countries like South Korea pivot towards stablecoins, the distinction between these private cryptocurrencies and state-controlled digital currencies like China's e-CNY becomes more critical. The digital yuan, intended for small domestic retail payments, is centrally managed by China's central bank and is not exchangeable for foreign currencies. In contrast, stablecoins are privately issued, blockchain-based tokens pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, backed by reserve assets to maintain their value. This article explores the fundamental differences in their design, purpose, and regulatory oversight, highlighting their distinct roles in the evolving digital finance landscape.</p>

Planned initiatives include a student field trip program to historic landmarks, a proposed National Garden of American Heroes, and an oral history project with the Library of Congress.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that while Zohran Mamdani's socialist primary victory in New York has captured headlines, the true future leaders of the Democratic Party are pragmatic, center-left figures like Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger. Both congresswomen, who recently won their respective gubernatorial primaries in New Jersey and Virginia, have a track record of winning in competitive districts by focusing on consensus-building and kitchen-table economic issues. The author suggests their approach of persuasion over ideological purity, grounded in their national security backgrounds, provides a more viable model for building durable Democratic majorities than performative activism. This piece presents a strategic vision for the party's direction.</p>

          <h2>The Cultural and Historical Roots of American Barbecue</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The tradition of barbecue, a staple of American summer holidays like the Fourth of July, has a rich history originating with Indigenous peoples in the Caribbean. The term itself is derived from the Ta√≠no word "barabicu," which described the wooden frames used for cooking meat over an open fire. Spanish explorers adopted the term as "barbacoa" in the 16th century, and the cooking method and cuisine have since evolved regionally across the United States. Different areas developed unique styles, such as South Carolina's mustard-based sauces and Memphis's sweet, tomato-based sauces, reflecting the influence of local immigrant cultures and available ingredients.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A sweeping domestic policy bill advanced by the Senate includes a provision to increase tax credits for semiconductor manufacturing in the United States from 25% to 35%. This measure aims to incentivize companies like Intel, TSMC, and Micron to expand their advanced manufacturing facilities within the U.S., building on the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. The move is part of Washington's broader strategy to onshore critical technology supply chains and reduce reliance on Asia, particularly amid geopolitical tensions with China. The bill reflects the Trump administration's preference for using tariffs and tax incentives, rather than direct grants, to bolster domestic production. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liverpool FC has turned down a formal approach from German club Bayern Munich for their forward, Luis Diaz, signaling that the player is not for sale. The Premier League club has made it clear to Bayern's sporting director that they will not entertain any discussions for the 28-year-old Colombian international. This follows a similar rejection of an approach from Barcelona earlier in the summer. Liverpool considers Diaz, who scored 22 goals last season, a key and integral member of their squad and is adamant about retaining him for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>The 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, has announced that the institution of the Dalai Lama will continue after his death, ending years of speculation that he might be the last to hold the title.

He emphasized that the process should be free from interference by China, which insists it has the sole authority to approve the next leader. This decision is politically significant for Tibetans and sets the stage for a potential dispute, with the possibility of rival Dalai Lamas being named.</p>

State media reported that domestic tourists were filled with emotion at the site, which is one of leader Kim Jong Un's key development projects aimed at boosting the country's tourism industry. The opening comes as North Korea slowly reopens its borders following the pandemic, with a group of Russian tourists expected to visit soon.

Rather than causing a price drop, the increased supply was met with strong investor demand, as the stock has surged over 1,300% since its 2024 debut. Analysts attribute the company's strong performance to its powerful branding, pricing power, and rapid sales growth, which is projected to continue.

          <p>China's top leadership, led by President Xi Jinping, has signaled a move to regulate the intense price wars affecting many of the country's industries. At a high-level economic meeting, Xi used the term "disorderly low-price competition" to describe the phenomenon, calling for laws to guide companies toward improving product quality and phasing out outdated production capacity. This direct language marks a shift from the previously used, vaguer term "involutionary competition." The focus on curbing aggressive price-cutting is seen by Beijing as essential for fostering innovation, improving efficiency, and ensuring the long-term health of the Chinese economy.</p>

To facilitate the move, the Bucks waived nine-time All-Star guard Damian Lillard, who is recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon and is likely to miss most or all of the upcoming season. The Pacers' decision comes as their own star, Tyrese Haliburton, is also expected to be out for the season with an Achilles injury.
