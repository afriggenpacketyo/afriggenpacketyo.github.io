          <h2>Ryanair to Boost Staff Bonus for Identifying Oversized Cabin Bags</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary announced an increase in the bonus for staff who identify passengers with oversized cabin bags, raising it from €1.50 to €2.50 per bag starting in November. O'Leary stated the measure is intended to deter a small minority of passengers from flouting size limits, emphasizing that the airline is not trying to "catch people out" but rather enforce existing regulations for efficiency. While passengers are allowed a free small carry-on, larger bags can incur charges up to £75, with the airline's rules set to adjust slightly in September due to new EU regulations. O'Leary insists that compliance with these rules will lead to faster boarding processes and fewer flight delays across the network.</p>

          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch reported a slowdown in sales growth for its namesake brand in the fiscal second quarter, with a 5% decline, yet the company hiked its full-year revenue outlook thanks to a robust 19% surge from its teen-focused Hollister brand. Despite the overall 7% sales climb and beating Wall Street expectations, shares were down as the company now anticipates a $90 million hit from tariffs, nearly double its previous estimate, affecting its operating margin. CEO Fran Horowitz noted efforts to clear old inventory and expand into new categories and international markets for Abercrombie, while Hollister's Y2K assortment continues to drive strong performance. The company aims for a return to growth for the Abercrombie brand by year-end. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Claiming Social Security benefits at age 62, the earliest eligibility age, carries significant financial risks that can permanently reduce one's retirement income. This article highlights three key downsides: a permanent reduction of monthly benefits by approximately 6.7% for each year before full retirement age, missing out on delayed retirement credits that increase benefits by 8% annually until age 70, and a potential reduction in survivor benefits for a spouse. The article suggests strategies like tapping retirement savings, considering annuities, utilizing home equity options, or working part-time to delay claiming and maximize benefits. Delaying by even a few years can substantially enhance financial security in retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia is expected to report robust fiscal second-quarter earnings, with analysts projecting 53% year-over-year revenue growth, primarily fueled by insatiable demand for its GPUs in the generative AI era. The data center business, accounting for 88% of sales, will be a key focus, with analysts keen on updates regarding Blackwell chip sales and the company's performance in China. Despite previous warnings of an $8 billion sales loss due to export controls, the Trump administration has since granted licenses for the H20 chip, though China's push for homegrown alternatives poses a new challenge. Nvidia is anticipated to guide for nearly $53 billion in sales for the fiscal third quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Graham Simpson, a Conservative Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP), has defected to Reform UK, appearing alongside leader Nigel Farage to announce his move. Simpson, who has been an MSP for Central Scotland since 2016, described leaving the Conservatives as "an enormous wrench" but expressed a desire to "create something new, exciting and lasting" with Reform. This defection makes him Reform's sole current MSP and is the second departure from the Scottish Conservative Holyrood group in a week. Farage indicated Reform would have a Scottish leader before next year's Holyrood election and might consider a deal with Scottish Labour to oust the SNP.</p>

          <p>Kohl's shares surged over 20% after the retailer significantly surpassed Wall Street's fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations, despite a decline in overall sales. The company narrowed its full-year sales guidance and revised its earnings per share outlook, reflecting ongoing efforts to revitalize the business amidst leadership turmoil and a challenging economic environment. Interim CEO Michael Bender attributed slower sales to lower- and middle-income customers trading down, but highlighted initiatives like reintroducing petite sections, adding jewelry, and overhauling discount strategies to win back shoppers. The beauty partnership with Sephora continues to attract new, younger customers, contributing to improved sales trends throughout the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Chinese woman, identified as Zhou, was dramatically rescued after being trapped for 30 hours in a locked guesthouse room in Sichuan province, having no access to food or a toilet. In a desperate attempt to signal for help, she bit her finger and used her blood to scrawl "110 625" (emergency number and room number) on a pillow, which she then threw from her sixth-floor window. A food delivery driver, Zhang Kun, spotted the plea and immediately alerted the police, leading to her rescue. Zhang was later awarded 3,000 yuan ($419) by local authorities for his quick thinking and crucial role in saving the woman.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered an extraordinary armored dinosaur, Spicomellus afer, in Morocco, distinguished by its meter-long spikes protruding from its neck, earning it the nickname "punk rocker" of its time. Living 165 million years ago, this species is the oldest known ankylosaur, a group of armored dinosaurs, and its elaborate spikiness is forcing experts to rethink their evolutionary theories. Researchers, led by Professors Richard Butler and Susannah Maidment, found the spikes were fused directly onto the bone, a unique feature. The discovery suggests ankylosaurs might have initially developed elaborate armor for display in the Jurassic period, later adapting it for defense against large predators in the Cretaceous.</p>

          <p>A landmark federal ruling is imminent that could dismantle Google's lucrative default search contracts, potentially costing Alphabet over $26 billion annually, with $20 billion going to Apple. While Google risks losing some search traffic, analysts suggest this could ultimately benefit the company by freeing it from costly deals that no longer drive demand, allowing it to redirect funds towards AI and cloud initiatives. The Justice Department's antitrust case, which found Google holds a search monopoly, aims to open the market to competitors, though past European rulings show Google's market share remains robust even without exclusive deals. The evolving landscape of generative AI is seen as a new frontier where Google aims to solidify its dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

This initiative, driven by growing threats and NATO commitments, requires all 18-year-old men to complete a questionnaire, with medical examinations becoming obligatory for men starting July 2027. The plan includes increased salaries, free accommodation, healthcare, and travel to attract recruits for six to 23 months of service.
