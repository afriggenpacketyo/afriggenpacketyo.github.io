          <p>Shares of Kering, the French fashion house owning Gucci and Saint Laurent, surged by 7% following reports that Renault's Luca de Meo is set to become the group's CEO. De Meo's potential appointment comes as Kering seeks to revitalize its Gucci brand, which has experienced declining sales and designer changes. Analysts suggest that de Meo's experience in brand management and technological innovation at Renault could be beneficial, but acknowledge the challenges in turning around luxury brands. Kering's shares have dropped over 60% in the past two years due to profit warnings and struggles with the Gucci label. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bayern Munich began their Club World Cup campaign with a dominant 10-0 victory over Auckland City in Cincinnati, Ohio. Despite the resounding win, some Bayern supporters voiced criticism of FIFA and tournament organizers, citing concerns over governance and sponsorship. The banner unfurled behind the goal referenced the luxury Swiss hotel in which several high-ranking FIFA executives were arrested on corruption charges in May 2015. Borussia Dortmund is set to begin their campaign on Tuesday against Brazilian giants Fluminense.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has added China's Huawei and SMIC to its trade blacklist, further aligning with U.S. trade policy amid growing tensions with Beijing. The two leading Chinese chip firms have been placed on Taiwan's "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List," requiring licenses for domestic firms to ship products to them. This move reinforces existing policies and tightens loopholes, potentially raising penalties for future breaches. Both Huawei and SMIC are also on a U.S. trade blacklist, impacting their access to advanced chips.</p>
