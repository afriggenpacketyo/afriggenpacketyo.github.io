          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed southeast of Bermuda and is currently moving northeast over the open ocean. The National Hurricane Center reports that the storm has maximum sustained winds of 40 mph and is not expected to make landfall. Forecasters predict Fernand could strengthen into a hurricane by Monday before weakening later in the week as it travels across the subtropical North Atlantic. This storm follows Hurricane Erin and is part of a season that NOAA has forecast to be above-normal, with 13 to 18 named storms anticipated.</p>

          <p>Coyotes are increasingly adapting to urban environments across the United States, with a notable pair named Romeo and Juliet now residing in New York's Central Park. These animals, which have expanded their territory eastward over the last century due to a decline in predators, have become a subject of fascination for local photographers and wildlife enthusiasts. Experts emphasize that coyotes are not a significant threat to humans and advocate for coexistence, urging people to give them space and not feed them. This situation reflects a broader trend of wildlife adapting to city life and the evolving human response to their presence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "performative male" has emerged as a new social archetype on TikTok, describing men who adopt an alternative, intellectual, and "soft" aesthetic, often to appeal to progressive women. This character is identified by traits like reading feminist literature, listening to indie female artists, and drinking matcha, leading to public contests where men perform this role. While often lighthearted, the trend also taps into a deeper skepticism about whether these behaviors are genuine or a deceptive strategy. The discussion reflects broader internet conversations about evolving masculinity, privilege, and the inherent performance of gender in modern dating.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Notting Hill Carnival began in west London with its traditional children's parade, filling the streets with vibrant costumes and music. Europe's largest street party kicked off at dawn with J'ouvert, a celebration where revelers cover themselves in colorful paint and powder to mark the opening of the festivities. The annual event, which has been running for over 50 years, will also include a 72-second silence at 3 p.m. on both days. This moment of reflection honors the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire, as well as others who have passed away at the carnival in recent years.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, former EPA administrator Gina McCarthy criticizes the Trump administration's focus on fossil fuels and its disregard for escalating climate risks. She argues that despite the federal government's inaction, significant progress is being made at the state, city, and corporate levels across the United States. McCarthy points to record-setting solar and wind energy production in states like California, Florida, and Texas as evidence that a clean energy future is both viable and economically beneficial. She asserts that this grassroots momentum demonstrates a refusal to let the current administration dictate the country's environmental fate.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. Open draws attention, the article highlights tennis as a premier lifetime sport with extensive health benefits that extend well into old age. The sport provides a full-body, aerobic workout that improves bone density and cardiovascular health, with one study linking it to a nearly decade-longer lifespan compared to sedentary peers. Beyond its physical advantages, tennis offers significant cognitive benefits by requiring complex motor coordination, rapid decision-making, and spatial awareness, which can help buffer against cognitive decline. Its accessibility and social nature make it an engaging and sustainable form of exercise for people of all ages.</p>

          <p>An author reflects on the profound experience of reading aloud to her newborn, a practice that transformed from a personal comfort into a powerful tool for connection and understanding. Initially reading complex novels and poetry, she adapted to simple, high-contrast board books, realizing the process was not just about instilling a love of literature but also about learning to interpret her child's reactions and development. This shared activity became a way to teach her child about the world while simultaneously learning to "read" her child's emerging personality. The essay suggests this practice offers invaluable benefits for both parent and child.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues for a shift in perspective on artificial intelligence, advocating for its use as a collaborative tool that enhances human expertise rather than a tool for premature automation that aims to replace it. Using examples from radiology and aviation, it illustrates how imperfect automation can undermine human skills and lead to poor outcomes. Instead of designing AI to automate entire jobs, which is often infeasible, developers should create systems that complement human strengths like context, intuition, and ethical judgment. This collaborative approach can lead to better results, prevent skill decay, and provide a more effective path to integrating AI into high-stakes professions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book proposes a novel approach to climate change: treating excess atmospheric carbon as a sacred commodity to be hoarded, much like the U.S. government sequesters gold. The concept involves creating community-based carbon banks that would convert organic waste into biochar, a stable form of carbon, and in return, issue a local digital currency to depositors. This grassroots system aims to create both financial and spiritual incentives for carbon sequestration, operating independently of government regulation. The authors argue that if society can render gold priceless by taking it out of circulation, a similar cultural shift could be applied to carbon.</p>

Chukwuemeka is set for a permanent transfer for a fee of around £24 million, while Anselmino will join the German club on a season-long loan. These sales are crucial for Chelsea to comply with UEFA's financial regulations, which require the club to record a positive transfer balance to register new players for the Champions League.
