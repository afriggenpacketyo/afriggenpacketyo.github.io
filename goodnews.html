          <p>Nvidia's stock concluded a fifth consecutive day of gains, setting new records and reaffirming its position as the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization around $3.8 trillion. This surge occurred despite ongoing concerns about U.S. export controls on high-end chips to China, which CEO Jensen Huang noted has impacted potential sales. At a recent shareholder meeting, Huang highlighted robotics as the next major growth opportunity for the company, envisioning a future with billions of robots and autonomous vehicles powered by Nvidia technology.

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has become the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for June, surging 44% in its best month since November. The rally is attributed to its recent inclusion in the benchmark index, positive regulatory developments like the Senate's GENIUS Act for stablecoins, and new product launches. Analysts suggest the market may not have fully priced in Coinbase's lucrative revenue-sharing agreement with Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, which has itself soared since its public debut. Despite concerns over declining trading volumes, the overall sentiment is that legislative clarity could provide further catalysts for growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Honduran experimental pop artist Isabella Lovestory is releasing her second album, "Vanity," which draws inspiration from folklore, mid-2000s club music, and John Waters films. The record explores themes of self-image and beauty through a unique blend of electroclash and reggaeton, creating what she calls a "poisonous lollipop" of contrasting sounds. As a self-sustaining artist who handles her own visuals and creative direction, Lovestory injects a punk, DIY ethos into her pop persona. Her music reflects her multicultural background, with multilingual tracks that contribute to her distinct, post-genre artistic identity.</p>

          <h2>Economists Explain Why Recent U.S. Tariffs Have Not Yet Caused Significant Inflation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 15:13:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite fears that President Trump's recent tariffs would reignite inflation, U.S. prices have remained relatively stable, with key inflation gauges showing only modest increases. Economists attribute this to several short-term factors, including companies pre-ordering goods to avoid duties, absorbing some costs to protect consumers, and using logistical loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay payments. However, experts caution that this buffering effect is likely temporary and that the impact of higher import costs will probably translate into noticeable inflation in the second half of the year.

          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement to accelerate shipments of rare-earth minerals to America, a move that provided a temporary boost to U.S. stock markets. The deal aims to resolve supply chain disruptions caused when China restricted exports of these critical minerals in retaliation for U.S. tariffs. These materials are vital for numerous industries, including automotive, aerospace, and defense manufacturing. While the agreement marks progress in the ongoing trade disputes, the complexity of ensuring these materials are not diverted for military use remains a significant challenge.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With home equity levels at a record high, homeowners are weighing whether a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC) will be the cheaper borrowing option this summer. Currently, both products have nearly identical interest rates, but this is expected to change. Because HELOCs have variable rates tied to federal actions, they are positioned to become less expensive if the Federal Reserve enacts anticipated rate cuts. However, a fixed-rate home equity loan offers certainty against potential market volatility, making the choice dependent on a borrower's risk tolerance. (not investment advice)</p>

This tour represents a significant opportunity for Russell, whose previous Lions experiences were unfulfilling.

          <p>Nearly three decades ago, a female gorilla named Binti Jua became an international hero at the Brookfield Zoo near Chicago. When a 3-year-old boy fell into her enclosure, the 8-year-old gorilla gently picked up the unconscious child, cradled him, and carried him to a service door for zookeepers. Her actions, which many attributed to motherly instinct, stood in stark contrast to the tragic 2016 incident involving the gorilla Harambe. Binti Jua, whose name means "daughter of sunshine," is still alive and celebrated her 37th birthday at the Brookfield Zoo this year.</p>
