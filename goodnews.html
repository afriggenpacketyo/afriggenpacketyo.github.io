          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 12:53:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, the average rate for a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has fallen below 8%, making it a more affordable borrowing option. For a $70,000 HELOC, this translates to monthly savings of around $30 compared to rates from the previous year, with current payments estimated at $845 for a 10-year term. The article explains that because HELOCs have variable rates, borrowers are benefiting from the cooling rate environment without needing to refinance. This analysis suggests that for homeowners needing financing, a HELOC may be a cost-effective choice in the current economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

The company is experimenting with ingredients like paprika, turmeric, and purple sweet potatoes to replace synthetic dyes in popular items such as Flamin' Hot Cheetos and Mountain Dew. This multi-year process involves significant research and development to ensure the taste, shelf life, and appearance of the products remain consistent and appealing to consumers.

          <p>Linda Murphy, a Massachusetts woman who passed away from ALS, has become a viral sensation after writing her own witty and heartfelt obituary. In her self-penned tribute, she humorously reflected on her life, her love for parties, and the frustrations of her illness, stating she "died of FOMO due to complications of ALS." Murphy also used the platform to encourage kindness and requested that instead of flowers, people buy scratch tickets to give to strangers and make them happy. Her daughter shared that this was characteristic of her mother's vibrant personality and desire to bring laughter to others.</p>

          <p>Jane Goodall, the revolutionary primatologist who transformed the world's understanding of chimpanzees, has passed away at the age of 91. Her career began in the 1960s in Tanzania, where her observations of tool use and complex social behaviors in chimps challenged long-held scientific beliefs. Initially a reluctant public figure, she skillfully used her fame to advocate for conservation, founding the Jane Goodall Institute and the youth program Roots and Shoots. Goodall transitioned from a scientist to a global activist, traveling extensively to promote environmental protection and compassion for all living beings, leaving behind an enduring legacy.</p>

          <p>Fair Isaac Corp., the company behind the FICO credit score, has announced a significant change to its business model that will allow it to license scores directly to mortgage resellers. This move, which could let lenders bypass credit bureaus, sent the company's stock surging over 20% while shares for bureaus like Experian and TransUnion fell sharply. The new plan offers lenders a choice between two pricing models, a change Fair Isaac says will eliminate unnecessary markups and give more control to mortgage decision-makers. The Federal Housing Finance Agency director praised the move as a creative solution to help consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actress Sarah Jessica Parker has reflected on the decision to end the "Sex and the City" revival, "And Just Like That," stating it was a respectful choice to "gracefully walk away when things feel really right." While suggesting the door might not be fully closed, she is focusing on her other passion, publishing. Through her book imprint, SJP Lit, she has selected "I Am You" by Victoria Redel as her latest pick. The historical novel explores the relationship between two real-life female artists in 17th-century Amsterdam, a story Parker praised for its skillful blend of fact and dramatic fiction.</p>

          <p>Tesla announced it delivered 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter, a 7% increase compared to the same period last year, though production saw a slight decline. The delivery numbers narrowly beat analyst expectations, driven in part by a rush of U.S. buyers ahead of the expiration of a federal EV tax credit. While sales in Europe have slumped due to increased competition and backlash against CEO Elon Musk, the company's performance was bolstered by the strong U.S. market. The electric vehicle maker also reported significant growth in its energy storage business, deploying 12.5 GWh of its battery products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The English Premier League is considering replacing its current Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR), which limit club losses to £105 million over three years. Chief executive Richard Masters confirmed that discussions are underway about adopting an alternative system more aligned with UEFA's regulations, which are based on a squad cost ratio. This new model would allow clubs to spend a certain percentage of their revenue on player-related costs, potentially offering more flexibility for investment. A decision on whether to scrap the controversial PSR in favor of the new system is expected to be made in the coming months.</p>

          <p>For the eighth consecutive year, Finland has been named the happiest country on Earth, a title that many Finns themselves find surprising. According to the World Happiness Report, the ranking is based on life satisfaction rather than daily expressions of joy, and Finland's success is attributed to a strong sense of societal contentment. Key factors include a robust social safety net funded by high taxes, free access to extensive public resources like state-of-the-art libraries, a deep cultural connection to nature, and the national tradition of sauna. This contentment reflects a society where citizens feel well-cared for and have opportunities regardless of income.</p>

          <p>This article explores the significant positive effects of regular exercise on mental well-being, noting that physical activity stimulates mood-balancing neurochemicals like serotonin and beta-endorphins. While all forms of exercise are beneficial, aerobic activities like running appear to have the strongest influence on mood, while yoga is effective for stress management and weightlifting can boost self-confidence. The largest happiness gains are seen in sedentary individuals who start a new routine. The author advises moderation, as exercise can become an unhealthy addiction, and suggests that simply starting with a daily walk can profoundly lower depression and anxiety.</p>

While hurricane-force gusts were recorded, the worst of the storm has passed, and there have been no immediate reports of significant damage. A tropical storm warning remains in effect for the archipelago, but the system is now moving farther out into the Atlantic Ocean. Swells generated by Imelda are still expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along much of the U.S. East Coast.</p>

Investigators were able to identify Halstenberg as the suspect after an automatic license plate reader linked his truck to the area where the fire started.

          <p>A team of researchers from Purdue University is planning an expedition to a remote Pacific island, Nikumaroro, to investigate a "visual anomaly" they believe is the wreckage of Amelia Earhart's lost aircraft. The object, visible in satellite imagery of a lagoon since 1938, is considered "very strong" evidence of the Electra 10E plane that disappeared in 1937. The team will use sonar and magnetometers to scan the object before attempting to dredge it for identification. If confirmed, the discovery could finally solve the enduring mystery of the pioneering aviator's fate and fulfill her plan to return the plane to the university.</p>
