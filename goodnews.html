          <p>The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) will invest over ¬£1 billion in developing battlefield technology to expedite decision-making, leveraging AI and software, as revealed in the government's strategic defense review. This initiative, prompted by lessons from the war in Ukraine, aims to better connect soldiers with satellite, aircraft, and drone-provided information, enhancing target identification. The MoD also reported facing over 90,000 cyber-attacks in the past two years, leading to the establishment of a new Cyber and Electromagnetic Command. The investment is supported by the government's commitment to increase defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, although the NATO Secretary-General is pushing for allies to exceed 3.5%.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal court has blocked President Trump's sweeping tariffs, delivering a major blow to his economic policies, ruling that the invoked emergency law did not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court stated that the Constitution gives Congress exclusive power to regulate commerce with other nations. The Trump administration quickly appealed the ruling, which was based on cases brought by the Liberty Justice Center and a coalition of US state governments. Global markets reacted positively, with stock markets in Asia rising and the US dollar gaining strength.</p>

          <p>The UK government has outlined its plans to reform the pension industry by creating ¬£25 billion "megafunds" that will be instructed to invest a portion of their assets locally to stimulate economic growth. These reforms, designed to emulate the successful pension investment funds of Australia and Canada, aim to improve returns for workers and channel billions into clean energy and high-growth businesses. While seventeen of the UK's largest pension firms have already approved the reforms in a voluntary agreement, the government is including a legislative back-stop to ensure progress by the end of the decade. The reforms will be part of the Pension Schemes Bill.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. trade court has ruled that Donald Trump's sweeping tariff regime is illegal, potentially blocking his controversial global trade policy. The court's decision, resulting from lawsuits arguing that Trump exceeded his authority, states that his tariff orders "exceed any authority granted to the president...to regulate importation by means of tariffs". Financial markets reacted positively, with the US dollar rallying, though the Trump administration has already filed an appeal. The ruling, if upheld, would significantly undermine Trump's strategy to use tariffs for trade concessions and to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% year-on-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by demand ahead of the impact of higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. Global production also increased by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, marking an all-time high for April. While Toyota stated it will not pass the tariff costs onto consumers, analysts believe the company may face pressure to do so if the higher levy remains long-term. Despite solid demand in the United States, Honda Motor Co. experienced a 4.8% drop in global sales, impacted by poor sales in China and Japan.</p>

          <p>Chinese startup DeepSeek has quietly released an upgraded version of its R1 AI reasoning model, intensifying competition with rivals like Meta and OpenAI. The company did not make an official announcement, but the upgrade was released on AI model repository Hugging Face. DeepSeek gained prominence earlier this year when its free, open-source R1 model outperformed competitors, raising concerns about overspending by U.S. tech giants. The upgraded model is a reasoning model capable of executing complex tasks through logical thought processes and is benchmarked just behind OpenAI's o4-mini and o3 models on LiveCodeBench.</p>

Wu believes Trump will exercise more restraint with tariffs, considering their mixed results, and may explore measures related to science, diplomacy, and security. Wu noted that tariffs had limited impact on China but significant side effects for the US, prompting the need to be alert to other potential strategies from Washington.</p>

          <p>Remember Monday, the UK's first all-female group at Eurovision since 1999, is planning their "summer of our dreams" following the competition in Switzerland. The trio, who co-wrote and performed "What The Hell Just Happened?", finished 19th in the grand final and are now preparing to tour the UK and make appearances at music festivals. Their song is currently charting at number 31, and the group hopes to return to the studio to record new music soon. The group described the Eurovision experience as one filled with "memories that will last a lifetime."</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, suggested that purchases of U.S. defense equipment may help reduce the trade deficit and could be used as a bargaining chip in bilateral tariff talks. While stating that tariff negotiations and security matters are based on different logic, Akazawa acknowledged the possibility of including defense purchases in the scope of trade talks. Japan aims to have higher tariffs on cars, car parts, steel, and aluminum withdrawn, as well as a "reciprocal" tariff. The Trump administration has resisted completely removing the new levies, seeking a tariff-cutting agreement.</p>
