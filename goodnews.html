        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Cognition announced its acquisition of Windsurf, an AI coding company, just days after Google hired away Windsurf's CEO and senior staff in a major licensing deal. The acquisition includes Windsurf's intellectual property and personnel, highlighting the intense competition for top talent among tech giants like Google, Meta, and OpenAI. Cognition's CEO assured that all Windsurf employees would be treated with fairness and respect as the two companies merge their efforts. This move consolidates talent within two firms backed by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, underscoring the high stakes in the AI industry.</p>

          <p>Meta announced the removal of approximately 10 million Facebook profiles during the first half of 2025 as part of a significant effort to combat spam and inauthentic activity. The company is implementing stricter measures to demote unoriginal content, including AI-generated material, and promote posts from original creators. This initiative also involved taking action against 500,000 accounts for spammy behavior by reducing their content's distribution and monetization potential. The move comes as social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube grapple with a surge in low-quality, mass-produced content fueled by advancements in AI technology.</p>

          <p>Following the end of a decade-long civil war and the removal of the country's dictator, millions of Syrian refugees are now considering a return to their homeland. Many who fled to neighboring countries, particularly Turkey, are assessing the situation in Syria as it begins the slow process of recovery. The decision is a complex one, as they weigh the prospects of rebuilding their lives in a nation ravaged by conflict against the challenges of life as expatriates. This pivotal moment marks a potential turning point for the Syrian diaspora and the future of the nation itself.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on the GENIUS Act, a bill aimed at creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins, as part of its "Crypto Week." Proponents argue the legislation will enhance investor protection and U.S. competitiveness by establishing clear rules for issuing these digital currencies, which are pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. Critics, however, express concerns that the bill could compromise crypto's decentralized nature and create opportunities for corruption. The outcome could significantly impact the $238 billion stablecoin market by potentially increasing mainstream adoption and competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian officials have positively received President Trump's announcement of a new deal to supply significant U.S. military aid, paid for by European allies. The deal is seen as a major improvement in relations with Washington and a crucial step in bolstering Ukraine's defense capabilities, particularly its air defense systems. Conversely, officials and commentators in Moscow have largely dismissed Trump's accompanying threat of severe sanctions if the war does not end in 50 days, viewing it as political posturing. The differing reactions highlight the complex geopolitical dynamics as Ukraine secures vital support while Russia projects confidence against economic pressure.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the "age 75 rule," a common belief suggesting that retirees should wait until age 75 to purchase an annuity to receive higher payouts. While it's true that payouts increase with age because of shorter life expectancy calculations, the rule oversimplifies a complex financial decision. Waiting until 75 could mean forgoing years of guaranteed income, drawing down other assets, and facing risks related to changing health and insurability. The best time to buy an annuity depends on individual circumstances, including retirement goals, other income sources, and risk tolerance, rather than an arbitrary age. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. is implementing a new strategy to reduce its reliance on China for rare earth metals, which are crucial for military and tech applications. Through a Department of Defense deal, domestic miner MP Materials will receive a guaranteed minimum price for its rare earths, nearly double the current market rate set by China. This move is designed to create a separate, higher pricing system to incentivize investment in Western production and challenge China's control over 90% of the global supply. Analysts believe this benchmark will pull global prices up, benefiting producers but potentially increasing costs for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>
