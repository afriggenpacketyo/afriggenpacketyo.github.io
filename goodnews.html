          <p>Apple has integrated a new suite of custom-designed chips into its latest iPhones, signaling a strategic shift to prioritize on-device artificial intelligence and gain greater control over its hardware. The new A19 Pro chip features neural accelerators on its GPU cores, while the N1 wireless chip and C1X modem reduce reliance on previous suppliers like Broadcom and Qualcomm. Company executives state that this vertical integration allows for enhanced performance, better power efficiency, and improved privacy by processing more AI tasks directly on the device. This move positions Apple to compete more effectively in the escalating AI technology race.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch are likely part of an investor group aiming to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations, alongside tech leaders Larry Ellison and Michael Dell. This potential deal is driven by a U.S. law requiring the app's divestment from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, over national security concerns. The White House has suggested a deal could be finalized soon, with Oracle set to manage U.S. user data and have control over the app's algorithm to address privacy and security issues.</p>

In the fifth inning, Young made a juggling, "hacky-sack" style catch by kicking the ball to himself after it was dislodged from his glove upon hitting the wall. He followed this in the ninth inning with a leaping grab at the fence to rob a potential game-tying home run, dealing a significant blow to the Mets' chances in the tight National League wildcard race.</p>

          <p>South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung stated that he would accept a potential deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un for North Korea to freeze its nuclear weapons program. In a BBC interview, Lee described such an agreement as a "feasible, realistic alternative" and an "interim emergency measure," rather than insisting on the long-term goal of complete denuclearization, for which talks have stalled. He expressed hope that the apparent mutual trust between Trump and Kim could provide a new path toward reducing tensions on the Korean peninsula.</p>

          <p>A 93rd-minute goal from Gabriel Martinelli allowed Arsenal to secure a 1-1 draw against Manchester City, denying the visitors a crucial Premier League victory. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola had implemented an unusually defensive 5-5-0 formation after taking an early lead, a tactic that nearly succeeded. The last-minute equalizer represents a significant setback for both teams' title aspirations and serves as a major boost for league leaders Liverpool, who now sit five points clear at the top of the table.</p>

          <p>Pete Buttigieg has responded to a revelation in Kamala Harris's new memoir that he was her top choice for a running mate in 2024 but was ultimately not selected. Harris wrote that she believed a ticket with a Black woman and a gay man would be "too big of a risk" for America to accept. In his reaction, Buttigieg stated that he was surprised by the excerpt and believes in giving "Americans more credit," suggesting that voters are primarily concerned with policy results rather than candidates' identities.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris was unable to fully capitalize on a difficult weekend for his teammate and championship rival, Oscar Piastri, at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix. While Piastri crashed in qualifying and in the race, Norris could only manage a seventh-place finish, gaining just six points in the title race. Norris attributed his result to a poor qualifying session impacted by tricky conditions, arguing that overtaking was nearly impossible in the race. The weekend's results allowed Red Bull's Max Verstappen to gain ground on both McLaren drivers.</p>
