Clouatre, who was breastfeeding her newborn at the time of her arrest, was taken into custody due to an old deportation order she was unaware of. Her husband, Adrian, advocated tirelessly for her release, which came after intervention from Senator John Kennedy's office. While she is now home with her family under parole conditions, she still faces a lengthy immigration process to secure a green card.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's anti-corruption agencies have arrested a member of parliament and other officials in connection with a major bribery scheme involving military procurement. The officials are accused of inflating prices by up to 30% on state contracts for drones and electronic warfare systems. President Volodymyr Zelensky affirmed a "zero tolerance" policy for corruption, praising the agencies for their work. This development comes shortly after the independence of these anti-corruption bodies was restored following public protests, a move crucial for Ukraine's ongoing bid to join the European Union.</p>

Initially a cypherpunk project, it now underpins trillions of dollars in stablecoin transactions, tokenized real-world assets, and decentralized finance applications used by major institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin and industry leaders note that institutions value Ethereum for its stability and programmability, making it the preferred platform for building new financial products despite the emergence of faster blockchains.

          <p>A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts federal immigration agents from conducting "roving" raids based on factors like race or speaking Spanish. The court agreed that such factors alone do not constitute reasonable suspicion for detaining an individual, a violation of the 4th Amendment. The case stems from controversial sweeps by the Trump administration in Southern California that targeted locations like car washes and tow yards. Pro-immigrant advocates praised the decision as a protection of constitutional rights, while the administration criticized it as judicial overreach.</p>

          <p>As former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn establishes a new left-wing party, this article examines the critical and complex process of choosing a political party's name. Experts suggest a name should be simple, resonate with modern voters, and effectively convey the party's core essence for branding and online sharing. Corbyn and his fellow MP Zarah Sultana have opted to let their supporters suggest a name, highlighting a modern, grassroots approach. However, they face strict Electoral Commission rules and the risk of public ridicule if the chosen name fails to land well.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has shared that the premature death of his stepfather was the catalyst for his decision to leave his career as a doctor and pursue comedy. In a radio interview, Hill explained that he felt unsuited to medicine and was at the end of his tether with the profession. Witnessing his stepfather pass away at 54, before he could enjoy retirement, made Hill realize he did not want the same fate. This personal tragedy, he said, ultimately set him free to follow his passion for entertainment in the early 1990s.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a key advocate for open-source artificial intelligence with its Llama models, has indicated it will be more careful with its open-source strategy in the future. This shift in approach contrasts sharply with China, where a vibrant and competitive open-source AI ecosystem is rapidly advancing. Computer scientist Andrew Ng suggests this "Darwinian" environment in China, with companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI releasing powerful new models, could be the country's path to surpassing the US in the field. While top proprietary models are still American, China is now leading in the development of top open-source models.</p>

          <p>Researchers have uncovered the likely cause of death for 'Winston,' a platypus gifted to Prime Minister Winston Churchill by Australia in 1943. For decades, it was rumored the creature died from shell-shock after its ship encountered a German U-boat. However, archival research of the attendant's logbook reveals a more mundane cause: the platypus likely succumbed to prolonged high temperatures and insufficient food as the ship crossed the equator. The failure of this early attempt at "platypus diplomacy" was kept secret for years to avoid a potential diplomatic incident during World War Two.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly relying on the development of large-scale theme parks to boost its economy and fuel consumer spending. The recent opening of the world's largest Legoland resort is the latest example of this trend, adding to the more than 4,400 attractions already operating nationwide. According to the global theme park industry association, IAAPA, the number of such facilities is projected to grow significantly in the coming years.
