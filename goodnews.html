          <h2>Scientists Confirm 'Selective Hearing' is a Genuine Neurological Function</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 11:00:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research indicates that "selective hearing" is not a conscious choice but a real neurological process known as "auditory selective attention." This brain function automatically filters and prioritizes important sounds, like a specific voice in a noisy room, while tuning out background noise. This process involves the auditory and prefrontal cortexes and can be affected by cognitive load and fatigue. While occasional instances are normal, persistent issues could signify underlying hearing loss, which forces the brain to work harder and can impact cognitive health over time.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an excerpt from his new book, Dr. Sanjay Gupta details breakthroughs in understanding and treating chronic pain, emphasizing a shift toward "bedside to the bench" research that starts with patient experience. This approach has led to the discovery of objective biomarkers for pain by mapping neural signals directly from the brain. Neuroscientist Prasad Shirvalkar's work is highlighted, involving implanting electrodes to track and even predict pain bursts in patients. This allows for targeted deep brain stimulation to interrupt pain signals, offering a revolutionary, though not yet widely available, treatment for a condition rooted in the brain's circuitry.</p>

          <p>Musician John Fogerty, at 80, has released a new album featuring re-recordings of his iconic Creedence Clearwater Revival songs, titled "Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years (John's Version)." After years of legal battles where he lost control over his own music, Fogerty, with encouragement from his wife Julie, recently repurchased the rights to his catalog. The new album is a family affair, recorded with his sons Shane and Tyler, who are part of his touring band. Fogerty reflects on the pain of being unable to perform his own songs and the joy of finally reclaiming his musical legacy.</p>

          <p>The UK has finalized its largest-ever warship export deal by value, a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The Ministry of Defence states the deal will support 4,000 UK jobs, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be built. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 British and Norwegian anti-submarine frigates. The agreement is seen as a major victory for the British defense industry, chosen over competitors from France, Germany, and the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a humorous commentary, comedian Jim Gaffigan confesses his problem with gardening is not a lack of success, but rather an overabundance of it, particularly with cucumbers. He humorously recounts his annual cycle of ambitious May planting, including a "succession planting" strategy that he now realizes was a mistake. This has led to a relentless and overwhelming harvest of cucumbers that his family and various recipes cannot keep up with. Gaffigan concludes that despite his best intentions each year, he only realizes in August that his gardening skills have once again resulted in a comical surplus.</p>

          <p>Germany is marking the 10th anniversary of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's famous declaration, "wir schaffen das" ("we can do it"), which opened the country's borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees. A decade later, the nation is grappling with the complex legacy of this policy, which has reshaped its society and politics. While data shows that nearly two-thirds of refugees from that wave were employed by 2022, challenges in integration and a rise in support for the far-right AfD persist. The anniversary prompts a national discussion on the successes and failures of the integration efforts and the future of immigration in Germany.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed painter Alex Katz, now 98, is shifting focus from his own work to championing other artists through a new exhibition at Maine's Portland Museum of Art. Titled "Painting Energy," the show features over a hundred paintings he gifted to the museum from his foundation's collection. Katz, known for his distinctive figurative style, says he wants to help other artists who faced the same difficulties he did early in his career. The collection includes works by both emerging and established artists, selected by Katz for the "pow" or energy he feels from them, rather than any similarity to his own style.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that getting children to listen stems from building emotional safety and connection, not just demanding obedience. The article outlines six "magic phrases" designed to calm a child's nervous system and foster cooperation. Phrases like "I believe you" and "Let's figure this out together" defuse shame and prevent power struggles by turning parents into allies. The core principle is that children are more receptive when they feel heard, respected, and emotionally supported, making listening a natural outcome of a secure relationship.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, the author challenges the common liberal disdain for hunting, arguing it is a more honest, ethical, and sustainable way to consume meat compared to factory farming. Recounting her own journey from a French city-dweller to a hunter in Montana, she describes the profound connection and respect for the animal and ecosystem that hunting fosters. The author contends that hunters are often deeply invested in conservation, with license fees and firearm taxes funding wildlife management. She suggests that hunters and vegetarians share common ground in their deep consideration of food ethics, urging a more nuanced view of the practice.</p>

He discusses finding a connection with Springsteen through the artist's feelings of fraudulence and the generational trauma explored in his work, which echoed themes from his role in "The Bear."

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, illuminates the forgotten history of how surfing was introduced to the American mainland in 1885. The sport was brought to the shores of Santa Cruz by three teenage Hawaiian princes—David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui—who were attending a nearby military school. Missing the waves of their home, they crafted surfboards from local redwood and demonstrated the royal sport of "surfboard swimming" to amazed locals. This event planted the seed for the sport's popularity in the U.S., long before it was globally popularized by Duke Kahanamoku in the 20th century.</p>

The iconic single-use items, common in sushi takeaways, are being targeted because their small size makes them difficult to recycle, despite being made of recyclable plastic. The ban, which takes effect on Monday, builds on previous legislation that outlawed plastic bags, straws, and other single-use items. Officials hope the move will help reduce plastic waste that can persist in the environment for centuries and protect marine life.</p>

The author addresses the common feeling of guilt over one's own success when humanitarian and political disasters are unfolding. Drawing on religious and philosophical traditions that view humanity as a single interconnected body, the piece argues that feeling others' pain is a moral response. However, it also posits that this connection should extend to feeling others' joys, a concept known as "sympathetic joy." The author concludes that acknowledging both the world's horrors and its delights is a form of resistance and a way to maintain a balanced, connected soul.</p>
