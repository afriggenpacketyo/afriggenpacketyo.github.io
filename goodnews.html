          <p>NATO allies are expected to pledge increased defense spending, potentially reaching 5% of their GDP, during their annual summit. The U.S. is pushing for this increase, comprising 3.5% for defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure, but some members are hesitant. Kurt Volker, former U.S. ambassador to NATO, anticipates potential clashes if messaging is not aligned, as some allies may try to dilute spending pledges. The summit occurs amidst the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and Middle East tensions, making it a crucial meeting in NATO's history, as some European aerospace and defense companies are eager for concrete government procurement commitments to scale up their production capacity.</p>

          <h2>NHS Ketamine Clinic Proposed for Treatment-Resistant Depression</h2>

          <p>An NHS psychiatrist in Scotland hopes to establish a ketamine clinic by the end of the year, offering the drug as an alternative treatment for severe depression. This initiative follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors. Professor Andrew McIntosh believes ketamine could provide additional hope for patients who do not respond well to other treatments. </p>

          <h2>Global Markets Appear Calm Following US Strikes on Iran</h2>

          <p>Despite the U.S. joining the war between Israel and Iran, global markets have largely remained stable, with many strategists viewing the conflict as contained. The MSCI World index saw only a slight decline, and safe-haven assets traded mixed. Wedbush's Dan Ives believes the market views the attack as a relief, reducing the nuclear threat in the region. Other experts caution against dismissing the gravity of the situation but do not see it as a systemic risk to global markets. </p>

          <h2>Japan Appears to Support US Strikes on Iranian Nuclear Sites</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 01:01:09 EDT</div>

          <p>The Japanese government has indicated support for the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, stating that they signal Washington's resolve to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya acknowledged U.S. efforts to pursue dialogue and reiterated Japan's hope for a resumption of talks between the U.S. and Iran. While traditionally maintaining amicable ties with Iran, Japan's security alliance with the U.S. remains strong. This stance reflects Japan's concern for stability in the Middle East, given its dependence on the region for crude oil.</p>
