          <p>Dutch semiconductor equipment giant ASML is working to alleviate investor worries about its 2026 growth projections, even as it forecasts a significant decline in sales from China next year. The company expects total net sales in 2026 to at least match 2025 figures, with further details due in January. Despite benefiting from the AI boom, ASML faces challenges from tightening U.S. chip export restrictions and potential tariffs. Analysts remain largely bullish on the firm, citing AI chip foundry expansion and increased manufacturing.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' offense has proven relentless and deep in the postseason, particularly with significant contributions from the bottom half of their batting order. In their 5-1 Game 2 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in the NLCS, players batting sixth through ninth combined for seven hits, three runs, and three RBIs. This trend has been consistent throughout the playoffs, with these hitters boasting a .302/.391/.448 slash line. The team emphasizes a collective trust, knowing that if the top of the lineup doesn't produce, others will step up.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are projected to open higher, recovering from recent lows, as traders evaluate the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China. U.S. President Donald Trump recently threatened new tariffs on China and criticized its soybean purchases, escalating tensions. Concurrently, France's Prime Minister promised to suspend a controversial pension reform until after the 2027 election, a move welcomed by Socialists.

          <p>The Supreme Court has rejected Alex Jones' appeal, leaving in place the $1.4 billion defamation judgment against him for falsely claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax. Jones had argued against being found liable without a trial on the merits, but the justices dismissed his appeal without comment. A lawyer for the Sandy Hook families praised the decision, affirming accountability for the harm caused. Jones, who filed for bankruptcy, continues to appeal a separate $49 million judgment in Texas.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced that adult ChatGPT users will soon gain access to a less censored version of the AI chatbot, which will include erotic materials. This policy shift, expected in December with age-gating, aims to "treat adult users like adults" after mitigating mental health risks. Existing versions were restrictive, making the chatbot less useful for many. The move comes as OpenAI faces increased scrutiny over its safety practices, particularly concerning minors, and recently formed an expert council on well-being and AI.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets saw gains on Wednesday, diverging from Wall Street's declines, amidst an escalating trade dispute between the U.S. and China. U.S. President Donald Trump criticized China's lack of soybean purchases and threatened further economic retaliation. Concurrently, China's consumer prices unexpectedly fell in September, with producer prices remaining in deflation, reflecting sluggish domestic demand. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a nearing end to bond holding reductions and potential interest rate cuts.</p>

          <p>Scholars suggest that escalating US-China trade tensions, marked by new sanctions and tariff threats, could paradoxically foster unity and resolve within China. This perspective highlights China's "national character" of transforming external pressure into motivation. The latest friction includes reciprocal port fees and Beijing's sanctions on a South Korean shipping giant for alleged collaboration with US efforts. This dynamic sets a tone for the upcoming Communist Party plenum, where China is expected to emphasize a steady, long-term strategy without yielding to US pressure or altering its economic plans.</p>

New laws require AI companies to implement guardrails against self-harm and sexually explicit content, and to alert minors that chatbots are not human. Another bill removes a civil legal defense for AI developers, holding them accountable for harm caused by their products. Additionally, penalties for creating nonconsensual "deepfake" pornography are increased, and social media platforms will require warning labels for minors by 2027.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, president of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, faces a more challenging route to becoming Prime Minister after coalition partner Komeito abruptly withdrew. This exit leaves the LDP with a smaller minority in the Diet, opening opportunities for opposition parties to unite behind a single prime ministerial candidate. While the LDP remains the largest bloc, a united opposition could surpass its seat count. Analysts note the coalition's collapse might free the LDP to pursue long-delayed policy goals, but also question Takaichi's leadership.</p>
