          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is poised to vote on the GENIUS Act, a bipartisan bill designed to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins. Supporters argue the legislation will enhance investor protection and solidify the U.S. dollar's global dominance by creating clear rules for issuers like banks and other financial entities. However, critics express concerns that the bill could compromise crypto's decentralized nature and give too much power to certain entities. The act's passage could also influence broader payment systems beyond the cryptocurrency market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of space infrastructure company Rocket Lab surged on Monday, continuing a strong rally that has seen the stock nearly double in two months. This growth is fueled by a series of successful launches of its Electron rocket and a new partnership with the European Space Agency to launch navigation satellites. The company's performance highlights the increasing demand and competition within the maturing space industry, where it competes with giants like SpaceX. CEO Peter Beck noted that the company is now producing a new rocket approximately every 15 days to meet this rising demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores utility-sponsored power saver programs, where homeowners allow utilities to remotely adjust their smart thermostats during peak energy demand in exchange for incentives. While these programs help prevent grid overloads and can lower bills, they also raise significant concerns about consumer control, privacy, and potential equipment wear. Some customers have been enrolled unknowingly or were surprised when utilities locked their thermostats during heatwaves. The article advises consumers to read the fine print carefully, understand override options, and secure their devices before opting into such programs.</p>

          <p>In a significant move within the competitive AI industry, startup Cognition is acquiring Windsurf, another company focused on AI-powered coding tools. The deal for Windsurf's intellectual property and talent comes just days after Google hired away Windsurf's CEO and other senior employees in a multi-billion dollar licensing and compensation deal. This acquisition underscores the intense "talent war" among major tech firms like Google, Meta, and OpenAI, all vying for top AI engineers and researchers. Both Cognition and Windsurf are backed by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, highlighting consolidation among well-funded players in the space.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian officials have positively received President Trump's announcement of a new deal to supply weapons via NATO allies, with President Zelenskyy expressing gratitude for the support. The deal, which includes much-needed Patriot air defense systems, is seen in Kyiv as a significant improvement in relations with Washington. Conversely, officials and pro-war bloggers in Moscow have largely dismissed Trump's accompanying threat of severe sanctions if the war doesn't end in 50 days, calling it "hot air." This mixed international reaction highlights the differing perspectives on the potential impact of the new U.S. policy.</p>

          <p>England's cricket captain Ben Stokes delivered a pivotal performance to secure a dramatic 22-run victory over India in a Test match at Lord's. Despite a recent hamstring surgery and an injury scare earlier in the match, Stokes bowled two crucial, lengthy spells on the final day, taking key wickets to bowl out the tourists for 170. His relentless effort earned him the player of the match award and gave England a 2-1 series lead.

          <p>Meta has removed approximately 10 million Facebook profiles in the first half of 2025 for impersonating large content producers as part of a major crackdown on spam. This initiative aims to improve the authenticity of the Facebook Feed by targeting accounts that engage in spammy behavior, including the use of AI to generate low-quality content. In addition to the profile removals, Meta is implementing stricter measures to promote original creator content and has taken action against 500,000 other accounts for inauthentic behavior. This move comes as social media platforms grapple with a rise in AI-generated spam.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the so-called "age 75 rule" for annuities, a common belief that retirees should wait until that age to purchase one to secure higher payouts. While it's true that monthly payments increase with age because of shorter life expectancy calculations, the rule oversimplifies retirement planning. Waiting until 75 may mean forgoing years of guaranteed income, drawing down other assets, and facing risks if health declines. The article advises that the best time to buy an annuity depends on individual factors like retirement goals, other income sources, and risk tolerance, not an arbitrary age.

The tool is designed to streamline the coding process by helping define requirements, design systems, and create task lists before writing code, a process some call "vibe coding." This move places Amazon in direct competition with similar AI coding assistants from Google, Microsoft, and startups like Cursor. Kiro currently uses models from the Amazon-backed AI company Anthropic and will be offered in free and premium tiers after the preview period.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is taking a significant step to reduce its reliance on China for rare earth metals by creating a new, separate pricing system. Through a deal with the Department of Defense, domestic miner MP Materials will be guaranteed a minimum price for its rare earths, nearly double the current market rate set by China. This policy is designed to incentivize domestic investment and production of these 17 critical metals, which are vital for military technology, electric vehicles, and wind turbines. Analysts believe this move will create a new benchmark that could pull global prices up. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists have detected the largest black hole merger ever observed, an event so extreme it challenges current models of stellar evolution. The collision, detected by the LIGO observatory, formed a new black hole about 225 times the mass of the Sun. At least one of the two original black holes falls into a theoretical "upper mass gap," a size at which stars are expected to explode completely, leaving no remnant behind. This discovery forces astronomers to reconsider how such massive black holes can form, with one leading theory suggesting they are the result of previous, smaller black hole mergers.</p>
