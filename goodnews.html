        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>SoftBank Group has agreed to acquire the robotics division of Swiss engineering firm ABB for $5.4 billion, a strategic move to bolster the Japanese conglomerate's artificial intelligence initiatives. This significant acquisition means ABB will no longer pursue a separate listing for its robotics business, with SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son emphasizing a vision to fuse Artificial Super Intelligence with robotics to drive groundbreaking evolution. The deal aligns with SoftBank's broader strategy of investing in and acquiring technology companies to position itself at the forefront of the burgeoning AI sector, complementing its existing stakes in firms like chip designer Arm and OpenAI. ABB anticipates the sale will deliver immediate value to its shareholders, with proceeds allocated according to established capital principles.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of UK motorists affected by a widespread car finance mis-selling scandal could receive an average of £700 per claim under new compensation plans proposed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The regulator estimates that approximately 44% of 14 million motor finance agreements made since 2007 may be eligible, with lenders potentially paying out £8.2 billion in total. This scheme addresses issues like undisclosed discretionary commission arrangements and unfair contracts. While the FCA aims for quick payouts, some industry figures believe the proposed compensation is excessive, whereas consumer groups and legal firms argue it might not fully reflect the financial harm suffered by victims.</p>

          <p>Jordan Pickford, Everton's 31-year-old goalkeeper, has solidified his position as England's undisputed number one, poised to break his own national record for consecutive clean sheets. Football experts and former teammates commend his exceptional reflexes, significantly improved all-round play with his feet, and powerful long distribution, which aids counter-attacks. While his animated temperament was once a point of discussion, Pickford's increased maturity has reduced histrionics, making him a calmer presence that benefits the defense. His consistent, high-level performances for both club and country, particularly in high-pressure major tournaments, have silenced critics and affirm his crucial importance to the England squad, with no serious threat to his starting role.</p>

          <p>Approximately 900 hikers, guides, and staff were successfully rescued from the Chinese side of Mount Everest after a severe snowstorm stranded them at over 4,900 meters altitude. The storm, which struck Saturday night, cut off access to their camps, leading to some individuals suffering from hypothermia. Rescue teams, equipped with food, medicine, heating, and oxygen supplies, diligently escorted all stranded individuals to safety by Tuesday, with the scenic area now temporarily closed. This incident occurred during a week-long national holiday in China and coincided with other early-season snowstorms in western China, which led to one fatality from hypothermia and altitude sickness in the Qilian Mountains and stranded motorists in Xinjiang.</p>

Aaron Judge's clutch three-run home run in the fourth inning, a signature moment that banged off the foul pole, tied the game and ignited the Yankees' offense, which ultimately scored eight unanswered runs. This remarkable turnaround marked the largest comeback win in an elimination game in franchise history, keeping their postseason hopes alive. The Yankees, now facing elimination once more in Game 4, will turn to rookie pitcher Cam Schlittler, while the Blue Jays anticipate a bullpen game to counter the revitalized Yankees lineup.</p>

          <p>US scientist Dr. Fred Ramsdell learned he had won the Nobel Prize for medicine in a most unusual way: while on the last day of a three-week, off-grid hike in Montana's grizzly bear country. His wife discovered the news through a flurry of text messages after his phone came out of airplane mode, prompting his initial disbelief and a search for phone signal. Dr. Ramsdell, who shares the 11 million Swedish kronor prize for his research into how the immune system combats infections, was finally able to contact the Nobel Committee and his fellow laureates 20 hours after their initial attempts. This amusing incident adds to a history of Nobel winners receiving their news in unexpected and often comical circumstances, highlighting the unique human element behind scientific recognition.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking study published in Nature Biomedical Engineering demonstrates that enzyme-converted kidneys can function effectively in recipients with different blood types, potentially revolutionizing organ transplantation. This innovation could significantly improve access to organs and reduce lengthy waiting lists, addressing a critical shortage where many patients die awaiting transplants. Researchers from the University of British Columbia and West China Hospital of Sichuan University led the team, highlighting the urgent need for more efficient utilization of the existing human organ pool. This method offers immediate and practical hope, especially contrasting with engineered animal organs, which, despite offering future promise, remain many years away from general clinical practice due to recent failures in human trials.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dodgers manager Dave Roberts explained his decision to initially hold back rookie phenom Roki Sasaki in Game 2 of the NLDS, opting for Blake Treinen despite a save situation. Roberts cited Sasaki's workload management and inexperience with back-to-back appearances as primary reasons, aiming to preserve his ace reliever for later in the demanding playoffs. The strategy nearly backfired as Treinen struggled, allowing two runs and forcing Sasaki into the game to record the final out. Moving forward, Sasaki is confirmed as the primary option for future save situations, though Roberts emphasized a continued cautious approach to his usage, balancing his dominant performance with the young pitcher's long-term health and lack of relief experience.</p>

          <p>Dolly Parton's sister, Freida Parton, has publicly asked fans worldwide to pray for the iconic country singer, who recently postponed a forthcoming Las Vegas residency due to unspecified health issues. Dolly, 79, cited the need for "a few procedures" to address ongoing health issues and insufficient time for rehearsals, rescheduling the concerts for September next year. This follows a previous announcement where she pulled out of a Dollywood event after being diagnosed with a "lot of problems" from a kidney stone. Freida expressed strong belief in the power of prayer and confidence in Dolly's eventual recovery, affirming her sister's strength and the immense love surrounding her.</p>

          <p>Charlie Mackesy, the best-selling author and illustrator of "The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and the Horse," revealed his new book, "Always Remember," took six years to complete partly because his iPad, containing many ideas and rough drawings, was stolen from his car. The theft resulted in the loss of significant, unbacked-up portions of the book, forcing him to reconstruct from memory. Mackesy, who also navigated the profound grief of losing his mother and his beloved dog, Barney (inspiration for the Mole character), during this period, described the setback as a test of resilience. Despite these challenges, he found motivation in connecting with readers whose lives were touched by his work, and is now focused on new creative projects and personal rewilding efforts.</p>

          <p>Sky-watchers worldwide were treated to a spectacular "Hunter's Moon" supermoon this week, which appeared notably brighter and larger in the evening sky. A supermoon occurs when the moon reaches its perigee, signifying its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit, making it appear more prominent. This particular supermoon is known as the Hunter's Moon because it marks the first full moon in October, a name historically associated with preparations for winter in the northern hemisphere, when people would hunt and preserve meats before the cold season. The celestial event offered a dazzling and widely appreciated display, captivating observers across various skylines globally.</p>

          <p>Matt Van Epps, strongly backed by former President Trump, has won a crowded Republican primary in Tennessee's special election for a House seat, following an endorsement that came after early voting ended. Van Epps, a West Point graduate and combat-decorated Army helicopter pilot, will now face Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn in the December general election. His victory is seen as a significant test of the former president's influence and the popularity of his "America First" agenda, particularly among Republican-leaning suburban voters in the Nashville area. The 7th Congressional District is a safely Republican seat, and the outcome could slightly expand the GOP's slim majority in the U.S. House, with outside groups spending millions on the race.</p>

          <p>Former football star Herschel Walker has been confirmed by the Senate as the US ambassador to the Bahamas, a diplomatic post for which he was nominated by President Trump last year. Walker, a Heisman Trophy winner who previously ran unsuccessfully for a Georgia Senate seat, is the first Senate-confirmed ambassador to the Bahamas in over a decade. His confirmation, alongside over 100 other Trump nominees, occurred via a single "en bloc" vote, a rules change by Senate Republicans implemented to expedite approvals. This significant political appointment took place while the Senate remained in an impasse over the ongoing government shutdown, underscoring the political maneuvering and legislative deadlock in Washington.</p>

He asserts that he carefully selects projects based on quality, personal interest, and whether he believes he can do a decent job, rather than simply accepting every offer. While nervous about his first stage acting role since primary school, Ranganathan is committed to connecting with audiences and contributing positively, even joking about potential future career changes if public sentiment shifts regarding his visibility.</p>

          <p>Shares of US-listed minerals explorer Trilogy Metals soared over 200% after the White House announced it would take a 10% stake in the Canadian company, through a $35.6 million investment. This move is part of a broader US push to unlock domestic supplies of critical minerals, including copper, cobalt, zinc, and lead, located in Alaska's Ambler mining district. Trilogy Metals welcomed President Trump's decision to grant permits for the Ambler Road project, reversing a previous administration's rejection, and emphasizing its importance for securing domestic supply chains. This strategic action aims to counter China's undisputed dominance in the critical minerals supply chain, which is vital for energy infrastructure, defense technologies, and manufacturing, highlighting a geopolitical and economic imperative.
