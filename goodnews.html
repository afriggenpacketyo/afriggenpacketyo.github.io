        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Indiana Pacers, defying expectations, now lead their series against the Cleveland Cavaliers 2-0 after a dramatic comeback victory. Tyrese Haliburton's game-winning three-pointer capped off a rally from a 20-point deficit, securing the win on Cleveland's home court. Haliburton scored 11 of his 19 points in the final quarter, overcoming Mitchell's 48 points for the Cavaliers. The Pacers capitalized on Cleveland's turnovers and injuries to key players, setting the stage for a potentially series-clinching Game 3 in Indiana. The Pacers have not been to the Eastern Conference Finals since 2014.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have unveiled comprehensive measures to bolster the nation's economy, which is facing headwinds from ongoing trade tensions. The announced plans include interest rate cuts, a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio for banks, and targeted support for key sectors like technology, real estate, consumption, and elderly care. These actions signal a shift towards greater urgency in addressing economic challenges, especially as trade talks with the U.S. are set to resume in Switzerland, potentially marking a turning point in the trade war.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite broader concerns about China's economic headwinds, domestic tourism is experiencing a significant surge, with travel during the May Labor Day holiday exceeding pre-pandemic levels. This trend indicates resilient consumer sentiment, with many Chinese prioritizing spending on travel and cultural experiences over traditional retail goods. Cities are investing in innovative attractions and experiences to capture this growing market, while relaxed visa policies are also encouraging a modest recovery in inbound international travel. The article suggests that tourism is a key driver of economic activity and reflects a shift in consumer spending priorities.</p>

          <p>For the second time in eight days, a U.S. Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet assigned to the USS Harry S. Truman has been lost in the Red Sea. In the latest incident, the fighter jet went overboard during a failed arrestment attempt while landing on the carrier, and the two pilots ejected safely with minor injuries. This follows a previous incident where a Super Hornet fell overboard in the hangar bay. While the Pentagon denies Houthi involvement in the recent incident, the Truman Carrier Strike Group has experienced several serious incidents since deploying to the Middle East in September 2024.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly planning to announce that the U.S. will officially refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia during his upcoming trip to Saudi Arabia. This move aligns with the preferences of Arab nations but is likely to anger Iran, which has historically maintained ties to the name Persian Gulf. While the U.S. can change the name for official purposes, it cannot dictate international usage. This decision follows a similar move to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.</p>

          <p>The federal government is resuming collections on defaulted federal student loans, initiating an accelerated process that includes wage garnishment and withholding of tax refunds and Social Security benefits. This action follows a five-year pause implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. Borrowers in default will receive notifications about the Treasury Offset Program and are encouraged to contact the Default Resolution Group for assistance with repayment options. There are several ways for borrowers to get their loans out of default, including paying in full, rehabilitating the loan, or consolidating the loan.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with the new Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, in the Oval Office, adopting a friendlier tone after months of belittling Canada. Despite past rhetoric about potentially acquiring Canada, Trump expressed his love for the country and its people. The meeting covered a wide range of topics, including the construction of Barack Obama's presidential library and diplomacy with the Houthis in Yemen. Carney firmly stated that Canada was not for sale, and Trump acknowledged that it takes two to tango, seemingly backing away from his previous stance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China, a major aluminum producer and consumer, relies on imported aluminum ore due to a lack of high-quality bauxite. However, a French technology developed by Yves Ocello from IB2 could change this. The technology transforms low-grade bauxite, which is abundant in China, into a high-quality material suitable for aluminum production. IB2 signed a 22-year agreement with a Chinese firm to implement this technology, potentially reducing China's dependence on imported aluminum ore.</p>
