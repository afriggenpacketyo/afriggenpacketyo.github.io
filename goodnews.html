          <p>Kemi Badenoch's Conservative conference speech, pledging to abolish stamp duty, has generated significant political discussion and placed pressure on the Chancellor's November Budget. Alongside this, the article highlights a former civil service head challenging Prime Minister Starmer's explanation for a collapsed China spying trial, raising questions about national security. Other news includes government plans to extend pub opening hours to boost the hospitality sector, despite concerns about public order. Furthermore, the IMF and Bank of England have issued warnings about potential global stock market corrections due to the rise of AI, drawing parallels to the dot-com bust.</p>

          <p>A construction team at the Port of Long Beach made an unexpected discovery when they unearthed a World War II-era explosive device, prompting an immediate response from multiple authorities. The incident led to the evacuation of one container terminal and the establishment of a safety perimeter by local police, fire departments, and the U.S. Coast Guard. The L.A. County Sheriff’s Department Bomb Squad and a U.S. Marine Corps ordnance disposal team successfully assessed, transported, and deactivated the eight-decade-old shell off-site. The swift and effective handling of the situation allowed the port to resume normal operations within hours, ensuring minimal disruption.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has announced that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the initial phase of his peace plan, which includes the imminent release of all remaining hostages and an Israeli troop withdrawal to a pre-determined line. This agreement, brokered through intensive negotiations and Trump's personal diplomacy, is seen as a significant step towards de-escalation. However, the article highlights that this phase primarily addresses the hostage crisis, leaving deeper issues such as Hamas's disarmament and the long-term governance of Gaza unresolved. Trump is reportedly banking on the created momentum and his influence to push for a comprehensive end to the conflict, despite the considerable challenges that persist.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Priscilla, having weakened from hurricane strength, continues to churn off Mexico's Pacific coast, but still presents a notable flood risk to the southwestern United States. The storm is generating high surf conditions and gusty winds across Baja California Sur, where a tropical storm watch remains in effect for specific coastal areas. Meteorological forecasts indicate that regions including central and northern Arizona, southern Utah, and parts of New Mexico and Colorado could experience up to four inches of rainfall, raising concerns for scattered flash flooding. Priscilla is projected to further dissipate into a remnant low by Friday, gradually reducing its impact.</p>

          <p>SoftBank's shares experienced a significant 13% jump following its announcement to acquire the robotics division of Swiss engineering firm ABB for $5.4 billion, a move designed to deepen its involvement in Artificial Intelligence. This acquisition aligns with SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son's long-term vision for "Physical AI" and Artificial Super Intelligence, which he believes will drive groundbreaking human advancement. The deal, pending global regulatory approvals, also means ABB will no longer pursue a separate listing for its robotics business. Furthermore, the article notes that SoftBank-owned British chip designer Graphcore plans a $1.3 billion investment in India, including a new research hub, reinforcing SoftBank's strategic global expansion in AI.

          <p>The Toronto Blue Jays triumphed over the New York Yankees with a 5-2 victory in Game 4 of the American League Division Series, earning their first trip to the American League Championship Series since 2016.

This win showcased the Blue Jays' resilience, especially after a disappointing loss in Game 3 where they squandered a large lead. Toronto will now advance to host Game 1 of the ALCS, facing either the Detroit Tigers or Seattle Mariners in their pursuit of a World Series score.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrat party has experienced a significant decline in its paid-up membership, nearly halving from close to 118,000 in 2020 to 60,000 over the past five years, as revealed by BBC analysis. This trend is counterintuitive, considering the party achieved its most successful general election in terms of seats won just last year. The article clarifies that the party's publicly reported figures often combine members with "registered supporters," which can obscure the actual drop in active membership. Despite this decrease, research suggests that Liberal Democrat members remain the most engaged and active among all UK political parties in direct voter outreach.</p>
