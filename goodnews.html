          <p>Canada has rescinded its digital services tax just one day before the first payments were due, following a move by U.S. President Trump to halt all trade talks. The tax, a 3% levy on large tech firms like Google and Amazon, was retroactive to 2022 and drew strong opposition from the U.S. for being discriminatory against American companies. With the tax now withdrawn, Canadian officials announced that negotiations for a new economic and security relationship can resume, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement.</p>

          <p>In a wide-ranging interview, U.S. Women's National Team coach Emma Hayes shares her insights on leadership, coaching, and the state of women's soccer. She emphasizes empathy, a clear vision, and vulnerability as keys to being a great coach and discusses the cultural and infrastructural differences in soccer between the U.S. and Europe. When asked about potentially managing the England national team in the future, Hayes confirmed her current focus is on the USWNT but stated she would "never say never."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new UK-US trade deal has reduced a 25% tariff on British cars to 10%, allowing manufacturers like Aston Martin and JLR to resume large-scale shipments to the American market. The deal, however, has drawn criticism from British farmers who feel their sector was used as a bargaining chip, citing concessions on US beef and ethanol imports. While the auto industry welcomes the relief, the new 10% duty is limited to a quota of 100,000 cars annually, offering little room for future export growth.</p>

Since fleeing to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, he has championed a non-violent "Middle Way" approach, earning him the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize. Despite China viewing him as a separatist, he remains an influential spiritual leader and has indicated his successor will be born outside of China in the "free world."</p>

          <p>China has officially lifted its comprehensive ban on Japanese seafood imports, which was imposed in August 2023 in protest of the release of treated radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear plant. The decision follows international monitoring and independent sampling by China that "showed no abnormalities." While the move is seen as an effort to improve bilateral ties, China will maintain import restrictions on food from 10 Japanese prefectures, including Fukushima. Japanese exporters must now complete registration and radiation checks before shipments can resume.</p>

          <p>A black bear has been spotted for the second time in Greene County, Ohio, prompting a friendly warning from the Yellow Springs Police Department. The bear, nicknamed "Mosey," was previously seen in the county on June 19 after first appearing in a neighboring county. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) advises that black bears are naturally skittish and advises residents not to approach or feed the animal. Officials are asking the public to secure trash, take down bird feeders, and keep pet food indoors to avoid attracting the bear.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, studies are revealing they are more likely to induce motion sickness than traditional combustion engine cars. Researchers attribute this to the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs, particularly the regenerative braking systems. This system, which converts kinetic energy back into battery power, can cause low-frequency deceleration that provokes queasiness and discomfort in passengers. The findings highlight a challenge for automakers as they continue to refine the EV driving and riding experience for consumers.</p>
