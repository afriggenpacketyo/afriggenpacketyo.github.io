          <p>NASA has officially introduced its newest class of ten astronaut candidates, a group selected from a pool of over 8,000 applicants. The class, which notably includes more women than men for the first time, features individuals from diverse professional backgrounds such as pilots, engineers, a geologist, and a former SpaceX launch director. These candidates will now undergo a rigorous two-year training program to prepare for future missions to the International Space Station, the Moon, and potentially Mars. The selection highlights NASA's ongoing commitment to expanding its human spaceflight capabilities for the next generation of exploration.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin and Senator Rand Paul, has introduced the America’s CHILDREN Act. This legislation is designed to offer a pathway to citizenship for more than 250,000 young adults known as 'Documented Dreamers'. These individuals were brought to the U.S. legally as dependents of visa-holding parents but risk 'aging out' of their legal status at age 21 due to extensive backlogs in the immigration system. Proponents argue the bill addresses a critical flaw that penalizes individuals who have grown up and been educated in the United States.</p>

          <p>A jury has found Karen Read not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the 2022 death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe. She was, however, convicted of driving under the influence. The verdict concludes a highly publicized retrial after her first trial ended in a hung jury. Prosecutors had accused Read of striking O'Keefe with her vehicle and leaving him in a snowstorm, while her defense team argued she was framed in an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement. The case drew national attention due to its complex timeline and conflicting narratives.</p>

          <p>Disney has announced that 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' will return to ABC's programming schedule this Tuesday, ending a nearly week-long suspension. The late-night show was pulled after host Jimmy Kimmel made controversial comments linking the alleged killer of a conservative activist to President Trump's political movement. In a statement, Disney explained the suspension was intended to de-escalate a tense situation, calling the original comments ill-timed and insensitive. The decision to reinstate the show followed several days of discussions between the network and Kimmel, who is expected to address the matter upon his return.</p>

          <p>The White House has detailed a proposed structure to allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States while addressing national security concerns. The plan involves creating a new U.S.-based joint venture with a majority of American investors and board members, which would oversee all U.S. operations. Software company Oracle would serve as the security provider, monitoring the platform's algorithm to prevent malicious use or foreign influence. While the administration expressed confidence that China has approved the framework, Beijing has not publicly confirmed that a final agreement has been reached.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, homeowners considering borrowing $50,000 have two primary options: a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC). Currently, a HELOC is slightly cheaper on a monthly basis due to its variable interest rate, which has adjusted downward. However, a home equity loan offers the stability of a fixed interest rate, protecting borrowers from future rate hikes. The article advises homeowners to carefully weigh the immediate savings of a HELOC against the long-term predictability of a home equity loan before making a decision. (not investment advice)</p>

The project, located off the coast of New England, is 80% complete and was ordered to halt construction by the Interior Department in August. In his ruling, the judge stated that Orsted had shown a likelihood of success and would suffer irreparable harm if the order remained.

He argued that rates should be below 3% by the end of the year and dismissed concerns that the administration's tariffs are significantly fueling inflation.
