        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Britain has successfully harvested its first-ever rice crop, cultivated in Cambridgeshire as part of an ambitious trial by the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. This experiment, initially met with skepticism, thrived during the UK's hottest summer on record, suggesting new agricultural possibilities amidst climate change. Beyond food production, growing rice on peat soils could help lock in greenhouse gases, addressing a significant source of national emissions. While commercial viability is still distant, this project explores innovative ways to protect farming livelihoods and food supplies while mitigating environmental impacts.</p>

          <p>Two Indian researchers, Vikash Kumar and Sarthak Mittal, have been awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for their study on the impact of foul-smelling shoes on the user experience of shoe racks. Their humorous yet inventive scientific endeavor confirmed that shoe odor, caused by the bacterium Kytococcus sedentarius, is a widespread problem. The duo developed a prototype UVC light-equipped shoe rack that sterilizes footwear in minutes, effectively eliminating the smell. This quirky research, discovered by the Ig Nobel committee, highlights an everyday problem with a practical, if unconventional, scientific solution.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems has reached a confidential settlement in its $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit against Rudy Giuliani, stemming from his baseless claims of election-rigging in the 2020 presidential election. Giuliani, former personal lawyer to President Trump, had spearheaded efforts to discredit Dominion's voting machines, alleging manipulation without evidence. This settlement follows similar agreements with Fox News and Newsmax, and marks another legal and financial setback for Giuliani. The lawsuit aimed to address the undermining of public confidence in U.S. elections and the threats faced by election officials.</p>

          <p>Starbucks workers rallied in Los Angeles and other cities to pressure the company to resume stalled contract negotiations. The protests follow Starbucks' announcement of store closures and layoffs, and legal actions by employees over a new dress code without reimbursement. The union, Starbucks Workers United, claims the company has ignored requests to return to the bargaining table since February, despite federal mediation. Starbucks, however, asserts the union walked away and that the company offers competitive pay and benefits. Workers are preparing for a potential strike if an agreement is not reached.</p>

          <p>Tesla's new family-friendly EV, the Model Y L, has achieved stunning success in China, selling out through October shortly after its August 2025 launch. Over 35,000 orders were placed on launch day, with new deliveries now pushed to November. This surge is crucial for Tesla, which has faced slowing sales globally due to increased competition and regulatory hurdles in Europe. The Model Y L's expanded cabin space and lower price point are broadening its appeal, accelerating EV adoption, and contributing to reduced heat-trapping transportation pollution.

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, in his upcoming book "Life, Law, & Liberty," reflects on his 30-year tenure and his role as the court's frequent 'swing justice.' Kennedy expresses concern about the current state of American discourse and the tone of some Supreme Court opinions, fearing for democracy's survival. He details his pivotal votes on issues like same-sex marriage, influenced by the demeaning impact on children of gay parents, and abortion, where he separated personal morality from legal judgment. Kennedy also critiques originalism, advocating for a broader interpretation of 'liberty' that evolves over time.</p>

          <h2>Effectiveness of Collagen Supplements for Skin Ageing Remains Debated by Dermatologists</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The effectiveness of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging is a subject of ongoing debate among dermatologists. While collagen is vital for skin and joint health, its journey through the body after oral ingestion, even in peptide form, is complex and uncertain. Topical collagen creams are generally dismissed as ineffective, as they don't penetrate beyond the skin's outer layer. Some industry-funded studies suggest benefits, but independent research often finds no substantial effect. Experts recommend sunblock, a healthy diet, and quitting smoking as more impactful strategies for skin health than expensive supplements.</p>

          <p>This article examines whether China has surpassed Europe in the race for a high-tech future, coinciding with 50 years of diplomatic relations between China and the European Union. Decades ago, Chinese officials observed their country was significantly behind Europe in science and technology. However, China's subsequent reform and opening-up policies have fueled decades of rapid growth, transforming its technological landscape. This historical context provides a backdrop for evaluating China's current position and its implications for Europe's competitive standing in the global technology arena.</p>

          <p>UN General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock warned that the UN is at a 'make-it-or-break-it moment,' a sentiment underscored by global conflicts like the ongoing situation in Gaza. This article argues that China's global initiatives could offer a path to necessary UN reform, contrasting with the contradictions of traditional powers. Germany, for instance, a key arms supplier to Israel, embodies the challenges of current international dynamics. The piece suggests that while Western allies enable conflicts, China's approach might represent a more substantive reform model for the multilateral institution.</p>

          <p>The UK government will guarantee a £1.5bn loan for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to support its supply chain, as a cyber attack continues to halt vehicle production. The cyber incident, which began in late August, has forced JLR to suspend manufacturing for weeks, causing concerns that small suppliers could face bankruptcy. Business Secretary Peter Kyle stated the loan aims to protect thousands of jobs in the automotive sector. This financial support, provided through the Export Development Guarantee, will boost JLR's cash reserves to manage a backlog of payments to its 700 suppliers. (not investment advice)</p>
