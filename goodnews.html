          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump stated that "great progress" is being made in negotiations to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. He also commented on recent U.S. air strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, claiming they caused "total obliteration" and set back Iran's nuclear ambitions by "decades." These remarks followed a CNN report suggesting the strikes failed to completely destroy Iran's underground facilities or eliminate its centrifuges and enriched uranium stockpile. Trump dismissed these reports as "fake news," asserting that the strikes would aid in the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza.</p>

          <p>This commentary explores the propriety of age-gap relationships, drawing lessons from the relationships of famous men. The article starts with the controversy surrounding the relationship between Anna Camp, 42, and Jade Whipkey, 24, and goes on to address other relationships. The author notes problematic relationships with significant age gaps, such as Jerry Seinfeld's past relationship with a 17-year-old and Elon Musk's father's relationship with his former stepdaughter. The article concludes that while age gap relationships between consenting adults are generally acceptable, there are red flags to watch out for, especially when there is a large power imbalance.</p>

          <p>Cooper Flagg, the anticipated No. 1 pick in the NBA draft, has defied the stereotype of the hated white Duke superstar. Unlike figures such as Grayson Allen, JJ Redick, Danny Ferry, and Christian Laettner, Flagg has garnered widespread admiration for his skill and demeanor. The article contrasts Flagg with Caitlin Clark, suggesting that her on-court attitude has contributed to a negative perception. Flagg's humility, intense play, and respect for the game have made him a celebrated figure, a departure from the vitriol often directed at white Duke players.</p>

          <p>Curvy couches are experiencing a comeback in interior design, offering a softer contrast to the angularity of most spaces. While some designers view them as unwelcome, others appreciate their ability to transform a room and create a custom look. These couches can be practical in open-plan spaces, breaking up large areas and fostering conversation. Considerations for choosing a curvy couch include measuring dimensions, assessing comfort, and selecting complementary furniture. The article provides examples of curvy couches across various price points and styles.</p>

          <p>UC Berkeley law professors Erwin Chemerinsky and Claudia Polsky successfully fought against the Trump administration's cuts to research funding for UC arts, science, and medical researchers. A federal judge ordered the restoration of millions in UC grants and approved a class-action suit, opening it to UC researchers statewide. The judge found the government engaged in "quintessential viewpoint discrimination" by rescinding funding based on diversity-related keywords or generic agency letters. The lawsuit is one of many filed against the Trump administration over grant terminations, but this one came directly from researchers. The court's decision requires the government to restore grants discontinued after Trump's inauguration if projects were flagged over diversity-related topics.</p>

While YouTube offers some C-SPAN content for free, C-SPAN CEO Sam Feist emphasizes the value of its neutral approach in a partisan media landscape.

The case involved allegations of tax evasion concerning a ‚Ç¨6.7 million payment from the DFB to FIFA, purportedly for a World Cup gala that never occurred. The payment triggered investigations into claims of vote-buying to secure Germany's bid to host the tournament. The DFB was previously ordered to pay over ‚Ç¨20 million in back taxes related to 2006.
