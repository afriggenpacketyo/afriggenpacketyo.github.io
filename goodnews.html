          <p>The Reserve Bank of India has opted to keep its key policy interest rate steady at 5.5%, a decision that was widely anticipated by economists. This move occurs as India navigates rising trade tensions with the U.S., including threats of higher tariffs from President Trump over India's ties with Russia. Following an aggressive rate cut in its previous meeting, the central bank has now adopted a "neutral" stance, signaling it will carefully evaluate incoming economic data before determining future policy actions.

While the state-backed Guo Wang project receives priority access to the nation's Long March rockets, other ambitious Chinese satellite internet ventures are struggling to find launch capacity. This challenge is compelling private firms like Shanghai's Qianfan to issue large tenders to private rocket companies to deploy their constellations and remain competitive in the global space race.</p>

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings, the number of living survivors, known as "hibakusha," has fallen below 100,000, with their average age now over 86. This reality has created a new urgency among museums, organizations, and younger generations to preserve their invaluable first-hand accounts of the nuclear attacks. Successors, such as 12-year-old Shun Sasaki, a great-grandson of a survivor, are now stepping up to share these harrowing stories to ensure the lessons of the past are carried forward to promote peace.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation announced it will close the medium-security state prison in Norco by fall 2026. This decision stems from a significant decline in the state's overall inmate population and is projected to save California $150 million annually. The facility currently holds nearly 2,800 inmates and employs 1,200 staff, who will be offered transfers to other state jobs. This closure continues a recent trend of deactivating correctional facilities in California amid criminal justice reforms and falling crime rates.</p>

          <p>As China develops its upcoming 15th five-year plan, a debate has emerged among the country's economists regarding the implementation of official targets for consumption. Some scholars advocate for including measurable benchmarks, such as the household consumption rate as a share of GDP, to strategically boost domestic demand. However, other influential thinkers are more cautious, questioning whether such metrics are operationally practical to use as direct policy goals for the world's second-largest economy.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki, a highly touted phenom from Japan, is showing promising signs of a comeback after a shoulder injury interrupted his debut season. Following a difficult start with a 4.72 ERA, Sasaki has progressed in his throwing program and may soon begin a minor-league rehab assignment. The team is encouraged by his mechanical adjustments and the addition of a new pitch, holding out hope that he can still be a valuable contributor to their World Series push this fall, either as a starter or a reliever.</p>

The company noted that its AI business revenue declined, partly due to U.S. export restrictions to China, but it projects that AI-related sales will grow in the upcoming quarter.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction to stop the Trump administration from reallocating more than $4 billion in FEMA disaster relief funding. The ruling is a victory for 20 states that sued after the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The judge determined that redirecting the funds, which are meant for projects like flood mitigation, could inflict "irreparable harm" on vulnerable communities and that the administration failed to show Congress authorized the transfer.</p>

          <p>A massive copper mine in Afghanistan, backed by China's state-owned Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC), is reportedly making substantial progress toward starting extraction this year. The Mes Aynak mine project, first awarded in 2008, has been delayed for 17 years by security challenges, the presence of ancient archaeological sites, and a lack of infrastructure. A recent decision by the Taliban to switch to underground mining, a method more protective of historical relics, may have cleared a major hurdle for production to finally commence.</p>
