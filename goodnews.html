        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Phantom energy, also termed vampire energy, describes the electricity consumed by devices when they are plugged in but not actively in use. This silent drain can account for 5% to 10% of a home's total energy consumption, originating from common items like phone chargers, microwaves, and smart televisions with constant connectivity features. Experts highlight that reducing this wasted electricity, by simply unplugging devices or disabling smart features, offers a dual benefit: significant savings on individual utility bills and a collective contribution to reducing planet-warming emissions. Such small, consistent actions, when adopted widely, are crucial for fostering more sustainable energy practices and combating climate change.</p>

          <p>Actress Demi Moore has publicly defended Emma Heming Willis, wife of her ex-husband Bruce Willis, against criticism regarding her caregiving decisions for the actor, who is diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. Moore emphasized the lack of a roadmap for such a condition and praised Emma's dedication to self-care, which she argues is essential for any caregiver. Emma Heming Willis had faced backlash for moving Bruce into a separate home with professional caregivers, a decision she defended as necessary. Moore also shared her personal struggles with seeing Bruce's decline, stressing the importance of meeting individuals where they are without expectations of their past selves.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-03 10:54:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive fact-check investigation by DW, utilizing data from the FBI and long-term academic studies, debunks President Trump's repeated claims that Democrat-run cities inherently experience higher crime rates. While it's true that most large U.S. cities are governed by Democrats and generally report higher crime rates than rural areas, the analysis strongly emphasizes that this correlation does not imply causation. Research from Harvard, MIT, and Boston University, spanning nearly three decades across 400 cities, found no detectable impact of a mayor's political affiliation on crime rates or policing strategies. The article concludes that crime trends are primarily influenced by a complex interplay of socioeconomic, geographic, and cultural factors, rather than the political party in charge.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners possess substantial tappable equity, making HELOCs and home equity loans attractive financing options with rates around 8%, significantly lower than credit cards or personal loans. This article compares the affordability of these two options, noting that while HELOCs currently have slightly lower variable rates, home equity loans offer fixed rates and predictable payments. Experts suggest HELOCs become more appealing when rates are decreasing, while fixed-rate loans are preferred during rising rate environments. Borrowers must consider interest rates, repayment terms, and additional costs like closing fees, as both options are secured by the home and carry foreclosure risks if payments are missed.

          <p>A New York judge has ruled to admit critical DNA evidence in the ongoing Gilgo Beach serial killer case, which prosecutors assert links alleged killer Rex Heuermann to the murders of at least seven victims. This judicial decision is highly significant because the defense had challenged the evidence, obtained through whole genome sequencing—a new DNA technology never before utilized in a New York court. Prosecutors successfully argued that this advanced technology is derived from widely accepted scientific methods and will prove crucial in aiding the jury's determination of guilt. Heuermann, who was arrested in July 2023, has pleaded not guilty to the murders, making the inclusion of this forensic evidence a major development in this high-profile and long-unsolved case.</p>

          <p>Topshop and its menswear counterpart, Topman, are set to return to the UK High Street in February 2026, five years after all their standalone stores closed following the collapse of Sir Philip Green's retail empire.

This partnership aims to leverage Topshop's enduring customer affection and John Lewis's reach to attract new shoppers. The comeback acknowledges the need for adaptation, as the brand must now cater to a more conscious consumer base and evolve beyond its fast-fashion heritage to succeed in a changed retail landscape.</p>

          <p>An exhibition in Gdansk, Poland, titled "Our Boys," is sparking heated debate by exploring the long-taboo subject of Polish citizens who served in the Nazi German Wehrmacht during World War II. While right-wing conservatives, including Poland's former president, have condemned the exhibition as a "historical falsehood" and "moral provocation," curators aim to show the nuanced, tragic fates of individuals forced into service under brutal pressure. After Nazi occupation, many Poles in annexed territories were placed on the German People's List, which brought privileges but also compulsory military service, with refusal leading to severe family repercussions. This article delves into the complex choices faced by these individuals, often seen as traitors post-war, and highlights a re-evaluation of Poland's black-and-white historical memory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alphabet shares rose 9% after a U.S. District Judge ruled against the most severe breakup proposals in Google's antitrust case, a decision viewed favorably by investors. Although Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in internet search, the court rejected the Department of Justice's call to divest its Chrome browser and Android operating system. Google can continue making payments to companies, like Apple, to preload its search engine, but cannot enforce exclusive contracts. This outcome is considered a "monster win" for Google, removing a significant overhang on the stock and reinforcing the durability of its search business amidst rising competition from AI players like Perplexity and OpenAI.

This alliance aims to ensure their states' health policies remain unified and grounded in scientific expertise, focusing on evidence-based immunization guidance and credible vaccine information.

          <p>Macy's shares surged 20% after the retailer reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that significantly exceeded Wall Street expectations, prompting the company to raise its full-year earnings and sales guidance. CEO Tony Spring attributed this robust performance to strategic initiatives, including revamped stores and a focused approach on growing business segments such as denim and women's contemporary apparel. Despite previous concerns regarding President Trump's tariffs, which had led to price adjustments, Macy's has now integrated these impacts into its cautiously optimistic outlook. The department store's luxury brands, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, also contributed to the overall positive financial picture with strong comparable sales growth, indicating a broad-based recovery.

          <p>Reverse mortgages, which convert home equity into cash without monthly payments, are gaining traction among older homeowners amidst high mortgage rates and home prices. However, experts warn of unique risks in the current market, including rising costs for insurance, maintenance, and property taxes, which borrowers must still cover to avoid foreclosure. Falling home prices in some areas can reduce the qualified loan amount and make qualification harder, though government-backed HECMs protect against owing more than the home's value. Borrowers must also consider the impact on heirs' inheritance and whether upfront fees justify the loan for short-term occupancy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, a potential candidate for Fed chair, expressed support for initiating a rate-cutting cycle within two weeks, emphasizing the central bank's flexibility to adjust the pace thereafter. Waller argued that a deteriorating labor market can worsen rapidly, necessitating prompt action despite ongoing concerns about tariff inflation. He believes current interest rates are significantly above their "neutral" level, suggesting multiple cuts could occur over the next few months. Waller reiterated the critical importance of the Fed's independence, assuring that the institution will maintain its apolitical function regardless of leadership, even amidst current political pressures.
