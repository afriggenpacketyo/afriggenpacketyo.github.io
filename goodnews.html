          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 09:26:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thames Water, the UK's largest water company, may face a ban on bonus payments to executives under new rules being considered by the industry regulator, Ofwat, as described in the article. The potential ban comes amid criticism of Thames Water's high debt, leaks, sewage spills, and outdated infrastructure. The regulator's new powers would allow it to block bonuses if water companies fail to meet acceptable standards on environmental performance, consumer matters, financial resilience, and criminal liability. The company argues that retention payments, which are not covered by the new rules, are necessary to retain key personnel during a complex turnaround.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that customer complaints against U.S. airlines surged to a record high in 2024, despite only a slight increase in passenger volume. The U.S. PIRG Education Fund attributes the rise to issues like cancellations, delays, refunds, and baggage handling, exacerbated by pandemic-related disruptions and air traffic controller shortages. Frontier Airlines had the highest rate of complaints, while Southwest, Alaska, and Hawaiian Airlines performed best. The article also offers tips for consumers to mitigate travel hassles, such as downloading airline apps and using tracking devices for luggage.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a temporary $4,000 tax deduction for older adults as an alternative to eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, the article reports. The "bonus" deduction would be available to adults ages 65 and over for tax years 2025 through 2028, phasing out for higher-income individuals. While framed as a historic tax break for seniors, experts note that the deduction is less generous than a tax credit and would result in a modest tax cut for most retirees. The bill provides a "historic tax break" to seniors receiving Social Security, "fulfilling President Trump's campaign promise to deliver much-needed tax relief to our seniors,".</p>

While support for Trump's agenda remains strong among Republicans, some acknowledge the difficulties of seeing layoffs in a region reliant on federal support.

Novogratz noted that auditing costs were significantly higher for crypto companies due to regulatory scrutiny.

          <p>While President Trump is pressuring automakers to build in the U.S. through aggressive tariffs, experts say it's not feasible to source and manufacture all auto parts domestically, according to the article. Some parts are cheaper to manufacture overseas, and the U.S. lacks sufficient processing and production plants for materials like steel, aluminum, and semiconductors. The increased costs of a 100% U.S.-made vehicle could price many consumers out of the market, leading to less demand and lower production. Experts estimate it could add thousands of dollars to a vehicle's price point with each step taken to get closer to 100% U.S. and Canadian parts.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri led Lando Norris to a McLaren one-two in first practice at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, the article states. Less than a 10th of a second covered the top five cars, as Williams driver Carlos Sainz took third place ahead of Mercedes' George Russell and Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton. The session was brought to a premature end two minutes before the scheduled end when Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto crashed at the second Rivazza corner. Piastri, leading the world championship from Norris by 16 points after four wins in the first six races, was 0.032 seconds ahead of his team-mate at the top of the times.</p>

          <p>Latvia's Defense Intelligence and Security Service has warned citizens to be on the lookout for potential Russian spies and saboteurs, according to the article. The agency's threat assessment cites various factors that could indicate an infiltrator, including athletic appearance, poor hygiene, interest in critical infrastructure, and stilted Latvian language skills. The warning reflects heightened anxiety in Latvia due to Russia's war in Ukraine and the country's history as part of Moscow's empire. Some of the factors the Latvian threat assessment cites could make it hard to tell a camper or low-budget sightseer from an infiltrator.</p>
