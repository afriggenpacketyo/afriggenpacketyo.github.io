          <p>Aircraft leasing company Air Lease has agreed to be acquired for $7.4 billion by a group of investors including Japan's Sumitomo and SMBC Aviation Capital, taking the company private. The deal highlights a significant consolidation trend within the airplane-renting industry, which owns over half of the world's passenger jets. This move comes as lessors benefit from a shortage of new aircraft that has driven rental rates to record highs, making it a strategic time for large-scale acquisitions to increase market share.</p>

          <p>In a landmark antitrust ruling, a federal judge has decided that Google will not be forced to sell its Chrome browser but will be barred from entering into exclusive contracts to be the default search engine. This decision is a partial victory for Google, which avoids the most severe penalty proposed by the Department of Justice. However, the ruling imposes significant restrictions on its business practices, including its multi-billion dollar arrangement with Apple to be the default search provider on iPhones.</p>

          <p>A federal judge decided against the government's proposal to force Google to sell its Chrome browser to remedy its illegal search monopoly. The ruling provides context on how the online search landscape is evolving with the emergence of AI chatbots and new competitors. The article notes that AI startup Perplexity, which partners with some news organizations, had even made a bid to purchase Chrome, illustrating the shifting dynamics in the tech industry as AI becomes more integrated into search.</p>

          <p>Amid significant staff and budget cuts under the Trump administration, hundreds of workers at two of California's most prominent national parks have voted overwhelmingly to unionize. The move to join the National Federation of Federal Employees is driven by widespread concerns over job security, slashed agency budgets, and deteriorating working conditions. Organizers say the turmoil created by the administration, which has seen the National Park Service lose a quarter of its permanent staff, provided the necessary support to finally form a union.</p>

          <p>Amazon is discontinuing its Prime Invitee Program, which permitted members to share their free two-day shipping benefits with one person living outside their household. Starting in October, users will need to share the same primary residential address through the Amazon Family program to share benefits. This policy change tightens access to Prime perks and follows reports that U.S. sign-ups for the company's recent Prime Day sales event fell short of both internal targets and last year's totals.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price increased slightly, contrasting with a broader stock market sell-off, while the price of gold surged to a new all-time high around $3,500 per ounce. The market volatility was reportedly triggered by investor concerns over the legality of recent U.S. tariffs and their potential negative economic impact. Analysts suggest that while both assets are often considered safe havens, Bitcoin's recent performance has been somewhat tempered by a significant rotation of investor interest into Ethereum.
