          <p>New York City will utilize ranked choice voting in its upcoming Democratic mayoral primary election. Voters will rank up to five candidates in order of preference, and if no candidate secures a majority, the candidate with the fewest votes will be eliminated, and their votes redistributed based on voters' second choices. This process continues until a candidate reaches a majority. The system aims to ensure that the elected candidate has broad support and to prevent candidates with fringe views from winning in a crowded field. The tabulation process will begin on July 1, with official results certified on July 15. </p>

          <p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile has released its first images, showcasing its unprecedented ability to observe the universe. The observatory, equipped with the world's most powerful digital camera, aims to transform our understanding of the cosmos. The telescope will continuously film the southern night sky for ten years, potentially increasing the number of known objects in our solar system tenfold. Scientists hope to detect killer asteroids, map the Milky Way, and answer crucial questions about dark matter. </p>

Since 1972, pandas have symbolized friendship between the two countries, but their diplomatic weight may be diminishing.
