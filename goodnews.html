          <p>Cerys Vaughan, a teenage amateur footballer, is requesting an apology from the Football Association after being banned for questioning the gender of a transgender woman opponent during a friendly match. Vaughan raised concerns about fairness and safety with the referee after learning the player was transgender, leading to a charge of improper conduct and a six-match ban. An FA appeal board later found the initial hearing unfair, quashed the ruling, and the case was dropped after the complainant withdrew. Vaughan asserts the ordeal has negatively impacted her life and believes the FA's actions were unwarranted.</p>

          <p>Mexico has initiated a lawsuit against Google after the tech giant changed the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on its maps platform, following an executive order by former U.S. President Donald Trump. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced the lawsuit, emphasizing that the Gulf of America label should only apply to the portion over the U.S. continental shelf. Google's policy of aligning with local official names has resulted in the gulf being labeled differently depending on the user's location, a practice Mexico contests. This legal action follows House Republicans passing the Gulf of America Act to codify Trump's order.</p>
