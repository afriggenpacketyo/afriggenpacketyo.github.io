          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the United States and China have made substantial progress in trade talks held in Geneva, with details to be released on Monday. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer suggested a deal had been reached, emphasizing the speed of the agreement. The Trump administration initiated these talks to address the significant trade imbalance, viewing it as a national emergency. China's Vice Premier He Lifeng described the discussions as candid and constructive, agreeing to establish a consultation mechanism for economic and trade issues, as both sides aim to ease tensions and potentially lower tariffs that have disrupted global supply chains. The resolution of this trade war has major implications for the global economy, which has been affected by tariffs imposed by both countries.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly set to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet from the Qatari royal family, which will be retrofitted for use as Air Force One during the president's second term. The Qatari Ministry of Defense is gifting the plane to the Pentagon, which will then modify it with necessary security features. Following Trump's presidency, the plane is intended to be donated to his presidential library for continued use. This arrangement has raised ethical and legal concerns, although Qatari officials describe it as a government-to-government transaction rather than a personal gift.</p>

Nuno emphasized the owner's passion and commitment to the club's growth. He said that the owner's actions were due to his desire to see the club succeed and his emotional investment in the team.</p>
