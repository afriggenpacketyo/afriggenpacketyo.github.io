          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record high, briefly exceeding $112,000, buoyed by a strong rally in the technology sector led by Nvidia. The cryptocurrency's movement demonstrated its continued correlation with risk-on assets, as investor optimism in tech stocks appeared to spill over into the digital asset market. Despite significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs recently, the price had been trading in a narrow range before this latest breakout. Analysts suggest that increased corporate buying and potential crypto-friendly legislation could fuel further upward momentum for the digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Passengers on a Delta Air Lines flight from Madrid to New York experienced a significant delay after an engine issue forced an emergency landing on Terceira, a small Portuguese island in the Atlantic. The 282 customers and 13 crew members spent approximately 29 hours on the island before a replacement aircraft could transport them to their destination. Delta provided hotel accommodations and meals during the unexpected layover and has apologized for the delay. The airline confirmed it will offer compensation to the affected passengers for the extended travel disruption.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to lift a lower court's injunction against a controversial Florida immigration law. The law, backed by Governor Ron DeSantis, would have made it a state felony for certain undocumented immigrants to enter Florida. A federal judge had previously blocked the law, ruling that it unconstitutionally encroaches on the federal government's exclusive authority over immigration policy. The Supreme Court's decision means the law will remain unenforceable while the legal challenge against it proceeds, a move praised by civil rights groups as a reaffirmation of federal jurisdiction over immigration.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, has engineered its own custom cooling hardware to manage the intense heat generated by Nvidia's next-generation AI graphics processing units (GPUs). The company developed the "In-Row Heat Exchanger" because existing commercial solutions were deemed too slow to implement or inefficient for the scale of AWS's operations. This new hardware allows AWS to effectively deploy powerful Nvidia computing clusters, such as the GB200 NVL72, in its data centers. The move reflects a broader trend of major cloud providers designing bespoke hardware to optimize performance and reduce reliance on third-party suppliers.</p>
