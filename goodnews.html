          <p>Liverpool's manager, Arne Slot, has pushed back against criticism from pundits regarding the club's £450 million expenditure on eight new players during the summer transfer window. He highlighted that the significant spending was offset by over £250 million generated from player sales, arguing it was a necessary investment to strengthen the squad. Slot defended the club's strategy of signing younger players, like the record £125 million striker Alexander Isak, who are under 25 but ready to compete at a high level. He believes the club deserves praise for its self-sustaining business model and forward-thinking recruitment policy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby stated that his company's aggressive expansion is succeeding because customers are choosing United for its superior product and network. While many rival airlines are scaling back growth plans due to an oversupply of flights, United is set to increase its domestic capacity by 5.7% in 2025, outpacing the industry average. Kirby attributes this success to investments in onboard amenities like Bluetooth connectivity and seat-back screens, which differentiate the airline from competitors. He reiterated his belief that the ultra-discount airline model is failing, positioning United as a resilient, brand-loyal carrier poised for growth.</p>

          <p>In a move highlighting the escalating rivalry between the two AI leaders, OpenAI has hired Mike Liberatore, the former chief financial officer of Elon Musk's xAI. Liberatore will serve as OpenAI's business finance officer, tasked with overseeing the company's substantial infrastructure spending, including its major deals with cloud providers like Oracle. The hiring follows a public falling out between OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Musk, who co-founded OpenAI in 2015 but has since become a vocal critic of its commercial direction. This personnel acquisition underscores the intense competition for top talent and strategic positioning within the rapidly advancing AI industry.</p>

          <p>Cloud security provider Netskope has raised its planned initial public offering price range, now targeting a valuation of up to $7.3 billion. The company plans to sell 47.8 million shares at between $17 and $19 each, an increase from its previous range that targeted a $6.5 billion valuation. This move signals strong investor appetite and comes amidst a hot streak for tech IPOs and a series of major acquisitions in the cybersecurity sector. The successful market debuts of other tech companies like Figma and Klarna suggest a resurgent IPO market after a period of volatility caused by inflation and interest rate concerns.

          <p>Grammy-winning artist Cardi B is preparing to release her new album, titled "Am I the Drama?," which addresses her reputation for being outspoken and at the center of public controversy. In an interview with Gayle King for "CBS Mornings," she explained that she doesn't enjoy conflict but believes her personality makes her an easy target for it. The Bronx-born rapper acknowledged that this perception has followed her since high school, where she was voted "most dramatic." She stated that some of the drama in her life is a source of significant stress, pushing back against the idea that she actively seeks it out.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's autonomous vehicle company, Waymo, has received a permit to begin testing its robotaxi service at San Francisco International Airport (SFO). The rollout will occur in phases, starting with employee testing with human safety drivers on board before transitioning to a fully driverless commercial service for the public. This expansion marks a significant step for Waymo, which already operates in San Mateo County and San Francisco but previously lacked airport access. The move follows similar permits obtained for airports in Phoenix and San Jose, positioning Waymo to integrate its services with major transportation hubs in the Bay Area.</p>

          <p>With interest rates remaining relatively high but potentially poised to fall, long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a way for savers to lock in current returns. A 2-year CD opened in September with a competitive rate of 4.06% could yield significant interest, with a $10,000 deposit earning approximately $828 over the term. This financial instrument provides a guaranteed return, protecting savers from future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. However, it requires committing funds for the full term, as early withdrawal penalties can be costly, making it suitable for money that won't be needed in the short term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The popularity of whole-body deodorants, marketed for use on the entire body, reflects a growing anxiety among Americans about their natural scent. This trend may be partly a delayed effect of the pandemic, which de-acclimated people to the normal odors of others, making them more self-conscious. Historically, deodorant marketing has preyed on insecurity, a strategy that continues today as people seek control in anxious times. However, scientists caution that altering our natural body odor, which plays a mysterious but important role in primal communication and potentially mate selection, could have unintended consequences for human interaction.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite political debates and shifting government policies, renewable energy sources like onshore wind and utility-scale solar remain the cheapest forms of energy to produce in the U.S. An analysis using the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) benchmark shows that even without subsidies, renewables are more cost-competitive than fossil fuels like coal and natural gas. While President Trump has enacted policies favoring oil and gas, and tariffs may increase costs for some renewable components, the fundamental economics still favor wind and solar due to their low operating expenses once built. Experts note that a diverse energy portfolio is necessary, but renewables lead on production cost.</p>

          <p>A framework agreement for TikTok's U.S. operations will reportedly include new investors alongside existing ones from its parent company, ByteDance, with the deal expected to close in the next 30 to 45 days. According to sources, Oracle will maintain its role as the cloud and data security provider for the platform under the new structure. This arrangement aims to resolve longstanding U.S. national security concerns that the Chinese government could access American user data. The deal follows years of uncertainty and negotiations after Congress passed a law in 2024 mandating that ByteDance divest from the popular social media app's U.S. operations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The '6-month rule' is a critical component of reverse mortgages, dictating the timeline for heirs after the borrower passes away or permanently leaves the home. Lenders must issue a 'Due and Payable' letter, giving heirs six months to either repay the loan balance in full or sell the property to satisfy the debt. This rule primarily applies to federally insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs). While extensions are possible, the tight timeline underscores the need for borrowers to engage in thorough estate planning and communicate clearly with their families to avoid a stressful situation or potential foreclosure on the family home.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has lifted travel restrictions on Hungarian citizens that were imposed by the previous administration in 2021. The earlier restrictions were enacted due to security concerns over Hungary's policy of granting citizenship to nearly one million people born abroad without adequate vetting. The move restores the two-year validity period for travel authorizations under the Visa Waiver Program, which had been reduced to one year. This decision signals a significant warming of diplomatic ties between Washington and the government of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whom President Trump has praised as a 'fantastic leader.'</p>
