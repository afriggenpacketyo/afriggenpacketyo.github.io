          <p>The Federal Trade Commission, joined by seven states, has filed a lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, alleging illegal ticket resale tactics. The suit claims the companies facilitated scalpers' ability to unlawfully purchase large quantities of tickets, thereby inflating prices for consumers and harming artists who wish to keep prices affordable. The FTC accuses Ticketmaster of effectively "triple dipping" by collecting fees from brokers and consumers in both primary and secondary markets, generating billions in resale revenue.</p>

The company surpassed Wall Street estimates for both earnings per share and revenue, posting an adjusted EPS of $3.83 against an expected $3.59. CEO Raj Subramaniam attributed the positive performance to strategic initiatives that have reduced costs while improving customer experience, with a notable 6% increase in average daily volumes in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis from the BBC concludes that President Donald Trump's state visit to the UK was successful in demonstrating a warm personal relationship with Prime Minister Keir Starmer but did not grant Britain significant new influence over U.S. policy. While the pageantry, particularly the events with the Royal Family, clearly pleased the president, his administration has indicated that core positions on trade and international affairs will not change. The visit allowed Starmer to navigate disagreements on issues like Palestinian statehood without diplomatic penalty, but ultimately highlighted the limits of personal rapport.</p>

          <p>Hyundai Motor Group has reaffirmed its aggressive U.S. growth plans, even after a major immigration raid at its jointly owned Georgia battery plant and a downward revision of its annual profit outlook due to tariffs.

The film is described as a visceral and emotional triumph, blending intense action sequences with a compelling story about resisting authoritarianism, featuring strong performances from its cast.</p>

          <p>A jury has found a Los Angeles protester not guilty of assaulting a U.S. Border Patrol agent during a demonstration against immigration raids in June. The acquittal of Brayan Ramos-Brito is a setback for federal prosecutors, as the defense successfully cast doubt on the credibility of the agents who testified, including a senior chief. Witness footage showed an agent forcefully shoving the defendant but did not capture the alleged assault, and the trial revealed factual discrepancies in official reports about the incident.</p>

Despite previous unsuccessful bids for the Washington Nationals and Baltimore Orioles, he continues to pursue this localized growth model, which he compares to a tech company with recurring subscription revenue.</p>
