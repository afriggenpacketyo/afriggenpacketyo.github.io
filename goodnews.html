        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this New York Times opinion piece, Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist, argues that the pursuit of perfect motherhood is harmful. She contends that being flawed is essential for children to learn acceptance and resilience. Ross suggests that mothers often receive messages implying they are not doing enough, which can negatively impact children by creating unrealistic expectations about relationships. Ross encourages mothers to give themselves a break and recognize that their imperfections are a valuable part of parenting, teaching children about give and take in close relationships.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15, without preconditions, following calls from European leaders for a 30-day ceasefire. This offer references the unsuccessful 2022 peace talks held in Istanbul shortly after Russia's full-scale invasion. Putin stated Russia's commitment to serious negotiations and didn't rule out a ceasefire during direct talks. The proposal came after leaders from France, the U.K., Germany, and Poland urged Moscow to accept a 30-day ceasefire, supported by U.S. President Donald Trump, threatening increased sanctions if Russia doesn't comply.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a 5% year-on-year decrease in net profit for the first quarter of 2025, attributing the decline to lower oil prices and reduced production. The company's net income for the quarter reached $26 billion, slightly above analyst expectations, while free cash flow decreased from $22.8 billion to $19.2 billion. This signals ongoing financial pressures for the Saudi state oil giant as crude prices struggle to recover and global demand slows. Aramco increased its first-quarter base dividend by 4.2% year-on-year to $21.1 billion.</p>
