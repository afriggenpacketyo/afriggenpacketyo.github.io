          <p>Boston Red Sox pitcher Garrett Crochet delivered a strong performance, overcoming an early two-run deficit to lead his team to a 4-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. Despite Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández hitting early home runs, Crochet settled in to strike out 10 batters over six innings. Dodgers starter Clayton Kershaw struggled to hold the lead, giving up three runs in the second inning and another in the fifth. The Dodgers' efforts to rally were hampered by missed opportunities and three outs made on the basepaths, sealing the win for Boston.</p>

          <p>China has officially recognized "drone flight planner" as a new occupation, reflecting the rapid growth of its low-altitude economy. The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security announced the new role, which involves planning flight paths, developing mission plans, and managing on-site drone operations. This move is part of Beijing's strategy to cultivate the low-altitude sector, which includes both manned and unmanned aerial activities up to 1,000 meters, as a key driver of economic growth and innovation. The government has established a dedicated department to oversee the industry's development.</p>

          <p>A research team in China is attempting to reconstruct the Houfeng Didong Yi, an ancient seismoscope reputedly invented nearly 2,000 years ago by the polymath Zhang Heng. Historical texts describe the ornate device as being able to detect distant earthquakes and indicate the direction of their epicenter, a feat that has led some modern scholars to dismiss it as a legend. Despite its removal from Chinese school curricula in 2017, scientists are now using modern knowledge and new clues to restore the lost wonder.

          <p>Beyond his legendary music career, the late Ozzy Osbourne is being remembered for his iconic role in pioneering celebrity reality television with the early 2000s MTV show, "The Osbournes." The series, which followed the daily life of his family, presented the "Prince of Darkness" as a lovable, often-confused father, a stark contrast to his heavy metal persona. The show's success, blending mundane family life with rock-star fame, won an Emmy and paved the way for future reality TV dynasties like the Kardashians. It offered an unprecedented, and at the time unscripted, look into the private world of a celebrity family.</p>

Despite threats, he stood by his principles, an act the Church considers a testament to his faith.

          <p>As football fans prepare for the tense Euro 2025 final, psychologists explain the intense physical and emotional reactions that come with watching a high-stakes match. The body's stress response, driven by hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, causes elevated heart rates and anxiety, which is a normal sign of deep engagement. Experts advise managing these effects by getting good rest, having a clear plan for the day, and engaging in movement to release pent-up energy. They also suggest reframing the nerves as part of an enjoyable, communal experience that provides a rare outlet for emotional expression.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in 20 to 30 years, with average July temperatures running below normal and daytime highs struggling to leave the 60s. Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray weather to a misplaced high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold, deep ocean water to the surface. While the Bay Area remains cool, other parts of California are dealing with oppressive heat and dangerous fire conditions. Forecasters warn that despite the cold start, the Bay Area's hottest months are often September and October, so a heatwave is still possible.</p>
