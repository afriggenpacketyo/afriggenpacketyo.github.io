          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 13:56:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle publicly rebuked comments from United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, who had declared the ultra-low-cost carrier business model dead. Biffle highlighted Frontier's lower operational costs per seat mile compared to United, arguing that budget airlines cater to a distinct market segment seeking value. The dispute comes as discount carriers like Spirit and Frontier face financial headwinds from rising costs and increased competition from major airlines that have adopted similar no-frills basic economy fares, leading to an oversupply of domestic flights and downward pressure on ticket prices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent drop in the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate to its lowest point since 2022 has triggered a nearly 60% weekly surge in refinancing applications. The trend is largely driven by homeowner expectations of an impending Federal Reserve rate cut. The article suggests that homeowners who purchased homes in 2023 or 2024 at higher rates, those with large outstanding balances, and borrowers with good credit and significant home equity stand to benefit most. Refinancing into a stable, long-term fixed mortgage is also presented as a strategic move for those with adjustable-rate mortgages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a late-stage clinical trial, Eli Lilly's experimental oral diabetes pill, orforglipron, demonstrated superior efficacy in lowering blood sugar and promoting weight loss compared to Novo Nordisk's approved oral drug, Rybelsus. The study found that the highest dose of orforglipron reduced hemoglobin A1c levels by 2.2% and led to an average weight loss of 9.2%, outperforming the results from Novo Nordisk's pill. While these results position Eli Lilly's drug as a strong contender in the growing market for convenient GLP-1 treatments, experts note the trial did not compare it against higher, yet-to-be-approved doses of Novo Nordisk's medication.</p>

          <p>Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino asserted that despite public perception of rising ticket prices, concert tickets are still relatively underpriced compared to major sporting events. Speaking at a conference, Rapino highlighted the immense demand for live events in a post-pandemic world, noting that touring has become the primary revenue source for most artists. He emphasized the high production costs of modern tours, comparing major artist productions to staging a Super Bowl every night. The discussion comes as data shows the cost of admission to live entertainment has outpaced general inflation.</p>

          <h2>EU Adopts New Strategy to Strengthen Ties with India Amid US Trade Pressure</h2>

          <p>The European Union has proposed a new strategic agenda aimed at elevating its partnership with India, a move seen as an effort to draw New Delhi away from Russia's sphere of influence. This diplomatic approach contrasts with that of the U.S., where President Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on India, partly for its purchases of Russian fuel. The EU's strategy focuses on enhancing trade, defense, and industrial cooperation, viewing India as a key partner and a counterweight to China. European officials emphasize building relationships with reliable partners rather than imposing punitive tariffs.</p>

          <p>England defeated Ireland by four wickets in the first match of their three-game T20 cricket series in Dublin, largely thanks to a powerful performance by opener Phil Salt. Salt scored 89 runs off just 46 balls, setting a strong foundation for England's successful chase of Ireland's total of 196-3. Despite a late push from Ireland's bowlers, England reached the target with more than two overs to spare. The victory marks England's first T20 win against Ireland and sets a positive tone for the rest of the series, which continues on Friday.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged nearly 80% since the beginning of 2024, recently surpassing $3,600 per ounce, and some analysts believe it could reach the $4,000 mark soon. Several factors are contributing to this potential rise, including the expectation of further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which can make non-yielding assets like gold more attractive. Additionally, rising inflation and general market uncertainty are prompting investors to seek safe-haven assets. This article suggests these conditions create a strong upward pressure on the price of the precious metal. (not investment advice)</p>

While no immediate hazards to land have been issued, meteorologists suggest Gabrielle could intensify into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend. The storm's formation comes about a week after the historical peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, which has so far been quieter than initially predicted.</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service is set to announce its annual inflation adjustments for federal income tax brackets, which could provide financial relief for many households in 2026. Experts project the IRS will apply an inflation rate of about 2.7%, increasing the income thresholds for each tax bracket to prevent "bracket creep," where cost-of-living pay raises push workers into higher tax rates. This means taxpayers will be able to earn more income before moving into a higher marginal tax bracket. The official adjustments are typically announced by the IRS in October or November.

          <p>The Scottish Parliament has approved a landmark legal reform to scrap the controversial "not proven" verdict from its criminal justice system. This change, part of a broader justice bill, will leave Scotland with two possible verdicts: guilty and not guilty. The bill also raises the jury majority required for a guilty verdict from a simple majority to two-thirds and establishes a specialized court for sexual offenses. Critics of the "not proven" verdict argued it was confusing and failed to provide closure for victims, while supporters claimed it was a safeguard against wrongful convictions.</p>
