          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have made a strategic adjustment to their pitching rotation for the National League Championship Series against the Milwaukee Brewers, delaying Shohei Ohtani's next start. Manager Dave Roberts announced Yoshinobu Yamamoto will start Game 2, allowing Ohtani additional time to focus on his hitting after a challenging offensive performance in the NL Division Series. This move aims to optimize the team's pitching by keeping Yamamoto on his regular rest schedule for a potential Game 6, while Ohtani works to "recalibrate" at the plate. The article details how this decision, while sacrificing a second Ohtani start, is crucial for the team's overall World Series aspirations and player performance.</p>

          <p>Swimming Australia has taken action to refute and shut down "fake news" and "fabricated quotes" falsely attributed to Olympic champion Mollie O’Callaghan regarding transgender athletes. The misleading quotes, which circulated widely on social media platforms, suggested O’Callaghan would boycott the 2028 LA Games if a transgender swimmer like Lia Thomas were allowed to compete, including a provocative statement about "an insult and a disgrace." Swimming Australia confirmed that O’Callaghan never made such comments and has formally requested the posts be removed from Meta platforms.

          <p>This article explores the growing challenges of maintaining adult friendships amidst life changes and the common phenomenon of "ghosting," which contributes to the loss of approximately half of adult friendships every seven years. Experts advocate for honest communication, embracing "messy" lives by including friends in mundane activities, and prioritizing consistent in-person interactions over virtual ones. Psychologist Dr. Marisa Franco emphasizes that social connection functions like a muscle, becoming easier with practice, and that individuals often underestimate the profound happiness it brings. The article encourages readers to trust in the resilience of their friendships and to proactively rekindle bonds.</p>

          <h2>New Research Uses Thermal Cameras to Objectively Measure and Monitor Stress Levels</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 19:28:34 EDT</div>

          <p>Psychologists at the University of Sussex are utilizing thermal cameras to objectively measure and monitor stress levels, revealing that a drop in nose temperature correlates with acute stress. This innovative, non-invasive technique tracks changes in facial blood flow, which naturally shifts away from the nose towards the eyes and ears during stressful situations as a survival response. Researchers believe this "nasal dip" could serve as a robust marker for changing stress states, potentially aiding in managing harmful stress levels in humans. This article highlights a promising scientific advancement with applications for monitoring wellbeing in non-communicative individuals like babies and even great apes.</p>
