          <p>AI startup Anthropic has agreed to a landmark settlement in a class-action lawsuit brought by authors who alleged their books were illegally used to train AI models. The company will pay a minimum of $1.5 billion, amounting to roughly $3,000 per book, and has agreed to destroy the datasets containing the pirated material. This case has been closely watched as a bellwether for copyright infringement in the age of artificial intelligence. If approved, the settlement would represent the largest publicly reported copyright recovery in history, sending a strong message to the AI industry.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has ruled that the Trump administration's effort to terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for migrants from Venezuela and Haiti was illegal. The decision by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen blocks the administration from ending legal protections and work permits for hundreds of thousands of individuals from these countries. The judge criticized the Department of Homeland Security's action as unprecedented in its speed and a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. This ruling sets aside the administration's policy, pending a potential appeal, protecting recipients from deportation to their crisis-stricken home countries.</p>

          <p>Following his death at age 91, industry experts are reflecting on Giorgio Armani's legacy as both a revolutionary designer and a savvy business leader who built a global empire. He is celebrated for creating the "power suit," which redefined office attire for both men and women in the 1970s and '80s by offering a softer, more elegant silhouette. Armani was also a pioneer in leveraging celebrity culture, dressing stars for films and red carpet events to elevate his brand's prestige. By maintaining independent control of his company, he ensured a consistent vision across a vast portfolio that expanded from luxury clothing to perfumes, home goods, and more.</p>

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot grows, a new analysis shows significant state-by-state differences in lottery ticket spending. Massachusetts residents spend the most, averaging $915 per person annually, followed by Rhode Island at $573. In contrast, North Dakotans spend the least, at just $50 a year, which may be partly due to fewer purchasing opportunities in rural areas. For many states, lottery sales are a notable source of revenue, accounting for an average of 1% of general revenue and as much as 3% in states like Rhode Island and South Dakota.

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis of FBI data contradicts President Trump's characterization of Chicago as a "murder capital," revealing that its violent crime rate is lower than that of many other large U.S. cities. In 2024, Chicago ranked 29th out of 37 cities with populations over 500,000 for violent crime, with rates below those in New York, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C. While Chicago did record the highest total number of homicides, its homicide *rate* per 100,000 people was tenth highest. Crime analysts caution against ranking cities due to differing methodologies, but the data shows that overall violent crime in Chicago has been falling.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett stated she has "great respect" for Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, despite their sharp exchanges in written opinions. In her first television interview, Barrett addressed a recent majority opinion where she directly criticized Jackson's dissent, explaining that a "spirited argument" from her colleague "merited a spirited response." Barrett emphasized that their disagreements are about legal ideas, not personal animosity, quoting her former mentor Justice Antonin Scalia's philosophy of attacking ideas, not people. She dismissed any notion of a "beef" between them, highlighting the court's ability to maintain collegiality amid vigorous debate.</p>

          <p>The U.S. tech industry's eight largest companies added a combined $420 billion in market capitalization this week, bringing their total value to an unprecedented $21 trillion. This surge was led by Alphabet and Apple, which rallied after a favorable court ruling in Google's antitrust case that limited the required remedies. Broadcom also saw significant gains after announcing a new $10 billion AI chip customer, widely believed to be OpenAI. These eight megacap companies now account for approximately 36% of the S&P 500's total value, a historically unparalleled level of market concentration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides guidance for retirees considering reverse mortgages to access home equity amid rising living costs. It profiles several top lenders, categorizing them based on strengths such as low costs, product variety, large loan amounts, and customer satisfaction. The piece advises homeowners to carefully consider their long-term plans, as these loans are best suited for those who intend to remain in their homes. It also stresses the importance of comparing total costs, understanding the impact on benefits eligibility, and discussing the implications with heirs, as the loan becomes due upon moving, selling, or death.

          <h2>Weakening Job Market Data May Lead to Further Drops in Mortgage Rates</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent disappointing jobs report, which showed rising unemployment and weak hiring, could lead to a positive outcome for homebuyers and homeowners: lower mortgage rates. Because the Federal Reserve often cuts interest rates to stimulate a flagging economy, the weak labor market data increases the likelihood of a significant rate cut at the upcoming September meeting. Lenders have already begun pricing in an anticipated cut, contributing to recent rate declines. The new data raises the possibility of an even larger cut, which would likely push mortgage and refinancing rates down further. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to political attacks on their agency's credibility, employees at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) are publicly affirming the reliability of the government's economic data. Following President Trump's firing of the BLS Commissioner after a previous jobs report, current staff issued a statement emphasizing that their work is guided by law and statistical practice, not partisan influence. They defended the common practice of revising monthly jobs numbers as more data becomes available, countering claims that such revisions are a "major mistake." The employees vowed to continue publishing accurate data regardless of political pressure or how inconvenient the results may be.</p>

          <p>The large, 32-foot-tall "LAX" sign that has greeted travelers at the entrance to Los Angeles International Airport for 25 years is being temporarily taken down. The removal is necessary to accommodate a major reconfiguration of the airport's roadway system, which aims to improve traffic flow and accessibility. The project is part of a broader modernization effort to prepare the airport for the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics. The iconic letters will be stored safely during construction and reinstalled in a new location compatible with the redesigned entrance once the project is complete.</p>

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell significantly on Friday, dropping to 6.29% following the release of a weaker-than-expected August jobs report. This marks the largest one-day drop in over a year and brings rates to their lowest point since October of the previous year. The decline could provide relief to potential homebuyers who have been sidelined by high borrowing costs and home prices. A lower rate can reduce monthly payments by a considerable amount, though analysts question whether this drop will be substantial enough to fully reinvigorate a housing market.

          <p>Following the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has initiated a wide-ranging cabinet reshuffle in an attempt to reset his government. Instead of a simple replacement, Starmer opted for a major shake-up, appointing new home and foreign secretaries and creating a scenario where the top three offices of state below prime minister are all held by women. This move is seen as an effort to seize authority and re-energize his administration after a difficult first year marked by poor approval ratings. The prime minister is hoping this new team can deliver on his agenda.</p>
