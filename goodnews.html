          <h2>Eligibility of "Buy Now, Pay Later" Debt for Forgiveness Programs Examined</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 16:46:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>"Buy now, pay later" services have surged in popularity, but rising consumer defaults are creating new financial challenges. This article explores whether this type of unsecured debt qualifies for debt forgiveness programs, concluding that while it is technically possible, eligibility varies widely. The newness of these services means debt relief companies often lack established relationships with providers, and individual debts may not meet the minimum thresholds required for negotiation. The report also outlines alternatives for consumers, such as direct negotiation with lenders, debt consolidation, or professional credit counseling.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders met with President Donald Trump to discuss a potential path to ending the war with Russia. During the talks, Trump pledged "very good protection" for Ukraine through security guarantees but emphasized that Europe would need to shoulder most of the responsibility. He also reversed his previous demand for a ceasefire as a precondition for further negotiations, a stance that drew pushback from European leaders. Trump stated his goal is to organize a trilateral meeting with Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to finalize a peace agreement.</p>

          <p>During his return to the White House for talks with President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy adopted a notably collegial and charming demeanor. This approach contrasted with a previous, more acrimonious visit, and included a lighthearted exchange with a reporter about his decision to wear a suit instead of his usual military attire. The article highlights Zelenskyy's efforts to build rapport, such as delivering a personal letter from his wife to Melania Trump. It also covers President Trump's hints at providing security guarantees for Ukraine, a key demand from Kyiv in any potential peace deal with Russia.</p>

The deal includes up to $1.4 billion in additional backstop financing from Google, bringing its total potential investment to $3.2 billion, which will help fund the expansion of TeraWulf's Lake Mariner facility in New York. This move solidifies a strategic alignment to build out advanced artificial intelligence infrastructure, leveraging TeraWulf's energy assets. The announcement follows recent 10-year computing deals with AI cloud provider Fluidstack, which significantly boosts TeraWulf's contracted revenue and capacity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new musical "& Juliet" offers a vibrant and empowering revision of Shakespeare's classic tragedy, built around the hit songs of producer Max Martin. The show's premise has Juliet choosing not to die and instead embarking on a new life of self-discovery in Paris, set to a soundtrack of pop anthems from artists like Britney Spears and Katy Perry. This review praises the production for its witty book by David West Read and energetic direction, which transforms the story into a euphoric dance party celebrating female agency. The lead performance by Rachel Webb is highlighted for her powerful vocals that turn pop hits into anthems of emancipation.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 15:24:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article addresses the common question of whether age limits exist for purchasing annuities as a retirement planning tool. While there are no federal laws setting a maximum age, individual insurance companies typically impose their own limits, often around 80 to 85 years old, based on risk assessment. The piece explains that the best age to buy an annuity depends on individual financial strategy rather than a specific number. Purchasing in one's late 50s or 60s allows for growth in deferred annuities, while buying an immediate annuity closer to retirement age can provide a stable income stream to supplement Social Security.</p>

Yang discussed how pop culture, and SNL in particular, was a crucial tool for him to assimilate after moving from French Canada to Colorado as a child.
