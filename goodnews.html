          <p>Despite a slight dip in TJX Companies' stock following a recent earnings report, CNBC upgraded the company, noting its solid performance in a challenging retail environment. Revenue and earnings per share exceeded expectations, and same-store sales grew by 3%. Analysts attribute the stock's decline to concerns over same-store sales and gross margins, as well as conservative guidance for the upcoming quarter due to tariff impacts. This article emphasizes TJX's resilience as an off-price retailer, its ability to navigate tariff uncertainties, and its appeal to consumers seeking value during recession fears, concluding that the stock dip presents a buying opportunity.

          <p>Bitcoin briefly surpassed its January record, reaching a new all-time high before declining as Treasury yields increased, putting pressure on risk assets. The cryptocurrency had been steadily climbing in May, driven by factors such as softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. Cumulative inflows into ETFs tracking bitcoin's price have exceeded $40 billion, and on-chain data indicates lower selling pressure and increased liquidity in the crypto market. This article covers the factors influencing bitcoin's price fluctuations and the broader market dynamics affecting cryptocurrency investments.</p>
