          <p>South Africa's Presidential spokesperson, Vincent Magwenya, stated that President Ramaphosa anticipated a confrontational ‚Äúshow‚Äù from President Trump during their White House meeting. Magwenya emphasized that Ramaphosa remained calm and dignified throughout the exchange, which included Trump presenting videos that Magwenya described as an ‚Äúabsolute lie‚Äù. Ramaphosa aimed to discuss matters away from cameras, focusing on trade and South Africa's mineral resources, and considered Trump's actions as ‚Äúnoise‚Äù that would not alter the fundamental aspects of the relationship between the two countries. </p>

During a bond hearing, she was granted $1,500 bond, and her attorney stated that she would be home with her family soon.

The Tulsa Zoo was chosen due to its larger enclosure and existing herd of Asian elephants. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>News of former President Biden's advanced prostate cancer has revived debate about the benefits and harms of PSA screening tests. Doctors say the tests are an imperfect tool for detecting prostate cancer, as they can lead to overtreatment of slow-growing cancers. Conflicting public health guidelines on PSA screening have led to confusion. A new approach to prostate cancer screening involves getting an MRI and watching and waiting, instead of immediately having a biopsy. </p>
