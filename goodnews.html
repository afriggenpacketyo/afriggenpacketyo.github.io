        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are increasingly using income overlay strategies, such as selling covered call options, to generate regular income from non-yielding assets like gold and bitcoin. This approach caters to investors seeking portfolio diversification away from traditional stocks and bonds, while still desiring the steady income typically associated with fixed-income assets. Major firms like BlackRock are entering this space, indicating growing market interest, although these specialized income ETFs remain much smaller than their traditional counterparts. This trend reflects a broader rethinking of portfolio construction in the current economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's decision to lower the price of its 'Gold Card' residency visa from $5 million to $1 million has sparked significant interest among the global wealthy. Immigration attorneys report a surge in demand for the program, which grants residency in exchange for what is officially termed an "unrestricted gift" to the government. The new price point makes the U.S. visa highly competitive compared to similar programs in countries like Singapore and New Zealand. However, the program faces potential legal challenges and operational hurdles, as the application process is not yet active and its legal framework is unconventional. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Paccar, the parent company of truck manufacturers Peterbilt and Kenworth, saw a significant jump of over 6% in premarket trading. This surge followed President Trump's announcement of a new 25% tariff on all imported heavy trucks, set to begin on October 1st. The administration stated the tariff is intended to protect American truck manufacturers from what it described as unfair foreign competition. According to Bank of America analysts, this policy directly addresses the price disadvantage Paccar's domestically produced trucks face compared to competitors manufacturing in Mexico, placing the company in a stronger market position.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners looking to borrow, home equity loans and HELOCs offer more affordable interest rates compared to personal loans or credit cards. As of September 25, 2025, average rates for 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year home equity loans are 8.19%, 8.34%, and 8.21% respectively, while the average HELOC rate is 7.88%. These products allow homeowners to tap into their substantial home equity, though they use the home as collateral. While rates are variable and depend on multiple factors, they are expected to decline if the Federal Reserve implements further rate cuts later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As of September 25, 2025, average interest rates for home loans remain a key factor for buyers and refinancers in a challenging housing market. The national average for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.27%, while a 15-year mortgage averages 5.49%; refinance rates are slightly higher at 6.61% and 5.92% respectively. While rates are higher than in recent years, borrowers with strong credit profiles can still secure favorable terms. Experts suggest that a potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could bring relief and stabilize borrowing costs for consumers in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An intellectual property attorney advises that anyone starting a side hustle, regardless of its initial size, should secure a trademark as a foundational legal step. This protection acts like a deed to a house, legally establishing ownership of a business name, logo, or slogan and preventing others from using a similar brand. Failing to do so can lead to future legal disputes and potential loss of profits if another party claims prior use of the name. The attorney recommends a comprehensive intellectual property strategy that also considers copyrights and forming an LLC to protect personal assets as the business grows.</p>

          <p>As of September 26, 2025, the price of gold is reported at $3,766.45 per ounce, maintaining its status as a key commodity for investors. Gold is often considered a safe-haven asset, particularly during times of economic uncertainty and inflation, due to its historical ability to retain value. The price of the precious metal is influenced by a variety of factors, including global supply and demand, economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability. Investors often turn to gold to hedge against the eroding purchasing power of fiat currencies, making its price a closely watched economic indicator. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's key inflation measure, held at a 2.9% annual rate in August, meeting economists' expectations. The headline PCE, which includes food and energy, rose slightly to 2.7% annually. Despite inflation remaining above the Fed's 2% target, these figures are unlikely to alter the central bank's plan to continue with interest rate reductions this year. The data also showed resilient consumer spending and a slight increase in personal income, suggesting that the administration's tariffs have had a limited inflationary impact on consumers so far.

Unlike traditional turbines, these airborne versions float on helium and are tethered to the ground by cables that transmit electricity. The company, Sawes Energy Technology, aims for mass production by 2026, with the first units expected to connect to the grid in the same year, representing a novel approach to renewable energy generation.</p>

This follows two other rejected approaches earlier in the month, shortly after the departure of long-serving executive chairman Daniel Levy. Despite the owners' firm stance, the recent flurry of interest suggests that industry figures view the Premier League club as a potential acquisition target.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan housing bill, the ROAD to Housing Act, is gaining unanimous support in the Senate for its approach to boosting housing supply by involving the federal government. The act proposes creating model zoning codes that encourage denser construction and financially rewarding municipalities that adopt reforms and increase their housing stock. Proponents, like the Economic Innovation Group, see this as a step toward 'Right-to-Build Zones,' where cities could adopt less restrictive federal codes in specific areas to streamline development. This strategy aims to overcome local opposition that often stifles housing growth, representing a potentially significant federal intervention in land-use policy.</p>

          <p>Understanding how a financial advisor is paid is crucial for investors, yet many are unaware of the fee structures involved. Compensation typically falls into two categories: commission-based, where advisors are paid for selling specific products, and fee-based, which includes various models like a percentage of assets under management (AUM), flat annual fees, or hourly rates. Each model has its own benefits and potential conflicts of interest. For instance, commissions can create an incentive to sell products that are not optimal for the client, while AUM fees may not be accessible for those with fewer assets. (not investment advice)</p>
