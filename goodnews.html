          <p>The White House has announced that President Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition in older adults, after he experienced mild leg swelling. A memo from his physician, Sean Barbabella, stated the condition is benign and that the president remains in "excellent" overall health following a comprehensive examination. The announcement addresses recent public speculation fueled by photos showing swollen ankles and bruised hands, which the physician attributed to frequent handshaking and aspirin use. The memo confirmed no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, aligning with economists' expectations. The easing was partly attributed to a slowdown in the rapid increase of rice prices after the government released stockpiles, although they remain elevated. This data comes as the country faces economic growth concerns due to potential U.S. tariffs and a recent GDP decline. Despite inflation remaining above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months, some analysts do not expect an interest rate hike until 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A settlement has been reached in a class-action lawsuit brought by investors against Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other company leaders. The lawsuit alleged that officials failed to disclose the risks associated with the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal, where user data was misused for political purposes. Shareholders sought to have Meta reimbursed for over $8 billion in fines and legal costs stemming from the fallout, including a major fine from the Federal Trade Commission. The terms of the settlement, announced in a Delaware court, were not immediately disclosed.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed the Genius Act, a landmark bipartisan bill creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation, which now heads to the President's desk, aims to provide consumer protection and clear rules for the $250 billion market. Supporters, including President Trump, believe the act will secure America's leadership in payment innovation and allow banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins. The bill is part of a broader push to support the cryptocurrency industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA) has stated that reducing the County Championship from 14 to 12 games per season is the "only reasonable option" to improve the competition and protect player welfare. The recommendation comes as a review of England's domestic cricket structure is nearing its conclusion. The PCA cites research showing 83% of players have concerns about their physical wellbeing due to the current intense schedule. The association supports a conference-based model or a traditional divisional structure, as long as the number of games is reduced.</p>

His oil paintings, based on historical research and local recollections, depict miners toiling underground and the iconic coal breakers of the region.

Fico stated that it would be "counterproductive" to continue the blockade after receiving guarantees from the EU regarding future gas prices and supply. The new sanctions target Russia's energy and banking sectors, including further isolating Russian banks from the SWIFT payment system.</p>
