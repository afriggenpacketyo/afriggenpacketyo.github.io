          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has stated his openness to discussing the potential deployment of France's nuclear weapons in other European countries, under specific conditions. Macron emphasized that France's own defense capabilities must remain intact and that ultimate control over the weapons would remain with the French president. While Macron proposed talks with European allies, he also made it clear that France would not pay for the security of others. Germany has expressed interest in hosting French nuclear weapons, but stressed that this would not replace the nuclear guarantee from the United States.</p>
