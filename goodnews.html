          <p>The United States and China have reached a temporary agreement to reduce tariffs imposed on each other's goods for a 90-day period, signaling a potential de-escalation in the ongoing trade war between the two economic superpowers. This decision follows high-level trade negotiations in Switzerland, where both countries expressed a mutual interest in a sustainable and mutually beneficial economic relationship. The agreement entails the U.S. lowering tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China will decrease tariffs on American goods from 125% to 10%, with both sides continuing discussions on economic and trade policy.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer has revealed Labour's proposals to modify immigration levels into the UK, aiming for a system that is "controlled, selective, and fair." The plans include tightening skilled worker visa requirements by raising qualification standards, while also expanding eligibility for the "high potential individual" visa. Immigrants will generally need to live in the UK for 10 years before they can apply for permanent residency. Additionally, a dedicated visa for social care providers will be abolished, and overseas graduates will have a shorter period to stay in the UK after their studies.</p>

          <p>A new rule in the U.S. mandates that hotels and short-term lodging companies must disclose all mandatory fees upfront, targeting charges like "resort fees" that are often hidden until check-in. While the rule aims to increase transparency, it does not eliminate these fees, but rather ensures that travelers are aware of them before booking. However, some experts express concern that recent actions by the Trump administration, including staff cuts at enforcement agencies, may hinder the rule's effectiveness in protecting consumers from deceptive practices.</p>

These findings suggest that rhythmic structures and call combinations, key elements of spoken language, were present in primate communication long before the emergence of humans.</p>

          <p>Langer's Delicatessen in Westlake may serve the best pastrami dip sandwich in Los Angeles, offering a purist's take on the classic. Served on a golden French roll made by Fred's Bakery, the sandwich features a mountain of expertly prepared pastrami and a flavorful cup of jus for dipping. While Langer's is famous for its No. 19, the pastrami dip showcases the quality of the meat and ingredients, and is a must-try for pastrami enthusiasts.</p>
