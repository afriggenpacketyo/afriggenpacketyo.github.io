Kidd has a 179-149 record with the Mavericks and previously coached the Nets and Bucks. He also played for the Knicks in 2012-13. </p>

          <p>Following a social media feud between President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, wrestler Logan Paul has proposed a WWE-style faceoff between the two. Paul posted an edited WWE promo photo depicting a hypothetical match called "Summer Slam." The feud began after Musk criticized Trump, leading to a series of online exchanges.

          <p>Despite their recent falling out, Donald Trump and Elon Musk remain intertwined due to their reliance on each other in several key areas, including political funding, government contracts, and personal relationships. Musk's substantial donations to Trump and other Republicans could be missed as Republicans try to maintain their congressional advantage. Musk's companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, have significant government contracts, giving Trump leverage. Canceling these contracts would be a complex legal process, and the US government is likely to continue doing business with Musk's companies. </p>
