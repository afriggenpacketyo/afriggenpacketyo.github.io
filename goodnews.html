          <h2>Traveler Criticizes Hotel Shower Designs for Inconvenience</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A woman's Reddit post criticizing hotel shower designs has gone viral, highlighting frustrations with features like cold water blasts and immovable glass walls. The traveler, addressing male hotel room designers, expressed her need for a way to turn on the shower without getting wet, especially since she doesn't wash her hair every day. Commenters shared similar grievances, including the lack of shower doors and counter space. The post sparked a discussion about amenities geared towards women travelers and the overall hotel room experience, revealing that expensive hotels don't necessarily equate to great shower design, and many travelers want more thoughtful features in their rooms. The shower design flaws can lead to energy waste as guests compensate for the cold with more hot water. </p>

          <p>UCLA will distribute $20.5 million in revenue sharing to athletes, the maximum allowed under the House settlement with the NCAA, while maintaining its Olympic sports programs and staffing levels. The school will also preserve scholarship limits at their current levels for at least one year to distribute more revenue sharing money to each player. It is expected that UCLA will follow other Power Four conference schools in using U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken‚Äôs back-payment formula as a model for current athletes. UCLA is also committed to preserving its Olympic sports that have provided the lion‚Äôs share of NCAA championships in an athletic department widely regarded as one of the best in the nation. Jarmond said there would be no staffing cuts, but some personnel might be reassigned to better serve the athletic department. </p>

          <p>Charlotte Edwards and Nat Sciver-Brunt began their tenure with a clean sweep over a depleted West Indies side, but the team has tougher tests ahead. England has regularly dominated home bilateral series, but then crumbled on the big stage. Prior to this series, they had won 79.3% of their completed white-ball games at home since 2020, and that number rises to 87.8% when you take out Australia and India. World Cup-winning spinner Alex Hartley says that England are in a "good place" because of the dominant manner in which they have been winning, but has this series provided anything to suggest things will be different and whether the "new" England can finally perform under pressure when it matters?</p>
