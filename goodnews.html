          <p>Hims & Hers Health experienced a surge in its stock price after Novo Nordisk announced it would offer its weight loss drug Wegovy through telehealth providers like Hims & Hers. However, shares of Hims & Hers Health fell in extended trading after the company reported first-quarter earnings that beat analysts' expectations but offered weaker-than-expected guidance. The telehealth company's revenue increased significantly compared to the previous year, and it reported a net income, with the company indicating that more collaborations are on the horizon. Despite the positive earnings report, the company's second-quarter revenue forecast fell short of analyst expectations.</p>

          <p>The Army has suspended helicopter training flights around the Pentagon after two commercial flights had to perform "go-arounds" at Reagan National Airport due to an Army helicopter's training mission. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the incident, with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy expressing frustration over the disregarded rules. Army officials dispute the FAA's characterization of the helicopter taking a 'scenic route'. The incident occurred less than a month after the FAA increased staffing and oversight for the DCA air traffic control team and permanently restricted "nonessential" helicopter operations around the airport.</p>

          <p>FanDuel Sports Network, formerly known as Bally Sports, has reported substantial growth in its streaming subscribers, doubling to nearly 650,000 in eight weeks and aiming for one million by year-end. This growth follows Main Street Sports Group's emergence from bankruptcy, where it significantly reduced debt and restructured agreements. The network's streaming platform is averaging 250,000 unique daily users, and partnerships with Amazon's Prime Video, SB Nation, and Yahoo Sports have contributed to subscriber acquisition. The success of FanDuel Sports Network is notable as regional sports networks face challenges from declining pay-TV subscribers.</p>

          <p>Palantir experienced a boost in its revenue guidance due to significant growth in both commercial and government sectors, fueled by the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence software.

The company's commercial revenues saw a substantial increase, and Karp attributed government sector growth to greater U.S. defense sector adoption of its tools.

          <p>The migrant tent camp at Guant√°namo Bay, established three months ago under President Trump's orders, has been partially dismantled after never fulfilling its intended purpose of housing 30,000 migrants. The operation housed only 32 migrants, and the decision to remove tents indicates a shift away from large-scale detention plans. Critics have called the operation a waste of taxpayer funds, and Senators have requested a review for potential fraud and waste. The military says it can still expand migrant operations if needed, but the dismantling suggests a change in strategy.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has announced it will restructure as a public benefit corporation, with the nonprofit that has controlled it retaining its grip on the company, following pressure from civic leaders and ex-employees. The decision addresses concerns that the company was becoming too focused on profits and abandoning its commitment to safe AI development. CEO Sam Altman emphasized that the nonprofit and the PBC will share the same mission, though the nonprofit's stake in the company is still being negotiated. The move comes amid a legal battle with Elon Musk, who has criticized OpenAI's for-profit direction.</p>
