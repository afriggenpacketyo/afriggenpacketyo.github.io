          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly negotiating to take equity stakes in several quantum computing firms, such as IonQ and Rigetti, in exchange for federal funding. This strategy mirrors recent government investments in other critical sectors like rare earths and semiconductors, reflecting a policy shift towards securing supply chains and technologies vital to U.S. national security. The move, aimed at countering technological competition from China, underscores the perceived importance of quantum computing for future economic and defense applications. The news has prompted a significant surge in the stock prices of the mentioned quantum companies. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a new report from analytics firm Cotality, rent growth for single-family homes in the U.S. has slowed to its lowest level in 15 years. Rents increased by only 1.4% year-over-year in August, a significant deceleration from previous months and the 3% average gain seen last year. This cooling trend is observed across all price tiers, though regional variations exist, with Chicago seeing the highest growth and Dallas experiencing a decline. The slowdown is mirrored in the multifamily apartment sector, where a construction boom has increased supply and pushed the national vacancy rate to a record high.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A majority of prospective homebuyers are waiting on the sidelines because they anticipate that mortgage rates will fall further, according to a new CNBC Housing Market Survey. Despite rates hovering at their lowest level in a year, nearly three-quarters of real estate agents report that their clients believe rates will continue to drop. This expectation, combined with ongoing affordability challenges, has created a market standoff where many sellers are still pricing their homes for a seller's market. Consequently, many buyers are only moving if necessary, often compromising on home features or seeking financial help from family to make a purchase.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A university professor and linguist argues that the widespread concern over students using AI for their assignments is largely misplaced. The author contends that lamenting a decline in traditional reading and writing habits ignores the reality that technology has always changed how people learn and work. Instead of banning AI, educators should adapt by creating assignments that AI cannot easily complete, such as those requiring personal reflection or in-class writing. The article suggests that AI can handle tedious tasks like mastering arbitrary grammar rules, freeing up students to focus more on critical thinking and developing their own ideas.</p>

          <p>Boeing has named Landon Loomis, a Mandarin-speaking former U.S. trade attaché and White House advisor, as the new president of Boeing China. The appointment comes as the American planemaker navigates renewed geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing, which have directly impacted its business. Loomis's extensive experience in China is expected to help stabilize the company's position in the crucial market, where it faces competition from Airbus and uncertainties related to trade disputes and export controls. The move underscores Boeing's efforts to manage its relationship with China, a country that has previously used aircraft orders as a point of leverage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial advisors are recommending that high-net-worth individuals increase their charitable giving before the end of 2025 to maximize tax benefits that are set to diminish in 2026. New provisions in a tax bill signed by President Trump will introduce a floor and a ceiling on deductions for top earners, reducing the overall tax advantage of their donations. For example, a new rule will only allow deductions for contributions exceeding 0.5% of adjusted gross income. To navigate these changes, advisors suggest "bunching" several years' worth of donations into the current year or utilizing donor-advised funds for immediate deductions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Swedish automaker Volvo Cars surged by as much as 41%, marking a potential best-ever trading day, after the company announced third-quarter profits that significantly beat analyst expectations. The strong performance was attributed to an ongoing cost-saving program and some one-off financial items, which helped its operating margin increase to 7.4%. CEO Håkan Samuelsson stated that the company is on track with its cost-saving measures and is ramping up sales of its battery electric vehicles. However, Volvo Cars cautioned that the short-term outlook remains challenging due to macroeconomic pressures and price competition.</p>

While the technology is still in its early stages and doesn't always work perfectly, it represents a fundamental shift in how users interact with the internet.

The team, co-owned by David Beckham, begins its playoff journey against Nashville SC in a best-of-three series. While Inter Miami secured the Supporters' Shield for the best regular-season record, the post-season playoffs are considered the ultimate prize in American soccer.

By swapping its dollar-denominated debt, Ethiopia could see its interest rate drop from around 7.25% to 3%.

          <p>This article explores the literary world of Philip Pullman, whose fantasy series "His Dark Materials" and "The Book of Dust" stand apart from contemporaries like Harry Potter with their idiosyncratic and intellectually challenging themes. Pullman's work is characterized by its engagement with real-world issues, its critique of organized religion, and its celebration of experience over innocence. The author argues that Pullman's magic is intentionally unsystematic and that his storytelling is deeply committed to the tangible, material world. The essay concludes that Pullman's ultimate project is not escapism, but rather an imaginative guide to navigating and loving our complex reality.</p>
