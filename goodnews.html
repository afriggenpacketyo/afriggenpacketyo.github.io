          <p>A young Philadelphia Phillies fan experienced a viral incident at a game when an adult woman took a home run ball, initially given to him by his father, from his possession. Following the dispute, the boy received a gift bag from the Miami Marlins staff and later met Phillies player Harrison Bader, who gave him an autographed bat. This heartwarming resolution highlighted the spirit of sportsmanship after an unfortunate display of adult behavior.</p>

At their recent conference, several hopefuls, including Westminster councillor Laila Cunningham and Lancashire County Council leader Stephen Atkinson, were thrust into the spotlight. The party aims to recruit 5,000 vetted candidates for upcoming elections, strengthening its infrastructure and moving towards a more rigorous selection process to avoid past scandals, as it eyes significant gains in local and national politics.</p>

          <p>Dr. Bex Bennett, a former soldier who experienced mortar fire in Iraq, co-founded "Sisters in Service" to provide support and recognition for female military veterans. The group, which includes 160 members, addresses the unique challenges women face after leaving the armed forces, often due to misconceptions about their combat roles. Many female veterans feel isolated and avoid traditional support spaces like Royal British Legion clubs, where their service may be presumed to be secondary. This article highlights the "cathartic" community Sisters in Service offers, enabling women to connect and discuss shared experiences.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukraine is extensively employing thousands of military decoys, including inflatable tanks and flat-pack plywood artillery, to mislead Russian forces and preserve valuable ammunition. These imitations, costing significantly less than the missiles used against them, are designed to replicate real equipment and positions, sometimes even fooling visiting officers. Volunteer groups play a crucial role in producing these decoys, which can also include radar-mimicking devices and thermal dummies. Russia also utilizes similar tactics, deploying cheap imitation drones to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses.</p>

          <p>London-born Carlo Acutis is set to become the first millennial saint in a ceremony presided over by Pope Leo XIV, following his fast-tracked canonization. Known as "God's influencer," Acutis created websites documenting miracles before his death from leukemia at age 15. His mother, Antonia Salzano, championed his sainthood, with two miracles attributed to him. The Vatican hopes his story, connecting modern technology with faith, will inspire young people. His baptismal church in London has seen increased visitors, highlighting his growing global recognition.</p>

          <p>A US government lab has achieved a "game-changing" breakthrough in fusion energy, successfully creating "burning plasma" through a self-contained feedback loop. The Los Alamos National Laboratory-led team utilized a new diagnostic device called "THOR" (Thinned Hohlraum Optimization for Radflow) to better observe how materials react to extreme plasma conditions. This achievement, building on previous ignition successes, is a significant step towards realizing nearly unlimited, clean energy without long-lasting nuclear waste or meltdown risks, contrasting with fission reactors. The article notes the information gathered also has implications for weapons development. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, an FBI most-wanted fugitive suspected of two 2003 bombings linked to animal rights extremism, faces extradition to the US after 21 years on the run. He was found last year in a remote Welsh cottage, having evaded authorities since a high-speed chase in California where a "bomb-making factory" was discovered in his abandoned car. Former FBI agents recall "missed opportunities" to arrest him earlier. San Diego is indicted for maliciously damaging property with explosives, and his capture underscores the FBI's long-term commitment to accountability.</p>
