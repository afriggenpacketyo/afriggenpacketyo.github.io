          <p>Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice will be a full participant in the team's training camp, according to head coach Andy Reid. This comes despite Rice facing a looming NFL suspension and a recent 30-day jail sentence for his involvement in a high-speed car crash in Dallas. While his legal matters are resolved, the NFL has yet to announce its own disciplinary action. The Chiefs are preparing as if he will be available for the season, though his regular-season participation remains uncertain pending the league's decision.</p>

          <p>Following deadly flash floods that killed over 130 people in central Texas, Governor Greg Abbott has called a special session of the state legislature. The session will focus on improving the state's emergency preparedness and response capabilities for future flooding events. Lawmakers are expected to discuss the implementation of advanced flood warning systems, enhancing emergency communications, and securing relief funding. This legislative action aims to prevent a recurrence of the recent tragedy by ensuring better natural disaster preparation and recovery strategies are in place.</p>

          <p>José Adolfo Macías Villamar, the infamous gang leader known as "Fito," has been extradited from Ecuador to the U.S., marking a historic first for the country. He faces federal charges in New York for international cocaine distribution, conspiracy, and weapons smuggling. Macías, who leads the violent "Los Choneros" gang, had previously escaped from a maximum-security prison before being recaptured. His extradition represents a significant step in the joint efforts between the U.S. and Ecuador to combat transnational organized crime and the extreme violence it fuels in the region.</p>

          <p>The British government has confirmed a national inquiry will be held into the violent 1984 clashes between police and miners at the Orgreave coking plant. The event, known as the "Battle of Orgreave," was one of the most contentious episodes of the year-long miners' strike, resulting in numerous injuries and 95 arrests. The inquiry, chaired by the Bishop of Sheffield, will examine the events of the day and the subsequent failed prosecutions, which were marred by allegations of falsified police evidence. Campaigners, who have sought this for over a decade, hope it will finally bring truth and justice to the affected mining communities.</p>

His appointment is seen as a key part of the WRU's long-term strategy to rebuild the team and return it to a competitive position on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Ryanair is contemplating an increase to the bonus it pays gate staff for identifying and charging passengers with oversized luggage. The budget airline's CEO, Michael O'Leary, stated that the incentive, currently around €1.50 per bag, is designed to enforce baggage rules and speed up boarding times. This practice has drawn attention as part of a broader industry trend to generate ancillary revenue, with passengers facing fees up to €75 for non-compliant bags. The discussion comes as the European Parliament considers standardizing free carry-on luggage allowances across airlines.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the water sector in England and Wales has concluded that systemic failures by government, companies, and regulators have led to the current crisis of sewage spills and rising bills. The report's primary recommendation is to scrap the economic regulator Ofwat and create a single, unified regulator for water in both England and Wales. It also calls for stricter oversight of company finances, an end to water companies "marking their own homework" on pollution monitoring, and acknowledges that bills may need to rise to fund necessary infrastructure investment.</p>

          <p>Housing advocates are pushing for a simple legislative fix to help ease the housing crisis by removing five words from a 1974 law. The regulation requires all manufactured homes to be built on a "permanent chassis," a steel frame that adds cost, limits design flexibility, and creates a pretext for exclusionary zoning. Eliminating this mandate could make these homes more attractive and affordable, potentially scaling up production significantly. After decades of languishing in Congress, the proposal is gaining new traction amid the worsening housing shortage, with a Senate committee expected to consider it soon.</p>

The commission will aim to build a national consensus on how to boost private pension savings and tackle significant wealth gaps.
