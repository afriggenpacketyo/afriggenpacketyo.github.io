        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, dealing a significant blow to his economic policies. The Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country, citing the US Constitution's exclusive powers to Congress to regulate commerce. The Trump administration has lodged an appeal, but if unsuccessful, businesses who paid tariffs may receive refunds with interest. The ruling is seen as a potential shift from strongman tariffs to institutional guardrails, offering a fresh dose of macro stability. (not investment advice)</p>

Wu Xinbo of Fudan University believes that while Trump might continue using tariffs, he is likely to show more restraint due to the side effects on the US. These alternative measures could relate to science, diplomacy, and security, as Trump seeks new ways to exert pressure.</p>
