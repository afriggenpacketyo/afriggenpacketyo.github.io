          <p>Gisele Pelicot, who became a symbol for women's rights in France, has been awarded the nation's highest civilian honor, the Legion of Honor. She gained international recognition for publicly testifying against her ex-husband, who drugged her and allowed dozens of men to sexually assault her over a decade. Her courageous testimony during a public trial led to the conviction of her ex-husband and 50 co-defendants, shocking the nation. The case has been a catalyst for legal reform, contributing to the French Senate passing a bill to include lack of consent in the legal definition of sexual assault.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's economy successfully averted a technical recession by posting a 1.4% quarter-over-quarter growth in the second quarter of 2025, reversing a contraction from the previous quarter. The expansion was primarily driven by a strong performance in the manufacturing sector, which grew 5.5% year-over-year. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry maintains a cautious outlook, citing significant global uncertainty, particularly regarding U.S. tariff policies. This economic data precedes an upcoming monetary policy decision, with recent low inflation figures potentially supporting another rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Bank of England Governor Signals Readiness for Rate Cuts Amid Slowing Job Market</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 22:16:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has indicated a readiness to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK job market continues to show signs of slowing. In an interview, Bailey stated he believes the path for interest rates, currently at 4.25%, is downward, citing signs that businesses are adjusting employment and offering smaller pay raises. This follows Chancellor Rachel Reeves's increase in employers' national insurance contributions. The governor's comments come as the UK economy shows signs of contraction, adding pressure on the government to stimulate growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels selected UC Santa Barbara pitcher Tyler Bremner with the second overall pick in the MLB draft, addressing their significant need for pitching talent. Bremner, a right-hander with a strong fastball and changeup, has had an emotional year, having lost his mother to cancer in June. He spoke of his mother's support and how he channeled his grief into his on-field performance, which impressed the Angels' scouting team. The selection aligns with the Angels' strategy of drafting college players who can be fast-tracked to the major leagues to help the team win in the short term.</p>

          <p>Australia is enhancing its strategic partnership with the Philippines, notably through civil maritime cooperation programs, while simultaneously managing its crucial trade relationship with China. The initiatives include donating patrol boats, offering scholarships, and providing operational training, with Australia planning to double its investment in these areas to A$11.5 million by 2029. Analysts note that this deepening of ties is motivated by shared strategic interests as the two nations approach 80 years of diplomatic relations.

This marks a significant shift from two decades ago, when international trade and urban planning were popular, reflecting the country's economic evolution.

          <p>Banyan Group founder Kwon Ping Ho, a 30-year veteran of the luxury hotel industry, observes that modern tourists have vastly different expectations than previous generations. He notes that today's younger, more seasoned travelers are jaded with standard tours and are seeking deeper, more authentic experiences that involve interaction with local communities. This contrasts with older generations who were often content with group tours and staying within their hotel. Ho also highlights the rise of 'rainbow tourism,' with a more diverse, global mix of travelers from developing nations exploring destinations worldwide.</p>

Since July 14, 1795, observers have manually recorded temperature and air pressure, creating an invaluable dataset for climate science. This unbroken tradition, maintained by hand, predates modern meteorology and has captured significant weather events, from major storms to the first observations of noctilucent clouds. The institution also credits observer Theresa Hardcastle, who ensured the record's continuity after her husband's death in 1917.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte following an announcement of a plan to sell weapons to European allies, which can then be transferred to Ukraine. This strategy aims to expedite military aid by moving equipment from closer allied countries, such as Germany, rather than directly from U.S. factories. The meeting comes as the Trump administration hints at sending more defensive weapons, including Patriot missiles, to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. The discussions also coincide with bipartisan support in the Senate for legislation that would impose heavy sanctions on Russia's economy.</p>
