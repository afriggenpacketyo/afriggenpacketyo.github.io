          <p>Following MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred's announcement that those on baseball's ineligible list would be removed upon death, Pete Rose's daughter, Fawn, shared her emotional reaction to her father's potential Hall of Fame eligibility. The announcement came just before Cincinnati Reds hosted Pete Rose Night, celebrating the late baseball legend. Fawn praised the commissioner for his kindness and understanding during discussions about her father, highlighting the overwhelming love and gratitude from Cincinnati fans. Rose, who admitted to gambling, had been banned from baseball, making him ineligible for Hall of Fame consideration until now. </p>

          <p>China Vanke, a debt-laden property developer, has secured a 1.55 billion yuan (US$215.4 million) loan from its largest shareholder, state-owned Shenzhen Metro Group, to help meet its debt obligations. The loan, with a 36-month term and a low interest rate, aims to cover interest and principal repayments. This financial support follows a government-led shake-up in February, where authorities tightened control over Vanke by appointing new executives. Despite this assistance, Fitch Ratings recently downgraded Vanke's bonds further into junk territory, reflecting ongoing concerns in the financial markets. </p>

          <p>Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown academic, has been released from immigration detention after a federal judge ruled his detention violated his right to free speech and due process. Suri, an Indian national, was arrested on March 17 by immigration agents, accused of "spreading Hamas propaganda" and having "connections to a known or suspected terrorist." The judge refuted the government's claims, stating there was no evidence of Suri supporting Hamas. While the Trump administration is still seeking to deport Suri, his release comes amid concerns about the targeting of students and academics for their support of Palestinian rights. </p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after spending over three decades behind bars for the 1989 killings of their parents. The brothers claimed they acted in self-defense after years of alleged abuse. The case will now go to the California Board of Parole Hearings before a final decision by the governor's office. The resentencing has been described as a monumental decision with significant implications, with relatives expressing hope for their release and the district attorney reiterating opposition. </p>

          <h2>UK to Permit Limited Foreign State Ownership in Newspapers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 21:24:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government will now allow foreign states to own up to 15% of British newspapers and news magazines, reversing a previous ban prompted by a takeover bid involving the Abu Dhabi ruling family. This change enables State Owned Investors (SOIs) like sovereign wealth funds to invest in UK news organizations. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy argues the move balances media plurality with the need for publishers to secure funding. The threshold was set to ensure safeguarding of media from foreign state control while recognizing the financial needs of news organizations. </p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has endorsed two bills aimed at streamlining housing development in urban areas, emphasizing the need to cut red tape and address the state's housing crisis. Newsom's revised budget proposal includes provisions to reform the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and remove other impediments to construction. He praised Assemblymember Buffy Wicks and state Sen. Scott Wiener for sponsoring bills designed to ease the permitting process for infill projects. The proposals aim to accelerate urban infill and exempt qualifying projects from CEQA requirements. </p>

          <p>Amidst controversy over his plan to accept a luxury jet from the Qatari government, President Trump announced a lucrative deal for Boeing to supply Qatar with 210 planes. The $96 billion contract, touted as the largest-ever order of widebody Boeing planes, is expected to support 154,000 American jobs. Trump has defended accepting the Qatari jet, complaining about the outdated condition of the current Air Force One. The president continues to defend his decision, citing the benefits to American taxpayers. </p>
