          <p>Onosato has been promoted to yokozuna, sumo's highest rank, after only 13 professional tournaments, setting a new record. The 24-year-old from Ishikawa Prefecture is the 75th yokozuna and the first Japanese-born grand champion since his stablemaster Nishonoseki in 2017. Onosato secured his promotion by winning the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament, meeting the requirement of consecutive championships as an ozeki. He joins Wajima as the only wrestler to become a grand champion after entering the professional ranks from university. He is set to compete head-to-head with Mongolian yokozuna Hoshoryu at July's Nagoya meet.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in Nature suggests that fat cells may have a 'metabolic memory' of obesity, influencing metabolic pathways even after weight loss, potentially leading to easier weight regain. Researchers analyzed chemical markers on fat cells in mice and humans, finding that those with a history of obesity continued to exhibit unhealthy metabolic changes even after losing weight. While biology plays a role, the study emphasizes that genetics, environment, psychology, and social factors also shape obesity. Experts recommend maintaining healthy habits such as physical activity, a balanced diet, and strength training to counteract the genetic predispositions promoting weight gain.</p>

Slotkin suggests that the party needs to address economic concerns and provide a clear vision for the future, as well as project a stronger leadership image. She criticizes the party's focus on numerous priorities and its tendency to present policies in an academic manner, which alienates voters. Slotkin emphasizes the importance of economic security for social change and advocates for policies that address the concerns of average Americans.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The word 'pride' has transformed from a vice to a symbol of LGBTQ+ empowerment, dating back to before the 12th century when it meant 'inordinate self-esteem.' In the 14th century, it began to refer to 'a reasonable form of self-respect,' and in the 1960s, it became associated with the LGBTQ+ community, influenced by the civil rights movement. Following the Stonewall Uprising in 1969, organizers chose 'pride' as a rallying cry to reject negativity and embrace self-esteem. While debates about the word's use continue, it remains a powerful symbol, especially in the face of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation and backlash against inclusivity.</p>

Energy companies will pay out more than ¬£70m in compensation and financial support to customers who were switched to prepayment methods without their agreement. Ofgem's review found that suppliers fell short of required standards in treating vulnerable customers, leading to the suspension of forced installations. While a new code of practice is now in place, Citizens Advice is urging the sector to quickly disburse compensation to those worst affected by the scandal.</p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan has backed a report by the London Drugs Commission advocating for the decriminalisation of possessing small quantities of cannabis for personal use. The report recommends removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act and calls for reforms in education, healthcare, and policing. Lord Falconer, who chaired the commission, argued that the current law is disproportionate and contributes to racial disparities in stop and search practices. While the Metropolitan Police Commissioner acknowledged that any change to the law is a matter for parliament, critics argue that decriminalisation would send the wrong message about the harms of cannabis.</p>
