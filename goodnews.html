          <p>Nineteen states and Washington D.C. have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the layoffs of Health and Human Services (HHS) staffers. The states argue that these job cuts, impacting agencies like the CDC and FDA, undermine HHS's ability to perform its duties, such as worker safety and Head Start programs. The lawsuit also criticizes HHS leader Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s views on vaccines. An HHS spokesperson defended the changes as designed to strengthen the agency's capacity to serve the public.</p>

          <p>Former Governor Andrew Cuomo is under scrutiny for potentially violating New York City campaign finance rules by using his campaign website to coordinate with the super PAC 'Fix the City' supporting his mayoral bid. This involves 'red-boxing,' where candidates post strategic information publicly for super PACs to use, bypassing direct communication restrictions. The New York City Campaign Finance Board warned campaigns about the new rules targeting red-boxing, and Cuomo could face penalties if found in violation. A lawyer for Cuomo denies any wrongdoing, stating there is no evidence the super PAC acted on the information.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at incentivizing drug manufacturing in the U.S. by streamlining the FDA inspection process for new domestic production sites. The order also increases inspections of foreign drug facilities, switching to surprise visits.
