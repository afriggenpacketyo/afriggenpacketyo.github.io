          <p>England defeated West Indies by 238 runs in the first one-day international at Edgbaston, marking a strong start to Harry Brook's captaincy. England posted 400-8, their highest ODI total in three years, with significant contributions from Brook, Ben Duckett, Joe Root, and Jacob Bethell. Saqib Mahmood's impressive bowling performance, taking 3-32, dismantled the West Indies top order, leading to their dismissal for 162 in 26.2 overs. This victory ends England's seven-match losing streak in ODIs and boosts their confidence after a challenging 18 months in white-ball cricket; the series can be sealed with a win in Cardiff. The spectacle was lacking but England was desperate for any sort of victory after a wretched 18 months in white-ball cricket, and the team needed this win. </p>

          <p>A Harvard graduate student, Fangzhou Jiang, described the atmosphere on campus as "devastating" due to the Trump administration's efforts to restrict international students. A federal judge temporarily blocked the administration's attempts to prevent Harvard from enrolling international students, providing a temporary victory for the university. Tensions further escalated when Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced officials would begin to "aggressively revoke" the visas of some Chinese students. Jiang emphasized the crucial role international students play on campus, and remains optimistic that online learning options could provide a solution if necessary, as the school has committed to protecting international students in whatever capacity.</p>

The Fed confirmed the meeting occurred, emphasizing that the future path of monetary policy was not discussed. Powell stressed that policy decisions would depend entirely on incoming economic information and would be based on "careful, objective, and non-political analysis." Markets largely expect the Fed to maintain its current stance on rates until there is greater clarity on tariff uncertainty, though futures market pricing indicates a potential rate cut in September.

Justice Kavanaugh wrote that NEPA has been used to hinder infrastructure development and needs to be curtailed.

DHS will now give Harvard 30 days to prove it meets the requirements of the Student and Exchange Visitor Programme (SEVP). The legal battle centers on whether the government's reasons for targeting Harvard's participation in the student visa program are legitimate or a pretext for punishing the university for constitutionally protected speech.</p>

          <p>Amazon and The New York Times have announced a multi-year deal to bring the newspaper's content to Amazon's products and services, including Alexa. The agreement includes real-time summaries and excerpts of Times content, as well as training Amazon's proprietary foundation models. This partnership follows the Times' lawsuit against Microsoft and OpenAI for copyright infringement, marking a trend of news outlets striking licensing deals with tech companies rather than pursuing litigation. Amazon has been launching generative AI products to compete with OpenAI and Google.</p>
