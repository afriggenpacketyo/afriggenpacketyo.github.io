          <p>Warren Buffett, Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, clarified to CNBC that he is not in the market to acquire another railroad, despite a recent meeting with CSX CEO Joseph Hinrichs. The discussion centered on fostering greater cooperation to improve freight rail efficiency, aiming to achieve benefits similar to a merger without an actual acquisition. This announcement comes after intense market speculation that Berkshire Hathaway might enter the fray following Union Pacific's proposed $85 billion bid for Norfolk Southern. Consequently, shares for CSX, Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern, and Berkshire Hathaway all experienced declines, reflecting the market's sensitivity to potential industry consolidation and major investment decisions.

          <p>Los Angeles city officials announced the arrest of several alleged South L.A. gang members, dubbed the "Rich Rollin' Burglary Crew," linked to nearly 100 home and business break-ins, primarily on the city's Westside since 2022. The group allegedly targeted high-end jewelry, purses, and guns, selling the stolen goods for cash in what the District Attorney described as "crimes of greed." The investigation advanced significantly after three suspects were arrested following a vehicle pursuit in February, leading to a search warrant that uncovered weapons and stolen items. Mayor Karen Bass praised the operation as a major win for public safety, though these incidents are not connected to recent Encino crime waves.</p>

          <p>Tyrone Huntley, an accomplished actor who recently commanded the stage as Simon in the Hollywood Bowl's "Jesus Christ Superstar," was seen days later fulfilling his day job as an usher at the very same iconic venue. This compelling situation highlights the harsh economic realities confronting many working actors in Los Angeles, where a significant decline in film and TV production often necessitates taking on service jobs for survival. Huntley, a U.K.-trained performer with a decorated career and Olivier Award nomination, moved to L.A. for screen opportunities but found an industry grappling with slowdowns. His ability to balance acclaimed performances with practical employment underscores the resilience and determination required of artists in the entertainment capital.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball will introduce a Relief Pitcher of the Year award for each league starting in 2026, marking a significant recognition for a role that has dramatically evolved in modern baseball. Established by the Baseball Writers’ Association of America, this new honor addresses the historical underrepresentation of relief pitchers in major awards like MVP and Cy Young, despite their increasing importance in today's game. The decision reflects a growing acknowledgment of the specialized skill and crucial impact of bullpen pitchers, who now often dominate high-leverage situations and contribute significantly to team success. This move aims to celebrate these essential players beyond the often-criticized "save" statistic, providing them with deserved individual recognition.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Cameron Norrie secured his spot in the second round of the US Open after his opponent, Sebastian Korda, was forced to retire from their match due to an injury. Norrie was leading 7-5, 6-4 when Korda, who had only recently returned to tour action following a nearly three-month lay-off from a shin stress fracture, elected to end the match early, seemingly struggling with an abdominal issue. Norrie expressed his sympathy for Korda, recognizing his talent and previous victories against him. Despite admitting to pre-match nerves over the early start time, Norrie advanced to face either Argentine Francisco Comesana or American Alex Michelsen in the next round.</p>

          <p>Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, co-founder of the powerful Sinaloa cartel, pleaded guilty to federal racketeering and criminal enterprise charges in New York, ending a notorious career in organized crime. Zambada, 77, expressed remorse for the harm caused by illegal drugs in the U.S. and Mexico, taking responsibility for his actions. His plea comes after his arrest in Texas, which he claimed was a kidnapping orchestrated by El Chapo’s sons. This development follows a U.S. decision not to seek the death penalty and occurs amidst the Trump administration's increased pressure on Mexico to combat cartels.</p>

          <p>SpaceX is preparing for the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket, aiming to validate corrective upgrades after three prior catastrophic failures this year. A successful launch is crucial to rebuild confidence in the massive rocket, especially given concerns that its moon lander variant may not be ready for NASA's planned 2027 landing. The flight plan includes testing the Super Heavy first stage with deliberate engine shutdowns for splashdown and sending the Starship upper stage on a sub-orbital trajectory to the Indian Ocean, with various in-space tests. While SpaceX has a strong track record with Falcon rockets, the Starship presents unprecedented challenges for lunar missions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has confirmed its first human case of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite, in a Maryland patient returning from El Salvador, a country experiencing an outbreak. While the risk to public health in the U.S. is deemed very low, the northward spread of this parasite poses a significant threat to the country's livestock industry. The CDC and Maryland Department of Health confirmed the diagnosis, with the individual having since recovered. Federal authorities are implementing measures, including building a sterile fly production facility in Texas, to combat the screwworm, which was successfully eradicated in the U.S. in 1966 using the sterile insect technique.</p>

          <p>A seemingly minor detail on a boarding pass, the "sequence number" (SEQ), can significantly impact whether a passenger makes their flight or is involuntarily bumped. This number indicates the check-in order, which airlines often use as a criterion for denying seats on overbooked flights, alongside factors like fare paid or frequent flyer status. Passengers who check in late are at higher risk of being left behind, as highlighted by social media accounts of travelers denied boarding. To mitigate this, the U.S. Department of Transportation advises checking in as early as possible, typically 24 hours before departure, to secure a better sequence position.</p>

The separation also allows the cold beverage business to better focus on faster-growing segments like energy drinks.

          <p>With Americans facing record credit card debt and high interest rates, many struggle to make payments due to unexpected financial hurdles. Some lenders offer temporary relief, such as payment pauses, which can be a lifeline for borrowers needing a short break. Eligibility for these hardship programs typically requires a temporary financial issue like job loss or medical emergencies, and early contact with the issuer improves approval chances. If a payment pause is denied, alternatives include debt management programs, balance transfer cards, debt forgiveness negotiations, or personal loans. Understanding these options is crucial for managing unmanageable debt. (not investment advice)</p>

Thompson's proposed act aims to mandate transparency by requiring job posts to include details like intended hire dates and whether roles are new or backfills.

          <p>New data reveals that great white sharks are increasingly frequenting the cooler waters off New England and Canada's Atlantic coast, resulting in a rise in sightings in regions like Maine, where their presence was once quite uncommon. Scientists largely attribute this northward shift to an increased availability of seals, which constitute the sharks' primary food source in these ecosystems. Despite the growing presence of these apex predators, experts consistently emphasize that fatal shark bites remain exceedingly rare, with Maine having confirmed only two unprovoked attacks since 1837. This evolving trend necessitates that boaters, beachgoers, and fishermen adapt to coexisting with white sharks, prompting ongoing monitoring efforts.</p>
