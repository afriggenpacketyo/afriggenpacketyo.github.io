          <p>A potential transfer of Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford to Barcelona has advanced, with an agreement in principle reportedly reached for an initial loan with an option to buy. Rashford has been seeking a new challenge and has been training separately from the main squad under United's new head coach. For Manchester United, the move would provide significant salary relief, aiding their efforts to fund new signings. Barcelona's sporting director has previously expressed admiration for Rashford, who himself has spoken positively about the prospect of playing for the Spanish club.</p>

          <p>According to a regulatory filing, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sold an additional 75,000 shares of the company's stock, valued at approximately $12.94 million. This sale is part of a pre-arranged trading plan established in March, which allows Huang to sell up to 6 million shares.

          <p>The British and Irish Lions defeated the Wallabies 27-19 in a physically demanding first Test match, with flankers Tadhg Beirne and Tom Curry delivering standout performances. Curry, in particular, responded to recent criticism with a dominant display of aggressive and relentless play, setting the tone early with a powerful tackle and contributing a try. Despite a late-game drop in discipline that allowed Australia to narrow the score, the Lions' initial intensity was enough to secure the crucial win. The victory gives the Lions a 1-0 lead in the series ahead of the next match in Melbourne.</p>

          <p>Dutch cyclist Thymen Arensman secured his first-ever Tour de France stage victory on a difficult mountain stage, delivering a win for the Ineos Grenadiers team. Meanwhile, the race saw a major development as pre-race favorite Remco Evenepoel, who was third overall, was forced to abandon the Tour due to his struggles on the climbs. Overall leader Tadej Pogačar extended his lead slightly over Jonas Vingegaard by finishing second on the stage. The departure of Evenepoel significantly reshapes the competition for the final podium positions in Paris.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from a left knee bone bruise faster than initially anticipated. Muncy, who was injured in a slide on July 2, has already begun running, playing catch, and taking swings, reporting that his knee feels great. While the original timeline suggested a six-week absence, manager Dave Roberts is now optimistic about a much sooner return. Muncy's recovery is crucial for the Dodgers, whose offense has struggled significantly since their slugging infielder was placed on the injured list.</p>

          <p>Twenty-eight years after the event, Great Britain's men's 4x400m relay team from the 1997 World Championships have finally been presented with their gold medals. The ceremony took place at the London Diamond League meeting in front of a large home crowd. The team was upgraded from silver after the original winners, the United States, were disqualified due to a 2008 doping confession from team member Antonio Pettigrew. The belated recognition honored athletes Roger Black, Iwan Thomas, Jamie Baulch, Mark Richardson, and Mark Hylton for their performance in Athens.</p>

          <p>The recent week in financial markets saw positive momentum, driven by a combination of strong corporate earnings and signs of moderating inflation. The June Consumer Price Index met expectations, though persistently high shelter costs remain a concern for the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, wholesale inflation, measured by the Producer Price Index, came in slightly below forecasts, suggesting price pressures may be easing. While the impact of tariffs is still being monitored, the overall economic data supports the market's belief that the Fed will likely hold interest rates steady in the near term.

          <p>Bestselling author and entrepreneur Scott Galloway criticizes the common career advice to "follow your passion," labeling it as something only already-rich people can afford to say. He argues that a more effective strategy for success is to find the intersection of what you are good at and what can be profitable. Galloway shares his own journey, where he abandoned his passion for athletics to pursue business, ultimately finding success through his skills in entrepreneurship. The article suggests that enduring rejection and being open to pivoting are more crucial to building a successful career than blindly following a passion.</p>
