        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's Supreme Court has revised its earlier directive to relocate all stray dogs in Delhi to shelters, following widespread protests from animal welfare groups. The new ruling mandates that non-aggressive strays should be vaccinated and sterilized before being released back to their original sites, while only rabid or aggressive dogs will be kept in shelters. The court also prohibited feeding stray dogs in public areas, ordering the creation of dedicated feeding zones. This decision, welcomed by animal welfare advocates as balanced and compassionate, aims to address the estimated one million stray dogs in Delhi and the country's high rate of rabies-related deaths, while also planning a national policy on the issue.</p>

          <p>Washington state celebrated the grand opening of its first In-N-Out Burger in Ridgefield, drawing hundreds of eager customers who queued overnight and for hours. The popular California-based chain opened two hours early to accommodate the massive turnout, with one customer driving 126 miles and waiting since Tuesday evening to be the first in line. The new restaurant, managed by a 26-year In-N-Out veteran, features a drive-thru, indoor seating for 73, and outdoor seating for 28. Billionaire owner Lynsi Snyder, who cut the ribbon, recently sparked controversy by announcing her departure from California, though the company clarified its expansion eastward is separate from her personal move.</p>

          <p>A rare case of the plague in a South Lake Tahoe resident has prompted experts to explain the modern-day risks of this ancient disease, reassuring the public that it is largely under control. Caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, the plague primarily affects small animals and is typically transmitted to humans through infected flea bites or contact with infected rodents, often in rural areas. While the disease, which caused massive deaths in the Middle Ages, remains serious, it is treatable with antibiotics if caught in a timely manner. Experts emphasize that, unlike smallpox, the plague cannot be eradicated due to its presence in mammalian populations spread by vectors like fleas, but medical advancements have significantly mitigated its threat.</p>

          <p>The musical "Shucked," now on its North American tour at the Hollywood Pantages, is praised as a hilarious and wholesome, yet flamboyantly odd, country-themed farcical riot. The story, set in corn-dependent Cob County, follows Maizy's quest to save her town's shriveling corn crop by seeking an outside "corn doctor" in Tampa, leading to a series of comedic misunderstandings and puns. Directed by Jack O’Brien, the production is lauded for its precise direction, bucolic cartoon set design, and contemporary costumes. The sunshiny score, a blend of country, blues, and Broadway pop, features a range of gorgeous voices, contributing to the show's ability to shamelessly win over audiences with its intoxicating silliness and warmth.</p>

          <p>David Baron's book, "The Martians," delves into the widespread early 20th-century belief in intelligent life on Mars, a phenomenon fueled by respected scientists and sensational journalism alike. The article highlights how figures like Percival Lowell, Camille Flammarion, and Giovanni Schiaparelli contributed to "Mars fever," often projecting human desires onto the red planet and misinterpreting observations like "canali" as engineered canals. Baron's deeply researched and witty narrative focuses on the social currents and major personalities, rather than complex scientific concepts, to explain why people chose to believe. Ultimately, the book acknowledges that while many conclusions about Martian life proved incorrect, this imaginative fascination inspired generations, including Carl Sagan, to consider space exploration a real possibility.</p>

          <h2>Book Review: R.F. Kuang's 'Katabasis' Offers a Fresh Take on the Journey into Hell</h2>

          <p>R.F. Kuang's latest novel, "Katabasis," reimagines the classic journey into the underworld as a dark academia fantasy, surprising the reviewer with its fresh perspective despite the well-trodden trope. The story follows protagonist Alice Law, a psychologically complex student, who descends into hell with her partner to retrieve the soul of a mentor, a decision driven by academic ambition rather than love or knowledge. The article praises Kuang's intellectual prowess, which enriches the narrative with deep subject knowledge, akin to her previous work "Babel." While acknowledging the novel's demanding literary references, the reviewer finds "Katabasis" to be a more mature and subtly humorous work, exploring themes of delusion and self-destruction within an Oxbridge academic setting.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles labor groups are advocating for a "New Deal" from the city and the LA28 Olympics organizing committee, demanding significant commitments ahead of the upcoming mega-sporting events. Their demands include multibillion-dollar investments for 50,000 housing units, a ban on short-term rentals like Airbnb, increased transparency in venue agreements, and protections for immigrant workers and visitors from federal raids. Unions argue that past world sporting events have often failed to benefit host cities, leading to displacement and debt. While LA28 organizers claim the Games will bring good-paying jobs and economic impact, unions stress the need for concrete actions to address L.A.'s housing crisis and ensure lasting benefits for working people.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to dismantle electric vehicle incentives and promote fossil fuels, the EV market's global momentum and Ford's recent $5 billion investment in a new, affordable EV platform suggest a resilient future for electric cars. Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" aims to end federal EV tax credits, and sales have seen a recent slowdown in the US. However, Ford plans to deliver a $30,000 four-door pickup by 2027, targeting a mass market and global demand for cheaper vehicles. This move, focusing on affordability and export potential, highlights that while the US EV transition faces hurdles, the worldwide shift towards electric vehicles, driven by cost-effectiveness and environmental regulations elsewhere, continues to accelerate.

          <p>China's electricity consumption surged to a historic high of 1.02 trillion kilowatt-hours (kWh) in July, surpassing the 1 trillion mark for the first time, according to the National Energy Administration. This record demand, equivalent to the annual usage of all Asean nations combined, was driven by scorching heatwaves across the country. The primary industry, encompassing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries, saw the fastest growth in electricity use, increasing by 20.2% year-on-year. This surge in power usage coincided with a 5.7% year-on-year growth in industrial output for July, although this figure was slightly slower than June's growth and below forecasts.</p>

          <p>Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has indicated that its newly released V3.1 large language model will be supported by China's "next generation" homegrown AI chips, specifically mentioning the "UE8M0 FP8" precision format tailored for these upcoming domestic processors. This announcement signals DeepSeek's intention to collaborate more closely with China's emerging AI chip ecosystem, driven by Washington's advanced semiconductor export restrictions and Beijing's push for self-sufficiency. The news follows reports that Beijing urged Chinese AI developers to favor domestic alternatives to Nvidia's GPUs, even as local chipmakers like Huawei make progress despite lagging behind Nvidia. DeepSeek's earlier R1 reasoning model demonstrated capabilities comparable to Western competitors, despite US export controls, showcasing China's advancements in AI development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US real estate market is showing initial signs of improvement after a period of slowdown, with sales of existing homes rising 2% in July, according to the National Association of Realtors. While overall sales remain lower than pre-pandemic levels, a significant positive is the highest inventory of homes for sale since 2020, offering buyers more options and negotiation leverage. Additionally, prices are softening in many markets, with some declines in the South and West, and nationwide price increases at their slowest pace in two years. Mortgage rates have also slightly decreased, reaching their lowest since October 2024, which could encourage more buyers and ease the "lock-in effect" that has kept homeowners from moving.
