          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, announced a substantial reduction in the number of individuals listed as missing following severe floods earlier this month. Through extensive follow-up by state and local agencies, the count dropped from nearly 100 to just three. Many people initially reported as unaccounted for have since been confirmed safe. While this marks a positive development in the recovery effort, the overall death toll from the statewide flooding remains high at 134, with Kerr County being the most affected region.</p>

          <p>England's rugby team achieved a decisive six-try victory over the US Eagles in a match held in Washington D.C. The game was significantly affected by challenging weather, including high humidity and two separate lightning delays that prolonged the event. Despite the interruptions, the English team, composed of mostly younger professionals, demonstrated superior precision and control throughout the contest. The final score was 38-5, with the US scoring a consolation try at the end of the match.</p>

          <p>Following the deadly attack in Southport last year, UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new criminal offense targeting individuals who are preparing for mass killings but lack a specific ideological motive. This new legislation aims to close a legal gap, allowing police to intervene and charge suspects for preparatory acts, such as researching a target, in a manner similar to existing anti-terrorism laws. The goal is to give law enforcement the tools to prevent attacks from violence-obsessed individuals who do not fit the traditional definition of a terrorist.</p>

          <p>During a concert in San Francisco, pop star Katy Perry encountered a technical issue with a large mechanical butterfly prop she was riding midair. The prop suddenly dropped several feet, startling the singer, but she quickly recovered and completed her performance of the song "Roar" without further incident. After the song, she addressed the moment with the phrase, "Not today, Satan," indicating her relief. Perry was unharmed, and the incident adds to a list of similar technical malfunctions experienced by artists using complex aerial stage equipment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway in the UK regarding the structure of the school year, with some proposing to shorten the traditional six-week summer holiday and redistribute the time off throughout the year. Proponents argue this could help prevent learning loss, ease childcare burdens for working parents, and potentially lower holiday costs by spreading out demand. However, the idea is less popular with teachers, who value the long break for rest and preparation. The discussion reflects a broader re-evaluation of traditional schedules in light of modern family and economic pressures.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is advocating for a shift in public perception, encouraging savers to move money from low-interest cash accounts into stocks and shares investments. The government plans to launch a new campaign and have banks send targeted messages to promote investment opportunities, arguing that the benefits have been overshadowed by risk warnings. This initiative is part of a broader effort to make the UK a nation of investors, though it has sparked debate over potentially cutting tax-free allowances on cash ISAs to incentivize the change.

          <p>A new wave of modern, members-only clubs is gaining popularity in India, providing an alternative to the traditional, colonial-era gymkhanas. Chains like Soho House are expanding to cater to the country's growing class of young, self-made entrepreneurs and creative professionals who may not fit into the old, legacy-based establishments. These new clubs offer a more relaxed atmosphere focused on networking, community, and personal accomplishment rather than family pedigree. This trend reflects the significant economic and demographic shifts occurring in India's rapidly expanding economy.</p>

          <p>A recent season of the Iowa Public Radio podcast "Unsettled" delves into the gender gap in contemporary American society, examining its effects on politics, education, and social norms. The series was inspired by the growing gender divide in voting patterns among young people, particularly after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. It also explores why boys are falling behind academically and how social media and the "manosphere" are influencing young men's perspectives. The podcast aims to understand the roots of these divides and what masculinity means in 2025.</p>
