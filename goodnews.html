          <p>Nvidia's stock experienced a surge in after-hours trading after the company announced quarterly revenue and earnings that surpassed expectations, along with optimistic projections for the upcoming second quarter, despite limitations on sales to China. CEO Jensen Huang highlighted advancements in reasoning AI, the rescinding of AI diffusion rules, the development of enterprise AI agents, and industrial AI as key drivers of increased demand. The company is increasing its price target to $170 from $165, maintaining a hold-equivalent rating due to the stock's rapid rise. Blackwell superchip production is ramping up well, and sovereign AI is emerging as a new growth engine. (not investment advice)</p>
