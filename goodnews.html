          <p>Colombian winger Luis Diaz has officially transferred from Liverpool to the German champions, Bayern Munich, in a deal valued at £65.5 million. The 28-year-old signed a four-year contract, ending his successful tenure at Anfield where he won four major trophies, including the Premier League. In a farewell message, Diaz stated he was leaving with a sense of "duty fulfilled" and that his departure would have been a "perfect goodbye" if not for the recent tragic death of a teammate. During his time at Liverpool, he was a key offensive player, scoring 41 goals in 148 appearances.</p>

          <p>Following days of deadly border clashes, Thailand and Cambodia have reaffirmed their commitment to a ceasefire after participating in a China-brokered meeting in Shanghai. The initial truce had been tested by accusations of new attacks, but both nations reiterated their dedication to de-escalating the situation. The conflict, which has killed at least 41 people and displaced over 260,000, prompted diplomatic intervention from China, the U.S., and Malaysia. With the situation now calmer, some displaced residents have begun returning to their homes near the border.</p>

          <p>Google has announced its intention to sign the European Union's voluntary code of practice on artificial intelligence, a move that Meta recently refused. While Google expressed hope that signing would promote access to new AI tools in Europe, it also voiced concerns that the EU AI Act and its associated guidelines could slow down technological development and harm the region's competitiveness. Meta had previously criticized the code as an overreach that would stifle innovation, highlighting a significant split among Big Tech companies on how to approach AI regulation.</p>

          <p>Manchester United defender Luke Shaw has voiced his support for new head coach Ruben Amorim's demanding methods, aimed at fixing what he described as a "toxic" and "unhealthy" culture at the club. Shaw stated that for much of his time at United, the environment has been "extremely negative." He believes Amorim's insistence on 100% effort and holding all players to the same high standard, regardless of status, is exactly what the team needs. Shaw emphasized that senior players must also take responsibility for driving up standards in training and daily activities.</p>

          <p>South Korea's LG Energy Solution has announced a massive $4.3 billion contract to supply batteries to a major, yet undisclosed, corporation. The deal, which runs until the end of July 2030, is one of the company's largest to date for lithium iron phosphate batteries. While the customer's name is being kept confidential, reports suggest it is the electric vehicle maker Tesla. This agreement comes as LG Energy Solution expands its manufacturing presence in the U.S., with new plants in Michigan and Arizona set to bolster its production capabilities.</p>

          <p>Australia's headline inflation rate dropped to 2.1% year-over-year in the second quarter, its lowest level since March 2021 and below economists' expectations. This places inflation near the lower end of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) 2%-3% target range. The slowdown was driven by a fall in transport costs, which offset rises in housing and food prices. This weaker-than-expected inflation data strengthens the case for the RBA to implement another interest rate cut to support the nation's sluggish economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

In areas like Crescent City, which has a history of tsunamis, the alert was met with a practiced and largely unfazed response from locals. In Southern California, where smaller waves were predicted, some beachgoers were surprised by the news but not overly concerned. The event prompted officials to issue warnings to stay away from beaches and harbors, but the general atmosphere remained subdued without widespread panic.</p>

          <p>Chinese paleontologists have discovered 436-million-year-old fossils of brachiopods, or "lamp shells," that suggest the ancient creatures practiced a form of social distancing. The fossils, found in a checkerboard-like pattern, indicate that the invertebrates used hundreds of thin, bristle-like structures called setae to maintain a regular spacing from one another on the sea floor. Researchers believe this behavior was likely a strategy to ensure each individual had adequate space for filter feeding, thereby improving the population's overall chances of survival. The findings were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
