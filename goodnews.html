          <p>Nicholas Burns, former U.S. ambassador to China, stated that Washington and Beijing are on a "creeping path" toward a trade deal, citing strong economic self-interest for both nations. Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, Burns offered rare praise for President Trump's tariff strategy, arguing it provides leverage in negotiations. He highlighted the symbiotic economic relationship, with thousands of American companies in China and the U.S. being its largest export market, suggesting logic will guide both sides to an agreement amid an ongoing 90-day trade truce.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that a group of House Republicans who had initially blocked several cryptocurrency regulation bills have agreed to support the legislation after a meeting at the White House. The bills, including the GENIUS Act which regulates stablecoins, had failed a key procedural vote earlier in the day when 13 Republicans voted with Democrats. Trump's intervention and subsequent post on Truth Social underscore his support for the legislation and his influence over the Republican conference. The reversal is expected to allow the bills to advance for a final vote. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National League secured a 4-3 victory over the American League in the MLB All-Star Game, which was decided by a home run swing-off for the first time in its history. The game ended in a 6-6 tie after the AL erased a six-run deficit, triggering the new tiebreaker format. Kyle Schwarber of the NL was named MVP after hitting three home runs in the swing-off, leading his team to only its second win in the last twelve All-Star contests. The event also featured the use of a robot umpire system for challenges.</p>

          <p>According to market research firm Rho Motion, global sales of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles increased by 24% in June compared to the previous year, reaching 1.8 million units. This growth was primarily driven by strong demand in China, which accounted for 60% of the total, and a 23% rise in Europe. In contrast, North American sales experienced a 9% decline, positioning the U.S. as a laggard in the market. For the first half of 2025, global EV sales are up 28%, demonstrating a continued worldwide shift toward electric mobility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced the withdrawal of 2,000 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, half of the total number deployed last month to manage protests related to federal immigration raids. The Trump administration had federalized the troops, bypassing California Governor Gavin Newsom, who sued over the deployment. Governor Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass criticized the deployment as political theater and called for all remaining troops to be sent home immediately. The withdrawal is seen by local officials as a result of sustained public and legal pressure against the federal action.</p>

This move follows the advancement of the "SCORE Act" by a House subcommittee, which aims to create a federal framework for student-athlete compensation, superseding varied state laws. The NIL rules, enacted in 2021, have dramatically changed college athletics by allowing athletes to profit from endorsements and other activities.
