          <p>Alternative asset manager Ares Management has raised its three-year fundraising targets by 25%, attributing the increase to strong momentum from individual wealthy investors. CEO Michael Arougheti noted a significant shift, with retail investors expected to drive more than half of private market flows in the coming years. The firm, which already manages over $50 billion from retail-focused vehicles, is expanding its dedicated teams to service this growing client base. Arougheti pushed back against concerns that retail investors receive weaker deals, stating that investments are allocated based on available capital across both institutional and wealth platforms.

Despite the positive quarterly results, the company reiterated its previously lowered full-year guidance, citing a challenging macroeconomic environment that has dampened consumer demand. The company noted that its operating margin fell partly due to aluminum tariffs and continues to see concern among consumers about the socioeconomic climate. The reiterated forecast projects a 4% to 6% decline in organic net sales for the fiscal year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Canadian minerals explorer Trilogy Metals skyrocketed in premarket trading after the White House announced it would take a 10% stake in the company. The U.S. government's $35.6 million investment is part of a strategic initiative to develop domestic supply chains for critical minerals like copper and cobalt from the Ambler mining district in Alaska. The move reverses a previous administration's rejection of the Ambler Road project, signaling a renewed federal focus on responsible resource development to counter China's dominance in the critical minerals market. The project remains controversial among environmental groups. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Laura Modi, co-founder and CEO of the infant formula startup Bobbie, is challenging the long-standing market dominance of industry giants Abbott and Reckitt. Inspired by her own difficult experiences as a new mother, Modi launched Bobbie in 2018 as a direct-to-consumer, subscription-based company focused on high-quality, organic products. The company has since expanded into major retailers and gained significant market share, particularly after a 2022 nationwide formula shortage highlighted the risks of the concentrated market. Bobbie's strategy combines product innovation with mission-driven marketing, such as advocating for paid family leave.</p>

          <p>The Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret, and John M. Martinis for their foundational research into quantum tunneling. Their work, conducted in the 1980s, has become a cornerstone for the development of next-generation quantum technologies, including quantum computing, cryptography, and sensors. The Nobel committee highlighted how their discoveries are advancing digital technology by taking principles from the subatomic world and applying them on a larger, more practical scale. The laureates' research is considered fundamental to the continued evolution of powerful computing and secure communications.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners seeking financing, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become a more affordable option due to recent declines in interest rates. A hypothetical $75,000 HELOC with a 10-year term now costs approximately $906 per month, down from over $965 in the summer of 2024. Because HELOCs have variable rates, they are positioned to become even cheaper if the Federal Reserve continues its expected rate cuts later this year. This product allows borrowers to benefit from falling rates without needing to refinance, making it a timely option for accessing home equity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The use of artificial intelligence for planning and booking holidays is on the rise, according to a survey by the travel association ABTA. The report found that 8% of travelers now use AI, double the figure from last year, with younger demographics being the most frequent users. Despite this growth, AI still trails far behind traditional methods like general internet searches, recommendations from friends and family, and guidebooks. The travel industry views this trend as both an opportunity and a challenge, as less than a fifth of respondents currently feel comfortable handing over full control of their holiday booking to AI.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle maker Rivian is preparing to launch its next-generation vehicles, the smaller R2 SUV and R3 hatchback, as it aims to reach a broader market. The R2 is expected to start around $45,000 and will initially be produced at the company's Illinois facility before scaling up at a new $5 billion plant in Georgia. Chief Design Officer Jeff Hammoud explains that designing these more affordable models required a "subtraction" approach, removing features while retaining the brand's adventurous ethos. The article explores Rivian's design philosophy, including the origin of its controversial but now iconic "stadium" headlights.</p>

          <p>Michaela Del Barrio, a 37-year-old mother with a family history of breast cancer, received an early-stage diagnosis after persistently requesting early screening options from her doctors. Although an initial mammogram was clear, a subsequent breast MRI, recommended by a high-risk clinic, detected two suspicious masses that were confirmed to be cancerous. Her case highlights the importance of self-advocacy and understanding personal risk factors, as breast cancer is rising in women under 50. Because the cancer was caught early, her prognosis is excellent, and her oncologist credits her proactive approach with preventing a much worse outcome.</p>

          <p>A new study in Uganda has found that treating baby wraps with insecticide can significantly reduce malaria infections in young children. Inspired by the U.S. military's practice of treating uniforms, researchers provided mothers with permethrin-soaked wraps for carrying their babies. The trial showed a remarkable 65% reduction in malaria cases among children using the treated wraps compared to a control group. This simple, low-cost intervention could provide crucial protection for children when they are not under a bed net, offering a promising new tool in the fight against a disease that kills a child under five nearly every minute.</p>

However, the report reveals a divided picture, with developing nations like China and India driving the clean energy expansion, while the US and EU saw an increased reliance on fossil fuels.
