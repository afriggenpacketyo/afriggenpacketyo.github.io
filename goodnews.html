        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index declined by 0.59% after the Bank of Japan (BOJ) maintained its policy rate at 0.5%, a decision that aligned with economists' expectations. This move followed a significant drop in Japan's core inflation rate to 2.7% in August, marking its lowest point since November 2024 and a third consecutive month of decline. An investment director noted the BOJ's cautious stance, prioritizing stability amidst slowing inflation and global uncertainty, and aiming to preserve policy optionality for future economic responses. The article suggests this strategy supports the early stages of a reflationary cycle, rather than a reversal, as yields on Japan's 2-year government bonds rose to a 17-year high.

          <p>The Republic of Ireland has committed to new legislation ensuring full cooperation with a reformed UK legacy body addressing Northern Ireland Troubles cases. This agreement, part of a "new framework" between the British and Irish governments, aims to heal a rift caused by the widely opposed UK Legacy and Reconciliation Act. The deal includes renaming the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) to the Legacy Commission, establishing a new oversight board, and creating an Irish police legacy unit. A €25m support fund for victims is also part of the plan, reflecting a renewed, albeit "imperfect," opportunity to address the complex and sensitive legacy issues of the conflict.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced progress on a TikTok deal and a potential extension of the trade truce with China, ahead of an anticipated phone call with President Xi Jinping. Trump stated the US is nearing a deal that would involve a "tremendous fee-plus" and ensure the US version of TikTok is owned by "all American investors" and legitimate companies that "love America." He also mentioned the possibility of extending the current trade truce under favorable terms, aiming for a "very different deal" than in the past. This engagement marks the first direct contact between the leaders since June, following Trump's earlier claims of reaching a "very good trade deal" with China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) maintained its policy rate at 0.5% by a 7-2 majority vote, as Japan's core inflation rate dropped to 2.7% in August, the lowest since November 2024. This marks a third consecutive month of decline, aligning with economist expectations. Analysts suggest the BOJ's cautious approach prioritizes stability over premature tightening amidst global uncertainty, supporting a reflationary cycle. Despite growing calls for rate hikes due to headline inflation remaining above the 2% target for over three years, some economists argue high headline inflation is largely distorted by supply constraints and external factors like a weak yen, with key domestic demand metrics still below target. The yen is expected to strengthen as interest rate gaps narrow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a crucial 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants, largely due to their bullpen managing to hold a precarious lead. Starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto pitched 5⅓ scoreless innings but struggled with efficiency and walks, handing the game to the Dodgers' recently inconsistent relievers. Despite some shaky moments in the seventh inning, including multiple walks, the bullpen executed key pitches when it mattered most, with Jack Dreyer, Blake Treinen, Anthony Banda, and Alex Vesia closing out the game. This hard-fought win extends the Dodgers’ National League West division lead to three games, offering a much-needed confidence boost for the relief corps as potential reinforcements like Roki Sasaki are on the way.</p>

Export-dependent economies like South Korea and Singapore, which narrowly avoided recession, are poised for further rate cuts in the fourth quarter.
