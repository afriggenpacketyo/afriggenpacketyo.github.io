          <p>Harvard University and the University of Toronto have established a program allowing certain international graduate students to study in Canada if they are barred from the U.S. due to visa restrictions. This plan addresses uncertainty stemming from the U.S. government's recent actions against Harvard's ability to enroll international students, which included requests for extensive student records. The contingency, for students who have completed one year at Harvard's Kennedy School, will only be activated if there is sufficient demand from those unable to enter the United States.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced plans to scrap 201 National Health Service (NHS) organizations in England as part of a new 10-year health strategy. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the move aims to simplify a complex system, focusing resources on "more doers and fewer checkers." Among the bodies to be abolished are Healthwatch England, an advocate for patients, and the National Guardian's Office, which supports whistleblowers. The strategy also includes a trial to link hospital funding to patient satisfaction ratings.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHL implemented a new, decentralized draft format where teams made selections from their home cities, a departure from the traditional single-venue event. The semi-remote setup, held at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles, was marked by technical issues like audio failures and awkward virtual interactions between players and team management. Some general managers, like the Kings' Ken Holland, expressed a preference for the old system's atmosphere, though top pick Matthew Schaefer said the experience was still an honor. The event saw the Ducks select Roger McQueen and the Kings pick Henry Brzustewicz.</p>

          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has announced the completion of the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through blood vessels. This minimally invasive technique, which avoids open-skull surgery like that used by Elon Musk's Neuralink, reportedly helped a paralyzed patient regain some limb movement. The procedure involves inserting a stent electrode into the brain's vasculature via a neck vein, a method that is claimed to reduce surgical risks and shorten recovery times for patients.</p>

          <p>A new study from the Japan Institute for Health Security has found a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals who consume a traditional Japanese-style diet. The diet, which includes rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables, was associated with better mental health outcomes in a survey of nearly 12,500 employees. Researchers suggest that nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids from fish and folic acid from vegetables may contribute to these benefits by assisting in the release of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine.</p>

The May 16 escape, where inmates exploited a faulty cell door, has drawn heavy criticism of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's management of the facility.
