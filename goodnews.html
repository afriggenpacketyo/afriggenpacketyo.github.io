          <p>An executive coach and author outlines five practical strategies for employees dealing with controlling or micromanaging bosses. The techniques are designed to conserve energy and reduce frustration while satisfying a manager's need for oversight. Recommendations include submitting rough drafts for early input, reinforcing the boss's authority with specific phrasing, and proactively oversharing information to prevent future scrutiny. The article also suggests getting ahead of criticism by asking for initial thoughts and using the "yes, and..." technique to validate feedback while still asserting one's own perspective.</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S.-listed companies involved in the rare earth minerals supply chain experienced a rally as the Trump administration signals stronger industrial policy to combat China's market control. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced plans to set a price floor for these critical minerals, which are essential for technology and defense applications. This follows a Defense Department deal with MP Materials, the largest U.S. rare earth miner, to secure domestic supply. Investors are now anticipating that the administration will provide similar backing to other domestic miners to bolster the national supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In his first year as Indonesia's president, former general Prabowo Subianto has engaged in extensive international diplomacy, seeking a prominent role on the global stage. He has been a vocal proponent of peace in the Middle East, backing a U.S.-led plan for Gaza and offering Indonesian troops for a potential stabilization force. On the economic front, his administration successfully concluded a long-negotiated trade partnership with the European Union to boost investment and growth. However, some analysts critique his approach as overly personal and reactive, describing it as "FOMO diplomacy" that sometimes lacks coordinated follow-up from government ministries.</p>

          <p>China's Communist Party is convening to chart its next five-year economic plan amid significant structural challenges, including sluggish domestic consumption and geopolitical pressures from the U.S. Analysts expect the plan to prioritize industrial policy and investment in high-tech sectors like semiconductors to achieve technological sovereignty and resilience against U.S. restrictions. While Beijing has taken some steps to stimulate consumer spending, the primary focus remains on strengthening manufacturing and hard power. This strategy reflects a difficult balancing act between fostering domestic demand and competing in the global high-tech arena. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant health debate is underway regarding the coverage of GLP-1 medications like Ozempic for obesity under Medicaid, which currently serves an estimated 14 million adults with the condition. These drugs have proven highly effective for weight loss and treating related diseases, but their high cost presents a major budgetary challenge for states. Proponents argue that the long-term healthcare savings from reduced obesity-related illnesses would offset the initial expense, and that failing to provide coverage exacerbates health inequalities. They also note that prices are expected to fall as more competitors enter the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For homeowners with substantial equity, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) present an affordable borrowing option in the current high-rate environment. As of mid-October 2025, average rates for home equity loans range from 8.15% to 8.30%, while the average HELOC rate is 7.84%, significantly lower than personal loan or credit card rates. The article explains the key differences between the two products, with fixed-rate loans providing a lump sum and variable-rate HELOCs offering a revolving line of credit. It also notes potential tax benefits if the funds are used for eligible home improvements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite the U.S. government shutdown, the 74 million Americans receiving Social Security and SSI benefits will continue to get their monthly payments on schedule. This is because the program is funded through mandatory spending, which does not require annual congressional approval. However, the Social Security Administration's operational budget is affected, which could lead to disruptions in customer service. Services such as benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and the issuance of replacement Medicare cards may be halted or delayed until funding is restored and furloughed employees return to work.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates, which have recently fallen into the low-to-mid 6% range, are expected to remain relatively stable or decline slightly by the end of 2025. Experts predict that key economic indicators, particularly inflation and labor market data, will be the primary drivers of rate movements. Forecasts from the Mortgage Bankers Association and Fannie Mae project average 30-year rates to end the year around 6.4% to 6.5%. A more significant drop below 6% is considered possible only if inflation continues to cool and the job market shows further signs of weakening, prompting more aggressive rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.

          <p>According to Columbia University business psychologist Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, mastering specific social skills is more crucial for career advancement than simply "being yourself." He identifies three core abilities that enhance emotional intelligence and employability: being receptive to feedback, cultivating social awareness, and adaptability. The article suggests actively soliciting constructive criticism, focusing more on understanding others' perspectives than on oneself, and stepping outside one's comfort zone to develop new skills. These practices help close the gap between self-perception and reality, making individuals more effective and rewarding to work with.</p>

          <p>Despite facing significant challenges including tariffs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions, the U.S. automotive industry has shown surprising resilience in 2025. Initial bearish forecasts have been tempered by better-than-expected sales and production figures, though concerns about consumer demand and a potential "K-shaped" economic recovery persist. While major automakers have absorbed billions in tariff-related costs, they are also navigating the complex transition to electric vehicles and managing supply chain fragilities. The sector's outlook remains cautiously optimistic as it balances these numerous pressures. (not investment advice)</p>
