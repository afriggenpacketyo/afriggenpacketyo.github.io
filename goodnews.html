          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, debate has emerged over whether the record $7.6 trillion held in high-yield money market funds will flow into riskier assets like stocks. While some analysts predict a shift as savings rates become less attractive, others argue the vast majority of this "wall of cash" will remain, particularly institutional funds that prioritize stability. Experts suggest that only a significant drop in rates, potentially to near-zero levels, would trigger a substantial outflow from these funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article revisits the 1985 congressional hearing that led to the creation of "Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics" labels on music albums. The debate pitted musicians like Dee Snider of Twisted Sister and Frank Zappa against the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), co-founded by Tipper Gore. While the PMRC argued for "truth in packaging" to help parents, artists decried it as a form of censorship, though some later claimed the "Tipper sticker" actually boosted their sales.</p>

          <p>Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, co-founders of the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, have reiterated their bullish outlook on Bitcoin, predicting its value could reach $1 million per coin within the next ten years. They argue that Bitcoin is still in its early stages and functions as "gold 2.0," suggesting it has significant room for growth as it continues to disrupt traditional assets. The comments were made as their company, Gemini Space Station, prepared for its initial public offering, valuing the firm at a reported $3.3 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A South African court has denied an application by Thabo Bester and his partner to block the release of a Netflix documentary about his crimes. Bester, known for luring victims on Facebook, was convicted of sexual assault and murder but escaped from prison in 2022 by faking his own death in a fire. The judge ruled that the pair failed to prove the documentary would violate their right to a fair trial, as the case is already a matter of significant public record.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' offense, which led the majors in the first half of the season, has experienced a significant downturn, ranking near the bottom of the league in scoring since early July. The slump is attributed to a combination of injuries to key players and a team-wide shift toward individual swing mechanics rather than situational hitting. As the playoffs approach, the team is now refocusing on fundamentals like advancing runners and executing in key moments, hoping to regain its dominant form.</p>
