          <p>Amazon has announced a major expansion of its same-day grocery delivery service, making it available in 1,000 new cities and towns across the United States. The service, which is free for Prime members on orders over $25, will now include thousands of perishable items like produce, meat, and dairy. This strategic move intensifies competition with rivals like Instacart and Walmart+ by offering a one-stop shop for a wide array of goods. The company plans to extend the service to an additional 2,300 locations by the end of 2025.</p>

          <p>Walmart, the largest private employer in the U.S., is expanding its employee discount program to help its workforce cope with rising living costs. The company announced that its 1.6 million U.S. employees will now receive a 10% discount on nearly all grocery items year-round, a benefit previously limited to produce and seasonal periods. This move comes as concerns over inflation are renewed due to tariffs, and it serves a dual purpose of supporting employees and encouraging them to shop at Walmart, potentially boosting retention and sales.</p>

          <p>A recent report from Intercontinental Exchange reveals that approximately 48 million American mortgage holders have accessible home equity, with an average of $213,000 available per homeowner. This record level of tappable equity, totaling $11.6 trillion nationwide, provides a significant financial resource that can be accessed through products like home equity loans and HELOCs. The article explains that homeowners can calculate their available equity by subtracting their mortgage balance from their home's current market value, though lenders typically cap borrowing at around 80% of the total equity.

          <p>Matt Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services, advises that critical thinking, creativity, and adaptability will be the most vital skills for success in the age of artificial intelligence, rather than highly technical expertise. He emphasized that as AI handles more routine tasks, the ability to generate new ideas, make nuanced judgments, and learn new things will become paramount for human workers. Garman noted that he gave this advice to his own college-bound teenager, highlighting that these soft skills are where humans will continue to hold a significant advantage over AI systems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining over 1%, while megacap technology stocks saw a pullback. This market rotation is being driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in September. Lower rates are particularly beneficial for smaller companies, as they reduce borrowing costs and can stimulate consumer spending. The rally puts the Russell 2000 on track for its best week since May, reflecting a broader shift in market sentiment toward rate-sensitive sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Port of Los Angeles processed a record-breaking number of containers in July, a direct consequence of shippers front-loading cargo to get ahead of tariff deadlines. The port handled over one million twenty-foot equivalent units, an all-time high in its 117-year history, as companies rushed to import goods from China before new duties took effect. This surge, which created a premature and intense peak season, particularly involved retail goods, furniture, and seasonal items. However, analysts note that the subsequent trade slowdown indicates the significant impact of tariffs on importer behavior. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Residents in northern Colorado have reported sightings of wild rabbits with black, horn-like growths on their faces, dubbing them "Frankenstein rabbits." Wildlife officials have identified the cause as Shope papilloma virus (SPV), a common virus in cottontail rabbits that is spread by biting insects like fleas and ticks. The virus, which poses no risk to humans or other animals, causes wartlike tumors that are usually harmless unless they interfere with the rabbit's ability to eat. Officials advise the public not to interact with the infected animals but state that intervention is generally not necessary.</p>

          <p>A recently passed federal budget bill has significantly increased the flexibility of 529 college savings plans, expanding the definition of qualified educational expenses. In addition to traditional higher education costs, funds from these tax-advantaged accounts can now be used for vocational programs, required continuing education courses, and costs related to professional licensing exams. This expansion aims to make 529 plans more versatile for various career paths, addressing a common concern among parents that the funds might go unused if a child does not pursue a traditional college degree.

          <p>Advocacy group The Senior Citizens League is estimating that Social Security beneficiaries could receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026. This projection, based on the latest inflation data, would be a slight increase from the 2.5% boost recipients saw in 2025. The annual adjustment is designed to ensure that benefits keep pace with inflation, and the official figure will be announced by the Social Security Administration in October. Some economists express concern that this moderate increase may not be sufficient if inflation rates rise later in the year as predicted. (not investment advice)</p>

This move is part of Poland's broader military modernization effort aimed at countering threats from Russia and increasing its role within NATO.

          <p>A new analysis of an Incan khipu, a knotted cord device used for record-keeping, suggests the practice may have been more widespread than previously thought. Researchers discovered that the primary cord of one khipu was made of human hair, and a dietary analysis of the hair indicated its creator was likely a commoner, not a member of the ruling class. This finding challenges the long-held assumption that only elites produced these complex records. It suggests a continuity between ancient Incan practices and more modern khipus made by lower-status individuals like herders and laborers.</p>
