          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 16:28:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a significant rally over the past year, gold prices may face a period of stagnation in August, according to market analysis. Key factors influencing this forecast include the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates on hold until September, which removes a major catalyst for price movement. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding the next inflation report and evolving demand for portfolio diversification could lead to muted activity in the gold market. While the precious metal has seen its price increase by approximately 40% over the last year, experts suggest that short-term volatility is likely, advising investors to focus on long-term strategies rather than immediate price fluctuations.

          <p>An Ohio couple has given birth to a healthy baby boy from an embryo that was frozen for more than 30 years, a new record for the longest-stored embryo to result in a live birth. The embryo was donated in 1994 by another woman who had undergone IVF treatment and chose to make her remaining embryos available for adoption. This event highlights the growing practice of embryo adoption and raises complex ethical questions about the long-term storage and status of an estimated 1.5 million frozen embryos in the United States. The birth brings joy to the new parents and the donor, who expressed hope to one day meet the child.</p>

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma surged over 5% on Friday, building on its spectacular market debut the previous day. The company's stock, trading under the ticker FIG, opened at $85 and closed at $115.50 on Thursday, a 250% increase from its IPO price of $33 per share. Figma is the latest in a series of tech companies to go public, signaling a potential revival of the IPO market after a prolonged quiet period. The successful launch comes after a proposed $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was abandoned in 2023 due to regulatory opposition in the U.K., forcing Figma to pursue a standalone public offering.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 16:04:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study conducted by researchers at Oxford University has found that a species of common European songbird sometimes engages in a form of "divorce." The research indicates that these birds, which typically form monogamous pairs, may separate from their partners between breeding seasons. This behavior challenges common assumptions about lifelong pair-bonding in certain avian species. The study provides new insights into the complex social dynamics and mating strategies of birds, suggesting that factors such as breeding success and individual fitness can influence the stability of their partnerships over time. The findings contribute to a broader understanding of animal behavior and evolution.</p>

          <p>Indian fast bowler Prasidh Krishna revealed that a heated on-field exchange with England's Joe Root during the fifth Test was a deliberate tactic to disrupt the star batter. The confrontation occurred early in Root's innings and saw an uncharacteristically animated response from him. Krishna, who took four wickets in the innings, described the incident as a competitive moment between two players striving for an edge, clarifying that they are on good terms off the field. The tense moment was one of several in a series marked by high emotions, with India currently holding an advantage heading into the third day of the match at The Oval.</p>

          <p>The National Football League is expected to take an equity stake in ESPN as part of a major new deal with parent company Walt Disney Co. In exchange for the ownership share, ESPN will likely take operational control of the NFL's media properties, including the NFL Network and the popular Red Zone channel. This strategic partnership aims to bolster ESPN's position as it navigates the transition to streaming and declining cable subscriptions. The deal would give the NFL a financial interest in one of its largest broadcast partners, significantly altering the landscape for future media rights negotiations with other networks like Fox, NBC, and CBS.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to revive the Presidential Fitness Test, a standardized set of physical exercises for schoolchildren that was phased out in 2013. The test, which included drills like the one-mile run and push-ups, was a fixture in American P.E. classes for over 50 years. The administration argues its return is necessary to combat rising rates of obesity and inactivity, which it calls a threat to national vitality. While some educators welcome the renewed focus on physical fitness, others express caution, recalling the test's history of causing student anxiety and questioning its effectiveness at promoting lifelong healthy habits over competitive performance.</p>

While Detroit became the heart of mass production, Pewabic championed individual craftsmanship, a philosophy it maintains today as a nonprofit organization.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Just two days after a visit from President Trump, a vocal critic of wind energy, the Scottish Government has approved the development of the world's largest offshore windfarm. Trump had spent much of his five-day trip to Scotland decrying windmills, claiming they were ruining the country's scenery. The new windfarm is projected to generate enough electricity to power every household in Scotland twice over, marking a significant step in the country's commitment to renewable energy. The timing of the announcement has been viewed by many as a pointed and humorous rebuttal to the former U.S. president's stance on climate change and green technology.</p>
