          <p>President Trump stated he will not remove tariffs on China to encourage negotiations, asserting that China's economy is suffering significantly due to the tariffs. He suggested that while he may eventually lower them, he wants to ensure China doesn't continue to benefit economically at the expense of the U.S. Trump also declined to rule out making some tariffs permanent, predicting substantial new investments in the U.S. He highlighted investments from companies like Apple, Toyota, and General Motors as evidence of the tariffs' success. The article also notes Trump's ambiguous stance on a potential short-term recession, while promising an unprecedented economic boom.</p>

          <p>Active management is experiencing a resurgence in the stock market, challenging the long-standing dominance of index funds.

A record number of ETFs have launched this year, with active ETFs rivaling index ETFs in number, and capturing a significant portion of investor flows. Experts emphasize the importance of investors identifying funds with unique approaches and avoiding overreaction to short-term market swings, while also advising that the most important strategy is to remain invested.

          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX launch site in South Texas has been formally organized as the city of Starbase, following a vote approved by local residents, most of whom are SpaceX employees. Musk celebrated the decision, which allows SpaceX to expand its control over the area and streamline launch operations. Critics express concerns about Musk's increased authority, including the potential to close a popular beach and state park for launches. Companion bills are being considered in the state Legislature to shift authority over these matters from the county to the new city's government.</p>
