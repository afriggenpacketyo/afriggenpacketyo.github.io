          <p>The remains of U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Willis R. Hall, who was killed during an attack on a remote mountain outpost in Laos in 1968, have been officially identified. Hall was one of eleven servicemen whose bodies could not be recovered after their unit was overrun by Vietnamese commandos. After decades of recovery efforts, which included using dummies to trace body trajectories down the mountain, joint U.S.-Laos teams found remains earlier this year. Advanced DNA and anthropological analysis confirmed the identity, bringing long-awaited closure to his family, who will bury him in Kansas.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a new trade deal with the Philippines following a meeting with President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. According to a post on Truth Social, the agreement establishes a 19% tariff on products imported from the Philippines, while the Philippines will eliminate all tariffs on U.S. goods. The deal, which also includes military cooperation, was reached ahead of the Trump administration's August 1 deadline for countries to secure trade agreements or face higher tariffs. The Philippine government has not yet formally confirmed the details of the agreement.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola has announced plans to introduce a version of its classic cola in the U.S. sweetened with cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup. The move follows a social media post by President Trump claiming he had encouraged the company to make the switch. While Coke already sells a cane sugar version from Mexico, this new product will use U.S.-produced sugar and is intended to expand consumer choice. The announcement came as the company reported strong second-quarter earnings, highlighting its efforts to innovate and adapt to changing consumer preferences.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo is set to introduce a new prebiotic soda this fall, aiming to attract health-conscious consumers with a beverage that offers functional ingredients. The new cola, which follows the company's recent acquisition of the prebiotic brand Poppi, will contain prebiotic fiber, five grams of cane sugar, and have only 30 calories per serving. This move reflects a broader industry trend toward gut-healthy alternatives and Pepsi's strategy to boost sales by offering healthier choices. The prebiotic soda market is experiencing significant growth as consumer preferences shift away from traditional sugary drinks.</p>

          <p>President Trump continued his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell but appeared to walk back previous suggestions that he might try to fire him. In comments to reporters, Trump called Powell's performance "a bad job" but noted, "he's going to be out pretty soon anyway," referencing the end of Powell's term in May 2026. The president has repeatedly accused Powell of being too slow to lower interest rates and of acting for political reasons. This exchange adds to ongoing speculation about Powell's job security under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 2017, the percentage of working Americans with a side hustle has decreased, according to a new Bankrate survey. The report shows 27% of Americans have a second income stream, down from 36% in 2024. Analysts attribute this drop to a solid job market and several years of wage growth outpacing inflation, which has reduced economic anxiety for some. This shift contrasts with the post-pandemic peak, when many relied on side gigs to cover basic living expenses amid record-high inflation, suggesting a move toward greater financial stability.</p>
