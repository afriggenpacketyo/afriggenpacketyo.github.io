          <p>Mining giant Anglo American has agreed to a 'merger of equals' with Canada's Teck Resources, a move that will create one of the world's five largest copper producers, to be named Anglo Teck.

Under the terms of the deal, Anglo American shareholders will own 62.4% of the new entity, which will be headquartered in Canada and listed on four major global exchanges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The long-running succession dispute within Rupert Murdoch's media empire has concluded with an agreement that cements his son Lachlan's control over Fox News and News Corp. The deal restructures the family trust, effectively buying out siblings Prudence, Elisabeth, and James, who will receive approximately $1.1 billion each and cease to have influence over the companies' conservative editorial direction. This resolution ends all litigation over the trust and ensures that Lachlan will lead the conglomerate without potential interference from his more politically moderate siblings after Rupert Murdoch's death.</p>

          <p>China is pushing to finalize and sign an upgraded free-trade agreement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) by the end of the year. This 'Cafta 3.0' protocol, for which negotiations concluded in May, aims to expand market access and deepen cooperation in key areas like the green and digital economies. The initiative is part of Beijing's strategy to strengthen economic ties with its largest trading partner and diversify its exports as it navigates shifting global supply chains and rising protectionism, particularly from the United States.</p>

          <p>For the first time, NHS trusts in England have been publicly ranked in new league tables, with specialist institutions like Moorfields Eye Hospital securing the top positions. The rankings evaluate trusts on seven key metrics, including waiting times, cancer treatment, A&E performance, and financial management. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the tables are intended to increase transparency and public choice, though some trusts have raised concerns about the metrics used. High-performing trusts will gain more autonomy, while underperforming ones will receive enhanced support to improve standards.</p>
