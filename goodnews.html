          <p>A couple volunteering at Vindolanda, a Roman fort near Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland, England, discovered a sandstone carving of Victoria, the Roman goddess of victory. The artifact was found in rubble near former infantry barracks, built in 213 A.D. during a tumultuous time. Experts believe the stone was once part of a larger, brightly painted work, symbolizing the end of war and establishment of the fort. The piece will be displayed at the Vindolanda museum next year. </p>

          <p>Thomas Mann, a Nobel laureate and literary figure, is remembered 150 years after his birth as a voice for democracy and a conscience for Germany following Nazi rule. Mann gained global recognition for novels like "Buddenbrooks" and "The Magic Mountain," but also wrote political essays and radio speeches criticizing the Nazi regime. He lived in exile after 1933, eventually emigrating to the U.S. before returning to Europe. Mann's literature and his opposition to fascism serve as a lasting example of courage and integrity. </p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell advised Princeton graduates to "guard" their integrity, amid ongoing criticism from former U.S. President Donald Trump. Speaking to the Class of 2025, Powell emphasized the importance of doing what is right and maintaining honor. Trump has pressured Powell to lower interest rates, but Powell has maintained a wait-and-see approach, focusing on economic data and the Fed's mandate to provide maximum employment and stable prices. Powell affirmed that Trump's demands have no impact on the Federal Open Market Committee's decisions. </p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce ¬£15 billion in funding for transport projects across the Midlands, North, and West Country in England. The investment will focus on tram, train, and bus projects in mayoral authorities, marking a shift from the Treasury's Green Book rules, which have been criticized for favoring London and the South-East. The funding aims to address regional disparities and boost growth in areas facing electoral challenges. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander hailed the announcement as a "watershed moment" for improving transport, while opposition parties raised concerns about the feasibility and impact of the plans. </p>

          <p>Tesla experienced a rebound in Australia during May, with electric vehicle sales reaching their highest level in nearly 12 months, driven by strong demand for the Model Y. While U.S. and European sales have declined, Australian sales jumped to 3,897 vehicles, primarily due to a 122.5% year-over-year increase in Model Y sales. Despite this surge, Tesla's total sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared to the previous year.
