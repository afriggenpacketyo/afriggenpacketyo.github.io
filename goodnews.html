          <h2>Dorian Gray Adaptation Explores Identity in the Social Media Age</h2>

          <p>Sarah Snook stars in a one-actor adaptation of Oscar Wilde's *The Picture of Dorian Gray* on Broadway, playing all 26 roles with the aid of wigs and elaborate camerawork. The article discusses how the play uses social media tropes to critique the modern obsession with maintaining an idealized aesthetic and the dangers of performing a persona for others, which can erode one's interior life. In contrast, *Vanya*, another play featuring a single actor, suggests that there is richness to be found in seeing oneself as the embodiment of multiple intertwining voices. The adaptation prompts viewers to consider when putting on a performance is a perversion of the truth and when it is a way of becoming more freely oneself.</p>

          <p>The article explores the ethical responsibilities of scientists in an era marked by rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and climate change. Drawing upon a conversation between Werner Heisenberg and Friedrich von Weizs√§cker after the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, the article emphasizes the need for scientists to consider the broader implications of their work and engage with the public and policymakers. It argues that science and technology are value-neutral, and it is up to human beings to ensure they are used for good, advocating for scientists to educate the public and participate in public discourse to guide technological development toward beneficial outcomes.</p>
