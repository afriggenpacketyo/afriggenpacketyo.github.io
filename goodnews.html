          <p>Algerian Olympic gold medalist Imane Khelif will be banned from World Boxing competitions until she undergoes mandatory genetic sex testing. World Boxing announced it will introduce mandatory sex testing to determine the eligibility of male and female boxers, starting July 1, 2025. The decision follows controversy surrounding Khelif after she won gold at the Paris Olympics and after claims from the International Boxing Association that Khelif failed unspecified eligibility tests for the women's competition at last year's world championships. The test involves a PCR genetic test to determine the presence of the Y chromosome.</p>

          <p>Corporate buzzwords are prevalent in the workplace, but studies show that using jargon impedes trust. Gen Zers, who have grown up getting instant answers from Siri, may lean into buzzwords and cling to them like corporate life rafts. Research has shown that employees who feel like they're lower-status tend to use more jargon. The article suggests that buzzwords are really about people using poetry to distract from the fact that all they're doing is trying to make money, because that's all most buzzwords are ‚Äî metaphors.</p>

          <p>A psychiatrist who has worked with over 3,000 young adults shares five simple rules for raising highly successful kids. These rules include following your instincts, following your culture, following your kid, focusing on enjoyment, and being your real self. The psychiatrist emphasizes that parenting doesn't have to be complicated and that it's okay to trust your instincts and do what feels right. She also suggests that parents should focus on enjoyment rather than obsessing over developmental milestones.</p>

          <p>Sharon Horgan, an award-winning actor, writer, producer, and director, shared at the Hay Festival that she finally found confidence after the second series of her hit show 'Bad Sisters' premiered last year. Horgan, known for sitcoms like 'Catastrophe,' 'Pulling,' and 'Motherland,' initially turned to writing because she couldn't land acting roles, leading her to create parts for herself. Horgan also talked about how she first turned to writing because she couldn't land any acting roles, hence deciding to write parts for herself. She said she was concerned that because her female-led sitcom had been picked up, it might mean other women wouldn't get their shows made.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri beat his McLaren team-mate Lando Norris to pole position at the Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona. Piastri's advantage suggests that a rule change aimed at restricting the flexing of front wings for aerodynamic gain has had no effect on McLaren. The gap between pole and Verstappen was bigger than at Imola, where the Dutchman won, and in Japan and Saudi Arabia, where he was on pole. Piastri said the rule change had limited impact on McLaren and the way they prepared their car for the race.</p>
