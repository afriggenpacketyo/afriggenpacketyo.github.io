          <p>Japan and the U.S. have reported progress in tariff negotiations, aiming for a potential deal as early as next month, according to Japan's chief tariff negotiator. President Trump announced an increase in tariffs on steel imports to 50% from the previous 25%, speaking at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania, and praised Nippon Steel's planned $14 billion investment in the American producer. China has agreed to begin procedures to resume imports of Japanese seafood, lifting a ban imposed after the Fukushima wastewater release. Other news includes warnings about rice scam websites, strengthened Japan-Cambodia security cooperation, investigations into securities account hijackings, Dai-ichi Life's investment in British insurer M&G, and sumo grand champion Onosato's ring entry ceremony.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he would double tariffs on steel imports to 50% during a rally in Pennsylvania, aiming to further secure the steel industry in the United States. He also celebrated a "blockbuster" agreement for Japan-based Nippon Steel to invest in US Steel, stating that Nippon has committed to keeping U.S. Steel's blast furnaces operating at full capacity for a minimum of a decade. Trump emphasized there would be no layoffs or outsourcing due to the deal, and U.S. Steel workers would receive a $5,000 bonus, while the United Steelworkers union expressed caution regarding the merger's impact on national security and its members. The president framed the drive to boost domestic steel production as a matter of national security, blaming past administrations for the decline of the American steel industry.</p>

Kim Jong Un is cracking down on those caught with foreign content and the future of these efforts is uncertain due to funding cuts.

          <p>A bipartisan group of over 130 retired judges filed a brief urging a federal court to drop charges against Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, arguing her arrest undermines judicial immunity. Dugan was arrested by FBI agents for allegedly preventing the arrest of a man by immigration authorities in her courthouse. The judges argue that Dugan is entitled to absolute immunity for her official acts, similar to protections afforded to members of the legislative and executive branches. They describe the prosecution as an egregious overreach by the executive branch that threatens public trust in the judicial system.</p>

          <h2>Investors Embrace Parody Acronyms Inspired by Trump's Policies</h2>

          <p>Market observers have adopted parody acronyms inspired by President Trump's fondness for slogans, such as TACO (Trump Always Chickens Out) and MEGA (Make Europe Great Again). These acronyms reflect investment strategies or capture market factors influenced by Trump's economic and trade policies. The "Trump Trade," associated with the Make America Great Again theme, has faded as stocks and bonds react to tariff concerns. Some acronyms, like TACO, describe Trump's shifting positions on tariffs, while others, like MEGA, highlight investor interest in European markets.</p>

          <p>China is scaling up the use of AI in urban management, including the use of drones patrolling cities at night to deter crime. The city of Nanjing is using AI to plan patrol routes, focusing on areas generally ignored by human patrols. Despite this progress, analysts warn that China's AI governance faces challenges such as privacy protection and limited community involvement. These challenges are mirrored in other parts of the world as governments race to adopt AI technology.</p>
