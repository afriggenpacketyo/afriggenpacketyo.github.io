          <p>Google has eliminated more than 35% of its managers overseeing small teams in the past year, as the company prioritizes efficiency and reduced bureaucracy. This reduction primarily affected managers with fewer than three direct reports, many of whom transitioned to individual contributor roles. CEO Sundar Pichai emphasized the need for Google to scale without relying solely on increased headcount, following previous layoffs and buyouts. While the company's stock has performed well, these changes have sparked employee questions about job security and morale.</p>

          <p>The US Open tennis tournament is increasingly contending with the pervasive smell of marijuana, a new distraction that has players and fans talking. With recreational cannabis legalized in New York since 2021, the aroma frequently drifts across the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, particularly from nearby Corona Park. Despite a strict no-smoking policy within the grounds, players like Casper Ruud and Maria Sakkari have voiced frustration. This article explores how the city's changing culture is impacting the traditionally unruly Grand Slam event.</p>
