          <p>Chef Jon Yao of Kato in Los Angeles received the prestigious Best Chef: California award at the James Beard Foundation Restaurant and Chef Awards, using his acceptance speech to highlight the importance of immigrant communities in the culinary world. Yao, the child of Taiwanese immigrants, emphasized that Los Angeles was built by the efforts of these communities, who are now facing hardship. He urged everyone to use their voices to advocate for the freedom, dignity, and respect of immigrants, and culinary figures throughout the night echoed this sentiment, crediting immigrants for America's diverse flavors. The awards recognized several other culinary professionals and establishments, also celebrating diversity and immigrant contributions to the industry.</p>

          <p>Firefighters in Ventura County battled two brush fires on Monday night, with the Howe fire being the larger of the two, having blackened about 40 acres near Piru. Helicopters were deployed to make water drops on the flames in the steep terrain south of the town. Additional air tankers and helicopters were called in to assist, and approximately 140 firefighters were on the scene or en route, and the Maria fire, located south of Santa Paula, was contained after burning about 15 acres. Clean-up operations continued into the evening.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani made his highly anticipated pitching debut for the Los Angeles Dodgers, marking his return to the mound after undergoing Tommy John surgery in September 2023. Ohtani pitched one inning against the San Diego Padres, allowing one run on two hits, and his form was not flawless, with rusty command and missed zones. The Dodgers had initially planned to wait until after the All-Star break to have Ohtani pitch, but his progress in live batting practice sessions and concerns about the toll of simulated sessions led to an earlier return. Ohtani is expected to serve as an opener once per week, gradually increasing his workload.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Parliament is set to debate a law change aimed at decriminalizing abortion, with two Labour MPs, Tonia Antoniazzi and Stella Creasy, proposing rival amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill. Antoniazzi's amendment seeks to prevent women from being investigated, arrested, prosecuted, or imprisoned for terminating their own pregnancies, arguing that such investigations are dehumanizing. The current law in England and Wales deems abortion illegal but allows it up to 24 weeks of pregnancy under certain circumstances, with approval from two doctors, and recent changes have allowed women to access abortion pills for home use under 10 weeks.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Shift Towards Arms Exports: A Focus on Security and Alliances</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-16 22:01:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan, traditionally known for its pacifist constitution, is increasingly focusing on global arms exports to strengthen its defense sector. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani has expressed interest in promoting defense exports, signaling a shift from catering solely to the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF). This move is driven by the need to deepen ties with allies, improve interoperability, and develop Japan's defense industrial base, which has been heavily reliant on U.S. weapons. By exporting arms, Japan aims to standardize maintenance processes and create joint training opportunities with purchasing parties, which also allows it to achieve economies of scale and make domestic production more viable.</p>

          <p>The Society of Radiographers (SoR) has issued a warning regarding patients filming their medical treatment for platforms like TikTok and Instagram, and such actions could potentially endanger themselves and NHS staff. The union's annual conference highlighted that patients were increasingly videoing procedures without seeking permission, which can distract staff or cause discomfort, and the sharing of material on social media also risks exposing the private medical data of other individuals present in the hospital.</p>
