          <p>Apple reported strong second-quarter earnings, surpassing Wall Street's expectations, but anticipates a $900 million hit from tariffs in the current quarter. CEO Tim Cook noted the difficulty in predicting tariff impacts beyond June due to ongoing trade policy uncertainties. Apple is already sourcing a significant portion of iPhones from India and other products from Vietnam to mitigate tariff effects. The company authorized $100 billion in share repurchases and increased its dividend, reflecting confidence in its long-term strategy, but acknowledged challenges from the economic environment.</p>

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy expressed optimism that the company could emerge stronger from the current tariff environment during the first-quarter earnings call. Jassy referenced the COVID-19 pandemic as an example of how Amazon's broad selection and low prices helped customers during economic uncertainty. While Amazon beat earnings expectations, its operating income forecast for the current period came in light, with the company citing "tariff and trade policies" as potential impacting factors. Jassy reassured investors that Amazon's market position and customer-centric approach would help it navigate the challenges.</p>

          <p>McDonald's reported a significant sales drop at U.S. restaurants in its first-quarter earnings report, attributing it to economic uncertainty and diminished consumer sentiment. CEO Chris Kempczinski stated that "heightened anxiety" about the economy, largely driven by tariffs, is affecting lower-income Americans. Traffic to U.S. restaurants fell more sharply than anticipated, and the company acknowledged its vulnerability to industry volatility and consumer pressures. The company remains cautious about the overall health of the consumer amid President Trump's sweeping tariff agenda.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is planning to require placebo-controlled trials for all new vaccines, a move his administration calls a "radical departure" from past practices. HHS claims that current childhood vaccines haven't undergone "inert placebo" testing, which public health experts dispute, noting that initial trials did use placebos. Experts worry that requiring placebo tests for simple upgrades of established vaccines would be costly and could limit access to newer, more effective versions. Kennedy's history of spreading false claims about vaccine safety raises concerns about the potential impact of this policy.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of dachshunds and their owners gathered in Budapest, Hungary, to attempt a record for the country's largest single-breed dog walk. The Hungarian Records Association observed the event, tallying the number of participating dogs. While the event set a Hungarian record with 500 dachshunds, it fell short of the Guinness World Record set in Regensburg, Germany. Organizers vowed to try again next year. The article also includes other dachshund-related news, including a miniature dachshund found alive after being lost in the Australian wilderness for 529 days.</p>

          <p>California's population increased for the second consecutive year, with much of the growth concentrated in the state's largest cities. Seven of the state's 10 largest cities recorded population growth, signaling a recovery from pandemic-era declines. The state's population is nearing its pre-pandemic peak, with growth attributed to natural increase and international immigration. Governor Gavin Newsom acknowledged the growth but cautioned that the extreme and uncertain tariffs could jeopardize this momentum.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that any country or person buying oil or petrochemicals from Iran will not be allowed to do business with the U.S. The move aims to completely shut down Iran's oil exports as part of a "maximum pressure" campaign. Trump accused Iran of financing militant groups throughout the Middle East. Experts believe the comments are directed at China, which imports over 1 million barrels per day from Iran, and suggest Trump is negotiating from a position of strength.</p>
