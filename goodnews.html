          <p>Millions of bees escaped after a truck hauling approximately 70,000 pounds of active honey bee hives overturned in Washington state near the Canadian border. Authorities issued warnings for the public to avoid the swarm, and several master beekeepers were called in to assist. The Whatcom County Sheriff's Office stated that the primary goal is to save as many bees as possible, and the site of the crash will remain closed until the rescue operation is complete. The incident highlights the challenges and importance of safely transporting large quantities of bees, which are crucial for pollination and honey production. The situation underscores the need for caution and expertise in handling such incidents to minimize harm to both the public and the bee population, and to keep the bees from flying into Canada. The efforts to rescue the bees demonstrate a commitment to preserving these vital insects. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Corporate buzzwords are criticized for impeding trust and creating a culture of exclusion, with studies showing that using jargon can make employees feel insecure. Gen Zers are particularly vulnerable, as they may cling to buzzwords like corporate life rafts due to their reliance on instant answers. The article suggests that buzzwords are often used to distract from the primary goal of making money, and encourages people to use real-human-people words instead. The author suggests reading poetry for those who love metaphors, emphasizing that clear and direct communication is more effective than jargon. </p>

          <p>Military aircraft and helicopters are being used to evacuate residents in Manitoba, Canada, due to fast-moving wildfires, with thousands already evacuated from western Canada. The evacuation of residents from the northern First Nations community of Pukatawagan is described as a "rapidly evolving situation." Canadian Armed Forces, Manitoba Wildfire Service, and Manitoba's Heavy Urban Search and Rescue Team are involved in the effort to bring people to safety.

          <p>The UK government is preparing to unveil a major review of the military, the strategic defence review, amid concerns about a "new, dangerous era" with a malevolent Russia and a less willing White House. The review will underline the importance of nuclear weapons and the UK's commitment to NATO, while also emphasizing the need to modernize the forces with drones and quickly adapt existing equipment. The government is also expected to stress a greater need for public involvement in protecting the country, including announcements about British industry creating more defence kit and expanding the cadet forces. Despite claims of a "transformative" review, some suggest its impact may be marginal, with specific details about spending and orders not expected until the autumn. </p>

Since becoming Germany's leader, Merz has been actively involved in diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire and maintain Western support for Ukraine. Trump recently threatened to impose a 50% tariff on goods imported from the EU, but then pushed back the deadline to July 9, adding further complexity to the discussions. </p>

Nvidia stood out with better-than-expected quarterly results and guidance, while Salesforce faced criticism for its focus on AI. Costco's strong performance was attributed to margin improvement and same-store sales growth. Inflation also played a role, with the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge coming in cooler than expected for April, but concerns remain about the potential impact of tariffs. The Federal Reserve indicated a "cautious approach" to monetary policy, while Chairman Jerome Powell met with Trump to discuss the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A psychiatrist who has worked with over 3,000 young adults shares five simple rules for effective parenting, emphasizing the importance of trusting instincts, following culture, and focusing on enjoyment rather than strict development. The rules include following your instincts instead of influencers, following your culture instead of clickbait, following your kid instead of the crowd, focusing on enjoyment instead of development, and being your real self instead of your ideal self. The psychiatrist suggests that parents should trust their intuition and cultural traditions, pay attention to their child's unique interests, and prioritize joy and genuine connection. By embracing these principles, parents can create a nurturing environment that fosters healthy youth development. </p>

Despite the rule change, Piastri stated that it had limited impact on McLaren and the way they prepared their car for the race.
