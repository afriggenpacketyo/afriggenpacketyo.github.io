Thanedar stated he intends to add to his articles of impeachment, citing Trump's plan to accept a Boeing 747 from Qatar as a gift, but House leaders planned to table the resolution, effectively killing it. Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar criticized Thanedar's effort as a distraction from healthcare concerns, while Speaker Mike Johnson labeled it an embarrassing political stunt. Thanedar, who faces a challenging reelection, insists he will continue to fight to remove Trump from office for his alleged misconduct.</p>

          <p>Utah State Treasurer Marlo Oaks argues that state financial officers have a fiduciary duty to combat environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Oaks believes that ESG introduces motivations that violate fiduciary standards by addressing societal issues through capital markets, while DEI changes hiring practices away from merit-based systems, ultimately harming companies and their financial output. He contends that these practices negatively impact state pensions, harming firefighters, teachers, and police officers who depend on them for retirement. Oaks was among two dozen state financial officers who cautioned the SEC on the financial risks of prioritizing political agendas over financial returns.</p>

          <p>A new investigation by Consumer Reports, The Guardian, and the Food & Environment Reporting Network (FERN) reveals that Kroger customers are frequently overcharged due to price tag errors, such as expired discount labels. The investigation, prompted by allegations from Kroger employees, found overcharges on more than 150 grocery items, averaging $1.70 per item, at over half of the 26 Kroger and Kroger-owned stores examined. While Kroger disputes the findings, citing a small number of errors compared to total transactions, similar allegations have been made against other retailers, and customers have filed class-action lawsuits over pricing inaccuracies.</p>

          <p>Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee have voted to include a federal school voucher program, worth $20 billion over four years, in a reconciliation bill that would also extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts. The plan would use the federal tax code to create a national school voucher program, even in states where voters have fought such efforts. Funding would come from private citizens who make charitable donations to Scholarship Granting Organizations (SGOs), and the federal government would give these donors a dollar-for-dollar tax credit.

          <p>President Trump has revived a proposal to set drug price caps based on the amounts paid in other high-income countries, a plan that Senate Democrats and the Biden administration previously rejected. The executive order signed calls on the Department of Health and Human Services to draw up regulations to impose price restrictions tied to lower amounts paid in other developed nations, if drugmakers did not voluntarily reduce what they were charging in the U.S. Democrats had considered a similar approach in 2019 but ultimately opted for a different formula in the Inflation Reduction Act.</p>

          <h2>New York AG Sues Capital One After Trump Administration's CFPB Drops Similar Case</h2>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has sued Capital One, accusing the bank of "cheating" customers out of millions of dollars in interest payments. The lawsuit alleges that Capital One marketed its "360 Savings" account as its high-yield savings account, then failed to inform customers about its new "360 Performance Savings" product that offered substantially higher interest rates. This lawsuit mimics a similar case by the CFPB, which was dropped in February under the Trump administration's CFPB Acting Director Russell Vought.</p>

          <h2>Boeing Inks Record-Breaking Deal for Qatar Airways to Buy Up to 210 Planes</h2>

          <p>Boeing and Qatar Airways announced a deal for the Middle Eastern airline to buy up to 210 jets, notching the U.S. planemaker's largest-ever order of widebody aircraft. The order includes 130 of Boeing's 787 Dreamliners and 30 of its much-delayed 777-9s, with options for up to 50 more planes. The deal could be a boon for Boeing, which has not posted a profit since 2018, and has been beset by major safety concerns, manufacturing defects, cost overruns and a nearly two-month-long machinist strike last year.</p>
