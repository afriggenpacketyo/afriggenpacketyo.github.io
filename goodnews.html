          <p>England's women's cricket team secured a comprehensive ODI series win against the West Indies, highlighted by consecutive centuries from Amy Jones and Tammy Beaumont. In the second ODI, Jones scored 129 and Beaumont contributed 106, leading England to a dominant 366-6. West Indies, missing their captain Hayley Matthews, were eventually bowled out for 223. This victory, under the new leadership of Nat Sciver-Brunt and Charlotte Edwards, follows a 3-0 sweep in the T20 series. England's batting prowess and the Windies' struggles underscore the gulf between the two teams.</p>

          <p>Weaker-than-expected private-sector jobs data has increased speculation about a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut. The ADP's report indicated only 37,000 jobs added in May, the lowest in over two years, which could prompt the Fed to act to boost the labor market. Meanwhile, Amazon announced a $10 billion investment in new AI data centers in North Carolina, benefiting companies like Nvidia, Eaton, and GE Vernova. Additionally, OpenAI reported reaching 3 million paying business users for ChatGPT, signaling growing AI monetization. CrowdStrike disclosed government inquiries into its revenue recognition practices. (not investment advice)</p>

The potential appointment signals a possible shift in Rangers' approach. The appointment may bring stability to the team.</p>

          <p>Dave's Hot Chicken, a franchise that started as a chicken finger stand in an LA parking lot with $900, has been acquired by Roark Capital in a deal worth nearly $1 billion. Founded by Arman Oganesyan and his friends Dave Kopushyan and Tommy Rubenyan, the chain grew from a pop-up to over 300 locations. The company's success is attributed to a unique Nashville hot chicken recipe and effective marketing. The friends scraped their savings together to get to work developing a Nashville hot chicken recipe, drawing inspiration from popular Los Angeles restaurant Howlin' Ray's. The deal is a sign of increased optimism.</p>
