        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government has begun releasing stockpiled rice directly to retailers, resulting in cheaper prices for consumers. Ito-Yokado and Iris Ohyama were the first to sell the rice at approximately $15 for a 5-kilogram bag, with some stores selling out within minutes. Consumers have expressed relief at the lower prices, noting little difference in taste from newly harvested rice. This effort aims to combat soaring rice prices affecting households, with 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022 harvests being made available. (not investment advice)</p>
