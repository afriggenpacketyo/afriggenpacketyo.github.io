          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools, $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 for home-schooled students. Democrats argue the legislation hurts public schools, benefiting wealthier students already in private education. This article discusses the details and implications of the new school choice program in Texas.</p>
