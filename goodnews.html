        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Martin Powers, a historian, explains how visual evidence from imperial China, particularly public art, offers unique insights into historical political ideas and societal norms, often revealing widespread understandings not always explicit in texts. He argues that art actively participates in political discourse by depicting intergroup relations, such as rich and poor, and illustrating concepts of authority. Powers highlights the concept of "honour" as described by Montesquieu, where arbitrary privilege is a key feature of aristocracies, a notion observable in both Eastern and Western historical contexts through artistic representations.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes the current stock market, noting its resilience despite events like government shutdowns, which historically haven't significantly impacted it. It highlights a speculative bull market fueled by a "Trump put" perception and a new generation of buyers chasing high-growth, future-oriented stocks like Nvidia and Palantir. The author observes widespread complacency and a lack of profit-taking, even as some stocks experience "life-changing moves." Despite acknowledging the market's current magical run, the advice is to take some profits off the table to protect gains, emphasizing prudence amidst perceived invincibility.

          <p>The UK government has announced significant reforms to the housing market, aiming to reduce costs, minimize delays, and halve the number of failed property sales. Housing Secretary Steve Reed stated these changes would "fix the broken system," potentially saving first-time buyers an average of £710 and cutting up to four weeks from transaction timelines. Key proposals include legally mandating upfront provision of property information by sellers and estate agents, and considering the introduction of binding contracts to prevent late withdrawals. The initiative also seeks to elevate professional standards across the sector through a new mandatory Code of Practice.</p>

          <p>Three experienced cavers were successfully rescued after being trapped for over 30 hours in the challenging Dowber Gill Passage in North Yorkshire during Storm Amy. Over 100 volunteers from multiple rescue teams worked in "appalling conditions," including rising floodwaters, to bring the men to safety. The rescue was complicated by the weather, forcing teams to retrace their steps through the cave. Although uninjured, the cavers were exhausted after 42 hours of cold and wet conditions. Their pre-shared detailed route information was crucial for the successful outcome of the extensive operation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Oregon has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard to Portland. Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, ruled that the president lacked a "colorable basis" for the deployment, citing that protests were not significantly violent or disruptive and local law enforcement was capable of maintaining order. This decision was hailed by Oregon's Attorney General and Portland's Mayor as a "healthy check on the president" and a victory for peaceful expression. The ruling also prompted California Governor Gavin Newsom to pledge a lawsuit over the subsequent deployment of California National Guard troops to Oregon.</p>
