          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the government cannot deport or detain Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil based on foreign policy reasons cited by the Trump administration. The preliminary injunction, issued by a New Jersey judge, prevents the government from deporting Khalil for reasons related to Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination. The judge found that Khalil's career and reputation are being damaged and his speech is being chilled, resulting in irreparable harm. The ruling does not prevent the administration from pursuing deportation based on other alleged issues with his green card application.</p>

The images, released by the European Space Agency, offer new insights into the sun's behavior and magnetic field as it approaches the most active phase of its solar cycle. Scientists discovered that magnetic fields with both north and south polarity are present at the south pole, a phenomenon expected to last only briefly during the solar maximum. The Solar Orbiter's path will continue to tilt, providing even more direct views of the sun's south pole in the coming years.</p>
