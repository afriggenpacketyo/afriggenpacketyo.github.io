        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's civil aviation authority has enacted new safety measures, effective June 28, requiring all power banks carried by air travelers to have a mandatory safety and quality certification known as "3C." This certification ensures products meet specific national standards for safety, health, and environmental impact. Any power bank lacking the visible 3C mark is now considered substandard and will not be allowed on flights. To accommodate travelers, airports will provide designated areas for passengers to discard, store, or mail their non-compliant devices.</p>

          <p>The Colombian navy has intercepted an unmanned semi-submersible vessel, or "narco sub," equipped with a Starlink antenna for the first time off its Caribbean coast. Believed to be owned by the Gulf Clan cartel, the drone vessel was likely on a trial run as it was not carrying any drugs. This seizure highlights a significant evolution in drug trafficking methods, moving towards sophisticated, unmanned systems that are harder to detect and reduce risks for cartels. The use of drone vessels eliminates the need for a human crew, making it more difficult for authorities to trace the shipments back to their organizers.</p>

          <p>The Wisconsin State Supreme Court issued a significant ruling, determining that a pre-Civil War law from 1849 does not constitute a ban on abortion. This decision preserves the legality of abortion access within the state. The ruling addresses the legal ambiguity that arose following the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade. The 19th-century statute had been a point of contention, with its interpretation being critical to the future of reproductive rights in Wisconsin.</p>

          <p>Arsenal's efforts to strengthen their attacking lineup this summer have yet to yield a major signing, despite the club's clear intentions. The team is reportedly focused on acquiring a new center-forward, with RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko and Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres as primary targets, though negotiations have been difficult. The club is also exploring options for creative midfielders, with interest in players like Real Madrid's Rodrygo and Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze, but financial constraints and player availability pose significant challenges. The outcome of the striker search will likely dictate the budget for reinforcing other attacking positions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump traveled to Iowa to commence celebrations for America's 250th anniversary and to promote his administration's agenda to heartland voters. During a campaign-style speech, he aimed to reassure farmers that his trade policies, which have created economic uncertainty, are ultimately beneficial for them. The visit also served to build support for his sweeping tax and spending bill ahead of a congressional deadline. The legislation has been a source of tension, with some Iowa farmers and Republican constituents expressing concerns over retaliatory tariffs and deep cuts to the Medicaid health program.</p>

          <p>In response to ongoing ICE raids that have instilled fear in the community, the city of Santa Ana, California, has created a $100,000 emergency fund. The initiative, proposed by Mayor Valerie Amezcua, aims to help families impacted by the detention of a primary breadwinner cover basic necessities like food and rent. The move followed public criticism of the mayor's initial silence on the issue. The fund will be sourced by reallocating 10% of the budget from city-sponsored cultural events, a compromise reached after a heated city council debate over the funding source.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author reflects on his wavering faith in the American road trip, an experience he feels has been diluted by digital detachment and corporate sameness. He describes a cross-country drive where the journey felt more like a series of planned sightseeing stops than a genuine exploration. However, his perspective is restored by an unexpected stay at a motel in Shamrock, Texas, run by a warm South Asian immigrant family. This encounter on the Fourth of July reminds him of the road's potential for genuine human connection and the complex, shared dreams that still define the country.</p>

The trend allows parents who enjoy electronic music to share the experience with their kids in a family-friendly daytime setting.

          <p>A coalition of tribal leaders, activists, and environmentalists is proposing a plan to partially restore California's Tulare Lake, which was drained for agriculture over a century ago. The proposal involves acquiring nearly 24,000 acres of farmland to create a reservoir and wetlands, providing a crucial outlet for floodwaters and reviving vital wildlife habitat. Supporters, including the Tachi Yokut Tribe, for whom the lake holds deep cultural significance, argue the project would protect nearby towns and help address groundwater depletion.

The novel uses her child's perspective to highlight the emotional deflections of adults and the brutal simplicity of a world in crisis.

For example, rent freezes have occurred in NYC before, and publicly owned stores exist in other states.
