          <p>UK retail sales experienced a notable increase of 0.5% in September 2025, reaching their highest level since summer 2022, as reported by the Office for National Statistics. The quarterly performance, from July to September, saw sales grow by 0.9%, largely due to favorable weather conditions that spurred clothing purchases and a significant uptick in online retailing. Non-store retailers, primarily online shops, recorded a 3.8% rise, with computer and telecoms sectors performing strongly and online jewellers noting robust demand for gold. These critical ONS figures are instrumental for government policy formulation and the Bank of England's financial decisions, including interest rate adjustments, indicating a period of economic expansion.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's top leaders, following the "Fourth Plenum" meeting, committed to a five-year strategy focused on boosting domestic consumption and achieving self-reliance in advanced technologies such as quantum computing and hydrogen power. The plan, which aims to balance consumption with "effective investment" and expand internal demand, reflects a nuanced shift in economic policy. Despite calls for bolstering international influence, the primary emphasis is on domestic development, including supporting businesses and consumption-related sectors without direct cash handouts. This strategy also reaffirms a 5% growth target, concentrating resources on high-tech and emerging industries while acknowledging persistent deflationary pressures and the need for "high-quality development" in real estate.

          <p>A Chinese research team has unveiled a groundbreaking, smart, and super-tough coating designed to enhance stealth aircraft capabilities. Detailed in Advanced Materials, this innovative metasurface is remarkably thin at 0.1 mm, highly flexible, and capable of enduring temperatures up to 1,000 degrees Celsius. Its tunable impedance makes it exceptionally effective for absorbing electromagnetic waves, crucial for stealth technology. Led by researchers from Peking University and other institutions, this development leverages prior work in large-scale graphene production. This technological leap represents a significant advancement in aerospace materials, potentially improving the performance and resilience of future aircraft.</p>

          <p>Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao conveyed a conciliatory message, asserting that the U.S. and China can still find avenues for cooperation, ahead of the expected meeting between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping. Wang underscored that dialogue and collaboration are the "only right choice" for the two nations, rejecting notions of decoupling and advocating for global supply chain stability. He emphasized addressing bilateral issues through mutual respect to foster healthy and sustainable relations. This diplomatic posture emerges after China's Fourth Plenum, where leaders focused on domestic growth, technological self-reliance, and boosting consumption, setting a constructive backdrop for upcoming trade talks in Malaysia and the presidential summit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German company Böcker, whose furniture lift became an unwitting tool in the recent €88 million Louvre Museum heist, has cleverly leveraged the incident for a new advertising campaign. The firm published a social media post featuring its Agilo ladder extended to a Louvre balcony, accompanied by the slogan "When you need to move fast." The managing director explained that, after confirming no injuries occurred, they opted for a "touch of humour" to generate attention for their family business. The alleged thieves reportedly stole the lift during a demonstration, using it to facilitate their escape with priceless French crown jewels.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and over 20 allied nations in London to advocate for increased provision of long-range missiles to Ukraine. This summit aims to maintain momentum after recent diplomatic successes, including new US sanctions on Russia and EU financial support for Ukraine. Starmer will announce an accelerated delivery of 100 additional air defense missiles to Ukraine, part of a £1.6bn deal. The discussions will also cover strategies to remove Russian oil and gas from the global market and the contentious issue of using frozen Russian assets to fund Ukrainian loans, a plan that previously faced consensus issues.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump declared the cancellation of a planned federal deployment to San Francisco, attributing the decision to a conversation with Mayor Daniel Lurie and interventions from influential tech company executives. The "surge" operation, initially scheduled for Saturday, was halted after Mayor Lurie highlighted "substantial progress" in the city's public safety, citing notable reductions in crime rates across various categories. Lurie also received assurances from Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem regarding federal cooperation in addressing the fentanyl crisis. This reversal follows local opposition to federal intervention, with Governor Gavin Newsom and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi commending the mayor's leadership in prioritizing local public safety.</p>

          <p>Anti-Trump "No Kings" rallies have featured protesters donning inflatable animal costumes, such as frogs, lobsters, and unicorns, as a strategic response to Republican portrayals of them as "Hate America" radicals. This "Operation Inflation" tactic, inspired by an incident where an officer sprayed a frog-suited protester in Portland, aims to employ absurdist humor to undermine claims of the demonstrations being "war zones." Participants, including a NASA engineer dressed as a unicorn, believe humor is an effective tool against perceived autocrats, making any government response appear farcical. This creative form of dissent seeks to reframe public perception and challenge dominant political narratives through unexpected visual messaging.</p>

          <p>The US Women's National Team experienced a surprising 2-1 loss to Portugal in a friendly match, marking Portugal's historic first-ever victory against the Americans and their inaugural goals scored against them in international play. The game, which coincided with a star-studded farewell tribute for two-time World Cup winner Alex Morgan, saw the US initially take the lead with Rose Lavelle's early goal. However, Portugal rallied to equalize and then netted the winning goal in the second half. US coach Emma Hayes attributed the team's somewhat disjointed performance to a nearly four-month hiatus. Despite the unexpected result, the evening served as a significant celebration of Alex Morgan's illustrious career and enduring legacy in women's soccer.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers secured a dominant 37-10 victory against the Minnesota Vikings, dramatically reversing their recent performance slump. The offense exceeded 30 points for the first time this season, complemented by a relentless defense that sacked Vikings quarterback Carson Wentz five times and limited their offensive opportunities. Remarkably, the Chargers did not punt for the first time in four years, signaling a significant improvement in their ground game with 207 rushing yards. This comprehensive win, achieved despite critical defensive injuries, offered profound redemption for the team, propelling them into their mini-bye with renewed confidence after a challenging month of losses.</p>

          <p>This article systematically debunks ten prevalent historical "facts" that have been definitively proven false over time. It clarifies that Gavrilo Princip was not consuming a sandwich before assassinating Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and Anne Boleyn's conviction was for incest, adultery, and treason, not witchcraft. The piece also corrects the popular misconception that those accused of witchcraft in Salem were burned at the stake, and that the US Civil War was solely fought over states' rights, rather than slavery. Additional myths addressed include Nero playing a fiddle during Rome's fire, Paul Revere's actual warning cry, the true average medieval lifespan, the composition of George Washington's false teeth, and the identity of the first European to discover America.</p>
