          <p>The team bus for the Wales women's national football team was involved in a collision while en route to a training session in St. Gallen, Switzerland. The Football Association of Wales confirmed that all players and staff on the bus were unharmed, though the driver of the other vehicle was hospitalized with minor injuries. As a result of the incident, the team's scheduled training session at the stadium was canceled. Head coach Rhian Wilkinson and captain Angharad James were not on the bus, as they were traveling separately for a press conference.</p>

          <p>World number one Aryna Sabalenka secured her place in the Wimbledon semi-finals after a challenging three-set match against 37-year-old German veteran Laura Siegemund. Despite being the strong favorite, Sabalenka struggled against Siegemund's unconventional style, dropping the first set and having to fight back from a break down twice in the decider. The Belarusian ultimately prevailed with a 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 victory after nearly three hours of play. This win keeps her on track to potentially reach her fourth consecutive major final.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Black Americans are moving abroad and report experiencing a more fulfilling and inclusive life outside of the United States. Many expats state that in other countries, they are perceived as American first, rather than being primarily defined by their race, leading to fewer encounters with discrimination. In addition to a greater sense of social safety, individuals cite better work-life balance and economic opportunities as key benefits of their move. These experiences suggest that for some, the "American dream" is more attainable in countries like Mexico, Ghana, and Greece.</p>

          <p>Germany's Defense Minister, Boris Pistorius, has put forward a draft bill that would allow for the reintroduction of military conscription under specific security circumstances. The plan, a response to Europe's changing security landscape, would enable the government to call up conscripts if required to rapidly expand the armed forces. The proposal is viewed as a compromise, aiming to bolster the military and double the number of reservists to 200,000. It also seeks to make voluntary service more appealing with significantly higher pay, as Germany works to meet new NATO troop level guidelines.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Taylor Fritz has advanced to his first-ever Wimbledon semi-final with a four-set victory over Karen Khachanov. The fifth seed appeared to be in control after winning the first two sets, but experienced a sudden loss of form in the third, which he lost 6-1. After a medical timeout, Fritz regrouped and clinched the match in a fourth-set tie-break, winning 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (7-4). Fritz is now the first American man to reach the Wimbledon semi-finals in over a decade, keeping hopes alive for a U.S. male Grand Slam champion.</p>

          <p>A year after his Conservative Party's significant election defeat, former U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser. Sunak, who worked for the investment bank early in his career, will advise global clients on macroeconomic and geopolitical issues. A government watchdog required him to wait a year before taking the role to mitigate risks of unfair influence, and his advisory scope is restricted for another year. Sunak has stated that his compensation from the role will be donated to his educational charity.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is ending its long-standing policy that requires passengers in general security lines to remove their shoes for screening. According to an internal memo, the change will be implemented at many major U.S. airports starting this week, with a full rollout to all airports planned shortly. The policy was first introduced in 2006, years after the failed "shoe bomber" attempt in 2001. This move, which previously only applied to TSA PreCheck members, is part of an effort to streamline the security process for all travelers.</p>

          <p>The iconic Bayeux Tapestry, which depicts the Norman conquest of England in 1066, will be displayed in the United Kingdom for the first time since its creation. In a historic loan agreement between France and the UK, the 70-meter-long embroidery will be exhibited at the British Museum from autumn 2026 to July 2027. The loan will occur while the tapestry's home in the Bayeux Museum undergoes renovation. In exchange, the British Museum will loan several of its own treasures, including artifacts from Sutton Hoo, to museums in Normandy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A monthly survey from the New York Federal Reserve shows that U.S. consumer fears of a sharp, tariff-driven inflation spike have subsided. In June, respondents' one-year inflation expectation dropped to 3%, the same level as in January before the administration's most aggressive trade rhetoric began. This is down from a peak of 3.6% reached in March and April, suggesting that the threatened tariffs have not yet significantly impacted consumer outlook or most official inflation metrics. The survey also showed an improved outlook on employment, with fewer people expecting to lose their job. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Boeing delivered 60 airplanes in the last month, its highest total since December 2023, signaling progress in its efforts to increase production of the 737 Max jet. The company's output had slowed significantly following a mid-air door plug blowout in January 2024, which intensified scrutiny of its manufacturing and safety protocols. The monthly total included 42 of the 737 Max models delivered to major airlines. This marks the company's best second-quarter performance since 2018, as it works to recover from years of crises and regain ground against its rival, Airbus.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the successful New York City mayoral primary campaign of Zohran Mamdani, a progressive advocate for Palestinian rights. It argues his victory provides a roadmap for building broad Democratic coalitions by setting aside ideological purity tests. A key factor was his cross-endorsement with Brad Lander, a self-identified "progressive Zionist," which helped build a coalition of liberal Jews and pro-Palestinian Muslims. The piece suggests that by acknowledging their differences on foreign policy while focusing on shared local goals, they created a credible and effective political alliance that other progressives could learn from.</p>

Downing Street expects new powers allowing French police to intervene with boats in shallow water to become operational soon, a key UK objective. While a "one in, one out" migrant returns deal remains a central goal, its finalization is not yet confirmed. The discussions are a major focus of French President Emmanuel Macron's state visit, as 2025 has already set a record for small boat arrivals.</p>
