        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>It is not too late to seek tax relief in June, as the IRS continues to work with taxpayers to resolve debts even after the official tax deadline has passed. Taxpayers can still apply for payment plans, negotiate with the IRS, and potentially qualify for a temporary pause on collection efforts or penalty relief. However, interest continues to accrue, and unpaid taxes can eventually lead to enforcement actions, making it important to address the situation promptly. Taxpayers should know what they owe, consider payment plan options, explore IRS relief programs, and seek professional help if needed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Boeing will resume airplane deliveries to China next month after a pause amid a trade war, according to CEO Kelly Ortberg, who dismissed the impact of tariffs. Ortberg stated that China has indicated it will accept deliveries, with the first ones scheduled for June. Boeing has been paying tariffs on imported components from Italy and Japan for its Dreamliner planes but can recoup much of it when the planes are exported. The only duties Boeing would have to cover are those for deliveries to U.S. airlines.</p>

          <p>Harvard University secured a temporary reprieve in its legal battle against the Trump administration's efforts to restrict foreign students, after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) appeared to walk back its initial decertification. DHS now grants Harvard 30 days to prove it meets the requirements of the Student and Exchange Visitor Programme (SEVP), which authorizes universities to host academics on visas. US District Judge Allison Burroughs indicated she would later issue a longer-term hold, known as a preliminary injunction, that would stand while the case played out in court.
