          <p>A Florida woman named Amber Meade endured months of excruciating pain after a foot surgery, which was eventually diagnosed as chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS), a rare and incurable disorder. The condition, which can occur after nerve injuries, is difficult to diagnose and treat, often requiring a multi-faceted approach including physical therapy and medication. After finding a specialized physical therapist and undergoing ketamine infusions, Meade has been able to regain some functionality and improve her quality of life, though she still manages the lifelong condition.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has partially restricted the Trump administration's policy of summarily expelling migrants at the southern border without allowing them to seek asylum. The D.C. Circuit Court ruled that while the administration can deny access to the asylum system itself, it cannot ignore U.S. laws requiring consideration for other humanitarian protections, such as "withholding of removal" and relief under the Convention Against Torture. This decision narrows a lower court's ruling but affirms that the president cannot unilaterally suspend all forms of humanitarian protection for migrants fearing persecution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts federal immigration agents from conducting "roving" raids in the Los Angeles area based on factors like race or speaking Spanish. The court agreed that such factors alone do not constitute reasonable suspicion for detaining individuals to check their immigration status, a practice that violates the 4th Amendment. The decision stems from a lawsuit over raids by the Trump administration that sparked widespread fear in the region's large Latino community.</p>

          <p>China has funded and constructed a satellite data receiving ground station near Windhoek, Namibia, enhancing its space technology cooperation with African nations. The facility, completed ahead of schedule, will help Namibia with applications like environmental monitoring, disaster management, and resource assessment. As part of the partnership, China will also train Namibian engineers to operate the station independently. The project is seen as a key example of China's growing influence and support for Africa's developing space programs.</p>

          <p>Wells Fargo has raised its price target for Arm Holdings, citing strong momentum in artificial intelligence data centers as a key driver for future growth. The firm anticipates that the increasing demand for licenses related to AI computing will boost Arm's royalty revenue and help it maintain significant growth in its annual contract value. This positive outlook comes as recent data showed a 104% year-over-year increase in shipments of Arm-based server CPUs in the first quarter of 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule successfully docked with the International Space Station, delivering a new four-person crew for a long-duration mission. The international team includes two NASA astronauts, a Japanese astronaut, and a Russian cosmonaut, who will join the seven astronauts already aboard the orbiting lab. The arrival of Crew 11 will allow the preceding crew to return to Earth after their 145-day mission. The new crew may have their stay extended from six to eight months as NASA considers ways to manage costs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>University of Colorado football coach Deion Sanders recently underwent a neobladder reconstruction after being treated for bladder cancer. The complex surgical procedure involves removing the cancerous bladder and constructing a new one from a segment of the patient's own small intestine. Surgeons explain that this method avoids organ rejection, though patients must retrain themselves to manage urination as the new organ cannot signal the brain. Sanders has been open about his recovery, aiming to reduce the shame associated with side effects like incontinence.</p>

However, the path home is complicated by destroyed homes, lack of job prospects, and the ongoing security threat, which remains the primary deterrent for many.

          <p>A 66-year-old California man in urgent need of a kidney transplant discovered an extraordinarily rare match: his wife. Jim Irish, whose kidney function declined sharply after complications from a procedure, faced a long wait on the national transplant list. His wife, Mirna, volunteered to donate and, against odds of approximately 1-in-100,000, was found to be a strong genetic match. After overcoming additional health hurdles, the couple is scheduled for the transplant surgery, a profound test of their wedding vows.</p>

          <p>This opinion column pushes back against the notion that the Los Angeles Lakers' 2020 NBA championship, won in the Orlando "bubble," is less legitimate than other titles. The author argues that dismissing the victory ignores the immense courage and mental fortitude required for players to compete while isolated during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The piece contends that the unique challenges, including playing without home-court advantage despite having the best record, make the championship worthy of an exclamation point, not an asterisk.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is replacing its iconic Humvee, a military workhorse for 40 years, with a new, lighter vehicle designed for modern warfare. The new Infantry Squad Vehicle (ISV) is essentially a stripped-down, all-terrain truck based on a commercial Chevrolet Colorado, making it faster, cheaper, and easier to repair. This shift reflects the Army's strategic move away from heavy armor, which was crucial in Iraq and Afghanistan, toward speed and agility to counter threats like lethal drones on future battlefields.</p>
