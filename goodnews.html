        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK and EU are set to hold their first bilateral summit since Brexit, driven by shared concerns over Russia, China, and global security. The agenda includes a joint declaration on foreign policy priorities, a security and defense pact, and measures to reduce trade barriers. While Prime Minister Starmer aims to reset relations, he remains cautious due to Eurosceptic sentiments and fears of betraying Brexit. The summit will address issues such as plant and animal health agreements, fishing rights, youth mobility, and cooperation on illegal migration and energy trading. The discussions also involve the UK's access to EU defense contracts, complicated by France's protectionist stance. </p>

          <p>The FDA approved the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, Nuvaxovid, but only for older adults and high-risk individuals over 12, requiring the company to conduct further studies on potential heart conditions. This decision has drawn criticism, with some experts arguing it unnecessarily restricts access for healthy individuals under 65. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s influence on health agencies is cited as a possible factor, as the new restrictions deviate from the usual process of COVID-19 vaccine approvals. The approval requires Novavax to complete costly studies, raising concerns about the vaccine's availability. </p>

          <p>Home Depot is entering a critical sales period, with its Memorial Day outdoor sales event expected to drive revenue. While gardening sales are significant, Home Depot's performance is closely tied to housing turnover, which remains uncertain due to elevated mortgage rates. Analysts predict a tough first quarter due to unfavorable weather and weak consumer sentiment. Tariff impacts also pose a challenge, though potential de-escalation between the U.S. and China could ease those headwinds. </p>

          <p>Paleontologists have discovered the fossilized remains of Mosura fentoni, a 500-million-year-old three-eyed predator, in the Burgess Shale of the Canadian Rockies. This creature, nicknamed the "sea moth," had a pencil sharpener-like mouth and unique segmented body. The discovery provides new insights into animal life during the Cambrian period. The Mosura's complex anatomy suggests that early arthropods were capable of specializing different body regions for specific functions. </p>
