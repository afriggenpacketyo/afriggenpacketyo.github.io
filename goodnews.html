        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have tested core components of quantum communication technology in a space flight, aiming to build an integrated space-ground system for ultra-secure communications. A laser module and phase encoding device were launched on a Yuanxingzhe-1 rocket to test their robustness against the stresses of space travel. This test is a key step in China's transition towards a fully integrated quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network. QSDC is considered a more efficient and secure alternative to quantum key distribution (QKD), as it sends messages directly through a quantum channel without needing encryption keys.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) is warning residents about a fraudulent social media advertisement offering discounted vehicle registration renewals. The scam entices users to provide personal information and pay through unofficial channels, such as Cash App. The DMV emphasizes that it never requests personal data or payments through social media or transaction applications. To avoid falling victim to this scam, the DMV advises renewing vehicle registrations only through its official website, at a DMV kiosk, or by making an appointment at a DMV office.</p>

While "Ballerina" delivers action-packed entertainment, "Dangerous Animals" stands out for its suspense and strong performances.

Sufficient supplies were eventually obtained, primarily from the US, shortly before D-Day, though it was initially limited to military use.</p>

While the Home Builders Federation supports fitting more panels, they caution against burdensome paperwork that could hinder the construction of new homes.
