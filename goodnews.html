          <p>Former President Trump has endorsed Jack Ciattarelli in the New Jersey gubernatorial race, a move aimed at consolidating Republican support. Ciattarelli, who narrowly lost to the Democratic governor in 2021, has been actively seeking Trump's backing. The endorsement is expected to boost Ciattarelli's chances in the Republican primary, where he faces competition from Bill Spadea and Jon Bramnick. However, aligning with Trump could be a liability in the general election in a state that leans Democratic, as the New York Times article points out that Trump remains unpopular in many populous regions of New Jersey.</p>

          <p>A cache of secret Nazi documents seized during World War II was discovered in the basement of Argentina's Supreme Court by chance. NPR reports that the documents, which arrived from the German embassy in Tokyo in 1941, were intended to promote Adolf Hitler's ideology in Argentina. The contents include Nazi propaganda, photographs, and notebooks from the National Socialist German Workers' Party Organization Abroad and the German Trade Union. Officials are now scanning, digitizing, and reviewing the materials to uncover information about the Holocaust and the "global Nazi money trail."</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Retreats on China Tariffs After Disrupting Global Trade</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 18:38:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to impose and then reduce triple-digit tariffs on Chinese products has demonstrated the reach of U.S. trade policy but also its limitations. The New York Times reports that the tariffs caused significant trade disruptions, leading companies to reroute business and impacting both American importers and Chinese factories. Trade talks in Geneva resulted in an agreement to lower tariffs, with Chinese imports facing a minimum tax of 30 percent and China lowering its import duty on American goods to 10 percent. However, the agreement did not appear to generate any other immediate concessions from China, raising questions about the value of the trade disruptions.</p>

          <p>A new software update prevented a third radar outage at Newark airport after a telecommunications line failed again, according to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. ABC News reports that Duffy blamed the Biden administration for not adequately equipping the air traffic control facility in Philadelphia, which handles Newark's air traffic. The FAA will meet with airlines to discuss potential limits on flights into the summer, and Duffy plans to request an investigation into the transfer of Newark air traffic controllers to Philadelphia.</p>

          <p>Jon Voight, one of Donald Trump's Hollywood supporters, has joined labor unions and major studios in requesting tax incentives for film and television productions. The Guardian reports that the letter to Trump seeks support for tax provisions that would boost domestic production and bring back American jobs. The request comes amid controversy over Trump's proposed tariffs on foreign film production, which sparked outcry in the entertainment industry. The letter avoids mentioning the tariff proposal, focusing instead on shared goals of supporting the domestic film industry.</p>

          <p>U.S. tariff receipts reached a record $16.3 billion in April, contributing to a reduction in the budget deficit. CNBC reports that the increase is attributed to President Trump's trade war and tariffs on imports. While the U.S. is still running a large budget deficit, the surge in tariff revenue helped offset some of the imbalance. High interest rates continue to pose a budgetary burden, with net interest on the national debt totaling $89 billion in April.</p>
