          <p>Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil was released from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility in Louisiana after a federal judge ordered his release while his immigration proceedings continue. Khalil, who was detained for months under the Trump administration due to "foreign policy" concerns, addressed reporters, asserting that the administration chose the wrong person to target. Judge Michael Farbiarz determined Khalil is not a threat or flight risk, restricting his travel to New Jersey, New York, Michigan, Washington, D.C., and Louisiana. Khalil's wife, Noor Abdalla, expressed relief, while the White House stated its intention to appeal the decision, and a DHS spokeswoman criticized the judicial branch for undermining national security. The legal battle highlights tensions between immigration enforcement and civil liberties. </p>

The parents acknowledged that Karen's life will never be the same due to the case's notoriety and hurtful comments, but they hope to use their experience to help others. Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey expressed sympathy for the O'Keefe family, while a friend of O'Keefe's called the verdict a miscarriage of justice; Read still faces a civil wrongful death suit. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, but President Trump hinted at a potential "deal" with the school. Judge Allison Burroughs issued a preliminary injunction barring the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System. Trump stated his administration has been working closely with Harvard and suggested a "mindbogglingly" historic settlement could be announced soon, but the Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling. The conflict stems from the administration's claims that Harvard failed to address campus antisemitism, potentially jeopardizing the university's large international student population. </p>

Yoshinoya Holdings, parent of a major beef bowl chain, is also expanding its ramen business to balance ingredient costs.

          <p>Scientists are trying to solve a decade-long mystery involving anomalous radio waves detected from below the ice in Antarctica. The strange signals emerged during a search for high-energy cosmic particles known as neutrinos, and the signals seemed to defy the laws of physics. The signals came from below the horizon, suggesting they had passed through thousands of miles of rock, but radio waves should have been absorbed by the rock. Follow-up observations have not been able to find the same signals, and larger, more sensitive detectors may be able to solve the mystery. </p>
