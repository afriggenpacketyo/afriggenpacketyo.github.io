          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 07:00:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband defended Chancellor Rachel Reeves' decision to initially cut winter fuel payments for pensioners, and the subsequent partial reversal of that decision. The original cut, affecting over 10 million pensioners, was made to stabilize the economy, but following pressure, the government expanded eligibility to nine million pensioners with lower incomes. Miliband stated that the improved financial situation allowed for the extension, costing around ¬£1.25bn, which will be accounted for in the Budget. Critics argue the U-turn creates complexity and questions the funding source, while supporters emphasize the importance of supporting pensioners during the winter months.</p>

          <p>Marks and Spencer (M&S) has resumed taking online orders after halting purchases in April due to a cyber attack that disrupted its services. Shoppers can now buy fashion items for home delivery in England, Scotland, and Wales, with beauty and homeware products to follow soon. The cyber attack, which affected click and collect and contactless payments, is estimated to impact M&S's profits by around ¬£300m this year. The company has stated that some personal customer data, including telephone numbers and addresses, was stolen during the attack, but no payment or card details were compromised.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gen Z is showing a resurgence in religious engagement, reversing recent trends of declining religious affiliation. Experts attribute this shift to factors such as rebellion against secular parents, a search for community and answers in a turbulent world, and gender dynamics. Catholicism, in particular, is experiencing a rise in young male adherents, potentially driven by a desire for structured environments and traditional roles. The trend suggests a complex interplay of social, political, and personal factors influencing young people's spiritual journeys.</p>

          <p>President Trump has deployed hundreds of Marines to Los Angeles amidst protests against ICE immigration raids, along with additional National Guard troops. California's Governor Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Bass criticize this move as an unnecessary escalation, as Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr. removes all members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, raising concerns among public health experts. In more positive news, U.S. drug-related deaths among young people are declining, potentially due to better health care and increased caution among young people regarding hard drugs. The climate solutions week is highlighted with the example of Earthaven Ecovillage, which weathered Hurricane Helene due to collectivity and sustainable practices.</p>

          <p>Eurostar is planning to launch direct train services from London to Frankfurt and Geneva, aiming to have a fleet of up to 50 new trains operational by the early 2030s. The travel time between London and Frankfurt is estimated to be about five hours, while the journey to Geneva will take around five hours and 20 minutes. This expansion is driven by strong demand for train travel across Europe, despite challenges like higher operational costs and squeezed customer budgets. The firm also plans for the new fleet to service a direct line to Geneva from both Amsterdam and Brussels, with partnerships being developed to facilitate these new routes.</p>

          <p>Despite a quiet offseason compared to the Dodgers' high-profile acquisitions, the San Diego Padres are holding their own in the competitive NL West, currently sitting nine games over .500 and two games out of first place.

While the Padres have faced challenges with injuries and inconsistent performances, they remain confident in their ability to compete and make adjustments as needed.

          <p>Conservative Sen. Josh Hawley plans to introduce legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, aligning with some liberal members of Congress. The "Higher Wages for American Workers Act" would increase the federal standard starting in 2026 and adjust for inflation in subsequent years, with Vermont Democratic Sen. Peter Welch co-sponsoring. Hawley argues that the current minimum wage has failed to keep up with economic realities, while Welch emphasizes the need for a living wage. This move challenges conservative orthodoxy and reflects the party's shift towards populism in the Trump era.</p>

Reasoning models are systems that can execute more complicated tasks through a step-by-step logical thought process, and Mistral's new model "is great at mathematics [and] great at coding."</p>
