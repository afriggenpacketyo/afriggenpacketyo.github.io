          <p>Brandon Russell, the founder of a Florida-based neo-Nazi group, has received a 20-year federal prison sentence for conspiring to attack the power grid in Baltimore, Maryland. The plot, which he planned with his girlfriend, aimed to cause widespread blackouts and societal chaos to advance their white supremacist ideology. During sentencing, the judge described Russell as the "intellectual horsepower" behind the plan to target a majority-Black city. The case highlights ongoing federal efforts to combat right-wing domestic terrorism, a threat that officials have increasingly prioritized.</p>

          <p>Shares of Japanese investment giant SoftBank Group surged by 13% to a record high following a fiscal first-quarter profit report that far exceeded expectations. The company posted a profit of 421.8 billion yen, a significant turnaround from a loss in the same period last year. This strong performance was driven by a $4.8 billion gain in the value of its Vision Funds, the largest such gain since 2021. The positive results were attributed to valuation increases in portfolio companies like Grab and Swiggy, signaling a potential rebound for the influential tech investor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued another nationwide injunction blocking the Trump administration's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants. This marks the fourth time a court has halted the policy, which seeks to deny automatic citizenship to individuals born in the U.S. if their parents are not citizens or permanent residents. The judge certified the lawsuit as a class action, arguing the plaintiffs were likely to win on the grounds that the order violates the 14th Amendment. The ruling ensures the policy remains on hold as legal battles continue.</p>

          <p>Actress Gina Carano has reached a settlement with Disney and Lucasfilm in her lawsuit over being fired from the Star Wars series 'The Mandalorian' in 2021. Carano was dismissed after making controversial social media posts, including one comparing the political climate for Republicans to the persecution of Jews during the Holocaust. She had sued for wrongful termination, with her legal fees funded by Elon Musk. While the terms of the agreement were not disclosed, Lucasfilm released a statement describing Carano as a respected professional and looking forward to potential future work opportunities.</p>

          <p>Gareth Ward, an independent member of the New South Wales parliament, has resigned from his position after being convicted of sexually assaulting two men. The 44-year-old politician, who is in custody awaiting sentencing, quit just moments before parliament was scheduled to vote on his expulsion. Ward had previously launched an unsuccessful legal challenge to block his removal, arguing it was an "affront to democracy." His resignation, which state leaders said should have happened sooner, triggers a by-election for his seat and ends his taxpayer-funded salary.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he will host the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan at the White House for a historic peace summit to formally end their long-running conflict. The meeting is expected to result in the signing of a peace agreement between the two nations, which have been at war for years over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, resulting in thousands of deaths. The Trump administration stated it has been engaged with both sides for some time to broker the deal. This represents a significant diplomatic breakthrough in a protracted and violent regional dispute.</p>

          <p>The Southern Small White butterfly, a species historically found only in Southern Europe, has been officially recorded in the United Kingdom for the first time. A volunteer photographed the butterfly in Suffolk, confirming its rapid northward expansion across the continent, which has seen it move hundreds of kilometers in just over a decade. While a warming climate is believed to be a contributing factor, scientists say the species' migration has been far faster than predicted. The sighting is a notable event for conservationists tracking the impact of environmental changes on wildlife distribution.</p>

The vessel, which features a helideck, a mosaic pool, and a marble fireplace, is being sold via a sealed-bid auction with a starting deposit of $10 million. The seizure and sale are part of a broader U.S. strategy to put financial pressure on Russian elites close to President Vladimir Putin in response to the war in Ukraine.

          <p>A growing number of people, particularly millennials and Gen Z, are moving away from dating apps and seeking romantic connections through old-fashioned, in-person events. Organizers of singles events report a surge in attendance, driven by a widespread fatigue with the impersonal nature of swiping and the potential for misrepresentation online. Many users crave face-to-face interaction and the chance to gauge chemistry in real time. This trend is reflected in the declining market value of companies like Bumble, signaling a potential shift in the modern dating landscape back towards more traditional methods of meeting people.</p>

Haddix pleaded guilty to perjury and obstruction of justice after lying to a judge about the death of a chimpanzee named Tonka, whom she was hiding in her basement to avoid a court order. Tonka, a former celebrity animal actor, was found in a small cage and has since been relocated to a sanctuary. The case, brought to light by animal rights group PETA, exposes the dark side of the exotic animal trade.</p>
