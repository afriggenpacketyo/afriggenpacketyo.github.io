          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.1 billion, marking the fifth-largest prize in the game's history, following a Saturday drawing without a grand prize winner. The winning numbers were 3, 18, 22, 27, and 33, with a Powerball of 17. While nine tickets matched all five white balls, winning $1 million each, no ticket matched all six numbers. The jackpot for Monday night's drawing has an estimated cash value of $498.4 million. The drawing will take place in Tallahassee, Florida, and tickets cost $2 each and are sold in 45 states, as well as in other US territories. (not investment advice)</p>

LSU's Garrett Nussmeier connected with Trey-Dez Green for a touchdown in the fourth quarter, sealing the win. Nussmeier completed 28 of 38 passes for 230 yards, while Clemson's Cade Klubnik struggled with 19-for-38 passing and a non-existent rushing game.

Eduardo Rodriguez of the Diamondbacks pitched effectively, limiting the Dodgers' offense. The Dodgers struggled with runners in scoring position, going 1-for-8 and leaving eight runners on base.</p>

          <p>Justin Sun envisions a "Swift" system for the virtual asset sector, projecting that Tron's facilitated transactions will surpass Swift's within five years. Sun estimates Tron's transaction volume will reach US$8 trillion this year, with potential to increase to US$300-400 trillion. He emphasizes Tron's transaction speed compared to Swift's slower processing times. This confidence reflects Tron's growing influence in stablecoin transactions globally. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the US dollar.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order to protect residents' rights amid concerns of a potential federal agent deployment for immigration enforcement. The order prohibits Chicago police from cooperating with federal authorities on immigration patrols and restricts officers from concealing their identities. Johnson criticized the Trump administration and urged it to refrain from deploying the U.S. Armed Forces in Chicago. The order also directs city departments to provide information on residents' rights and submit FOIA requests to the Department of Homeland Security. White House responded that the mayor should focus on fixing crime in his own city.</p>

Erdinger brewery, a major producer, reports that about a quarter of its production is now non-alcoholic. Bars in Munich are seeing more customers opting for non-alcoholic beverages between alcoholic drinks. Despite the shift, traditional beer culture remains strong in regions like Bavaria.</p>

          <p>Konami has released a remake of Metal Gear Solid 3, titled Metal Gear Solid Delta, a decade after the departure of series creator Hideo Kojima. Kojima left Konami in 2015 after an acrimonious split, leaving the popular game series directionless. Gaming has pivoted towards remakes in recent years, with successful remakes of games like Resident Evil 4 and Final Fantasy VII. Fans of the series say that Metal Gear Solid 3 was chosen for good reason, as it is a prequel set at the beginning of the series timeline.</p>

          <p>Figures suggest that pupils in England who missed school during the first week back in September 2024 were more likely to miss large parts during the rest of the year. More than half of pupils partially absent in week one became "persistently absent" – missing at least 10% of school. By contrast, of pupils who fully attended the first week, 14% became persistently absent. The Education Secretary urged schools and parents to ensure children attend at the start of the 2025 term.</p>
