          <p>Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil giant, Aramco, announced a 5% decrease in net profit for the first quarter of 2025, primarily attributed to lower crude oil prices and reduced production. Despite the drop, net income reached $26 billion, surpassing analyst expectations. The company's free cash flow also decreased to $19.2 billion from $22.8 billion in the same period last year, reflecting the impact of market fluctuations on the world's largest oil producer. Aramco continues to navigate a volatile energy market influenced by global economic factors and geopolitical events.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly directing its energy investments in Africa towards renewable energy projects, with solar and wind power now constituting 59% of its energy projects on the continent. Between 2010 and 2024, China invested $66 billion in Africa's energy sector, with the continent becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology. This shift aligns with global trends indicating China's move away from fossil fuels towards renewables, driven by Africa's growing energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production.</p>
