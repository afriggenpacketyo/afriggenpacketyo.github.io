          <p>Journalism, after a second-place finish at the Kentucky Derby, claimed victory at the 150th Preakness Stakes in Baltimore.

          <p>A BBC series, "Change Your Mind, Change Your Life," follows 12 individuals undergoing therapy to address mental health challenges. The article highlights three cases: Nicole, who overcomes anxiety through self-compassion; James, who redefines his self-worth after a stroke; and Anjalee, who processes childhood trauma after her mother's death. Therapists employ cognitive behavioral therapy and other techniques to help patients understand and manage their minds, leading to significant life changes. The series underscores the potential of talking therapies to improve mental well-being, although research indicates that they are not universally effective.</p>
