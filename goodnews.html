        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The American Federation of Teachers is partnering with tech giants Anthropic, Microsoft, and OpenAI to launch a $23 million AI training academy for educators. The initiative aims to help teachers harness artificial intelligence safely and ethically in the classroom, rather than being replaced by it. Starting this fall, the academy will offer free virtual training to the union's 1.8 million members, with the goal of training 400,000 educators in person over five years. This collaboration seeks to keep teachers in control of how AI is implemented in schools, enhancing learning while addressing concerns about the technology.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's autonomous vehicle company, Waymo, has launched a new program allowing teenagers aged 14 to 17 to hail driverless rides. The service, which debuted in Phoenix, lets parents invite their teens to the platform through their own accounts, which enables trip monitoring and receipt management. The expansion aims to increase ridership and includes safety features like specially-trained support agents who can assist during a teen's ride. Waymo's move follows a similar offering from Uber and comes as the company continues its expansion into major U.S. cities.</p>

          <p>In his advice column, James Parker responds to a 19-year-old reader expressing a fear of dying alone. The columnist validates the fear as a legitimate part of the human condition, especially for the reader's generation. He then reframes the concept of isolation by emphasizing autonomy and the profound, often unseen, connections between people. The advice encourages the reader to embrace life, make decisions they are proud of, and trust that people will show up for them, offering a message of strength and hope.</p>

          <p>World number one Aryna Sabalenka fought back to win a grueling three-set match against German veteran Laura Siegemund, securing her spot in the Wimbledon semi-finals. Siegemund's unconventional style, featuring slices and drop shots, drove Sabalenka to distraction and pushed her to the brink of elimination. However, Sabalenka showed immense grit to overcome the challenge, winning 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 after nearly three hours. She will now face American Amanda Anisimova for a place in her first Wimbledon final.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for two top Taliban leaders, Supreme Leader Haibatullah Akhundzada and chief justice Abdul Hakim Haqqani. The court cited "reasonable grounds" to believe they have committed the crime against humanity of persecution based on gender, specifically targeting women and girls in Afghanistan since their 2021 takeover. The Taliban, which does not recognize the ICC's authority, called the warrants a "clear act of hostility." The move was welcomed by human rights groups as a step toward justice.</p>

          <p>The Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo activist group announced the identification of the 140th person stolen as a baby during Argentina's 1976-1983 military dictatorship. The 48-year-old man, whose identity was confirmed via DNA testing, was born in a clandestine detention center to activist parents who were forcibly "disappeared" by the regime. This marks another significant breakthrough in the decades-long effort to find the nearly 500 infants believed to have been taken from their parents and given to families loyal to the dictatorship.</p>

          <h2>Economic Anxiety Fuels 'Revenge Saving' Trend Among Americans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 12:38:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a new survey, feelings of economic anxiety are driving a trend of "vibe-based budgeting," particularly among younger Americans. This has led to a cultural shift from post-pandemic "revenge spending" to a new phenomenon known as "revenge saving." Many people are now aggressively building their savings and emergency funds in response to worries about inflation and a potential recession. Financial experts recommend channeling this motivation into intentional habits like reverse budgeting and automating savings to build long-term financial security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that GE Vernova's stock still has significant room for growth, despite its recent strong rally. His view is supported by a BMO Capital note that raised its price target for the company, highlighting nearly $80 billion in future service-related revenue that is shielded from market volatility in turbine equipment demand. Cramer believes that overlooked factors, including potential overseas orders and favorable accounting changes in new legislation, could continue to drive the stock's value higher.

          <p>A recently signed budget bill introduces "Trump accounts," a new type of government-seeded investment vehicle for children.

Parents and employers can make additional annual contributions. While financial experts call the initial grant a "no-brainer," they advise families to compare the accounts' tax implications with those of existing vehicles like 529 plans and Roth IRAs for specific long-term goals.

          <p>A top White House economic advisor, Stephen Miran, has dismissed concerns that President Trump's tariffs will lead to significant price increases, likening the odds to rare events such as "pandemics or meteors." He argued that there is currently no evidence of broad inflation resulting from the trade policies. However, many economists contend that price hikes are still likely, attributing the current stability to implementation delays, the time lag between policy and market impact, and proactive stockpiling by companies.
