          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the British Grand Prix in a dramatic qualifying session, narrowly beating McLaren's Oscar Piastri by just over a tenth of a second. Piastri's teammate, Lando Norris, secured third place, with Mercedes' George Russell finishing fourth, promising a competitive race. Verstappen noted the windy conditions made qualifying tricky and required full commitment in the high-speed corners at Silverstone. The result sets the stage for an exciting battle among the top drivers at the halfway point of the Formula 1 season.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as the most significant event in world history since the birth of Christ, as it introduced the concept of the citizen. He emphasized that the nation was born from deep division, viewing the period as a civil war, and suggested that understanding this complexity makes the founders' achievements more inspiring. Burns argued that the U.S. is held together by the words of its founding documents, which require active, educated citizenship to sustain the republic amid modern-day turmoil and distrust.</p>

          <p>AI cloud provider CoreWeave has become the first to roll out Nvidia's highly anticipated GB300 NVL72, a powerful liquid-cooled AI system designed for training advanced models. This move signals CoreWeave's aggressive push to compete with larger cloud providers in the AI infrastructure race, causing its stock to jump 9%. The system utilizes Nvidia's new Blackwell chips, offering significant performance gains over previous generations. The deployment confirms that Nvidia's next-generation technology is now operational in real-world data centers, benefiting partners like Dell and Supermicro. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actress Charlize Theron recently shared her decision to raise her children as a single mother, citing her own upbringing and past relationship dynamics as key factors. Theron explained that growing up in a family with alcoholism and a tendency to lose herself in relationships led her to realize she was not equipped to have children with a partner. Relationship experts support her choice, viewing it as a sign of self-awareness and strength. They note that choosing to be single can be a powerful act of aligning with one's own needs and capabilities.</p>

          <h2>Can the Viral 'Cortisol Cocktail' Actually Reduce Stress? Doctors Are Skeptical</h2>

          <p>A so-called "cortisol cocktail" has gone viral on social media, with proponents claiming the non-alcoholic drink can lower the body's primary stress hormone. The beverage typically combines coconut water, citrus juice, magnesium powder, and sea salt. However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence that these ingredients can reduce cortisol levels. While the drink is generally harmless and can aid hydration, doctors note that managing stress effectively relies on proven methods like adequate sleep, exercise, and maintaining strong social connections, not unproven online trends.</p>

          <p>A prototype of the MingKwai Chinese typewriter, invented by linguist Lin Yutang in the 1940s and long thought to be lost, has been discovered and acquired by Stanford University. The machine is a landmark in computing history, as its innovative design for inputting complex Chinese characters laid the groundwork for modern East Asian computing. Instead of phonetics, the typewriter organizes characters by their shapes, a concept that underlies how Chinese, Japanese, and Korean are typed today. The discovery has generated excitement among scholars studying the intersection of language, politics, and technology.</p>

Officials, including Mayor Anne Hidalgo, assured the public that the water now meets safety standards on most days. The event marks the fulfillment of a promise first made in 1988 and is seen as a moment of pride for the city.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Oregon State University's Chapple Big Fish Lab are studying sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay to better understand marine ecosystems and change negative public perceptions of the creatures. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the team examines the stomach contents of sharks to assess their health, which serves as an indicator of the overall health of the ocean. By showcasing the vital role sharks play, the researchers hope to generate more support for their conservation. The work highlights how these apex predators are essential for maintaining a balanced marine environment.</p>

          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google executive and happiness researcher, advocates for a "90-second rule" to better manage anger and stress. The concept, based on neuroscientist Jill Bolte Taylor's findings, suggests that the physiological response to an emotional trigger, like a rush of cortisol, lasts only about 90 seconds. After this period, any lingering feeling is a result of consciously or unconsciously re-running the thought. Gawdat advises allowing oneself this brief window to feel upset before making a conscious choice to shift focus and move forward.</p>

          <p>Inspired by the hobby-centric culture of Denmark, a business school professor embarked on a year-long experiment of trying 17 different hobbies, from woodworking to mahjong. She found that the experience fundamentally changed her life, helping her kick a doomscrolling habit, feel less lonely, and build deeper connections with others. The author argues that hobbies are not a reward for achieving work-life balance, but rather the secret to creating it. By pursuing activities for creativity, mental stimulation, and physical fitness, she was forced to define her boundaries and felt more confident.</p>

This figure is more than double that of the second-place state, North Carolina. The state's appeal is largely attributed to its tax-friendly policies, including no state income, estate, or inheritance tax, which makes it financially advantageous for seniors. Despite a high cost of living, Florida's sunny weather and abundant recreational opportunities continue to draw a significant number of retirees.</p>
