          <p>A mechanic in Minnesota discovered a wallet that had been lost 11 years ago by a Ford assembly plant worker in Michigan. The wallet, which had slipped into the airbox of a 2015 Ford Edge during its assembly in 2014, was found when the mechanic was performing repairs. After finding the owner's employee ID, the mechanic used Facebook to locate the retired autoworker, Richard Guilford, and mailed the wallet back to him. Inside, Guilford found his original $15 cash and, remarkably, $250 in Cabela's gift cards that the store confirmed are still valid.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers are reportedly developing a hypersonic drone carrier featuring an innovative 'scissor wing' design, a concept once explored by NASA. The aircraft's single, centrally mounted wing can rotate up to 90 degrees during flight to optimize performance across different speeds. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, pivots to 45 degrees at transonic speeds to reduce drag, and aligns parallel to the fuselage at hypersonic speeds, turning the entire aircraft into a high-efficiency 'waverider'. This adaptable design aims to solve the classic aerospace challenge of balancing low-speed lift with high-speed efficiency.</p>

          <h2>Couples Therapist Explains Five Psychological Reasons People Engage in Extramarital Affairs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 21:35:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An executive counselor and couples' therapist outlines five common psychological factors that can lead individuals to risk their careers and families for an affair. These reasons include a lifetime of repressing personal desires to always be 'good,' the burnout from perfectionism often rooted in childhood trauma, and having poor personal boundaries from being parentified as a child. Additionally, being in an abusive or emotionally withholding marriage can make an affair seem like a reprieve or an escape route. Finally, a recent significant loss, such as the death of a parent, can trigger a re-evaluation of life priorities and make boundaries more permeable.</p>

          <p>A former software CEO has completed a five-year, multi-million-pound renovation of Thorne Island, a derelict 19th-century Napoleonic fort off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales. Mike Conner purchased the abandoned property for £555,000 in 2017 and has since transformed it into a luxury retreat with 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and a nightclub. The challenging project required bringing in all materials by helicopter and installing modern utilities, including running water, which had been absent for 17 years. The historic, bomb-proof fortress, now valued at £3 million, is back on the market, ready for a new owner to host events or develop it further.</p>

          <p>As UK families face rising food prices, parents are employing meticulous planning and creative cooking to manage their budgets during the six-week school summer holidays. Some strategies include stocking freezers with 'yellow sticker' reduced-price items, batch cooking meals, and organizing the fridge to ensure food with the nearest use-by date is used first. Other tactics involve portioning out snacks into daily bags to prevent them from being eaten all at once. Charities report a significant increase in demand for food aid, highlighting the financial pressure many households are under as they provide extra meals for children at home.</p>

          <p>Hollywood Forever Cemetery, a famous final resting place for Hollywood legends, has unveiled a new five-story vertical mausoleum to address the premium on space in Los Angeles. The Gower Mausoleum, which opened in January, provides permanent housing for approximately 13,000 people and towers over the historic grounds. Designed to be a welcoming space, it features soothing marble, natural light, and views of L.A. landmarks. The cemetery has evolved into a cultural hub, hosting movie nights, festivals, and yoga, and this vertical expansion allows it to continue serving the community's needs while preserving its unique character.</p>

          <p>A group of GCSE students in the UK have opened time capsule letters they wrote to their future selves four years ago, just as they were returning to school after a COVID-19 lockdown. The letters, written when they were 11, reveal their anxieties about the pandemic and their hopes for the future, with questions ranging from whether they would still need face masks to if they had found a girlfriend. The exercise was organized by a teacher to instill confidence during a disrupted and isolating period. Now 16, the students reflected on their journey through a secondary education shaped entirely by the pandemic.</p>

          <p>Twenty-year-old British heavyweight boxer Moses Itauma secured a decisive victory over veteran Dillian Whyte, stopping him in the first round of their bout. Itauma sent the 37-year-old Whyte to the canvas with a powerful right hand, and although Whyte beat the count, the referee waved off the fight just 119 seconds in. The win extends Itauma's undefeated professional record to 13-0, with 11 of those victories coming by knockout. The impressive performance in his first headlining event further solidifies his reputation as a major rising star in the heavyweight division and positions him for a potential title shot within the next year.</p>

          <p>A new generation of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding globally, offering authentic, diverse regional cuisines far beyond the Westernized staples of the past. Brands specializing in fiery Hunan dishes, savory Zhejiang seafood, and other regional specialties are using multicultural hubs like Singapore as a launchpad for global expansion. This culinary wave is driven by intense competition in China's domestic market and aims to correct stereotypes about Chinese food by showcasing its sophistication and diversity. Some observers suggest this gastronomic expansion could serve as a form of 'ping-pong diplomacy,' improving China's international image through its rich culinary culture.</p>

          <p>A new box set titled "Sunset Boulevard" documents the final burst of studio creativity from Elvis Presley between 1972 and 1975, a period marked by personal turmoil and professional disappointment. The collection includes hits like "Burning Love" and soulful ballads such as "Separate Ways," recorded as his marriage to Priscilla Presley was ending. This era also saw Presley nearly cast in the 1976 remake of "A Star Is Born," a role that ultimately went to Kris Kristofferson. Longtime friend Jerry Schilling believes that losing this opportunity marked a turning point that contributed to the decline preceding Presley's death in 1977.</p>

The victory earns Robertson a £500,000 prize and moves him to third in the world rankings.

Robertson described the victory, secured against one of the sport's all-time greats, as potentially surpassing his World Championship win due to the personal and professional challenges he has had to overcome.</p>

          <h2>Billionaire Charlie Munger Advocated for Self-Insurance for the Wealthy</h2>

          <p>The late Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman, Charlie Munger, revealed that once he became wealthy, he stopped carrying insurance for risks he could afford to cover himself, such as fire insurance on his homes. He argued that it was illogical to pay premiums and deal with the claims process for losses that would not significantly impact his finances. Munger believed that intelligent people should self-insure against manageable risks, thereby avoiding the costs associated with the insurance system, including fraud committed by others. He acknowledged this stance was ironic given Berkshire Hathaway's large insurance holdings. (not investment advice)</p>
