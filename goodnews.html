          <p>President Trump signaled a willingness to lower tariffs on China, citing the current high levies as detrimental to trade between the two nations.

          <p>The New York Times examines the potential of retrofitting underused single-family homes into "roommate houses" or adding backyard cottages to address the affordable housing crisis. A developer in Dallas, Monte Anderson, has converted his own home into four studio apartments, highlighting the possibility of creating more housing units within existing neighborhoods. The article discusses how changing demographics and housing mismatches have led to older people living in large, empty homes while single adults seek smaller, more affordable options. Cities and states are increasingly encouraging these types of conversions to add housing without disrupting existing neighborhoods, offering a potential solution to the housing shortage.</p>
