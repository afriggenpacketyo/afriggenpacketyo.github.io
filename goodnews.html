          <p>A magnitude 3.0 earthquake occurred Saturday night, with its epicenter located near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. The quake, which originated about 10 kilometers below the surface, caused brief shaking that was felt across parts of the New York City metropolitan area. The U.S. Geological Survey confirmed the seismic event, and there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries. The article notes that this is a developing story with updates to follow as more information becomes available.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the Beijing Institute of Technology claim to have developed a sophisticated electronic warfare system using a swarm of drones. This technology can reportedly create a protective 'storm eye' for friendly forces by precisely canceling out jamming signals at their location. By adjusting signal properties like waveform and amplitude, the drones can simultaneously jam enemy communications while ensuring allied communications remain clear. This targeted approach marks a significant advancement over traditional brute-force jamming methods that disrupt all signals, including those of friendly troops, within a given range.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the 25-year-old wife of a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, has been released from ICE custody after being detained for two months in Louisiana. She was arrested in May during what she believed was a routine green card application interview, leaving behind her husband and two young children, one of whom was an infant she was still breastfeeding. Her detention stemmed from a 2018 deportation order she was unaware of, issued after her mother, who had abandoned her as a teen, missed an immigration hearing. Her case highlights the Trump administration's stricter immigration enforcement policies, even for military families.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's anti-corruption agencies have arrested a member of parliament and several other officials in connection with a large-scale bribery scheme involving the procurement of military drones and electronic warfare systems. The scheme allegedly involved signing state contracts with suppliers at prices inflated by as much as 30%. President Volodymyr Zelensky affirmed a 'zero tolerance' policy for corruption, praising the agencies for their work. The arrests come shortly after the independence of these anti-corruption bodies was restored following public protests against a bill that would have limited their power.</p>

          <p>Marking its tenth anniversary, this article traces Ethereum's evolution from a fledgling concept to a foundational layer of the modern financial system, now supporting a massive digital economy. It highlights how the platform, originally a radical idea for programmable money, now underpins trillions in payments through stablecoins and supports tokenized assets for major institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin reflects on the growth, while industry leaders explain how Ethereum is becoming the essential 'plumbing' for Wall Street, offering greater speed and efficiency than legacy systems.

          <h2>Appeals Court Upholds Most Restrictions on Immigration Raids in Los Angeles</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts how immigration agents can conduct 'roving' raids in the Los Angeles area. The decision affirmed that federal agents must have reasonable suspicion before detaining someone and cannot base arrests solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The case stemmed from controversial raids by the Trump administration that sparked protests and widespread fear. The 9th Circuit panel agreed that such factors create a broad profile that does not justify a specific stop, protecting individuals from unreasonable seizures under the 4th Amendment.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana are establishing a new left-wing political party but have yet to decide on a name. The pair claims over 600,000 people have registered as supporters and are inviting them to help choose a name, with 'The Left' or 'Left Party' being suggested by Sultana. The new entity cannot field candidates until it registers an official name with the Electoral Commission, which has strict rules to prevent confusion with existing parties. Political experts note the importance of a strong, modern brand name in today's digital political landscape.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have officially centered their franchise around Luka Doncic, signing the 26-year-old star to a three-year, $165 million contract extension. During the announcement, team management emphasized their commitment to supporting Doncic's inner circle, a pointed reference to his past tensions with the Dallas Mavericks. This move solidifies Doncic as the team's future, intensifying questions about the role of LeBron James, who is under contract for only one more season. With James' camp having previously expressed a desire to evaluate his options, the Lakers' definitive pivot to Doncic creates an uncertain dynamic for the aging superstar.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has revealed that the early death of his stepfather inspired him to leave his career as a doctor and pursue entertainment. In an interview, Hill explained that his stepfather passed away at 54, before he could enjoy retirement, which made him realize he didn't want the same fate. Having qualified as a doctor in 1988, Hill felt he was unsuited for medicine, recalling an instance where he felt 'completely out of my depth' breaking tragic news to a patient. This personal loss, he said, gave him the freedom to pivot to comedy in the early 1990s.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a key advocate for open-source AI with its Llama models, has indicated it will be more 'careful' with its open-source strategy in the future. This shift in stance contrasts with China's accelerated development in the open-source AI space, where companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI have recently launched advanced models. Renowned computer scientist Andrew Ng noted that while top proprietary models are still from U.S. labs, the leading open-source models are now predominantly from China. This competitive pressure appears to be influencing Meta's approach to sharing its powerful AI technology freely.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have likely solved the 80-year-old mystery of what killed 'Winston,' a platypus sent as a gift to UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill from Australia in 1943. For decades, it was rumored the creature died from shell-shock after its ship encountered a German U-boat. However, archival research by students at Monash University and the Australian Museum uncovered the ship's logs, revealing the real culprit was likely the heat. Records show that as the ship crossed the equator, water and air temperatures soared well above the safe threshold for a platypus, suggesting the animal essentially overheated on its long journey.</p>

According to the global theme park association IAAPA, these attractions serve as significant economic drivers for local economies. The article suggests that for every yuan of operating revenue generated by a theme park, it creates a ripple effect of 3.8 yuan in the surrounding community.</p>
