        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's proclamation that sought to bar Harvard University's international students from entering the country. Judge Allison Burroughs issued a temporary restraining order, stating the policy risks causing "immediate and irreparable injury." Harvard refiled a lawsuit to block the proclamation, arguing it violates the First Amendment and misuses federal law, calling it a "government vendetta" rather than a national security measure. The proclamation also directed the secretary of state to consider revoking the visas of foreign students already in the U.S. to study at Harvard.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the growing trend of food products with fewer ingredients, driven by concerns over ultra-processed foods. While some consumers seek simpler ingredient lists, nutritionists caution against sacrificing essential nutrients. The debate raises questions about whether the public has been misled about the health implications of processed foods. Food brands are responding by simplifying formulas and exploring new processing technologies, but the higher costs may lead to premium pricing and marketing strategies.</p>

          <p>China has tested core components of quantum-based network in space to assess their durability for building a secure space-ground communication system. The test involved a laser module and phase encoding device on a rocket flight to 2.5km, evaluating resistance to vibration and radiation. This marks a key step toward constructing a quantum secure direct communication network. The technology aims to provide ultra-secure communications without encryption keys.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles is warning against online vehicle registration scams. Deceptive social media ads are offering discounted renewal services, asking for personal information and payment through unofficial channels. The DMV emphasizes that it will never ask for personal information or payment through social media or transaction applications. Residents are advised to renew their vehicle registration directly through the official DMV website, at a DMV kiosk, or by making an appointment at a DMV office.</p>

          <p>Handwritten notes reveal Winston Churchill's concern over slow progress securing penicillin supplies before D-Day. Despite penicillin being a British discovery, the UK lagged behind the US in production, frustrating Churchill. The documents highlight the critical importance of penicillin in treating expected casualties from the Normandy landings. While sufficient supplies were eventually obtained, the medicine remained unavailable to the general public until 1946.</p>
