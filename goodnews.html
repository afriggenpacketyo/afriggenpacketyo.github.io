The pair were fired after Trump's reelection and aim to fill a void left by the purge of veteran prosecutors from the Public Integrity section, offering services to local and state governments to investigate public corruption. This article details their commitment to impartially and independently provide advice, believing corruption harms communities. The former prosecutors are also challenging their firings as unlawful, filing complaints with the Merit System Protections Board, asserting that civil servants should not be terminated for doing their jobs.</p>

          <p>The UK's inflation rate remained static at 3.8% in September, below the expected 4% mark, offering Chancellor Rachel Reeves potential fiscal space. Economists suggest a downward trend is likely, with significant falls anticipated in the spring, despite current levels being higher than other G7 countries. This article highlights that the International Monetary Fund still forecasts a return to the 2% target by the end of next year, and retail experts believe food price inflation has peaked. The more benign inflation outlook has led to a reassessment in markets, with UK government debt interest rates falling sharply, potentially saving billions in the upcoming Budget calculations.

          <p>Liverpool secured an emphatic 5-1 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt in the Champions League, showcasing manager Arne Slot's bold tactical changes despite recent losses. The decision to start Alexander Isak alongside Huge Ekitike paid off, with Ekitike scoring, though Isak suffered a groin injury in the first half, adding to another injury for Jeremie Frimpong. This article highlights the team's improved performance and effective high-pressing football in the second half, with five different players scoring. Despite defensive frailties still being evident, the match provided a glimpse of a potential long-term system for Slot and demonstrated the team's ability to perform without star player Mohamed Salah, raising questions about his future role.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur secured a goalless draw against Monaco in the Champions League, largely due to an exceptional performance from goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario, despite a dismal team display. The article notes Spurs managed only two shots on target and appeared to settle for a draw after surviving numerous scares, much to the frustration of their traveling supporters. This result extends their unbeaten record to three games in the competition, but manager Thomas Frank's side will need significant improvement to make a serious dent in Europe's elite tournament. Vicario's crucial saves were highlighted as the primary reason for earning a point in an otherwise unambitious effort, offering little hope for future performances.</p>

          <p>This article highlights a striking policy divide between the U.S. and China on climate change, contrasting President Trump's dismissal of the issue with President Xi Jinping's unveiling of ambitious strategies. China aims to cut emissions by 7-10% from peak levels by 2035 and increase non-fossil fuels in its energy mix to over 30%, focusing on wind and solar power. Driven by data on rising climate risks like floods and heatwaves, Beijing is re-engineering urban landscapes with an emphasis on resilience. The article suggests that China's transformation towards green and low-carbon energy makes economic sense, positioning it as a leader in addressing global climate challenges while urging the international community to "stay focused on the right direction."</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines posted a surprise profit for the third quarter, exceeding earnings estimates, and forecasts record revenue for the final three months of the year. This positive outlook is attributed to strong travel demand and higher fares, with unit revenue expected to rise by 1% to 3% for the fourth quarter. Despite cutting its full-year profit forecast earlier in the year, Southwest reaffirmed that outlook, signaling confidence in its current trajectory. The airline is also implementing strategic changes, such as abandoning its longtime open seating policy, to boost sales and better compete with rivals, with initial sales impact expected in the first quarter.

          <p>Meta is laying off approximately 600 employees from its artificial intelligence unit as part of an effort to reduce layers and operate more nimbly. The cuts, announced by Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang, impact various AI infrastructure and product-related positions, but spared top-tier AI hires in TBD Labs, underscoring CEO Mark Zuckerberg's bet on new talent. This article explains that the AI unit was considered "bloated," with teams often vying for computing resources, and the layoffs aim to streamline the department and consolidate Wang's leadership. Meta has been aggressively overhauling its AI approach, pouring billions into infrastructure and recruitment to keep pace with rivals like OpenAI and Google.</p>
