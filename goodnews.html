          <p>Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, is reportedly seeking to raise $15 billion to $20 billion in a private placement, which could value the crypto company at approximately $500 billion. This ambitious valuation would place Tether alongside major private tech firms like OpenAI and SpaceX. The move comes as Tether plans a return to the U.S. market, launching a new regulated token, USAT, for businesses and institutions. Talks are in early stages, so details may change, but the company is advancing its U.S. presence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A wave of protests across Asia, notably in Nepal, Indonesia, and the Philippines, is being driven by Generation Z, who are angered by perceived corruption and social inequality. These young activists, inspired by regional movements, are leveraging social media and AI tools to organize and amplify their calls for change. While governments warn of escalating violence, protesters like Aditya in Nepal believe this marks a new era of youth-driven activism. The movements highlight deep discontent over lack of opportunities and "nepo kids."</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass announced that her administration has successfully averted over 1,600 projected city worker layoffs, initially threatened by a $1 billion budget shortfall. This achievement follows months of negotiations and agreements with various city unions, including the L.A. City Coalition of Unions, which accepted up to five unpaid holidays in 2026. Cost-cutting measures, such as scaled-back hiring in the LAPD and fire department, along with reassigning employees to open positions, contributed to saving these jobs.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball announced that players will be able to challenge called balls and strikes starting in the 2026 season, utilizing an automated strike zone system (ABS). Each team will receive two challenges per game, retaining a challenge if the call is overturned. This system, refined through years of minor league testing and spring training, aims to balance umpire's role with accuracy, adding approximately 14 seconds per challenge. The decision reflects a player preference for challenges over a fully automated system, preserving the human element.</p>

While Canada has previously seen an influx of H-1B holders, challenges remain in its immigration system and wage structures compared to the U.S. The article notes that a 2023 Canadian program for H-1B holders quickly reached its 10,000-person cap.
