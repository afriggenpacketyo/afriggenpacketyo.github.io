          <p>The defense ministers of Japan and the Philippines have agreed to enhance cooperation between their armed forces in response to China's growing maritime assertiveness in the East and South China Seas.

          <p>The 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, commencing on Sunday, is expected to have a higher-than-usual number of storms, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Forecasters anticipate a 60% likelihood of 13 to 19 named storms, with six to ten developing into hurricanes, and three to five intensifying into major hurricanes. The article provides a list of the names designated for the 2025 hurricanes, which are rotated annually by the World Meteorological Organization, and explains the rationale behind naming storms to improve communication and preparedness. This year's list includes Andrea, Barry, Chantal, and other names, and the article also mentions the practice of retiring names of particularly devastating storms.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Anti-poverty organizers Rev Dr Liz Theoharis and Noam Sandweiss-Back argue that amidst proposed legislative cuts targeting Medicaid and SNAP, a new social contract is needed to uplift those at the bottom of society. Drawing lessons from past poor people's movements, including the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO), they emphasize the importance of grassroots organizing, solidarity, and addressing the root causes of poverty. The authors highlight the NWRO's innovative projects of survival and their demand for a guaranteed adequate income as a precursor to the expanded child tax credit. They advocate for the Johnnie Tillmon model, which recognizes the transformational power of the poor when united and supported, and suggest that this approach is crucial for preventing democratic decline and overcoming bigotry.</p>

Despite facing challenges such as a change in management and uncertainty regarding ownership, the team has achieved remarkable success, leading the Western Conference and remaining unbeaten in fifteen games. The Whitecaps' success has fueled a surge in nationalistic sentiment and community support, with efforts underway to secure a new downtown venue and attract new ownership to keep the team in Vancouver.

          <p>An excerpt from Sam Tanenhaus's biography of William F. Buckley Jr. explores the conservative intellectual's significance in American political and intellectual life. Buckley, the architect of the modern conservative movement, was also an author, editor, and media pioneer. The article discusses Buckley's intellectual roots, his complex relationship with Ronald Reagan, and his views on populism. While Buckley failed to articulate a serious coherent conservative philosophy, he was a gifted enactor of political ideas as a writer, debater, and candidate for mayor of New York in 1965.</p>

          <p>An established axiom of American elections, "The Republicans should pray for rain", is being challenged as stricter voting laws no longer provide an advantage to the Republican party. While historically lower voter turnout has benefited Republicans, recent trends indicate that stricter voting laws are not as effective in suppressing turnout among Democratic-leaning voters. The changing demographics and increased mobilization efforts by Democrats have altered the electoral landscape, and the article suggests that Republicans may need to reconsider their strategies for voter engagement.</p>
