          <p>During a game between the Chicago Sky and the Los Angeles Sparks, Angel Reese and Rickea Jackson were involved in a physical altercation in the first quarter. The incident began when Jackson and Sky player Rebecca Allen got tangled up while vying for a loose ball, leading to a double technical foul. Reese intervened, pushing Jackson away from her teammate, which resulted in Jackson pushing back, prompting Kelsey Plum to step in and diffuse the situation. Despite the altercation, Reese and Jackson were seen hugging after the game, which Chicago won 97-86, with Reese recording a double-double. The Sky improved to 4-10 on the season, while the Sparks fell to 4-11.</p>

          <p>A severe heat wave is impacting a large portion of the United States, particularly the eastern regions, with temperatures soaring 10-20 degrees above average. The heat index, or "feels like" temperature, is expected to reach as high as 110 degrees Fahrenheit in some areas. Over 125 million Americans are under heat alerts, marking one of the most extensive heat alert events in history. The National Weather Service attributes the heat wave to a heat dome, which traps heat and humidity, and experts warn that the early heat waves of the season are especially dangerous as bodies have not yet acclimatized. A cold front is expected to bring rain and cooler temperatures to the Midwest, Eastern Seaboard, and Southeast, offering some relief by the end of the week.</p>

Wood hopes his achievement will inspire others, especially those living with limb loss, to challenge their perceived limitations. Wood, who sustained his injuries in 2009 at the age of 18, plans to visit the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum to pay his respects to the victims of the atomic bombing, reflecting on his own experiences as a result of war.</p>

          <p>Tesla's car sales in Europe have experienced a fifth consecutive month of decline in May, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. Sales fell by 27.9% year-on-year to 13,863 units, resulting in a drop in market share from 1.8% to 1.2%. This decline is attributed to increasing competition from cheaper Chinese electric vehicles, which have seen a significant rise in market share.

          <p>Amazon is leveraging artificial intelligence to transform its online grocery business, aiming to increase profitability in a traditionally low-margin sector. The company sees consumer packaged goods, including groceries, as its largest growth opportunity, with online sales representing only 15% of the total market. Amazon plans to use AI to improve logistics, demand forecasting, inventory placement, and robotics efficiency, which will speed up delivery times and cut costs. The expansion of same-day and next-day delivery to smaller cities and rural communities is expected to further drive growth in the everyday essentials category. (not investment advice)</p>

A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore millions of dollars in UC grants and has approved the case as a class-action suit, opening it to UC researchers statewide. The judge determined that the federal government engaged in "quintessential viewpoint discrimination" when it rescinded funding to researchers at UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco. The lawsuit is one of dozens filed against the Trump administration over grant terminations, but one of the few to come directly from researchers.</p>

          <p>Geneticist Marlena Fejzo's research has provided a scientific answer to why some pregnant people experience more severe morning sickness than others. After experiencing debilitating hyperemesis gravidarum herself, Fejzo embarked on a DIY inquiry, posting an online survey that revealed a potential genetic link. The research has led to a biological cause and potential cures for pregnancy nausea, marking a significant advancement in understanding and treating the condition.

          <h2>US Judge Sides With AI Firm Anthropic Over Copyright Issue</h2>

          <p>A US judge has ruled that using books to train artificial intelligence (AI) software is not a violation of US copyright law. The decision came out of a lawsuit brought last year against AI firm Anthropic by three authors, including best-selling mystery thriller writer Andrea Bartz, who accused it of stealing her work to train its Claude AI model and build a multi-billion dollar business. But he rejected Anthropic's request to dismiss the case, ruling the firm would have to stand trial over its use of pirated copies to build its library of material. The ruling is among the first to weigh in on a question that is the subject of numerous legal battles across the industry - how Large Language Models (LLMs) can legitimately learn from existing material.</p>
