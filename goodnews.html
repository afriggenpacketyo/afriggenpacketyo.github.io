          <p>Following a rock fall and glacier collapse in the Swiss L√∂tschental valley, officials reported that the situation had eased as the Lonza River found new paths downstream, reducing flood risk. Construction machinery is being used to manage water runoff. The village of Blatten, buried by the landslide, will be rebuilt. Heat and forecasted rain could still increase the risk of further landslides, requiring residents to stay alert, but officials expressed relief that the immediate danger had passed, allowing for continued monitoring and mitigation efforts.</p>

          <p>Defence Secretary John Healey expects UK defence spending to rise to 3% of GDP by 2034, with the government set to unveil its major strategic defence review. The review, based on the assumption that the 3% target is the trajectory spending will follow, will warn of a new era of threat and recommend the deployment of new digital experts alongside troops. The review comes as other government departments are still negotiating how much they will have to spend over the next three years. The defence ministry said on Saturday that more than ¬£1.5bn in additional funding will spent on improving military homes as part of the government's review.</p>

          <p>India's highest ranking general said that India switched tactics after suffering losses in the air on the first day of conflict with Pakistan earlier this month and established a decisive advantage before the neighbors announced a ceasefire three days later. General Anil Chauhan said that India suffered initial losses in the air, but declined to give details. He said that they rectified tactics and then went back on the 7th, 8th and 10th in large numbers to hit air bases deep inside Pakistan, penetrated all their air defenses with impunity, carried out precision strikes. Chauhan, and Pakistan's chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen. Sahir Shamshad Mirza, have both said there was no danger at any time during the conflict that nuclear weapons were considered.</p>
