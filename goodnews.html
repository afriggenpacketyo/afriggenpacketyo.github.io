          <p>In a period of heightened market volatility, an Invesco senior portfolio manager recommends that risk-averse investors consider income funds utilizing options-based strategies. These funds are designed to offer more structural protection against downside risk and can provide income that is not sensitive to interest rate changes. The manager suggests this approach is advantageous as the Federal Reserve is expected to begin a rate-cutting cycle, making income sources independent of Fed policy increasingly valuable.

          <p>The race for governor in New Jersey is becoming increasingly competitive, with recent polls showing Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli closing the gap on his Democratic opponent, Rep. Mikie Sherrill. Ciattarelli expresses confidence, citing strong voter energy and key endorsements, while Sherrill's campaign brings in high-profile Democratic surrogates to mobilize support. The election is viewed as a key political barometer and a referendum on President Trump's second term, with both parties investing heavily in one of only two gubernatorial contests this year.</p>

The strategies include submitting rough drafts to invite early input, reinforcing the boss's authority with specific phrasing, and proactively oversharing information to satisfy their need for oversight. Additionally, the expert suggests getting ahead of criticism by asking for initial thoughts and using the "yes, and..." technique to validate feedback while still asserting one's own ideas, ultimately fostering a more manageable working relationship.</p>

          <p>White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett has expressed optimism that the ongoing government shutdown is likely to conclude within the week. He indicated that if a resolution is not reached, the Trump administration might consider "stronger measures" to compel Democrats to negotiate. Hassett attributed the delay to Democrats' political calculations, suggesting moderate members of the party will soon move to reopen the government, allowing policy negotiations to resume through the regular legislative process. The shutdown stems from a partisan disagreement over federal funding priorities.</p>

          <p>The Economist has released its third annual "Carrie Bradshaw Index," which ranks U.S. cities based on the affordability of living alone on a median salary. Using the 30% rule for rent, the index identifies cities where a typical studio apartment is affordable; this year, Wichita, Kansas, topped the list as the most affordable. The report notes a trend of decreasing affordability, with cities like Dallas and Houston moving into the unaffordable category, likely due to an influx of middle-class workers driving up rental prices across Texas.</p>

          <p>An article advocates for requiring all state Medicaid programs to cover GLP-1 medications like Ozempic for obesity, arguing it is a crucial step to address a major public health crisis. While acknowledging the high initial cost, the author contends that these near-miracle drugs offer substantial long-term health benefits and reduce other healthcare expenditures, offsetting a significant portion of the expense. The piece also suggests that prices will fall over time due to competition and that Medicaid's negotiating power would secure lower costs, making the expansion a fiscally sound and equitable policy.</p>

          <p>With personal loan and credit card rates remaining high, homeowners can access more affordable borrowing options through home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). Current average rates for these products are significantly lower than unsecured alternatives, providing a viable way to borrow large sums. A home equity loan offers a lump sum at a fixed rate, while a HELOC provides a revolving line of credit with a variable rate. Homeowners should be aware that their property serves as collateral for these loans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For those looking to buy a home or refinance an existing mortgage, current interest rates remain a key factor in affordability. As of mid-October, the national average for a 30-year fixed mortgage is approximately 6.46%, while a 15-year mortgage averages around 5.81%, with refinance rates being slightly higher. Experts advise that while the macroeconomic environment influences rates, individual borrowers can improve their chances of securing a good rate by strengthening their credit score, paying bills on time, and shopping around with multiple lenders to compare offers.</p>

While major forecasters project rates will end the year around 6.5%, a more significant drop below 6% is possible if inflation continues to cool or the job market weakens further.</p>

          <p>According to a Columbia University business psychologist, mastering specific social skills is more critical for career advancement than simply "being yourself." He identifies three key abilities: being receptive to honest, critical feedback; developing social awareness by focusing on others' needs and perspectives; and practicing adaptability by stepping out of one's comfort zone to learn new skills. Cultivating this emotional intelligence, which he defines as the ability to understand and manage oneself and others, makes individuals more employable and effective in the workplace.</p>
