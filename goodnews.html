        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's unexpected announcement to lift all sanctions on Syria caught senior Treasury Department officials off guard, despite months of lobbying by Syria's transitional government for relief. The announcement lacked specifics, causing confusion within the Treasury as officials scrambled to understand the scope and pace of the rollback. The Syrian government, led by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, has argued that sanctions hinder their ability to pay salaries, rebuild cities, and restore the health-care system. While some incremental lifting of sanctions was under consideration prior to the announcement, the sudden reversal took many by surprise, but a spokesperson said the Treasury Department is working to execute the President's vision.</p>

This strategic move aims to bolster the UAE's influence over global supply chains and diversify its economy away from fossil fuels. However, concerns have arisen regarding the UAE's political choices, including allegations of fueling conflict in Sudan and connections to the Wagner Group.</p>
