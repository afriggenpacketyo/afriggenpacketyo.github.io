          <h2>China Considers Male Childcare Subsidies to Address Demographic Crisis</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, argues that subsidies for fathers produce significantly higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. This proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The study analyzed data from 23 countries and found that traditional expectations placing the burden on women persist in China and other East Asian countries.</p>

They argue that Europe's startup ecosystem needs more funding and resources, not longer working hours. Concerns are also raised about the negative impact of overwork on employee retention and well-being.</p>

He believes that because AI learns by absorbing everything we do and say online, we need to be conscientious about the influences it is exposed to. De Kai's book, "Raising AI: An Essential Guide to Parenting Our Future," proposes that this paradigm shift is necessary to mitigate potential societal harm.

          <p>A parenting expert has identified five key traits common among parents of highly successful children: optimism, tailored motivation, recognizing learning opportunities everywhere, fostering a love of knowledge, and motivating with love rather than coaching. The expert interviewed dozens of parents and over 100 experts, emphasizing the importance of a positive outlook and catering to individual children's interests. Learning and empowerment can occur in everyday tasks, and a genuine love for knowledge, rather than just hard work, is crucial. The most effective motivation comes from love and support, not from being a coach or critic.</p>

          <p>UK doctors are testing "poo pills" containing freeze-dried faeces from healthy donors to combat dangerous superbug infections. The stool samples are packed with beneficial bacteria, aiming to replace drug-resistant superbugs in the gut. This approach is being explored as a new method to tackle infections resistant to antibiotics, which cause approximately a million deaths each year. Early data suggests that the poo pills can flush out superbugs and improve gut health.</p>
