This long-anticipated move, which will take effect on September 22, is expected to drive substantial investment from passive funds that track the index. Robinhood will replace Caesars Entertainment in the benchmark average, marking a major milestone for the company since its 2021 public offering.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores whether seniors can avoid paying for Medicare Part B, which has a standard monthly premium of $185 in 2025. While complete avoidance is rare, options for delaying enrollment without penalty exist for those still working with creditable employer health insurance. For low-income individuals, state-run Medicare Savings Programs or Medicaid can help cover or eliminate the premium costs. However, forgoing Part B can restrict access to crucial supplemental coverage like Medigap and Medicare Advantage plans, potentially leading to higher out-of-pocket expenses.</p>

          <p>Tennis icon Serena Williams, through her firm Serena Ventures, has invested in the women's 3-on-3 basketball league, Unrivaled, which is now valued at $340 million. The investment was part of a Series B round that also included soccer star Alex Morgan and was led by Bessemer Venture Partners. Unrivaled was created to provide WNBA players with a high-paying domestic option during their offseason, and its second season is set for January 2026. Williams established her venture capital fund in 2017 to invest in early-stage companies.</p>

          <p>With interest rates in flux, savers with a significant sum like $40,000 must carefully choose between a high-yield savings account and a certificate of deposit (CD). While current rates are comparable, a CD offers a fixed rate for its term, protecting against future declines, whereas high-yield savings rates are variable. The decision hinges on the saver's ability to keep the funds untouched, as CDs penalize early withdrawals, while high-yield accounts offer liquidity. Both options remain significantly more profitable than traditional savings accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senior trade union leaders in the UK are publicly calling on the government to pass its promised Employment Rights Bill in its entirety, amid concerns that it could be weakened. Speaking at the Trades Union Congress conference, officials expressed fear that recent cabinet changes could lead to the removal of key protections, such as a ban on zero-hours contracts. The government has insisted it is "absolutely backing" the bill, describing it as the biggest upgrade to workers' rights in a generation. Unions remain vigilant against potential business lobbying efforts to water down the legislation.</p>

          <h2>England's Football Manager Considers Reintroducing Long Throw-Ins as a Tactical Weapon</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England manager Thomas Tuchel has indicated that the team may utilize long throw-ins as a strategic tool for the upcoming World Cup, noting that the tactic is often underestimated. This approach, famously used by Stoke City's Rory Delap over a decade ago, is seeing a resurgence in the Premier League, with more teams using it to create scoring opportunities. Data shows a significant increase in long throws leading to chances and goals in recent seasons. With limited preparation time, focusing on set-piece advantages like throw-ins is seen as a sensible tactical approach.</p>

          <p>California is set to experience a significant cooldown this week as an "early season cold front" moves in from the Pacific Northwest. Temperatures are expected to drop 10 to 20 degrees below average, providing relief from recent heatwaves, wildfires, and thunderstorms. Northern California and the Bay Area may see light rain, which could help suppress wildfire risks in the region. While Southern California is not expected to receive significant rainfall, a deep marine layer could bring some drizzle, though not enough to mitigate the high fire danger from dry vegetation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage rates falling to an 11-month low in the low 6% range, homeowners who secured loans during the recent peak near 8% are considering whether to refinance. The decision involves weighing potential savings against closing costs, which typically range from 2% to 6% of the loan amount. Key questions for homeowners include whether current rates are low enough to justify the costs and if they plan to stay in the home long enough to break even. While waiting for even lower rates is tempting, it carries the risk that rates could rise unexpectedly. (not investment advice)</p>

One option is credit counseling, where professionals create a debt management plan, often negotiating lower interest rates.

A third strategy involves proactively contacting credit card issuers to inquire about hardship programs or payment plans, which can provide temporary relief from financial burdens.</p>
