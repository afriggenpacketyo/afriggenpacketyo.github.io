          <p>Nicaragua has officially withdrawn from UNESCO in response to the organization's decision to award the Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize to the exiled Nicaraguan newspaper La Prensa. UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay expressed regret over the decision, emphasizing that it deprives the Nicaraguan people of opportunities for cooperation in education and culture. La Prensa has been publishing from abroad after Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega's government tightened its control, leading to the arrest and deportation of its general manager. Nicaraguan authorities have accused La Prensa of promoting US interventions in the country, leading to this diplomatic rift with UNESCO.</p>
