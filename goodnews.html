          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 07:56:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Convenience stores are increasingly capturing the breakfast market from traditional fast-food chains. Data from market research firm Circana shows a 9% rise in morning visits to food-forward convenience stores, compared to a 1% increase for fast-food restaurants. This trend is driven by budget-conscious consumers and the wider variety of options offered at stores like Wawa and Casey's, which are investing heavily in their prepared food services. Even major chains like McDonald's acknowledge breakfast as their weakest daypart, as consumers find convenience stores to offer better value and quality for their morning meal.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock value increased after CEO Elon Musk disclosed his first open-market purchase of the company's shares since 2020, acquiring approximately $1 billion worth of stock. This significant insider buy is interpreted by traders as a strong vote of confidence from Musk amidst a year of slumping sales and concerns over his political activities impacting the brand. The purchase comes as analysts remain divided on the stock's future, with long-term optimism hinging on Tesla's pivot towards AI, robotics, and autonomous driving. The move is seen by some as Musk doubling down on his vision for the company's future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The horror genre has experienced a landmark year in 2025, surpassing $1 billion at the domestic box office for the first time since 2017 with hits like "The Conjuring: Last Rites" and "Sinners." This success is notable not just for its financial performance but also for the critical acclaim these films have received, positioning some as potential Oscar contenders. The article explores how horror, once a disrespected genre, is gaining new appreciation, with many successful directors like Jordan Peele and Zach Cregger crossing over from comedy. This trend highlights a shared creative DNA between horror and comedy, both of which rely on timing and surprise.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and the United States are set to sign a significant agreement to accelerate the development of nuclear power during President Donald Trump's state visit. The Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy aims to streamline regulatory approvals, potentially halving the time it takes to build new power stations in both countries. A key component involves a plan for US firm X-Energy and UK's Centrica to construct up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool. This partnership is intended to bolster energy security, create thousands of jobs, and unlock billions in private investment, though some critics question the costs of nuclear projects.</p>

          <h2>Growing Number of Renters Use On-Time Payments to Improve Credit Scores</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 07:12:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An increasing number of renters are reporting their monthly rent payments to credit bureaus as a strategy to build or enhance their credit history. According to a TransUnion survey, 13% of renters participated in such services in 2025, with younger generations like Gen Z and millennials leading the trend. Including rent payments can significantly boost credit scores, particularly for those who are "credit invisible" or have thin credit files, with an average increase of 60 points reported. However, experts advise consumers to carefully consider the costs and potential negative impacts if they miss a payment.</p>

          <p>China plans to significantly expand its world-leading energy storage capacity, aiming to almost double its current level to over 180 gigawatts by 2027. A new government action plan outlines an investment of 250 billion yuan (US$35 billion) to achieve this goal, focusing primarily on lithium-ion battery systems. The strategy is essential for supporting the rapid growth of renewable energy sources and ensuring a stable power grid as the country pursues its carbon neutrality goals. The plan also includes developing alternative technologies like hydrogen storage, capitalizing on growing demand for energy storage solutions.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking program in Flint, Michigan, called Rx Kids, is providing unconditional cash transfers to every pregnant woman, offering $1,500 during pregnancy and $500 per month for the infant's first year. Recent studies show significant positive impacts, including lower rates of maternal postpartum depression and improved infant health, which have saved millions in neonatal intensive care costs. Born from the community advocacy that followed the city's water crisis, the program aims to prescribe away poverty, which pediatricians identify as a key detriment to child health. The universal approach has earned bipartisan support and is expanding to other communities.</p>

          <p>New Zealand has embarked on one of the world's most ambitious conservation projects, aiming to eradicate invasive predators like possums, rats, and stoats by 2050 to save its unique native bird species. A crucial part of this "Predator Free 2050" initiative is the mobilization of a nationwide network of volunteers, including students and backyard trappers, who set and monitor traps on public and private land. These introduced mammals have driven dozens of native bird species to extinction and continue to threaten iconic birds like the kiwi. The project highlights a significant social challenge, requiring widespread community participation to restore the country's natural ecosystems.</p>

          <p>China's cyberspace regulator has introduced new measures requiring network operators to report "particularly serious" cybersecurity incidents to authorities within one hour of discovery. The regulation, set to take effect on November 1, establishes a four-tiered classification system for incidents based on their severity. The highest category includes attacks affecting the portals of high-level government agencies or key national news websites for extended periods. This move signifies Beijing's increasing focus on tightening control over its digital infrastructure and ensuring rapid response to significant online threats.</p>

          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court has ordered Meta to revise its privacy policies, ruling the company violated the freedom of expression of adult content actress Esperanza Gomez by closing her Instagram account. Gomez argued the closure, for posting photos in her underwear, affected her ability to work. The court found Meta acted in an "arbitrary" fashion, applying its policies on nudity inconsistently and without clear justification, as similar accounts remained active. The ruling mandates that Meta adjust its terms so users have clear mechanisms for challenging content moderation decisions, representing a significant legal check on social media platforms.</p>

A storm is typically named only when it is expected to cause significant impacts warranting an amber or red warning. The unsettled weather, including heavy rain, is expected to continue throughout the week as the jet stream remains positioned over the country.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee is initiating a weeklong voter registration campaign to counteract a concerning trend of declining party registrations compared to Republican gains. The effort will focus on battleground states and college campuses, aiming to build the party's volunteer base and infrastructure ahead of future elections. This direct involvement marks a shift for the party, which has previously relied on outside groups for such efforts. The drive is a response to data showing Democrats lost over 2 million registered voters from 2020 to 2024 while Republicans gained nearly 2.4 million.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Steve Cohen have reintroduced legislation to ban employers from using credit checks as part of the hiring process. The bill aims to amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act, arguing that denying job opportunities based on financial history is unfair and disproportionately harms people of color and women. Proponents of the bill note that about half of U.S. employers use credit reports in their vetting process, despite a lack of evidence correlating credit history with job performance. The push for the ban aims to make the application process fairer for all candidates.</p>
