          <p>With home equity levels high, homeowners are considering home equity loans and HELOCs for borrowing large sums. In June 2025, rates for both are similar, but HELOCs have variable rates, making long-term costs uncertain. The article compares repayment costs for a $200,000 loan under different rate scenarios and repayment periods. Home equity loans offer fixed rates, while HELOCs provide flexibility with interest-only payments during the draw period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A study analyzing nearly two billion words online found that Americans use vulgar language more frequently than other English-speaking groups. Linguists assessed websites, blogs, and other online sources across 20 English-speaking regions. The study suggests the anonymity of the internet may contribute to the higher rate of swearing among Americans online. Researchers believe understanding the cultural context of swearing can help non-native speakers integrate into new environments.</p>

Experts emphasize the need for policymakers to prioritize measures that protect society, especially children, from gun violence.</p>
