        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Transportation is officially dropping a proposed regulation that would have mandated airlines to offer cash payments to passengers for significant flight delays or cancellations. The rule, introduced under the previous administration, faced strong opposition from airline industry groups who argued it would increase ticket prices and create operational burdens. The DOT stated it will now reconsider such extra-statutory requirements while still committing to enforcing consumer protection laws mandated by Congress, such as refunds for canceled flights when passengers choose not to travel. This decision is seen as a move toward deregulation favored by the current administration.</p>

          <p>Following his death at age 91, industry experts are remembering Giorgio Armani not just for his iconic designs but as a brilliant business leader who built a global empire by maintaining strict control over his brand. Armani revolutionized fashion by creating accessible luxury, from red-carpet gowns to everyday apparel and even home goods, all while upholding a consistent vision of sophisticated elegance. He famously pioneered the "power suit" for both men and women and was among the first to strategically use celebrity endorsements to elevate his brand's profile. By never selling his company, he retained full creative and financial control, a rarity in the industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Newsmax's antitrust lawsuit against Fox News, which alleged that Fox engaged in monopolistic practices to suppress conservative media competitors. Judge Aileen Cannon ruled the suit was an improper "shotgun complaint" because it incorporated all allegations from the first count into subsequent counts, a technical violation of legal procedure. However, the dismissal is without prejudice, and the judge has granted Newsmax a short deadline to file an amended complaint that adheres to proper formatting. Newsmax has stated its intention to refile the case, indicating the legal battle between the rival networks is likely to continue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An employment tribunal in the United Kingdom has ruled that spending less than an hour of work time on personal online activities, such as shopping or browsing property sites, does not constitute a sackable offense. The judge awarded over £14,000 to an accountancy administrator who was fired after her employer used spyware to track her computer usage. The ruling noted that the employee's personal browsing was not excessive, the company had no clear policy against it, and even the boss engaged in similar activities. The judge concluded the real motive for the dismissal was likely to replace the employee before she reached two years of service.</p>

          <h2>Financial Guidance Offered on Protecting Inheritance from Division in a Divorce</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 14:40:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A financial advice article addresses how an individual in a community-property state like Arizona can protect an inheritance from being divided in a potential future divorce. The key strategy is to prevent commingling the inherited funds with marital assets. This involves opening a separate brokerage account solely in the recipient's name rather than depositing the money into joint accounts or certain shared retirement funds like a 401(k), where appreciation during the marriage could be considered community property. Keeping the inheritance distinctly separate ensures it legally remains the individual's personal property, safeguarding it from potential claims. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction has been raised to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year, a significant increase from the $10,000 limit established by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This deduction, which primarily benefits taxpayers in high-tax states like New York and California, allows itemizers to deduct property and state income taxes from their federal taxable income. While proponents argue the change reduces double taxation, critics point to its high cost, with estimates suggesting it will add over $142 billion to the national debt over the next decade.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) face a less favorable reinvestment climate. Financial experts suggest several strategies to consider instead of simply rolling over a CD into a new one at a lower rate. Options include moving the funds to a high-yield savings account, which offers comparable rates with greater flexibility, or a money market account that combines high interest with checking features. Alternatively, investing in a new long-term CD can lock in a fixed rate for several years, providing security against further market declines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell significantly, dropping to 6.29% following the release of a weaker-than-expected August employment report. This marks the largest one-day decrease in over a year and brings rates to their lowest point since October of the previous year. The cooling labor market has led investors to anticipate that the Federal Reserve will be more aggressive in cutting interest rates, causing bond yields and mortgage rates to fall. While the drop provides some relief for potential homebuyers, it is unclear if it will reinvigorate a housing market slowed by affordability challenges. (not investment advice)</p>
