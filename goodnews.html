        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an interview at the Telluride Film Festival, director Chloé Zhao discussed her latest film, "Hamnet," which explores the life of William Shakespeare's family and the death of their son. Zhao described the project as a deeply personal one that helped her process difficult personal and professional experiences, including the critical reception of her Marvel film, "Eternals." She explained her approach to adapting Maggie O’Farrell’s novel, focusing on the intimate human drama and archetypal themes of grief, creativity, and masculine-feminine energies. The film, starring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal, has received a very positive early response, marking a return to smaller-scale filmmaking for the Oscar-winning director.</p>

          <p>The community of Kerrville, Texas, gathered for its high school football season opener, an event that served as a moment of healing and normalcy following devastating flash floods in July. The Tivy Antler varsity team played their first game at Antler Stadium, the same venue that had been transformed into a volunteer hub and memorial site in the wake of the disaster. The traditional Friday night football game provided a sense of community and recovery for residents still grappling with the aftermath of the flooding. The event symbolized a step forward for the town as it continues to rebuild from the natural disaster.</p>

          <p>A joint operation between Cardiff Council and South Wales Police resulted in the seizure of 135 illegal e-bikes and scooters during a month-long crackdown in August. The initiative targeted vehicles that violated UK law, which classifies e-bikes with motors over 250 watts or speeds exceeding 15.5 mph as motor vehicles requiring proper registration. Among the seized items was a bike capable of reaching 86 mph with no functioning brakes and another ridden by a teenager that could hit 70 mph. The operation, aimed at curbing antisocial behavior and improving public safety, also led to arrests for other offenses, including weapon and drug possession.</p>

          <p>Personal finance personality Dave Ramsey advised a 61-year-old woman against using a home equity line of credit (HELOC) to pay off a $27,000 car she financed for her daughter. The caller explained that her daughter failed to refinance the car into her own name and has been irresponsible, leading the mother to consider drastic measures to resolve the debt. Ramsey and his co-host argued that this move would hurt, not help, her daughter and suggested selling the car, even at a loss, to manage the situation more responsibly. They emphasized that misguided financial generosity can often lead to negative consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Oval Invincibles won their third straight men's Hundred title after defeating the Trent Rockets by 26 runs in the final at Lord's. Will Jacks was instrumental in the victory, scoring 72 runs from 41 balls, the highest individual score in a men's Hundred final, to help his team post a total of 168-5. In response, the Trent Rockets struggled against the Invincibles' bowling attack, particularly leg-spinner Nathan Sowter, who took three key wickets. Despite a late effort from Marcus Stoinis, who scored 64, the Rockets finished short at 142-8, sealing another championship for the dominant Invincibles.</p>

          <p>A federal judge issued an emergency order to halt the Trump administration's plan to deport hundreds of unaccompanied Guatemalan children, some of whom were reportedly already on planes ready for takeoff. U.S. District Judge Sparkle Sooknanan's temporary restraining order prevents the government from removing any unaccompanied child to Guatemala without a formal deportation order for at least 14 days. Attorneys for the children argued the plan was illegal and deprived them of due process and the right to seek asylum. The Justice Department contended it was repatriating children at the request of their families, a claim disputed by the children's advocates.</p>

          <p>Liverpool secured a 1-0 victory over Arsenal at Anfield, thanks to a stunning 83rd-minute free-kick from Dominik Szoboszlai. The match, an early-season test between two Premier League title contenders, was largely a cautious affair until Szoboszlai's decisive strike. Arsenal, despite significant summer spending, adopted a conservative strategy that ultimately failed to produce a result, extending their winless streak at Anfield to 13 league games. The victory gives Liverpool a psychological edge and a perfect start to their campaign with three wins from three games, while raising questions about Arsenal's ability to overcome top rivals.</p>

In a social media post, Ramsay shared photos of the bandage and stitch marks, expressing gratitude to his medical team for their swift action. He used the experience to urge his followers to wear sunscreen, especially over the holiday weekend. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer and is rarely life-threatening, with a very high cure rate when detected and treated early, according to dermatologists.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has finalized a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 anti-submarine frigates, marking the UK's largest-ever warship export deal by value. The Ministry of Defence stated the deal will support 4,000 UK jobs, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be built. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined UK-Norwegian fleet of 13 advanced frigates designed to operate jointly. The agreement is seen as a major victory for the British defense industry over international competitors.</p>

          <p>During an informal meeting in Copenhagen, EU foreign ministers brainstormed new ways to support Ukraine amid the ongoing war with Russia. Among the ideas discussed were the potential for secondary sanctions targeting Russia's trading partners and establishing "safe haven" sites on EU soil for Ukrainian arms production. Ministers also revisited the contentious issue of seizing frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Kyiv's reconstruction. Another proposal involved shifting the EU's military training mission for Ukrainian troops onto Ukrainian soil in the event of a ceasefire, signaling a long-term strategic commitment to the country's defense.</p>
