          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has dismissed his chief of staff, Heather Flick Melanson, and deputy chief of staff of policy, Hannah Anderson. The department did not provide a specific reason for the ousters, stating only that the secretary has the right to make personnel decisions. Matt Buckham, the current White House liaison at HHS, has been appointed as the acting chief of staff. This leadership change occurs as the department continues to pursue its mission under the new administration's health agenda.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst expectations, with earnings of $10.91 per share against an expected $9.53. The bank's revenue climbed 15% to $14.58 billion, largely driven by its trading divisions which generated $840 million more in revenue than anticipated. This strong performance, particularly in equities trading, reflects a market environment influenced by tariff policies that have increased volatility. The positive results highlight the firm's ability to capitalize on dynamic market conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Wholesale Inflation Remained Unchanged in June, Complicating Economic Outlook</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 08:46:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The producer price index (PPI), a measure of wholesale inflation, showed no change in June, contrary to economists' expectations of a 0.2% increase. This flat reading from the Bureau of Labor Statistics presents a conflicting signal regarding the impact of tariffs on future inflation. While final demand goods prices rose, this was offset by a fall in services costs. The data, combined with recent consumer price figures, suggests that tariffs are currently having only a marginal effect on the U.S. economy and prices for goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant trend in the media industry is the appointment of executives with finance and operational backgrounds to top leadership positions, a departure from the traditional path of content and programming heads. This shift, exemplified by leaders at Warner Bros. Discovery, Comcast, and Netflix, is driven by the industry's focus on making streaming profitable and managing declining cable revenues. Experts suggest this change reflects a period of transformation where financial engineering and strategic deal-making are becoming as crucial as creative programming for survival and growth.</p>

This follows concerns from patient families and medical professionals that the growing role of PAs, who have less training than doctors, has led to confusion and potential risks in patient care.</p>
