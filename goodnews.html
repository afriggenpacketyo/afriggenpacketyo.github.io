The meeting follows a series of talks by a U.S. envoy and comes as a U.S. deadline for a ceasefire approaches. While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed support for a potential three-way summit, the Kremlin has not committed to that format. Trump remains cautious, emphasizing the goal is to end the conflict and stop the loss of life.</p>

          <p>Saudi Pro League club Al-Hilal has reached a £46.3 million agreement to sign Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez. The 26-year-old Uruguayan international is set to undergo a medical before completing the move. Nunez joined Liverpool in 2022 and scored 40 goals in 143 appearances, but his starting opportunities became limited in the previous season. The sale could provide Liverpool with the financial resources to pursue a deal for Newcastle's Alexander Isak.</p>

Suggestions range from turning shopping into a game of choosing items without buying to using the library for a dopamine hit instead. Other popular strategies include letting items sit in an online cart for a period, creating a "wishlist" folder, and envisioning exactly how an item will be used. Some readers advocate for deeper lifestyle changes, such as finding fulfillment in non-material experiences, to transform the impulse to shop.</p>

          <p>Dungeons & Dragons has transitioned from a home-based tabletop game into a major form of spectator entertainment, with live-play shows selling out large venues like Madison Square Garden. This phenomenon, known as "actual play," features performers playing D&D for millions of online viewers, fueling a new golden age for the game. The increased visibility and diverse cast of popular shows like "Dimension 20" and "Critical Role" are attracting new audiences, including more women. This trend is not only creating a new entertainment genre but also encouraging more people to play the game themselves.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NFL has officially banned the use of smelling salts by players on the field, citing safety concerns and the risk of masking concussion symptoms. The league's decision aligns with an FDA warning that the ammonia-based substances have not been proven safe or effective for boosting alertness. While some players expressed dismay at the ban, medical experts note that inappropriate use can cause adverse effects. A key concern is that the jolt from smelling salts could hide signs of a concussion, preventing proper medical evaluation and potentially worsening an injury.</p>

          <h2>Gordon Brown Advocates for Higher Gambling Taxes to Fund Social Programs</h2>

          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown is urging Chancellor Rachel Reeves to increase taxes on the gambling industry to fund the removal of benefit restrictions, such as the two-child cap. Brown argues that the "undertaxed" gambling sector provides a cost-effective way to address the "social crisis" of child poverty. The proposal, supported by the IPPR think tank, suggests raising taxes on online gambling to generate an estimated £3.2 billion annually. The Betting and Gaming Council opposes the plan, calling it "economically reckless" and warning it could drive consumers to the unregulated black market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Experts Propose Strategies for Fireproofing Forests in a Warming World</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 03:55:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As climate change accelerates the frequency and intensity of wildfires globally, experts are focused on strategies to make forests more resilient. One key approach is to restore natural, healthy forests, as diverse deciduous woodlands are less flammable than conifer monocultures. Short-term tactics include reducing fuel loads through controlled burns or mechanical clearing, a practice historically used by Indigenous peoples. Additionally, creating and maintaining firebreaks—strips of land cleared of vegetation—can slow or stop a fire's spread, protecting communities and infrastructure from catastrophic damage.</p>

          <p>SoftBank Group reported its second consecutive profitable quarter, largely driven by a $4.8 billion gain in the value of its Vision Fund technology investments. The Japanese conglomerate's first-quarter profit of 421.8 billion yen significantly exceeded analyst expectations. The positive performance of the Vision Fund was attributed to gains in publicly traded companies like Grab and private investments in its India portfolio. This result comes as SoftBank continues its aggressive spending on artificial intelligence, including a major investment in OpenAI and the pending acquisition of chip firm Ampere Computing.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to an analysis of recent 13F filings, billionaire investor David Tepper's fund, Appaloosa, has significantly reduced its holdings in AI hardware giants Nvidia, AMD, and TSMC over the past year. In contrast, the fund has been increasing its stake in Broadcom, another trillion-dollar company with a strong position in the AI sector. The article suggests this shift may be due to valuation concerns with Nvidia and a belief that Broadcom's diversified business in networking solutions and custom chips offers a more resilient investment. Broadcom's role in connecting AI-GPUs and its broader portfolio may make it less vulnerable if an AI bubble were to burst. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Deoleo, the world's largest olive oil producer, has provided an optimistic outlook for the industry, signaling a recovery from a recent period of extreme turbulence. A bumper olive harvest in Spain has led to a 50% drop in raw material prices, allowing the company to lower shelf prices and stimulate consumer demand. This follows two years of poor yields, which, combined with inflation and extreme weather, caused prices to soar. The CEO of the Spain-based company expressed cautious optimism for a more balanced and promising market landscape ahead.</p>
