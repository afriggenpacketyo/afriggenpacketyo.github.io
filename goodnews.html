          <p>Morrisons supermarket chain believes the recent UK-EU trade agreement will ease the strain on food prices by removing trade barriers and reducing complexities in food imports. The chief executive, Rami Baiti√©h, expressed optimism about the deal's potential to improve access to key export markets for British meat and fish. Asda echoed these sentiments, anticipating reduced costs and bureaucracy for fresh produce imports and goods moving to Northern Ireland, hoping for a swift finalization to maximize benefits for customers' budgets. Business groups like the CBI and BCC have also lauded the agreement as a significant step forward in EU-UK relations after a decade of turbulence.</p>

          <p>Top officials from Britain and the European Union met in London to announce a "reset" of post-Brexit relations, tightening trade and defense ties. The new defense agreement allows Britain to participate in European defense efforts, including a 150 billion euro loan program. Trade agreements include relaxing post-Brexit barriers to facilitate the movement of animals and food, enabling British producers to sell raw meat products into the bloc. The agreement also aims to enhance cooperation on illegal migration and includes provisions for European boats to access British fishing waters until June 30, 2038, ensuring stability for fishermen on both sides.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As economic uncertainty persists, annuities are gaining traction as a means to secure retirement income, but experts advise careful consideration before investing. Annuities offer guaranteed lifetime income and market volatility protection through fixed and indexed options, providing tax-deferred growth and no contribution limits. However, they come with fees, limited access to funds, early withdrawal penalties, and complex terms. Experts recommend balancing investments, researching the annuity company's financial strength, creating a financial plan, and reviewing current economic conditions to determine if an annuity aligns with retirement goals.

Despite Biden's high Gleason score of 9, Davies noted that hormonal treatments, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy are viable options. These treatments aim to suppress testosterone levels to slow cancer growth and extend life, with the possibility of living 10 years with the disease. Davies emphasized that Biden's age of 82 does not necessarily limit treatment options, but his overall physiology is a key factor.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sleep specialists suggest that eating habits significantly impact sleep quality, recommending dietary practices to improve nighttime rest. Consuming foods rich in tryptophan, such as almonds, oats, and salmon, can aid in the production of serotonin and melatonin, essential for sleep regulation. Swapping sugary and processed foods for fruits and vegetables provides sleep-supporting nutrients like fiber and micronutrients. It's advised to avoid caffeine in the late afternoon and evening, and to refrain from drinking alcohol right before bed, as it disrupts sleep patterns. Avoiding heavy meals close to bedtime promotes better digestion and reduces discomfort.</p>
