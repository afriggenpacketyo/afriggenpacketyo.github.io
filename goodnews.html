          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 00:01:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Frustrated by local "Not In My Backyard" (NIMBY) opposition, a growing number of states are passing laws to compel cities and counties to allow for more affordable and denser housing. Utah, for example, is requiring municipalities to adopt strategies to increase housing supply, as soaring home prices have made homeownership unattainable for a large portion of its population. The article highlights the tension between state mandates aimed at addressing a national housing crisis and local governments concerned about infrastructure strain and loss of control. This reflects a broader effort to tackle generational wealth gaps exacerbated by the housing shortage.</p>

          <p>For the first time in five years, China and Russia have launched a joint oceanographic research mission, signaling a renewal of scientific cooperation between the two nations. A team of 25 scientists set sail from Vladivostok on a 45-day expedition to the Bering Sea and the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The mission's stated goals are to study the effects of climate change on deep-sea environments and the movement of sediment from land to water. This resumption of joint research highlights a shared commitment to addressing climate issues and exploring marine science, potentially with an eye toward future ambitions in the Arctic region.</p>

          <h2>Federal Appeals Court Rules Trump's Attempt to End Birthright Citizenship is Unconstitutional</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 23:33:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has dealt another blow to the Trump administration's effort to end birthright citizenship, affirming a lower court's ruling that the president's executive order is unconstitutional. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that the proposed policy, which would deny citizenship to many individuals born in the United States, violates the 14th Amendment. This ruling is the latest in a series of legal challenges that have blocked the order since it was signed. The case is expected to eventually be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, keeping the long-standing legal principle intact for now.</p>

          <h2>Walking 7,000 Steps Daily Linked to Significant Health Benefits, Study Finds</h2>

          <p>A major study suggests that walking just 7,000 steps a day, a more achievable goal than the popular 10,000-step benchmark, can significantly reduce the risk of serious health problems. Research published in The Lancet Public Health analyzed data from over 160,000 adults and found this step count was associated with a lower risk of heart disease, cancer, and dementia. The findings challenge the 10,000-step target, which originated from a 1960s marketing campaign rather than scientific evidence. Researchers hope this more realistic goal will encourage more people to use step tracking as a practical way to improve their health.</p>

          <h2>Australian Women Win Appeal to Sue Qatar Airways Over Invasive Airport Searches</h2>

          <p>Five Australian women who were subjected to invasive strip-searches at Doha's airport in 2020 have won a crucial legal victory, allowing them to proceed with their lawsuit against Qatar Airways. The women were among a group ordered off a flight and examined to see if they had recently given birth after an infant was found abandoned in the airport. An Australian federal court overturned a previous ruling that had dismissed the case, finding that the airline could potentially be held responsible. This decision paves the way for the case to go to trial, where the women are seeking damages for the trauma they endured.</p>

          <p>An oceanographer at the Scripps Institute discovered a rare violet sea snail, Janthina janthina, on a La Jolla beach, a species not typically seen in the area. These pelagic snails are known for their vibrant purple shells and their ability to float on the open ocean using a self-secreted bubble raft. Their appearance in Southern California is unusual and often coincides with warmer offshore waters moving toward the coast. While a direct link to climate change is not confirmed, researchers suggest that continued warm water trends could lead to more frequent sightings of these tropical and subtropical creatures along the coast.</p>

          <p>San Francisco Giants' Rafael Devers made a surprising admission after his debut at first base, stating he prefers playing a defensive position over being a full-time designated hitter. Devers explained that being on the field helps keep him active and prevents him from overthinking his at-bats. This contrasts with his time at the Boston Red Sox, where he had been adamant about his desire to exclusively handle DH duties. The change in perspective comes after a tense spring training where his role was a point of contention, and he had previously rejected the idea of playing first base for Boston.</p>

          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter compared to the previous one, narrowly avoiding a technical recession, which is defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction. The growth, which beat economists' expectations, was primarily driven by a strong performance in exports, particularly of semiconductors and chemical products. However, analysts remain cautious about the future, as domestic consumption remains sluggish and the global trade outlook is uncertain due to the specter of U.S. tariffs. The data provides some relief but underscores the challenges facing the nation's export-reliant economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has finalized new trade agreements with Indonesia and the Philippines, which will see U.S. shipments to those countries face no duties while imports will be subject to a 19 percent tariff. Analysts suggest the move is an indirect strategy to counter China's economic influence by reshaping regional supply chains and securing access to critical resources like rare earth minerals. However, the article notes that Chinese firms are already a step ahead, having increasingly localized their production within Southeast Asian nations over the past five years. This reduces their reliance on the transshipment routes the new deals might affect. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A vegetation fire, dubbed the Euclid fire, broke out in Chino Hills, California, quickly growing to 120 acres and forcing the temporary closure of the 71 Freeway. The blaze was reported on Wednesday afternoon near Euclid Avenue and jumped the freeway before pushing toward the Prado Dam area. Fire crews worked to establish a dozer line to clear vegetation and successfully stopped the fire's forward rate of spread by the evening. As of Wednesday night, the fire was 5% contained, the freeway had reopened, and crews were remaining on scene to conduct mop-up operations.</p>
