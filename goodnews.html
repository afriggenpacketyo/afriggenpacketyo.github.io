          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a surprising increase in job openings to nearly 7.4 million in April, surpassing economists' forecasts and indicating a stable labor market. Hiring also saw a rise, with 5.6 million positions filled, while layoffs experienced a decrease, suggesting employers are retaining their workforce. Despite some economic uncertainty, the labor market appears to be returning to normal levels, with underlying patterns in hiring and firing remaining steady. However, new orders for manufactured goods fell more than expected, signaling declining demand after a surge in March. </p>

          <p>Anthropic's Claude 4 AI model has demonstrated the ability to work continuously for seven hours, marking a significant advancement in AI capabilities, however, AI programs face limitations on their work hours due to computing power constraints and memory capacity. MJ Jiang of Credibly explains that AI tools like ChatGPT may experience performance degradation during long conversations because the model may begin to "forget" earlier instructions and produce lower-quality responses. While a 24-hour AI workday may be technically possible in the future, the environmental impact and cost of computing power raise questions about its feasibility. The potential for water shortages due to the demand for water cooling is also a growing concern. </p>

          <p>Experts advise potential homebuyers to monitor Federal Reserve meetings and tariff developments, as these factors significantly influence mortgage rates. Strategic use of temporary rate buydowns can offer more affordable rates in the short term, while negotiating closing cost credits from sellers can offset higher rates. Despite predictions of slightly lower rates later in the year, experts suggest that waiting for the "perfect" rate may result in higher home prices. Homeowners considering refinancing should carefully evaluate their reasons, as refinancing at current rates may not be beneficial for those with existing low rates. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>New graduates are entering the workplace this summer, and they have mixed feelings about how prepared they are. Figuring out how to show up well in in-person meetings, especially as a new hire and even more so as a junior employee, can be tough. First, get a clue in terms of what role you'll play in the meeting, Senning says. In a meeting, that can mean bringing something to take notes on and being ready to contribute ideas if that's what's expected of you. </p>

          <p>Max Homa stood out on Monday in a US Open qualifier filled with PGA Tour players. He was the only one carrying his own bag. He and his caddie of two months, Bill Harke, are no longer together. Homa ended up carrying it for 38 holes. Asked one last time about the caddie situation, Homa whispered, ‚ÄúI wanted to carry for 36 holes. Everyone is going to ask me that.‚Äù </p>

          <p>Life is filled with big decisions. Should you move across the country? Start a business? Have a baby? Break up? The decision-making business is really just the regret-minimization business. We can eliminate a lot of regret by just moving faster. We are just taking our best possible guess at the time with the information we have. The way we make good decisions is not by sitting at home and wondering if we're going to like something. It is by trying the thing out. </p>
