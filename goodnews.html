          <p>Indiana Fever head coach Stephanie White received a technical foul for yelling at officials during a game, and she later suggested that star player Caitlin Clark offered to pay the associated fine. The incident occurred while Clark, who was sidelined with an injury, clapped in support of her coach from the bench. This event is highlighted as part of a more rebellious team culture developing around the Fever, which recently won the WNBA's Commissioner's Cup. The article notes other instances of the team's assertive attitude this season.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that zooplankton, tiny marine animals, play a surprisingly significant role in mitigating global warming through a massive annual migration in the Southern Ocean. These creatures gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface, grow fat, and then sink deep into the ocean to burn this fat, effectively locking away vast amounts of carbon. Researchers estimate this process sequesters as much carbon as the annual emissions of 55 million cars, a much larger amount than previously thought. This discovery highlights the crucial but often overlooked role of these organisms in regulating the planet's climate.</p>

          <p>Hamas has formally delivered what it calls a "positive response" to the latest Gaza ceasefire proposal, signaling it is ready to enter negotiations. However, a senior Palestinian official clarified that while Hamas accepts the general framework, it has requested key amendments. These include a U.S. guarantee that hostilities will not resume if permanent ceasefire talks fail and that all humanitarian aid be distributed exclusively by the UN. The U.S. and Israel, which have been reluctant to accept similar demands in the past, have not yet issued a formal response to the group's position.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart attacks has shared a list of five common foods he considers "toxic" and does not feed his own children. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and hot dogs because of nitrates and sodium. He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health. Instead, he recommends healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain Greek yogurt, and lean proteins to foster long-term wellness.</p>
