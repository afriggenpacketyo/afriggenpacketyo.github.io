          <p>Singapore's economy demonstrated robust growth in the second quarter, expanding by 4.3% year-over-year and beating economists' predictions. This acceleration was primarily driven by a strong 5.5% expansion in the manufacturing sector. Despite the positive performance, the Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, highlighting significant uncertainties and downside risks from global trade tensions, particularly U.S. tariff policies. The country's central bank had previously loosened monetary policy due to these external risks, but the strong GDP figures present a complex picture for future decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks secured a hard-fought 92-88 victory against the Connecticut Sun, driven by a powerful offensive performance from their frontcourt. Dearica Hamby, Rickea Jackson, and Azurá Stevens combined for a dominant 57 points, effectively controlling the paint and creating opportunities for their teammates, who tallied 22 assists. Despite a late surge from the Sun, the Sparks maintained their lead from start to finish. Crucial free throws from Stevens in the final seconds ultimately sealed the win for the team at Crypto.com Arena, capping a dynamic and high-scoring contest.</p>

          <p>Australia is navigating a delicate geopolitical balance by enhancing its defense and maritime cooperation with the Philippines while managing its significant trade relationship with China. As part of a broader civil maritime program, Australia recently donated equipment to the Philippines and plans to double its investment in related initiatives to A$11.5 million by 2029. Analysts view these moves as a reflection of the growing strategic partnership between the two nations, which are preparing to celebrate 80 years of diplomatic relations. This strengthened alliance is developing against the backdrop of regional tensions and complex international trade dynamics.</p>

          <p>A significant shift is occurring in Chinese higher education, with students increasingly choosing technology-focused majors like information technology and vehicle engineering. This trend reflects China's national strategy to bolster its technological capabilities in response to intensified competition with the United States. Unlike two decades ago when international trade and urban planning were popular, today's students are being guided toward fields seen as crucial for future industrial and technological advancement. The state-driven system is actively funneling talent into these strategic disciplines to secure the nation's position as a global tech leader.</p>

          <p>Transport for London (TfL) has seen a significant increase in prosecutions for fare evasion on the Tube, reaching the highest number in six years with 3,691 cases in 2024-25. In the same period, a record number of penalty fare notices were also issued on the London Overground. TfL, which spent over £21 million on enforcement across the Tube and bus networks, states that fare evasion deprives the system of vital investment. The agency is expanding its enforcement teams and aims to reduce the overall fare evasion rate to 1.5% by 2030.</p>

          <p>The Armagh Observatory is celebrating a remarkable meteorological achievement: 230 years of continuous, daily weather observation. This unbroken, handwritten data sequence is the longest of its kind in the UK and Ireland, providing an invaluable record of climate change. Since the first entry on July 14, 1795, observers have manually recorded temperature and air pressure, a tradition that continues today alongside automated systems. The long-term data clearly shows a warming climate, with current observer Shane Kelly noting that the distinct seasons of the past have blurred into one long, variable season.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers entered the All-Star break with a 5-2 extra-innings victory against the San Francisco Giants, securing a 5.5-game lead in the NL West. Despite a record-setting payroll, the team's first half has been marked by both success and inconsistency, including an injury-plagued pitching staff and slumps from veteran stars. Sunday's game encapsulated this duality, with a brilliant performance from starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto followed by a blown save from the bullpen, before the offense rallied in the 11th inning. While their performance has been uneven, the Dodgers remain in a strong position for a postseason run.</p>
