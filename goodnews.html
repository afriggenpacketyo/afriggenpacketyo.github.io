          <p>Pet dogs are increasingly becoming integral parts of wedding ceremonies, taking on roles such as ring bearers and greeters, reflecting their status as cherished family members. Couples like Ellie and Brad describe the immense joy their dog, Newton, brought to their special day. This trend has spurred the growth of dog chaperone services, like Precious Pets Weddings and Paws2Party, which help plan and manage canine involvement. These services ensure pets are groomed, assigned roles, and cared for during the event, often leading to the dogs "stealing the show" and enhancing the unique charm of modern weddings.</p>

The platform saw significant growth, with creator accounts increasing by 13% to 4.6 million and fan accounts by 24% to 377.5 million.

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets generally traded higher on Friday, with investors keenly awaiting U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the annual Jackson Hole economic symposium. South Korea's Kospi and Kosdaq saw gains, while Japan's Nikkei 225 closed flat and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined. Australia's core inflation cooled slightly, but Japan's July core inflation was hotter than expected. Mainland China's CSI 300 jumped significantly. Overnight, U.S. stocks fell for the fifth consecutive day, as Fed funds futures indicated a nearly 74% likelihood of a rate cut in September, reflecting anticipation around Powell's upcoming remarks.

          <p>US President Donald Trump has reversed his threat of imposing steep tariffs, up to 250%, on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors imported from the European Union. New details of the US-EU trade agreement confirm that tariffs for these sectors will be capped at 15%, aligning with most other goods. This provides significant relief for major European exporters like Ireland and Denmark. However, the 27.5% tariff on European car exports will only be reduced to 15% once the EU passes legislation to eliminate its own tariffs on US industrial goods. The deal aims to provide predictability for businesses and stability in the world's largest trading partnership, though wine and spirits remain subject to tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's Supreme Court has revised its earlier order on stray dogs in New Delhi, now directing that captured animals be sterilized and immunized before release, unless they exhibit rabies or aggressive behavior. The court, however, prohibited public feeding of stray dogs, instructing civic bodies to establish designated feeding zones and threatening legal action against violators. This modification comes after an initial order for mass removal sparked widespread protests from animal rights activists. The court cited a surge in dog bite cases, with nearly 2,000 incidents daily in New Delhi, and aims to frame a nationwide policy to address the issue.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate for July cooled to 3.1%, down from 3.3% in June, marking its lowest since March 2025, primarily due to easing rice prices. However, this figure was still higher than the 3% economists had anticipated. The "core-core" inflation rate, excluding fresh food and energy, remained steady at 3.4%. While food inflation shows signs of moderation, particularly for rice, the 3.1% headline inflation remains above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for the 40th consecutive month. Analysts suggest this persistent inflation could support a potential rate hike by the BOJ later this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been acquitted of royal insult (lese majeste) charges, which could have led to a 15-year jail sentence. The charge stemmed from a 2015 interview where he allegedly implicated palace members in a coup. The court interpreted the law literally, ruling that he had not named specific individuals covered by the statute. This verdict offers significant relief to the Shinawatra family's political movement, especially as Thaksin's daughter, Paetongtarn, faces her own legal challenges. The case highlights the controversial and often broadly interpreted lese majeste law, which critics view as a political tool.</p>

Claimants who remain abroad for over eight weeks will generally lose eligibility, barring exceptional circumstances.

This initiative follows a successful pilot that saved £17 million in less than a year by stopping incorrect payments to 2,600 individuals.
