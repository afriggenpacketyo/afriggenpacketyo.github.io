          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 20:09:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France has enacted a comprehensive ban on smoking in most public areas, including beaches, parks, and near schools, in an effort to "denormalize" tobacco use. Violators of the new law face significant fines, ranging from 135 to 700 euros. The government aims to combat the high rate of tobacco-related deaths, which claim 75,000 lives annually in the country. While smoking has been illegal in restaurants and bars since 2008, over 30% of French adults still smoke, prompting these stricter measures, though caf√© terraces remain a notable exception.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, a proposal mediated by Qatar and Egypt. He urged Hamas to accept the deal, stating that the terms would not improve and that the situation would only worsen otherwise. This development comes ahead of a scheduled meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The war, which began after the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, has resulted in a significant number of casualties on both sides.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Minnesota has implemented the nation's most stringent law against PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," found in many consumer products and linked to serious health issues. The legislation, called "Amara's Law," is named after Amara Strande, who advocated for the ban while dying from a rare cancer at age 20. The law will phase out nonessential PFAS products by 2032. 3M, the company that developed and manufactured PFAS, has agreed to stop production and pay $850 million for state cleanup efforts, though no definitive link was proven between PFAS and Strande's illness.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has identified Microsoft, Nvidia, and Meta as the three standout performers of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks, as each finished the first half of the year at all-time highs. He noted that Microsoft's stock surged after its Azure cloud business beat growth expectations, driven by AI demand. Nvidia overcame early-year concerns to rally hard due to its continued dominance in the AI chip market. Cramer attributed Meta's success to its powerful advertising capabilities, which led to a blowout quarterly earnings report in April. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's economy demonstrated notable resilience during a turbulent first half of 2025, managing to navigate U.S. trade policy shifts while maintaining stable growth toward its 5% annual target. Despite this, experts warn that significant challenges lie ahead for the second half of the year. Analysts predict that export growth will likely slow or even contract due to the front-loading of orders and an expected slowdown in U.S. consumer demand. This suggests that while China has weathered the initial storm, the path forward remains an uphill climb. (not investment advice)</p>

Since 1970, the notes have featured notable historical figures, but future designs could celebrate themes like nature, innovation, architecture, or key historical events. This move could see figures like Winston Churchill and Jane Austen replaced with images of British wildlife or famous landmarks. The consultation aims to create notes that serve as a symbolic representation of the UK's collective national identity.</p>

          <p>Trent Alexander-Arnold's first month at Real Madrid has already proven financially successful for the club, effectively paying back the ¬£8.4 million fee they paid to sign him from Liverpool early.

The English right-back has started every game in the tournament, adapting to a new wing-back role under coach Xabi Alonso.

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed major reforms to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a move intended to spur housing construction by removing significant regulatory hurdles. The changes largely waive CEQA requirements for many housing projects in urban areas, eliminating the threat of lengthy environmental studies and lawsuits that have historically delayed or blocked development. While hurdles like interest rates and labor costs remain, this reform removes a key point of leverage used by project opponents. The goal is to address the state's severe housing affordability crisis.</p>
