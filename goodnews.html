          <p>Tesla's board of directors has unveiled a new long-term compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could potentially make him the world's first trillionaire. The package ties his earnings to achieving aggressive growth targets, including increasing Tesla's market capitalization to at least $8.5 trillion by 2035. This proposal, which requires shareholder approval, is designed to incentivize Musk to remain with the company and steer its focus toward AI and robotics. The plan has drawn criticism for its immense scale and potential implications for corporate governance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scotland's national football team has begun its World Cup qualification campaign on a positive note, securing a valuable point in a hard-fought draw against Denmark in Copenhagen. Manager Steve Clarke praised his team's work rate and resilience in a performance that puts one of their main group rivals on the back foot early in the tournament. Despite several players having limited club game time this season, the team demonstrated significant grit and defensive solidity. This result provides a hopeful foundation for Scotland as they aim to qualify for their first World Cup since 1998.</p>

          <p>Thirty years ago, Colombian goalkeeper Rene Higuita performed the legendary "scorpion kick" save during a friendly match against England at Wembley Stadium. This audacious move, where he cleared the ball by diving forward and kicking it with his heels over his back, cemented his legacy as one of football's most flamboyant and unconventional players. Known as 'El Loco' (The Madman), Higuita was a pioneer of the sweeper-keeper role, famous for his risk-taking style, goal-scoring abilities, and a career that was as controversial as it was brilliant. The scorpion kick remains an enduring symbol of his unique approach to the game.</p>

          <p>Canadian forward Olivia Smith, at just 21 years old, has made history by becoming the first £1 million player in women's football following her transfer from Liverpool to Arsenal. Her journey has been marked by a rapid ascent, having made her senior debut for Canada at age 15 and playing in semi-professional, collegiate, and professional leagues in three different countries in three years. Despite the immense pressure and high-profile moves, those who have coached her describe Smith as a down-to-earth and driven individual. Her record-breaking transfer fee is seen as a major milestone in the rapid financial growth of the women's game.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to terminate temporary legal protections for over one million migrants from Haiti and Venezuela. The ruling preserves the status of approximately 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians, allowing them to continue living and working in the United States. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen determined that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's decision to revoke the protections was arbitrary and capricious. This legal decision is a significant setback for the administration's broader crackdown on immigration programs like Temporary Protected Status (TPS).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An intense "talent war" has erupted in the tech industry, with giants like Meta, Google, and Microsoft offering multi-million dollar compensation packages to attract a small pool of elite AI researchers and engineers. This fierce competition is driven by the massive investment required to build and train advanced AI models, which can cost billions of dollars. Companies view paying a top engineer $10 million as a relatively small expense to protect their larger investment. The trend is causing wage inflation and making it difficult for startups and traditional industries to compete for the best minds in AI.</p>

          <p>China is actively engaging in party-to-party diplomacy, a key component of its foreign policy strategy, as demonstrated by President Xi Jinping's recent meetings with leaders from the world's other four ruling communist parties. This outreach is managed by the Communist Party’s International Department, which has established connections with over 600 political parties globally. While distinct from the state-level diplomacy conducted by the foreign ministry, these party-level interactions serve as an important channel for China to strengthen relationships and exert influence, particularly with ideologically aligned nations.</p>
