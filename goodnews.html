          <p>Levita Almuete Ferrer, a former State Department budget analyst, pleaded guilty to stealing over $650,000 from the agency over two years. Ferrer abused her signature authority, writing checks to herself and an associate, then attempted to conceal the scheme using Quickbooks by falsifying payee information. She faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and has agreed to pay full restitution to the U.S. government. Ferrer is scheduled to be sentenced in September, marking the end of a significant breach of trust within the State Department.</p>

          <p>Chinese government scientists have reported successful results from a weather modification experiment in Xinjiang, where cloud seeding drones increased rainfall by over 4% across a vast area. Using a small amount of silver iodide, the project generated enough additional precipitation to fill 30 Olympic-sized swimming pools. This test, conducted by the China Meteorological Administration, demonstrates the potential for weather modification technologies to alleviate water scarcity in arid regions. The findings were published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article critiques the panic surrounding ultra-processed baby foods, particularly pouches, arguing it's another way to induce maternal guilt. The author, a mother herself, acknowledges dietary concerns but questions the moral judgment placed on mothers who occasionally use pouches for convenience. She contends that the focus on foodwork, often disproportionately borne by women, reinforces traditional gender roles and ignores broader social and economic inequalities. The author advocates for a society that supports parents through improved parental leave, childcare, and reduced economic pressures, rather than condemning convenient food choices.</p>
