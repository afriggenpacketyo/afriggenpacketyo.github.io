          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men‚Äôs participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China.

          <p>European startup founders are resisting pressure to embrace China's '996' work culture, citing concerns about overwork and its impact on employee wellbeing. Venture capitalists sparked debate by suggesting European startups need to adopt a more intense work ethic to compete globally.

They emphasize the importance of sustainable innovation cultures and work-life balance.</p>
