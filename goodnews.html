          <p>Chicago is implementing various strategies to resist President Trump's immigration policies, building on its history of protecting immigrant communities. These include "Know Your Rights" campaigns, community meetings, and rapid-response groups to monitor Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity. Despite increased volunteer interest, there is still fear among immigrants in Chicago as deportations rise. The city's Welcoming City ordinance restricts city agencies from sharing information on undocumented immigrants with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, showcasing Chicago's pro-immigrant stance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reducing home energy consumption can be achieved through simple and inexpensive methods, according to experts. Opening windows for natural ventilation and utilizing ceiling fans can significantly decrease reliance on air conditioning. Making roofs reflective and installing exterior shades can help minimize heat absorption during hot months. Sealing air leaks around windows and doors is crucial for preventing heat from escaping in cooler months, resulting in lower energy bills and reduced environmental impact. These measures promote climate-friendly living and enhance resilience to global warming.</p>

Sir David Attenborough has warned that bottom trawling is destructive, and President Macron called for a moratorium on deep sea mining.

          <p>Canadian farmers are expected to shift towards planting more spring wheat due to the impact of Chinese and U.S. tariffs on canola. China's tariffs on Canadian canola meal and oil, along with the threat of duties on canola seed, have made wheat a more attractive option. Improved wheat varieties and government support are also incentivizing this shift. This change in crop selection illustrates how global trade turmoil is influencing agricultural practices in Canada and the United States (not investment advice).</p>
