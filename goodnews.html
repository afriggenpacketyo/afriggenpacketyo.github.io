          <p>Southwest Airlines announced a surprise profit for the third quarter, reporting adjusted earnings per share of 11 cents and revenue of $6.95 billion, exceeding analyst estimates. The carrier anticipates continued robust travel demand and higher fares for the fourth quarter, forecasting a 1% to 3% rise in unit revenue and a 6% increase in capacity compared to the previous year. This positive outlook, however, comes after the reaffirmation of a reduced full-year earnings forecast from earlier in 2025. The article notes Southwest's strategic initiatives, such as modifying its long-standing policies on open seating and free checked bags, are aimed at improving its competitive stance within the airline industry and driving future sales growth.</p>

          <p>The Minnesota Supreme Court unanimously ruled that USA Powerlifting discriminated against transgender athlete JayCee Cooper by prohibiting her from competing in the women's division in 2018, violating the state's Human Rights Act. The article notes that while the court found the policy facially discriminatory, it sent part of the case back to a lower court to determine if USA Powerlifting had a "legitimate business purpose" for the exclusion. The organization maintains that biological males have a physical advantage, advocating for fair play and having created an open MX division for all gender identities. Republicans in Minnesota have condemned the decision, citing concerns for safety and fairness in women's sports.</p>

          <p>IBM announced third-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street estimates, reporting adjusted earnings per share of $2.65 and revenue of $16.33 billion, largely propelled by ongoing artificial intelligence tailwinds. The company further boosted its full-year revenue growth guidance to "more than" 5% and increased its free cash flow estimate to $14 billion. Despite these positive financial achievements and an expanding AI book of business, which now surpasses $9.5 million, IBM's stock unexpectedly dropped 5% in extended trading. The article underscores IBM's strategic emphasis on AI for enhancing productivity and cost-cutting, including its prior decision to replace hundreds of human resources positions with AI solutions.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 16:27:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) indicates that traditional savings accounts yield minimal returns, averaging only 0.40%, which is insufficient to combat inflation. This article highlights the stark contrast with high-yield savings accounts, which currently offer competitive interest rates typically between 4.20% and 4.30%, with potentially higher rates available online. The piece provides examples demonstrating that, based on initial deposit amounts, savers could earn hundreds of dollars annually, benefiting significantly from compounding interest. It also advises considering Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts for their fixed rates, which offer protection against anticipated future rate cuts, providing a stable alternative for long-term savings despite less liquidity.

          <h2>Wholesale Turkey Prices Soar Ahead of Thanksgiving Due to Supply Shortages</h2>

          <p>Wholesale turkey prices are projected to surge by 40% this year, reaching $1.32 per pound, primarily driven by a reduced supply stemming from avian flu outbreaks and slightly weakened demand. The article highlights that over 3 million turkeys have been affected by the bird flu, contributing to a 3% decrease in the overall turkey population raised by farmers compared to the previous year. Despite this significant increase in wholesale costs, economists and experts suggest that consumer prices at the grocery store may not experience an equivalent jump. This is because retailers frequently employ turkeys as "loss leaders," pricing them competitively—sometimes even below cost—to draw customers into their stores for holiday shopping.</p>

          <h2>Economic Study Predicts Larger Tax Refunds for Americans Next Year Due to New Tax Law</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 16:10:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An economic analysis by Oxford Economics indicates that many Americans are likely to receive larger tax refunds next year when they file their 2025 tax returns. This projected increase, potentially totaling an additional $50 billion in taxpayer savings, is primarily driven by new, retroactive provisions within the Republicans' "one big, beautiful bill" act. The article explains that this legislation not only extended tax reductions from 2017 but also introduced new benefits, including the elimination of taxes on certain overtime and tipped income, and a significant increase in the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000. However, the study also notes that a disproportionate share of these new tax breaks is expected to benefit higher-income households.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team experienced a "timely reality check" with a defeat against Australia in the Women's World Cup, bringing their unbeaten run to an end. Despite this loss, the article acknowledges England's significant improvements and competitive spells compared to their previous encounters with the formidable Australian side. However, Australia's unparalleled depth and ruthless efficiency, particularly highlighted by Annabel Sutherland's nearly century-making innings and Ash Gardner's aggressive half-century, ultimately secured their victory. The piece critically points out England's middle-order batting inconsistencies and their inability to effectively counter Australia's leg-spin, underscoring that sustained, near-perfect performance is essential to challenge such an all-conquering opponent in major tournaments.</p>

The article highlights that the White House Historical Association undertook a comprehensive digital scanning and photography project to create an enduring historical record of the East Wing and its gardens prior to the demolition.

Subsequent search warrants led to the seizure of substantial amounts of cocaine and fentanyl, along with multiple firearms, stolen vehicles, and over $170,000 in U.S. currency. This successful prosecution and sentencing underscore the collaborative efforts of local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies to dismantle drug networks, remove dangerous offenders from communities, and address the proliferation of illegal drugs.</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve continues its rate-cut campaign, the article advises credit card borrowers to consider whether incremental cuts will offer tangible relief or if debt relief options are more beneficial. It highlights that even with anticipated cuts in October and December, totaling less than a full percentage point, the impact on average credit card rates (around 21%) will be minimal, as these rates are also influenced by the prime rate and often don't reflect cuts proportionally. Given that compounding interest quickly makes debt prohibitive, the article urges a proactive approach, exploring available debt forgiveness, management programs, or consolidation loans.

Kalshi's CEO anticipates similar partnerships with other sports leagues soon. However, the American Gaming Association (AGA) voiced strong objections, asserting that these platforms function as unregulated gambling, offering sports wagers nationwide to individuals as young as 18. Despite these regulatory concerns, the NHL expressed confidence in the platforms' integrity and sees the partnership as a unique opportunity to attract new fan demographics.</p>

Portier emphasizes the tightly-knit nature of the global fine jewelry market, asserting that dealers worldwide are now fully aware of the high-profile robbery and possess detailed descriptions of the unique, historic pieces.
