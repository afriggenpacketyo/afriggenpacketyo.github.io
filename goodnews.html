          <p>President Trump has been actively engaged in peace brokering, including lifting sanctions on Syria, negotiating the release of a U.S. citizen held by Hamas, ending military strikes on Houthi fighters in Yemen, slashing tariffs on China, ordering Ukraine to hold talks with Russia, and claiming responsibility for a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. This article suggests this flurry of activity reveals Trump's desire for a world of interstate relations based on trade rather than war, with a focus on American interests. The author notes that Trump's approach often involves impulsive decision-making without wider internal government discussion, which can lead to inconsistencies and confusion among diplomats.</p>

          <p>Brock Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers have agreed to a five-year, $265 million contract extension, with $181 million guaranteed. Purdy, the final pick of the 2022 NFL draft, has defied expectations, leading the 49ers to back-to-back playoff appearances. The extension solidifies Purdy's role as the franchise quarterback and places him among the highest-paid quarterbacks in the league. Purdy is expected to lead the 49ers back into playoff contention after a disappointing finish last year.</p>

          <p>Broader use of life jackets and more fences around swimming pools could save hundreds of lives each year, according to new modeling from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers. Out of 4,509 drowning deaths reported in 2022, the CDC's modeling found that 51 likely could have been prevented by better pool fencing, and 297 could have been prevented by victims wearing a life jacket during a boating accident. Researchers had worked for the agency's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, which had been responsible for the federal government's work studying drowning prevention and other leading causes of injury.</p>

          <p>Pep Guardiola, the manager of Man City, has expressed his dissatisfaction with the scheduling of the Bournemouth game shortly after the FA Cup final. Guardiola thinks there should have been a greater willingness to nudge back City's game after the demands of a cup final. With 60, Tottenham and United will both play more matches than any other Premier League club this season following their runs in the Europa League. The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss suggested his side have been chosen to play FA Cup semi-finals on a Saturday so often because broadcasters feel there are "more followers" for the Sunday game, with Guardiola saying: "They are tired to see us."</p>
