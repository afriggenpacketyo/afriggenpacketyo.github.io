          <p>In response to the catastrophic floods in south central Texas that have resulted in numerous fatalities and missing persons, NASA has dispatched specialized aircraft to aid in search and recovery operations. A high-altitude WB-57 aircraft equipped with a high-resolution imaging sensor is conducting aerial surveys of the Guadalupe River area to accelerate emergency response. Additionally, a Gulfstream III aircraft with advanced radar that can detect water through vegetation is collecting data to map the extent of the flooding. This data will help response teams assess damage to infrastructure and allocate resources more effectively.</p>

          <p>Paris Saint-Germain secured a decisive 4-1 victory over Real Madrid in the Club World Cup semi-final at MetLife Stadium. PSG dominated the match from the beginning, scoring three goals within the first half-hour, with Fabián Ruiz netting two and Ousmane Dembélé adding another. Real Madrid, featuring former PSG star Kylian Mbappé, was unable to mount a competitive response against the relentless pressure and fluid play of the French champions. A late goal by Gonçalo Ramos sealed the comprehensive win, sending PSG to the final and showcasing their current powerhouse status in world football.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to lift a lower court's injunction against a new Florida law that criminalizes the entry of undocumented immigrants into the state. This decision keeps the law, signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, on hold while legal challenges proceed. A federal judge had previously ruled that the state law likely oversteps into the federal government's exclusive authority over immigration policy. The law, which would have made it a felony for certain migrants to enter Florida, was challenged by civil liberties groups who argued it was unconstitutional and cruel.</p>

          <p>India's women's cricket team claimed a historic T20 series win against England, securing an unassailable 3-1 lead with a comfortable six-wicket victory at Old Trafford. After restricting England to a modest 126-7, India's openers provided a strong start, and the team chased down the target with three overs to spare. England's batting struggled against India's spin bowlers, failing to build momentum throughout their innings. The victory marks India's first-ever women's T20 series win on English soil, highlighting the team's strong form and tactical superiority in the matchup.</p>

This custom solution was necessary because commercially available options were too slow to implement or would not work at the scale AWS requires.

Despite recent weeks of trading within a tight range, bullish sentiment is growing due to increased corporate buying and the potential for new U.S. crypto legislation.

          <p>As part of a major spending bill signed into law, the maximum child tax credit will increase from $2,000 to $2,200 per eligible child, beginning in 2026.

To qualify for the full credit, parents must have an annual income of $200,000 or less for single filers, or $400,000 for joint filers. However, the legislation does not expand eligibility rules, meaning the increase will primarily benefit middle- and high-income families, while millions of children in the lowest-income households will still not receive the full benefit.

Major lenders have welcomed the change, stating it will help those struggling to save for a deposit amid high rent and living costs.
