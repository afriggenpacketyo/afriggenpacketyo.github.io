          <p>British-South African endurance athlete Lewis Pugh completed a 60-mile swim around Martha's Vineyard to raise awareness about shark conservation, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the film "Jaws."

Cumulative profits at major industrial firms climbed 3% year-on-year, accelerating from 2.6% in March, according to official data. The growth is attributed to Beijing's measures aimed at supporting businesses, particularly in the equipment and high-tech manufacturing sectors. Profits in the high-tech manufacturing industry increased by 9% from January to April, while the automobile sector faced headwinds due to intense price competition (not investment advice).</p>

She appreciates the circular nature of the ending, where June begins to tell the story that becomes the book. Moss notes that the ending shows how little is truly resolved, with June's daughter still trapped in Gilead, setting the stage for the sequel series, "The Testaments."</p>
