          <h2>Bipartisan Bill Aims to Make Childbirth Free in the US</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 07:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan bill, the Supporting Healthy Moms and Babies Act, has been introduced in the Senate to require private insurance companies to fully cover all childbirth-related expenses without co-pays or deductibles, aiming to alleviate the financial burden on families. The bill has garnered support from both reproductive health advocates and anti-abortion groups, reflecting a rare consensus on the issue. The proposed legislation would expand the Affordable Care Act's essential health benefits to include prenatal, birth, and postpartum care. The bill's origins trace back to an Atlantic article challenging the anti-abortion movement to support policies that help families, though questions remain about whether eliminating childbirth costs would actually boost birth rates or reduce abortions. Optimism exists among bill supporters due to converging forces creating a window for bipartisan family policy, though challenges remain regarding fiscal restraint and potential accusations of supporting socialized medicine.</p>

          <p>Chelsea has emerged as the frontrunner to sign striker Liam Delap from Ipswich after his ¬£30 million release clause was activated following Ipswich's relegation from the Premier League. Delap's decision was influenced by Chelsea's Champions League qualification and the presence of Cole Palmer, along with having the youngest squad in the Premier League. Manchester United, Everton, Nottingham Forest, and Newcastle also expressed interest, but Chelsea's co-owner Behdad Eghbali met with Delap's agent, and head coach Enzo Maresca directly pitched to the player. Delap's next decision involves choosing between playing for England Under-21s or joining his new club for the Club World Cup.</p>

          <p>India's economy expanded at an annual rate of 7.4% in the quarter ending in March, surpassing expectations despite global economic uncertainty. This growth marks the strongest quarterly performance of the fiscal year 2025, with the overall economy expanding by 6.5% during the full fiscal year. Strong domestic consumption and lower dependence on exports have contributed to India's robust growth outlook, helping to offset the impact of U.S. trade policies. The article notes the potential for India to secure a trade deal with the U.S. following agreements with China and the U.K.</p>

          <p>Adam Riess, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, is challenging the standard model of cosmology, particularly the theory of dark energy, which he helped establish. Riess's work on measuring the expansion rate of the universe has revealed discrepancies, known as the Hubble tension, that suggest the standard model may be flawed. While some cosmologists remain skeptical, Riess believes the Hubble tension will grow more pronounced, leading to a reevaluation of the universe's ultimate fate. Recent data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) hints that dark energy may be weakening, potentially altering the understanding of the universe's future.</p>
