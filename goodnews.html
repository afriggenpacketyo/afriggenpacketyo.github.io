          <p>The U.S. government has acquired a significant ownership stake in Intel, a strategic move to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing amid intense competition with China. This initiative, funded by the CHIPS and Science Act, aims to mitigate national security risks by reducing reliance on foreign chip suppliers like Taiwan's TSMC. While praised as a vital step for supply chain security, experts express concern that government involvement could lead to political pressure influencing Intel's corporate decision-making.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) represents a significant gathering of Asian powers like China, Russia, and India, it lacks the foundational economic institutions to create a new world order. The author suggests that political declarations are insufficient without a comprehensive framework akin to the Bretton Woods agreement that structured the post-war Western world. For the SCO's influence to be transformative, it must establish complex trade and financial systems to prevent further global fragmentation.</p>

As the second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his status underscores the ongoing debate about Japan's male-only succession laws. With only two male heirs younger than the current emperor, the ceremony has renewed public discussion about whether the rules should be changed to allow female members to ascend the throne.</p>

          <p>The board of directors at Tesla has put forth a new compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could potentially elevate his net worth to over a trillion dollars. The "super ambitious" package ties his earnings to achieving aggressive growth targets, including increasing Tesla's market capitalization to $8.5 trillion by 2035. This proposal, which requires shareholder approval, is seen as an incentive to retain Musk and ensure his focus on transforming Tesla into a leader in AI and robotics, though it has raised concerns about corporate governance.</p>

          <p>Scotland's national football team earned a valuable point in their World Cup qualifying campaign with a draw against Denmark in Copenhagen. Manager Steve Clarke praised his team's work-rate and resilience in a performance that puts one of their main group rivals on the back foot early in the competition. The result is seen as a promising, if understated, start for a team that has historically struggled in the early stages of World Cup qualification, offering hope for their bid to reach the finals for the first time since 1998.</p>
