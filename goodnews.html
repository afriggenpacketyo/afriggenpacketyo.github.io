          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief serving a 30-year sentence for murder and sexual assault, was recaptured after escaping from an Arkansas prison. Hardin had impersonated a corrections officer to escape, triggering a nearly two-week manhunt involving helicopters, drones, and K9 units, with assistance from a U.S. Border Patrol tactical unit. Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders thanked law enforcement for their efforts, highlighting the Trump administration's support. Hardin's capture brings relief to the community, which had been on high alert due to concerns about his potential to harm others.</p>

          <p>The South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) rejected a proposal to impose surcharges on gas-powered appliances aimed at improving air quality. The measures would have added fees to the sale of gas furnaces and water heaters, incentivizing manufacturers to meet sales targets for electric alternatives. Board members opposing the measure argued it would penalize residents by raising appliance costs, while proponents emphasized the need for tough decisions to improve air quality and avoid federal penalties.
