          <p>Financial experts are examining whether buying an annuity is a wise decision for individuals at age 70, highlighting both potential benefits and drawbacks. For healthy individuals with a long life expectancy, an annuity can provide a guaranteed, higher-paying income stream, especially in the current high-interest-rate environment. However, the decision involves trade-offs such as illiquidity of the principal, potentially high fees, and reduced inheritance for heirs. The article suggests that the optimal age depends heavily on personal health, financial goals, and existing income sources. (not investment advice)</p>

In a broadcast address, Yunus confirmed that his caretaker government would transfer power to an elected government following the vote.

The decision follows a strong second-quarter report where DuPont surpassed sales and earnings expectations, driven by significant profit margin expansion and better-than-expected cash flow. Management also raised its full-year outlook and reaffirmed the November 1 spin-off date for its electronics business, Qnity. The club views the stock's muted reaction to the positive news as a buying opportunity. (not investment advice)</p>

The announcement was spurred by the earlier-than-expected departure of Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, accelerating Trump's timeline for influencing the central bank's direction.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024, continuing a downward trend from the spike seen after the COVID-19 pandemic. The report, compiled from data covering over 95% of the U.S. population, shows a 4.5% drop in violent crime and an 8.1% decrease in property crime. Notably, the murder rate fell by 14.9%, and motor vehicle thefts saw a historic one-year drop of 18.6%. While experts note the positive trend, they also caution that aggravated assaults remain high compared to pre-pandemic levels.</p>

          <p>A new analysis suggests that Yum Brands, the parent company of KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, has become a key incubator for future leaders in the restaurant industry. Many executives who started or spent significant time at Yum have gone on to lead major rival chains, including the CEOs of Starbucks, Brinker International, and Cracker Barrel. Experts attribute this trend to the company's strong focus on leadership development, its massive global footprint, and a "people first" culture established by past CEOs. The intense internal competition for top roles often leads high-performing executives to seek CEO positions elsewhere.</p>
