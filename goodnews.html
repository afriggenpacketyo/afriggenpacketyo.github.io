          <p>President Trump signed an order confirming parts of a trade agreement between the UK and US, reducing tariffs on UK cars shipped to the US, but maintaining a 10% levy on most UK goods, including cars. The agreement allows up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, instead of the 25% import tax imposed earlier in the year. The order also said the US would set up a similar system for steel and aluminium, but did not specify what it would be, though the UK government said it would "continue to go further and make progress towards 0% tariffs on core steel products as agreed". The deal will come into effect seven days following its official publication.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Supreme Court has rejected an attempt to revive the copyright trial over Ed Sheeran's hit song "Thinking Out Loud," ending a decade-long legal battle. Structured Asset Sales (SAS) claimed Sheeran's song copied Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On," but the court sided with previous rulings in Sheeran's favor. Amy Wadge, co-writer of "Thinking Out Loud," expressed immense relief, stating the trials had "haunted" her for 10 years. The legal dispute began in 2016, with Townsend's family seeking $100m in damages, but Sheeran's team successfully argued that the shared chord pattern was a common element in pop music.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece on Fox News argues that President Trump has dominated international events since returning to office, particularly in the Iran-Israel conflict. The author suggests Trump tacitly approved Israel's strikes on Iran after Iran failed to negotiate on its nuclear weapons program. Trump's approach is described as "masterful ambiguity," drawing parallels to historical figures who employed similar strategies. The piece praises Trump's messaging on various issues, including border security and military strength, and expresses hope for the success of his remaining time in office.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With air travel becoming increasingly unreliable, travel experts offer advice on how to handle flight delays and cancellations. Key strategies include rebooking online while in line, calling customer service hotlines in other languages, and seeking assistance at airport lounges. Passengers should also know their entitlements from the airline and check their travel insurance coverage. Booking early-morning flights and direct routes can minimize the risk of disruptions, while maintaining a polite demeanor with customer service representatives can improve the chances of receiving refunds or flight credits.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Al-Hilal's chief executive stated that a loan move for Cristiano Ronaldo before the Club World Cup would have been "completely counter-intuitive" because he plays for their "biggest opponent," Al-Nassr. Despite FIFA introducing an additional transfer window, the CEO explained that signing Ronaldo, who is out of contract at Al-Nassr at the end of June, for only a few weeks would not be strategic. He added that while he respects Ronaldo, bringing the biggest player from their rival team for such a short period didn't make sense. The club is still looking to reinforce the team in the traditional transfer window after the tournament.</p>
