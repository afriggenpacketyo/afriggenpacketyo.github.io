          <p>Nearly six decades after the first moon landing, space agencies and commercial companies are setting their sights on the moon once again, driven by its rich resources and strategic value. NASA's Artemis program and a joint China-Russia project are planning to establish permanent lunar bases for scientific research and as a stepping stone for future Mars missions. The moon's resources, including iron, silicon, hydrogen, titanium, rare earth elements, and water ice, could be used for self-sufficiency and even rocket propellant production. These lunar missions aim to advance scientific knowledge, develop technologies for long-term space travel, and potentially establish a hub for further exploration.</p>

He acknowledged the constant speculation surrounding his name whenever the Tottenham position becomes available but affirmed his focus on his present responsibilities with the national team. The USMNT recently lost to Turkey in a friendly match, but Pochettino highlighted the team's improved performance compared to previous outings.</p>

          <p>Researchers have utilized a rare mineral, tellurium, primarily produced in China, to develop an artificial retina that restored sight in blind animals and granted them the ability to see infrared light. This breakthrough offers significant potential for treating human blindness, according to the scientists involved. The study detailed how nanowire implants made from tellurium were used in a biocompatible device that restored vision in blind mice and a monkey, while also enabling them to perceive "invisible" light. Tellurium's photoelectric properties allow it to convert visible light and infrared radiation into electrical energy, serving as a replacement for photoreceptor cells in the retina.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates, offering a fresh approach to China's demographic challenges. Researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong argue that subsidies for fathers produce higher long-term fertility gains than subsidizing mothers alone. The findings come as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The study also found that traditional expectations persist in China, placing the burden on women for most childcare duties.</p>
