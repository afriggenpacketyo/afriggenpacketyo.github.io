          <p>President Trump has publicly confirmed he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15 to discuss a potential resolution to the war in Ukraine. This high-stakes summit coincides with a Trump-imposed deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face severe new economic sanctions, including secondary tariffs on its trade partners. While Trump has expressed optimism about brokering peace, which he suggested might involve territorial swaps, the actual terms of any deal remain highly uncertain. The meeting marks the first direct talks between Putin and a U.S. president since 2021.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new documentary, “It’s Never Over, Jeff Buckley,” provides a loving and honest portrait of the late musician, focusing on his complex life rather than a narrative of inescapable fate. The film uses archival material and interviews with close friends and family to explore his turbulent upbringing, his creative development in New York, and his conflicted feelings about fame. This article's review praises the film for dimensionalizing Buckley beyond his one-album legacy and for thoughtfully handling his tragic 1997 death as an accident. It presents a sensitive and intimate look at the artist's life and struggles.</p>

He was also part of the pioneering Apollo 8 mission, the first to orbit the Moon, and his life inspired the 1995 film "Apollo 13."

          <p>Independent Member of Parliament Rupert Lowe has admitted to mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants" in a social media post. After alerting authorities and vowing to ensure their deportation, it was revealed the boat's crew was rowing to raise money for motor neurone disease research. The crew, which includes a former Royal Marine, found the incident humorous. In a subsequent post, Lowe apologized for the false alarm and pledged a £1,000 donation to their cause, turning the gaffe into a positive contribution.</p>

          <p>Apple shares experienced their largest weekly gain in over five years, rising 13% and adding more than $400 billion to its market capitalization. The surge followed CEO Tim Cook's visit to the White House, where he announced plans to spend $100 billion on American parts and companies. President Trump stated that Apple's commitment to U.S. manufacturing would exempt it from potential future tariffs on imported chips, alleviating investor concerns about a significant blow to the company's profitability. The positive news compounded a strong recent earnings report for the tech giant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from Realtor.com indicates that median home listing prices are falling in some U.S. regions, particularly in the South and West, offering some relief in a tight housing market. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen the most significant price drops since the market peak in 2022, largely due to an increase in housing inventory from new construction and homes staying on the market longer. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to see rising prices and limited supply. The data highlights a growing divergence in housing market conditions across the country.

          <p>Shares of rare earth miner MP Materials rose after the company reported a narrower second-quarter loss and record production of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide, a critical component in high-strength magnets. The company's sales jumped 84% year-over-year, fueling investor optimism about its path to profitability. This progress follows a major investment from the U.S. Department of Defense, which purchased $400 million in preferred stock, making the government its largest shareholder.

One such project is a nickel processing plant in North Dakota, supported by a $114 million Department of Energy grant, which will process ore for use in electric vehicle batteries and defense applications. This push, initiated under the Biden administration and continued by President Trump, aims to reduce reliance on foreign sources like China, which dominates the global market for many strategic raw materials.</p>
