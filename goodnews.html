          <p>Ecuador has extradited José Adolfo Macías Villamar, the notorious leader of the "Los Choneros" drug gang, to the United States. Known as "Fito," he faces federal charges in New York for importing thousands of pounds of cocaine into the U.S. The extradition occurred after Macías was recaptured in June following a prison escape, where he was serving a 34-year sentence for murder and organized crime. His gang is known for its extreme violence and use of military-grade weapons, and this move marks a significant step in the cooperation between the two nations to combat transnational criminal organizations.</p>

          <p>A research team from China and Singapore has developed an innovative nanovaccine that has successfully suppressed cancer recurrence and metastasis in animal trials. The bio-inspired approach, detailed in the journal Nature Nanotechnology, targets cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are responsible for tumor growth and spread. By addressing these resilient cells, the vaccine holds significant potential for developing personalized cancer treatments in the future. The findings represent a promising step forward in the ongoing fight against cancer, aiming to prevent the disease from returning after initial treatment.</p>

          <h2>Venture Capitalists Rely on 'Power Law' to Identify High-Potential Startups</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 03:48:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Venture capitalists utilize a principle known as the "power law" to guide their investment decisions, focusing on startups with the potential for massive, outlier returns. This strategy acknowledges that a small number of highly successful investments, like Spotify or Klarna, will generate the vast majority of a fund's profits, outweighing all other losses combined. According to Peter Specht of Creandum, VCs seek founders who can pitch a compelling vision for why their company can become a category-defining leader. This involves demonstrating a unique market solution and showcasing the founder's exceptional drive and ambition for outsized growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Major Review Proposes Sweeping Reforms for England and Wales Water Industry</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 03:27:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive review of the water industry in England and Wales has recommended the most significant reforms since its privatization over 30 years ago. Authored by Sir Jon Cunliffe, the report includes 88 proposals, such as abolishing the current regulator, Ofwat, and implementing stronger environmental regulations. The proposals aim to address systemic issues like underinvestment, leaking infrastructure, and sewage spills by enforcing minimum capital levels and blocking unsuitable ownership changes. While these reforms are expected to lead to higher customer bills to fund over £100 billion in necessary upgrades, they are designed to ensure long-term resilience and prevent future crises.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The inquiry will investigate the events of June 18, 1984, when thousands of police officers clashed with striking miners in Rotherham, as well as the aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of 95 miners based on what was later described as discredited evidence. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that the inquiry aims to answer questions that have persisted for over 40 years. Campaigners, who have long called for this, expressed cautious elation at the news.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is meeting with executives from top companies like Siemens and Deutsche Bank to encourage fresh domestic investment and restore confidence in the nation's struggling economy. After two years of recession, the "Made for Germany" initiative aims to secure private sector commitments to supplement public spending on infrastructure and climate. This economic push comes as survivors of abuse within the Catholic Church are formally urging the Vatican to take action against Cologne Cardinal Rainer Maria Woelki. They accuse him of mishandling abuse cases and shielding perpetrators, adding to years of controversy in the archdiocese.</p>

          <p>China is set to begin importing significant quantities of iron ore from Guinea and Algeria this year, thanks to the completion of critical infrastructure projects led by Chinese firms. For years, logistical bottlenecks, specifically the lack of railways connecting remote mines to coastal ports, have hindered exports from these African nations. In Guinea, the massive Simandou mine is now on track to start shipments in November. Similarly, a new railway will connect Algeria's Gara Djebilet mine in the Sahara to Mediterranean ports, securing new resource streams for China's industrial needs.</p>

          <p>A technologically advanced British F-35B fighter jet, which has been grounded at an airport in Kerala, India, for over five weeks, is finally scheduled to fly out. The stealth jet was diverted due to bad weather during a sortie from the HMS Prince of Wales carrier and subsequently developed a technical issue that local engineers could not fix. The prolonged stay of the $110 million aircraft prompted the deployment of a 14-person specialist team from the UK to conduct repairs. The incident sparked widespread curiosity and questions about how such a modern military asset could remain stranded for so long.</p>

          <p>Despite years of severe U.S. trade restrictions, Chinese tech giant Huawei has transformed itself into a formidable competitor across the entire artificial intelligence landscape. The company has expanded beyond its telecom roots into advanced semiconductors, data centers, and large language models, positioning itself as China's primary alternative to U.S. chip leader Nvidia. U.S. sanctions ironically pushed Huawei to innovate and become a state-backed national champion, developing its own AI hardware and software ecosystem, like the Ascend chips and CANN software. This strategic pivot has made Huawei a highly competent player in multiple complex technology sectors.</p>

          <p>The struggling Chinese rust-belt city of Hegang is gambling on a new 1.2 billion yuan airport and increased trade with Russia to revitalize its economy. The city, located in the northern province of Heilongjiang, has suffered from industrial decline, a shrinking population, and stagnant GDP. Scheduled to open in 2027, the Luobei Airport is expected to handle 450,000 passengers and 1,600 tonnes of cargo annually. This infrastructure investment is part of a broader strategy by the local government to create new economic opportunities and reverse years of decline by improving connectivity and fostering cross-border commerce.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing body of evidence suggests that popular GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy could be a game-changing treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder. Women with PCOS often suffer from insulin resistance, and studies indicate that losing as little as 5% of body weight can improve this, in turn helping to regulate hormones and alleviate symptoms like irregular periods and infertility. While not yet approved for this use, many women in trials and anecdotal reports have experienced significant improvements. However, the high cost and lack of insurance coverage for this unapproved use remain major barriers to access.</p>
