Foley expressed confidence in the company's ability to mitigate the financial impact, noting strong consumer demand for flavor and at-home cooking.

          <p>For the first time since its launch, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has captured direct images of what is believed to be a previously undiscovered exoplanet. The celestial body, named TWA 7b, orbits a young star and is estimated to be similar in mass to Saturn. Scientists utilized high-contrast imaging and a coronagraph, a tool that blocks a star's bright glare, to reveal the faint object. While a small possibility remains that the object is a background galaxy, researchers state the evidence strongly suggests it is a planet. The discovery could provide new insights into planetary formation and debris disks around young stars.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans have agreed to remove a contentious tax provision from President Trump's major spending bill following a request from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The provision, known as Section 899, would have allowed taxes on foreign-owned companies and investors from countries deemed to have unfair tax policies, a measure critics called a "revenge tax." Bessent requested its removal after reaching an understanding with G7 countries on a global tax deal, stating it would provide greater stability for the global economy. The removal complicates Republican efforts to offset the costs of the massive legislative package ahead of a July Fourth deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A California appeals court has dismissed the remaining criminal charges against Diana Teran, a top advisor to former Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc√≥n. Teran was accused of improperly downloading and using confidential police discipline records. The court ruled unanimously that Teran's actions were not criminal because the documents she accessed were public court records, and the computer crime statute used to charge her was misapplied. The decision is a significant rebuke to the California Attorney General's office, which brought the politically charged prosecution that was heavily criticized by criminal justice reform advocates.</p>
