          <p>A rare and intense dust storm swept through northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, plunging the region into near-total darkness during the day. The National Weather Service issued dust storm warnings, marking the first time such a warning was issued for Chicago. The storm, driven by strong winds over exceptionally dry soil, significantly reduced visibility, creating hazardous conditions on major highways and at airports. The event is considered unusual, reminiscent of dust storms from the Dust Bowl era, with soil moisture levels at record lows. The article highlights the storm's impact on visibility and transportation, as well as the meteorological conditions that led to its formation.</p>

          <p>Europe is experiencing a renaissance in sleeper train travel, driven by environmental concerns and a desire to compete with short-haul flights. The European Union plans to double high-speed rail traffic by 2030, linking major cities. In contrast, the United States is cutting funding for public infrastructure and prioritizing cars and planes. The article argues that America's car-centric culture has led to increased congestion and unhappiness, while its investment in transit remains limited. It contrasts America's focus on niche projects like the Hyperloop with China's successful high-speed rail network, highlighting the need for consistency, conviction, and adequate funding to revitalize American railways.</p>
