          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will sign an executive order to terminate the majority of U.S. sanctions against Syria, aiming to support the country's stability following the collapse of the Assad regime. This move follows months of lobbying by Syria's new transitional government, which argues the sanctions have hindered economic recovery and reconstruction. While broad sanctions will be lifted to encourage new investment, targeted sanctions will remain on former president Bashar al-Assad, his associates, and entities linked to human rights abuses or terrorism.</p>

          <p>A key provision in President Trump's proposed spending bill would eliminate federal income taxes on tips for service workers, a move the White House champions as relief for the working class. However, the proposal is receiving criticism for its limited scope and temporary nature, as the tax cut would expire in 2028. Policy analysts note that over a third of tipped workers earn too little to pay federal income tax anyway, meaning they would not benefit. Critics argue that raising the federal minimum wage would be a more effective way to help low-wage workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A coalition of major Democratic groups, including the DNC, is launching a new "Organizing Summer" program to rebuild voter engagement following defeats in the 2024 elections. The effort will focus on registering voters and mobilizing volunteers in communities where the party's message is not always heard, preparing for the 2025 and 2026 elections. With an initial six-figure investment, the program aims to counter the Republican agenda and address internal party friction that has emerged in recent months. The initiative represents a strategic push to reconnect with voters at a grassroots level.</p>

After struggling mightily through April, Muncy discovered he had astigmatism and began wearing glasses, but the real breakthrough came during a May 9 at-bat where a simplified approach led to a mechanical epiphany. Since that game, he has become one of baseball's most productive hitters, leading the majors in RBIs over that span.

          <p>In England's recent Test victory over India, the performance of fast bowler Josh Tongue in dismissing India's lower-order batsmen was a decisive factor. An analysis in this article highlights that quickly and ruthlessly removing the "tail" is a critical, often overlooked skill in Test cricket, preventing opponents from adding valuable late-inning runs. Tongue's aggressive and intimidating bowling was particularly effective, taking three wickets in each innings against India's last four batsmen. This ability to prevent the opposition's tail from "wagging" will be essential for England's success in future series, including the upcoming Ashes.</p>
