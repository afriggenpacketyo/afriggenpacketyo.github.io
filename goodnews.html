          <p>A UBS report indicates that the United States added approximately 379,000 new millionaires in 2024, averaging over a thousand each day and increasing the total count to 23.8 million. This growth is attributed to a strong performance on Wall Street and a stable U.S. dollar, despite a rocky start to 2025 due to trade war concerns and recession fears impacting the markets and the dollar's value. While it's too early to determine if the rate of wealth growth will slow, the resilience of American real estate and the potential for U.S. equities to recover offer some optimism for the remainder of the year. (not investment advice) The overall state of the economy seems to be robust despite the initial turbulence.</p>

          <p>Adam Ratcliffe, a former corporate employee turned adventurer, has joined three ex-Royal Marines in an attempt to break the world record for rowing across the North Atlantic, departing from New Jersey with the goal of reaching the British Isles of Scilly in under 43 days. The team, "United We Conquer," aims to raise ¬£50,000 for Head Up, a mental health charity supporting the British armed forces community. Teammate Jack Jarvis, a 12-year British army veteran, views the challenge as a way to regain a sense of purpose after leaving military service, while Ratcliffe seeks to inspire others struggling with mental health to take control of their environment. The journey is dangerous, with the team using Starlink technology for communication, but they are determined to complete the voyage and raise awareness for their cause.</p>

          <p>Google faced a setback as an advisor to the European Union's top court recommended dismissing its appeal against a record 4.1-billion-euro antitrust fine. The fine, initially 4.34 billion euros but reduced in 2022, relates to a long-running antitrust case concerning Google's Android operating system. The advocate general at the European Court of Justice advised the court to uphold the General Court's judgment. This development suggests that Google's efforts to overturn the fine are unlikely to succeed.</p>

The guidance covers various aspects of university life, from protests to teaching, and aims to ensure that universities protect academic freedom. The Union of Jewish Students expressed satisfaction that the guidelines clarify that Holocaust denial is not protected speech, while also ensuring protection against antisemitic harassment.</p>

Slimness is becoming increasingly important for foldable phones as consumers are less willing to accept bulkier devices. While the market for foldable phones remains relatively small, Samsung hopes that a thinner design will attract more consumers. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also noted that Apple plans to enter the folding iPhone market starting next year, further intensifying competition.</p>

Bengio, increasingly concerned about the risks of advanced AI, proposes creating "Scientist AI," a non-autonomous system designed to predict and block potentially harmful actions by other AIs. This initiative stems from his disillusionment with current AI systems and a desire to address the potential for AI agents to escape human control. Scientist AI would act as a guardrail, assessing the morality and safety of AI actions and preventing those deemed too risky.</p>

          <p>A decade ago, Mattel released Hello Barbie, an internet-connected doll that listened to kids and used AI to respond, but the doll was hacked and discontinued due to security vulnerabilities. Despite this cautionary tale, Mattel and OpenAI have announced a partnership to bring AI to age-appropriate play experiences. Naomi Aguiar, a researcher at Oregon State University, suggests that while AI can be a powerful educational tool, kids often prefer creating their own imaginary worlds. Some tech-centric toys, such as the Toniebox and Nex Playground, incorporate technology without triggering dystopian nightmares, offering screen-free audio players and movement-based video games with limited data collection.</p>

          <p>Democrats are increasingly becoming the party of political junkies, while Republicans are the party of people who would rather think about anything else, and Democrats need to find ways to reconnect with voters outside of politics. The party's candidates, donors, and staff are caught in a contradiction, as the obligation to engage politically has never been greater, but the best hope for defeating authoritarianism remains the ballot box. To win elections, Democrats need to win back voters who have no interest in becoming more politically engaged, and perhaps that path goes through activities other than politics. The author suggests that Democrats should showcase their hobbies and interests outside of politics to appear more relatable and connect with a broader audience.</p>

          <h2>The Origin and Significance of Juneteenth</h2>

          <p>Juneteenth, a federal holiday observed annually on June 19, commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. and is also known as Freedom Day or Emancipation Day. The name Juneteenth is a portmanteau that combines the words June and nineteenth, referencing June 19, 1865, when the last group of enslaved people in Texas were informed of their freedom under the Emancipation Proclamation. While the Emancipation Proclamation set the stage for an end to slavery, it was the 13th Amendment to the Constitution that actually abolished slavery nationwide. Celebrations often include parades, parties, concerts, educational workshops, and cultural events centered on art and cuisine, with the holiday serving as an opportunity to remember the country's foundation on centuries of slavery and celebrate independence.</p>
