Many figures, including Barack Obama and Kamala Harris, have offered support, while King Charles, who is also undergoing cancer treatment, sent his well wishes.</p>

SPACs are speculative investment vehicles that raise money without a business plan, and their resurgence is fueled by the rising stock market, demand for crypto, and small investors seeking quick gains.

          <p>Following former President Joe Biden's announcement of his advanced prostate cancer diagnosis, oncology experts provided insights into the disease's progression and potential screening history. While PSA tests are not typically recommended for men over 70, they are standard during presidential physicals, leading to questions about whether Biden was screened and what the results indicated. Experts suggest several possibilities, including that Biden may have chosen to forgo screening, had normal results that failed to detect the cancer, or that the cancer developed rapidly between screenings. Despite the advanced stage, experts emphasized that recent advances have significantly improved treatment outcomes.</p>
