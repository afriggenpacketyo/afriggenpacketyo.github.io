          <p>President Trump is moving forward with a long-held plan to construct a new grand ballroom at the White House, with work scheduled to begin in September. The project, estimated to cost $200 million, will be funded by Trump and private donors and aims to create a 90,000-square-foot space capable of seating 650 guests. The new ballroom will be located in the East Wing, replacing existing office space to provide a permanent, more elegant venue for large events like state dinners, which are currently often held in outdoor tents.</p>

This expansion has solidified its position as the U.S. bank with the most physical locations, now totaling around 5,000. The strategy contrasts with the industry trend of branch closures, as JPMorgan aims to capture more deposits and serve growing populations, projecting that its new branches will eventually contribute over $160 billion in incremental deposits.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have solved a long-standing botanical mystery, discovering that the modern potato evolved from a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago. A study published in the journal *Cell* explains that the potato's ability to form starchy tubers resulted from an ancient hybridization event. A key gene from the tomato ancestor, combined with a gene from a non-tuber-producing wild potato relative, gave the modern potato its signature trait. This finding highlights how interspecies breeding can drive the evolution of new and important characteristics in plants.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key consumer protection for federally backed reverse mortgages, known as the "95% rule," can significantly impact heirs who wish to keep a family home. This rule stipulates that if the loan balance exceeds the home's value, heirs can settle the debt by paying 95% of the property's current appraised value, rather than the full amount owed. This prevents them from being "underwater" on the inheritance. The provision offers peace of mind for senior homeowners, ensuring their loved ones won't face an unmanageable financial burden if they choose to retain the property.</p>

          <p>West Ham United midfielder Lucas Paqueta has been cleared of all spot-fixing charges by an independent regulatory commission, ending a nearly two-year investigation by the Football Association. The Brazilian international was accused of deliberately receiving yellow cards in four separate matches to influence betting markets and had faced a potential lifetime ban if found guilty. While the four main charges were not proven, the commission did find him guilty on two lesser counts of failing to cooperate with the investigation, for which a sanction will be decided later.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a 90-day extension for reaching a new, comprehensive trade deal with Mexico, maintaining the existing tariff structure during the negotiation period. In a social media post, Trump stated the extension was agreed upon after a successful conversation with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, acknowledging the complexities of the U.S.-Mexico trade relationship. During this time, Mexico will continue to face a 25% tariff on certain goods. The decision comes as a deadline approaches for many other countries to finalize trade deals or face higher import duties. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the government also moved to accelerate a broader tariff increase on EV kits, which will now reach 35% in January 2027. This decision balances short-term relief for the new market entrant with long-term protection for established automakers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of stick insect, *Acrophylla alta*, in a remote rainforest in Far North Queensland, which is believed to be the heaviest insect in Australia. The newly discovered creature measures 40 centimeters long and weighs 44 grams, comparable to a golf ball. Researchers suggest its large body mass may be an evolutionary adaptation to the colder conditions of its high-altitude habitat. The species remained undiscovered for so long due to its remote location and life high in the forest canopy, with specimens now added to the Queensland Museum for further study.</p>
