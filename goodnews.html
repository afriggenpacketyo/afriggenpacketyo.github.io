          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 with metastasis to the bone. The diagnosis was made after Biden consulted a doctor for urinary symptoms. Biden and his family are currently reviewing treatment options, and his office has indicated that the cancer is hormone-sensitive, which may allow for effective management. The former president's health remains a focal point as he navigates this new challenge.</p>

          <p>Exit polls indicate that Portugal's ruling Democratic Alliance (AD) is poised to secure the most votes in Sunday's election; however, the party is expected to fall short of the 42% needed for an outright majority. This marks the third election in as many years for Portugal, a country grappling with political instability. AD leader Luis Montenegro has ruled out forming a coalition with the far-right Chega party, suggesting that the AD will likely need to forge deals with smaller parties to secure a majority in parliament. The election has been dominated by issues such as housing and immigration.</p>

          <p>Personal finance expert Dave Ramsey criticizes the media for emphasizing fear-based narratives over positive economic developments, particularly the stock market's recovery. Ramsey points out that the market has rebounded to its levels from the beginning of the year following a deal with China on tariffs, but he argues that news outlets are not reporting this positive development. He accuses the media of thriving on fear and advises investors to remain steady in their mutual funds rather than reacting emotionally to short-term market fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>
