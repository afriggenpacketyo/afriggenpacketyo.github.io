          <p>Shares for identity management software company CyberArk jumped as much as 18% following reports that Palo Alto Networks is in discussions for a potential acquisition valued at over $20 billion. This move highlights the increasing importance of cloud and AI security, prompting consolidation within the cybersecurity industry. For Palo Alto Networks, the largest cybersecurity firm by market cap, this would be its most significant acquisition to date, expanding its portfolio amid fierce competition. The potential deal reflects a broader trend of major technology companies making large-scale investments to bolster their security offerings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New Tax Law Restores Provisions Expected to Unleash Billions for Big Tech</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 13:00:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" restores three key tax provisions that are poised to provide a significant cash flow boost to major technology companies. The law permanently brings back immediate expensing for domestic R&D, 100% bonus depreciation for capital expenditures, and a more flexible interest deductibility limit. Analysts predict these changes will unlock billions in free cash flow for firms like Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft, giving them greater flexibility to invest heavily in AI infrastructure and data centers. The permanent nature of the provisions provides greater stability for long-term capital planning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 55-year-old Texas man has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison after pleading guilty to felony stalking and misdemeanor harassment of WNBA star Caitlin Clark. The man was arrested in January after sending hundreds of threatening and sexually explicit messages to Clark via social media and traveling to her hotel. As part of his sentence, he is barred from having any contact with Clark, must stay away from Indiana Fever and Pacers venues, and is prohibited from accessing the internet. The judge also recommended he seek mental health treatment.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has introduced "study mode," a new feature in ChatGPT designed to help students learn by guiding them through problems step-by-step rather than providing direct answers. This initiative addresses educators' concerns that AI chatbots can be used for cheating and hinder critical thinking. When activated, study mode prompts students with questions to help them work through homework and test preparation, encouraging them to summarize answers in their own words. The feature, developed with input from educators and students, will be available on both free and paid versions of ChatGPT.</p>

          <p>During a four-day visit to Scotland, U.S. President Donald Trump met with First Minister John Swinney, discussing the potential exemption of Scotch whisky from U.S. tariffs and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Swinney urged the president to use his influence to secure a ceasefire, while also advocating for the Scottish whisky industry, which faces a 10% tariff. Trump, who was in Scotland to open a new golf course at his Aberdeenshire resort, also commented on North Sea oil and gas, suggesting taxes on the industry were too high before departing for Washington D.C.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase is reportedly in advanced negotiations to acquire the Apple Card portfolio from Goldman Sachs. This move would see the nation's largest credit card issuer take over the high-profile partnership, while allowing Goldman Sachs to exit its troubled foray into consumer credit cards. For Goldman, divesting the business would help it move past a period marked by unexpected losses and regulatory scrutiny. For Apple, partnering with the more experienced JPMorgan could bring greater stability and discipline to the rapidly grown but challenging credit card program. (not investment advice)</p>

Once mature, these cubs will also join the global program to help ensure the long-term survival of Sumatran tigers.</p>

          <p>Real estate developers are anticipating that affordable housing projects could soon become more profitable due to an expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) in a recent federal bill. The legislation increased the amount of credits available to states and lowered financing requirements, which is expected to help produce over a million additional affordable rental homes by 2035. Despite challenges like high interest rates and construction costs, investors are showing strong demand for the sector. This boost aims to address the nation's severe shortage of affordable housing for both renters and buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Royal Collection Trust has received an insurance payment of over £3 million for two historic snuff boxes that were stolen from a Paris museum last year. The items, on loan to the Cognacq-Jay Museum for an exhibition, were taken during a daylight robbery where thieves smashed display cases. The annual accounts for the trust, a charity that manages the Royal Collection, show the funds will be used for the enhancement of the collection. The stolen pieces included a German-made box with nearly 3,000 diamonds that once belonged to the Russian royal family.</p>

          <p>A painting by Surrealist artist Salvador Dali, purchased at a house clearance sale in Cambridge for just £150, is now expected to sell for up to £30,000 at auction. The piece, titled "Vecchio Sultano," has been authenticated as an original work from a series illustrating "The Arabian Nights." The artwork was part of a 1960s commission and was likely lost by its original publisher, leading to its attribution being forgotten over time. An anonymous art dealer with a keen eye rediscovered the piece, which has now been certified by a leading Dali expert.</p>
