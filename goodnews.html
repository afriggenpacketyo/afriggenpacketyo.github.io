          <p>South Korea's central bank maintained its benchmark interest rate at 2.5%, extending a pause since May, driven by ongoing concerns over household debt. This decision follows the introduction of tighter property measures in Seoul aimed at curbing borrowing and stabilizing the housing market. The Bank of Korea cited stable inflation and an improving economic growth outlook, bolstered by the strong semiconductor sector, as key factors. However, the bank also highlighted increased economic uncertainties stemming from ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S., warning that the impact of U.S. tariffs on exports is likely to gradually expand. The central bank continues to monitor the delicate balance between supporting economic growth and managing debt levels.</p>

The company currently manages 888 outlets across 280 Chinese cities, a nearly sixfold increase since 2018, with recent new signings including Waldorf Astoria Shenzhen and Conrad Zhoushan. Hilton's strategy emphasizes elegant designs and a new dimension to lifestyle offerings, tailored to cater to evolving Chinese consumer demands. This aggressive expansion positions Hilton to further compete with rivals like InterContinental, which managed 740 hotels as of August 2024, demonstrating a strong commitment to growth in the vast Chinese market.</p>

          <p>A German soldier was mistakenly shot by police during a large-scale Bundeswehr training exercise, "Marshal Power," in Erding, Bavaria. The incident, which resulted in minor injuries to the soldier who has since been discharged, stemmed from a misunderstanding. Police, responding to public reports of an armed man, encountered military police participating in the drills. Believing it was part of the exercise, the military police fired practice ammunition, prompting the actual police officers to return fire with live rounds. The exercise involves 500 military police and hundreds of first responders rehearsing for an attack on a NATO member state, and an investigation into the incident is currently underway.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania are conducting a promising clinical trial targeting dormant "sleeper cells" to prevent the recurrence of aggressive breast cancer. These cells, which break away from primary tumors and can spread cancer later, were identified in patients like Illeana Casiano-Vazquez, who had triple-negative breast cancer. After six months of drug treatments, doctors were unable to detect these cells in her bone marrow. Out of 51 women in the trial, only two experienced cancer recurrence after seven years, significantly below the expected rate. The next steps involve larger trials and exploring applicability to other cancer types, offering substantial hope for future treatments.</p>

          <p>A family of three was rescued by the Coast Guard off Cape Cod after their 30-foot pleasure boat caught fire, forcing them to swim to Naushon Island where they sheltered in a barn for nearly two days. A relative contacted authorities when they didn't return as expected, initiating a night-long search by the Coast Guard, Falmouth police, and Harbormaster. The son managed to use the boat’s marine radio, which washed ashore, to make a mayday call, leading to their rescue by a Coast Guard helicopter. One family member was transported in critical condition and two in stable condition. Authorities praised the family's quick thinking and having quality equipment for their survival in the challenging situation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>From 2026, NHS health checks in England, offered to adults aged 40-74 every five years, will officially include menopause screening. Women will be asked about menopause and its potential symptoms, aiming to identify those who could benefit from advice and support, including HRT, hot-flush medications, and counseling. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated this measure would bring menopause into the mainstream, addressing the fact that many women suffer in silence. While campaigners welcome the move to reduce stigma and improve support, concerns remain about the low uptake of health checks in some communities, potentially limiting the benefit for many women.</p>

          <p>Former reality TV contestants from shows like Love Island and Big Brother are opening up about the challenges of returning to regular life after temporary fame. Ellie Jackson, who appeared on Love Island, initially struggled with the pressure to become a major influencer and the impact on her mental health when brand deals dwindled. She eventually returned to her corporate job, finding fulfillment in balancing both. Similarly, Big Brother's Jenkin Edwards found it difficult to navigate social settings post-show and initially felt like a failure when returning to his barman job. Psychologists working with reality TV productions emphasize preparing contestants for the aftermath of public scrutiny and the importance of authenticity.</p>

Huawei stated the feature "breaks down device boundaries and allows for more flexible data flow," demonstrating efforts to enhance user experience and compete against Android and Apple's iOS in China. HarmonyOS has maintained its lead over Apple's iOS in the mainland for six consecutive quarters, and this interoperability feature aims to further solidify its market position and appeal to a broader user base.</p>

          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has lauded 17-year-old midfielder Reggie Walsh as a special talent, plucking him from the academy to become the club's third-youngest ever player. Walsh recently broke an 11-year record as Chelsea's youngest Champions League player and has made four first-team appearances, setting other club records. Maresca praises Walsh for intuitively executing his tactical demands, making him "perfect" for the system. This development highlights Chelsea's youth-focused strategy, which saw them field a team with an average age of 20.6 years against Ajax. The club aims for long-term success by integrating academy graduates, balancing new signings with homegrown talent.</p>

          <p>A transport truck accidentally drove onto the still-closed Gordie Howe International Bridge from the U.S. side last month, despite extensive security barriers. The bridge, which will link Detroit and Windsor, is not expected to open until early 2026 due to ongoing quality reviews and preparations. Canadian border services officers intercepted the confused driver before reaching the Canadian port of entry, with no injuries or use of force reported. Officials from the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority confirmed the driver initially received directions from security but remained disoriented on the large construction site. This incident underscores the importance of clear signage and the integrity of security measures for such a significant infrastructure project still under construction.</p>

          <p>Helen Ledwick, a former BBC journalist, is openly sharing her experience with pelvic organ prolapse, a common but often taboo condition affecting one in twelve women, which she discovered two weeks after her second childbirth. Prolapse occurs when pelvic organs shift and bulge into the vagina, causing profound physical and mental health impacts. Ledwick felt isolated and received unhelpful initial medical advice, prompting her to launch a podcast and write a book to break the silence and provide knowledge and comfort to others. Women's health specialists confirm symptoms can be subtle and varied, emphasizing the need for greater awareness and support.</p>

Two titles, "Little Miss Marple: Muddle at the Vicarage" and "Mr Poirot: Mischief on the Nile," are set for release, with two more to follow. Agatha Christie's great-grandson, James Prichard, hailed it as a "dream collaboration," believing these "clever and very funny re-imaginings" will delight fans of both authors. The adaptations offer a charming, humorous twist for younger mystery fans, notably without any murders.</p>

          <p>IBM reported strong third-quarter results, surpassing Wall Street estimates with a 9% revenue increase to $16.33 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $2.65. The company also raised its full-year revenue guidance to "more than" 5% growth and free cash flow to $14 billion, citing ongoing artificial intelligence tailwinds. CEO Arvind Krishna highlighted that IBM's AI book of business has grown to over $9.5 billion. Despite these positive financial indicators, the stock dropped about 6% in extended trading, reflecting market reactions that sometimes diverge from strong earnings, potentially due to broader tech sector trends or investor expectations.</p>
