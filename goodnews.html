          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the G7 summit in Canada, pledging Japan's ongoing support for Ukraine in achieving a lasting peace. Ishiba announced that Japan will host an international conference on October 22 to address the issue of landmines in Ukraine. The two leaders discussed the war situation and future plans for Ukraine. Since the Russian invasion in 2022, Japan has condemned Moscow and imposed sanctions in coordination with other G7 members, and Ishiba also met with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to strengthen strategic partnerships, viewing it as a model for cooperation amid global complexities. The deepening ties aim to address security concerns across Europe, the Middle East, and the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>Seven men from California have been charged in connection with a jewelry heist that involved the theft of $100 million worth of gold, gems, and luxury watches. The Department of Justice alleges that the suspects scouted a jewelry show near San Francisco in 2022 and then followed a Brinks truck for approximately 300 miles to Lebec, California. While the truck was parked, the suspects allegedly stole 24 bags containing the jewelry. Some of the jewels were recovered during the execution of search warrants, and attorneys representing the jewelers expressed gratitude for any recovered items.</p>

          <p>Phillies outfielder Nick Castellanos was benched by manager Rob Thomson after making an "inappropriate comment" following being pulled from a game. Thomson emphasized Castellanos's passion for playing but stated that the comment crossed a line, leading to the disciplinary action. Castellanos acknowledged the manager's decision and his own displeasure at being removed from the game. Max Kepler shifted to right field, and Johan Rojas took over in centerfield as a result of the lineup change. Despite the incident, Castellanos has had a solid season, batting .278 with seven home runs.</p>

          <p>Extreme heatwaves, particularly in Europe, are changing the way people plan their holidays, with 81% of Europeans adjusting their travel plans due to climate change. Many are opting for destinations with milder weather or traveling during cooler months, like October and May, instead of the traditional summer season. This shift is prompting holiday resorts in the Mediterranean to adapt by offering evening markets and indoor activities during the hottest parts of the day. Some regions are also investing in winter tourism and connectivity to offset the decline in summer visitors, while others are introducing climate crisis resilience taxes to support rebuilding efforts after climate-related disasters.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports experienced a 1.7% year-over-year decline in May, marking the sharpest fall since September 2024, as the country grapples with trade uncertainties. Exports to the U.S. fell 11.1%, with automobile exports to the U.S. plummeting 24.7%. The Bank of Japan noted that the country's growth is likely to moderate due to trade-related factors, leading to a slowdown in overseas economies and a decline in domestic corporate profits. Japan's trade deficit stood at 637.6 billion yen in May, smaller than the expected deficit. The U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly said that Japan was being "tough" in trade talks.

While President Trump initially suggested changes to immigration policies to address farmers' concerns, a subsequent reversal has left the agricultural community unsure of the administration's stance.
