          <p>New photos of China's sixth-generation fighter jets, the Chengdu J-36 and Shenyang J-50, reveal more details about their potential capabilities, according to defense experts. The J-36 fighter features three weapons bays and a dorsal intake for the third engine, which is likely used to provide additional thrust for cruising at supersonic speeds. These jets may also have the ability to work with combat drones. The latest image of the J-36 shows the aircraft parked on a tarmac at Chengdu Aircraft Corporation‚Äôs main plant in Sichuan province, offering the closest look at the mysterious jet so far.

          <p>A recent segment on "CBS Sunday Morning" explores the modern appeal of William Shakespeare, featuring insights from figures like Ira Glass, Maureen Dowd, and Patrick Page. Despite some initial reservations, many find Shakespeare's themes of revenge, murder, and treachery surprisingly relevant to contemporary life. The Folger Shakespeare Library, recently renovated, houses the world's largest collection of Shakespeare's First Folios. Dowd notes Shakespeare's influence on America's Founding Fathers and draws parallels between his characters and modern political figures, highlighting the Bard's timeless understanding of power and human nature.</p>

          <p>Pomona College is seeing a growing movement among students and faculty to reduce the influence of technology on campus life. Students are advocating for more classes without electronic devices, forming a "Luddite Club" for tech-free socializing, and even switching to flip phones. Some professors are limiting or banning devices in their classes and curbing the use of ChatGPT. This effort aims to foster a closer-knit community and encourage deeper engagement with academic material, differentiating Pomona from other institutions that heavily promote technology use. The administration has yet to fully align with this vision, but the movement highlights concerns about the impact of technology on learning and social interaction.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece discusses how President Trump's policies have diminished China's historical fear of "peaceful evolution," a strategy aimed at undermining the Communist Party through Western values. Mao Zedong warned about this threat, but China has since become a major economic power, while the US has shifted away from nation-building efforts. The author suggests that Trump's actions have inadvertently lessened the perceived danger of American conspiracies aimed at subverting China, as the US no longer promotes its values as aggressively.</p>
