The company recorded a substantial rise in cross-border hospital claims, constituting 30% of its total in the first half of the year, reflecting a growing trend of residents seeking medical and retirement care across the region. A recent Prudential survey highlighted significant demand from mainland Chinese for Hong Kong-based health-related and savings insurance products. This article indicates that Prudential aims to offer more medical products to meet these market needs, emphasizing technological integration to capitalize on growth opportunities and streamline its extensive operations effectively.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer urged investors to consider the market's recent narrative over government shutdown headlines, suggesting that while third-quarter stock winners might experience continued, incremental gains, the year's most substantial rallies could be behind us. He pointed to top performers like AppLovin, Western Digital, Seagate, Warner Bros. Discovery, Teradyne, Intel, and Invesco, crediting their strong showing to factors such as surging AI demand, balance sheet improvements, and M&A speculation. Cramer explained that fund managers often acquire these successful Q3 stocks in the fourth quarter to showcase favorable portfolios to clients, potentially driving further, yet smaller, upward movements.

          <p>This article provides expert advice on selecting and utilizing various cooking oils, addressing common misconceptions about their health benefits and suitability for different culinary applications. Professor Nita Forouhi from the University of Cambridge explains that oils such as sunflower and vegetable oil are beneficial due to their low saturated fat and high healthier mono- and polyunsaturated fats, dispelling claims of them causing inflammation. The article also clarifies that extra virgin olive oil, despite its antioxidants, is better for dressings given its low smoke point, recommending vegetable or sunflower oil for deep frying. Ultimately, it stresses that no single oil is universally superior for health.</p>

          <p>Cool Patch Pumpkins in northern California, home to a massive 40-acre corn maze, encourages visitors to rediscover the simple pleasure of getting lost. Owner Taylor Cooley emphasizes the unique disorientation offered by the maze, a stark contrast to a GPS-reliant world, where the uniform corn stalks create an immersive experience until elevated bridges provide perspective. The maze, a two-time Guinness World Record holder, features elaborate designs, with this year's theme celebrating farmers. Visitors from across the country enjoy the challenge, with some lightheartedly suggesting they'd resort to eating corn if truly stranded, making it a cherished fall tradition.</p>

Arteta has granted the 26-year-old midfielder "total freedom" to explore and execute risky plays, recognizing creativity as an inherent and defining strength of Odegaard's game. Despite an early-season shoulder injury, Odegaard's recent return has significantly influenced Arsenal's offensive output, including an assist in a dramatic league comeback and contributions to both goals in their Champions League win.

          <p>Dame Jane Goodall, the globally renowned primatologist and conservationist, passed away at 91 from natural causes while on a US speaking tour in California. Her pioneering research, particularly with chimpanzees in Tanzania, fundamentally transformed scientific understanding of our closest primate relatives, notably by observing tool use, which challenged long-held beliefs. Beyond her significant scientific contributions, Goodall dedicated her life to tireless global advocacy for conservation, striving to protect wildlife and their natural habitats. The United Nations and Greenpeace were among many to mourn her loss, underscoring her extraordinary legacy in science and her role in inspiring a worldwide movement for environmental protection.</p>

          <p>Manchester City drew 2-2 with Monaco in the Champions League, twice letting a lead slip, prompting star striker Erling Haaland to express significant disappointment with the team's performance. Haaland bluntly stated that City "didn't play good enough" and "don't deserve to win," specifically criticizing their lack of energy in the second half. Manager Pep Guardiola, who had previously downplayed concerns about conceding late goals, might now be reconsidering, as the team has developed a worrying trend of giving up crucial goals in the final minutes of recent matches. This article highlights how this pattern has cost them valuable points in both domestic and European competitions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the ongoing US government shutdown, the stock market closed at record highs, indicating that investors remain largely unfazed by the political gridlock. Historical data from 22 previous shutdowns since 1976 suggests a modest impact on financial markets, with the S&P 500 rising an average of 0.3% during these periods and achieving a 13% average gain in the 12 months following. Experts propose that much of the economic activity is merely delayed, not lost. However, this article cautions that a prolonged shutdown could heighten market uncertainty, disrupt the release of critical economic data, and potentially cause companies to defer investments, which might eventually depress stock prices.

          <p>Pope Leo XIV, in his initial engagement with US politics, questioned the consistency of those who oppose abortion but simultaneously support the death penalty, asserting that such a stance is "not really pro-life." He further extended this critique to encompass the inhumane treatment of immigrants. The Pope's remarks, which align with Catholic teaching forbidding abortion while opposing capital punishment and advocating for humane migrant treatment, were made amidst a controversy regarding a cardinal's plan to honor a pro-abortion rights senator. This article emphasizes the Pope's call for greater mutual respect and a comprehensive examination of ethical issues within the Catholic Church.</p>

          <p>The new documentary "The President and the Dragon" chronicles former President Jimmy Carter's decades-long mission to eradicate Guinea worm disease, a debilitating parasitic infection spread through contaminated water. Carter, inspired by his former drug czar, dedicated his post-presidency to this global health effort, dramatically reducing cases from 3.5 million in 1986 to a mere 14 by the time of his death. The film, directed by Waleed Eltayeb, emphasizes the profound power of collective action, education, and discussion as primary interventions, rather than relying on vaccines or medication. This article highlights the documentary's focus on hope, partnership, and the compelling human stories behind this remarkable near-eradication success.</p>
