          <p>President Donald Trump has announced the conclusion of a trade and military deal with the Philippines, which he stated includes a 19% tariff on Filipino goods imported into the U.S. while U.S. goods would face no tariffs. The announcement, made on social media, also mentioned a new military cooperation agreement between the two nations. This development followed a meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. at the White House, though officials in Manila have not yet confirmed the details of the agreement.</p>

          <p>Arsenal is reportedly on the verge of finalizing a £63.5 million deal to sign Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting Lisbon. Negotiations over the final details, particularly add-on payments, have slightly delayed the official announcement. Gyokeres, who has already agreed to a five-year contract, is set to bolster Arsenal's attack after an impressive season where he scored 54 goals in 52 games. The move follows manager Mikel Arteta's extensive search for an elite center-forward to strengthen the team's offensive capabilities.</p>

Hines missed the last two seasons after sustaining a significant knee injury in a jet ski accident in July 2023 while he was with the Buffalo Bills. The 28-year-old dual-threat player, known for his skills in both rushing and receiving, will now compete for a roster spot with the Chargers. His return marks a significant step in his recovery from a serious off-field incident.</p>

          <p>The remains of U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Willis R. Hall, who was killed during the Vietnam War in 1968, have been officially identified and accounted for by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. Hall was one of 11 American soldiers killed when their remote radio site in Laos was attacked by Vietnamese commandos. His remains were discovered earlier this year during joint recovery operations on the mountain where he died. After nearly six decades, his family has been briefed, bringing long-awaited closure to his case.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola has announced it will introduce a version of its classic cola sweetened with cane sugar in the United States this fall. This move comes after President Donald Trump publicly urged the company to make the switch from high-fructose corn syrup, which has been the standard sweetener in U.S. Coke since the 1980s. The new product is designed to expand consumer choice, complementing the company's existing portfolio. The cane sugar version, often referred to as "Mexican Coke," has long been popular among a niche group of consumers in the U.S.</p>

          <p>For the first time in eight years, the percentage of working Americans with a side hustle has decreased, according to a new Bankrate survey. The report shows 27% of Americans have a second income stream, down from 36% in 2024, the lowest level since 2017. Analysts attribute this decline to a solid job market and wage growth that has outpaced inflation, reducing the economic pressure that drove many to seek extra work. This shift may suggest that Americans are feeling less financial anxiety than in the immediate post-pandemic years. (not investment advice)</p>

An AI company used these recordings to create a vocal clone that captures her unique personality, intonation, and sarcasm, which she now uses via a phone app. Frustrated by a lack of support from her insurance, Sotinsky now advocates for better access to this life-changing technology for other patients.</p>
