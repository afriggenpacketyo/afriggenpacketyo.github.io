          <p>At a memorial service for her late husband, conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Erika Kirk delivered an emotional speech declaring she forgives the man accused of his murder. She stated that forgiveness is what Christ would do and what her husband would have wanted, asserting that love, not hate, is the answer to hate. Contrasting with more combative remarks from other speakers, she emphasized her husband's focus on reviving the American family and urged attendees to embrace faith and prayer. Her message focused on Christian values of love for one's enemies and finding revival in the face of tragedy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The People's Bank of China has kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged for the fourth consecutive month, with the one-year loan prime rate (LPR) at 3.0% and the five-year LPR at 3.5%. This decision was widely expected by economists and comes despite a recent interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The move suggests Chinese authorities are holding off on major stimulus measures, even as recent data indicates slowing export growth and signs of economic fatigue. Policymakers are still anticipated to introduce some marginal monetary easing later in the year to support the government's annual growth target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 20:51:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that the DNA switch responsible for the development of fingers and toes in four-limbed animals, including humans, originally regulated the formation of the cloaca in fish 380 million years ago. Scientists from the University of Geneva compared the genomes of mice and zebrafish, finding that a key regulatory region next to Hoxd genes controls digit formation in mice but cloaca development in fish. When this region was deleted using CRISPR, mice failed to develop digits correctly, while zebrafish had malformed cloacas. This discovery illustrates how evolution often repurposes existing genetic mechanisms for new functions, rather than creating them from scratch.</p>

The article highlights the story of a former DJ with a terminal illness who is curating the soundtrack of his life, finding it helps both him and his family. Experts note that music has recognized therapeutic benefits, capable of reducing anxiety and psychological pain by lighting up multiple parts of the brain simultaneously. Even when a person is unconscious, hearing is often the last sense to go, allowing music to keep them connected to loved ones and cherished memories.</p>

          <h2>Child Development Expert Outlines Nine Practices of Parents Who Raise Children with Strong Social Skills</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article by a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships identifies nine key things parents do to foster exceptional social skills in their children from an early age. These practices focus on creating an environment of emotional safety and authentic connection. They include talking openly about feelings, modeling empathy in daily life, validating a child's emotions, and treating mistakes as learning opportunities rather than failures. The author argues that rather than memorizing phrases, children learn best by observing their parents' behavior, which provides a blueprint for communication, conflict resolution, and building real confidence.</p>

          <h2>UK Work and Pensions Secretary Affirms Commitment to Welfare System Reform</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 19:10:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pat McFadden, the UK's Work and Pensions Secretary, has stated that reforming the welfare system "must happen" to address the rising cost of benefits and provide better support for people to return to work. The government plans to offer skills and employment support to tens of thousands currently on sickness benefits without a requirement to seek employment. This commitment follows the government's recent reversal on a controversial policy to cut disability benefits. McFadden emphasized that the current system creates an "unhealthy" divide between those deemed fit for work and those not, and that reform is essential for both individuals and the national budget.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of scientists is working on a project to reduce the transmission of Lyme disease by genetically engineering the local population of white-footed mice, the primary carriers of the bacteria. The "Mice Against Ticks" project, led by an MIT associate professor, aims to introduce a gene that would make the mice immune to Lyme, thereby breaking the infection cycle where ticks feed on infected mice and then transmit the disease to humans. The researchers are actively engaging with the Nantucket community to gain public consent before releasing any engineered mice, emphasizing a transparent and collaborative approach to deploying this novel technology.</p>

For now, UATX offers free tuition, funded by nearly $200 million in private donations. The curriculum is rooted in Western civilization, and admissions decisions are based on merit without consideration for race or ethnicity, a policy critics have noted resulted in a lack of diversity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article details the extraordinary journey of the monarch butterfly "super generation," which lives up to nine times longer than typical monarchs in order to migrate 3,000 miles from the northern U.S. and Canada to a specific forest in Mexico. This special generation suppresses its reproductive hormones to conserve energy for the flight, navigating using an internal compass. Scientists are still studying the mystery of how generations of butterflies find their way to the same remote location. However, the monarch population has declined by 70% in 30 years due to threats like illegal logging and the loss of milkweed plants in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost their final regular-season home game 3-1 to the San Francisco Giants after the bullpen failed to hold a late lead. Despite the loss, the team and its record-breaking 4 million fans for the season are anticipating a swift return to Dodger Stadium for the playoffs. Starting pitcher Emmet Sheehan delivered a strong performance, allowing only one hit over seven scoreless innings. However, reliever Blake Treinen gave up three runs in the eighth inning, securing the loss. The Dodgers now head on the road for their final six games with a magic number of three to clinch the NL West division title.</p>

The division became public after conflicting messages were sent to supporters about party membership, and Sultana accused the party's leadership of being a "sexist boys' club" that had sidelined her.

The potential sale is mandated by a U.S. law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its American arm over national security concerns regarding user data. The White House has suggested a deal could be finalized in the coming days, which could give some of America's most powerful media figures significant influence over the popular social media platform.</p>

He referenced his own recent experience with political violence, including the firebombing of the governor's mansion in April, as well as other attacks on political figures. Shapiro emphasized the distinction between protected, though sometimes hateful, political speech and illicit incitement to violence, stating that violence leaves lasting scars on society.</p>

Later, in the ninth inning, he made a leaping grab at the top of the fence to take away a potential game-tying home run from Francisco Álvarez.

This pragmatic stance reflects a shift in policy aimed at reducing tensions and re-engaging Pyongyang, which has rejected all talks since 2019.</p>
