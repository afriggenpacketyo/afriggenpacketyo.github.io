          <p>A new study by Lightcast reveals a significant surge in demand for AI skills across the job market, with employers willing to pay substantial premiums for these capabilities. Job postings requiring at least one AI skill advertised salaries 28% higher on average, escalating to 43% for those with two or more, representing a substantial annual increase. The article highlights that this demand is not confined to the tech industry, showing strong growth in non-tech sectors like marketing, sales, and customer support. Experts suggest that "AI literacy" is becoming essential for nearly every job function, emphasizing the importance of continuous learning and preparation rather than fear regarding AI's impact on employment.</p>

He expresses confidence in the future "tokenization" of these physical assets on the blockchain, aligning with his broader vision of "Wall Street on chain" to modernize asset management. The article highlights that despite his shift from NFTs, Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate his crypto portfolio, representing nearly 90% of his digital asset holdings. This change underscores his evolving perspective on digital and physical asset valuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has soared to an estimated $1.7 billion, becoming the third-largest in U.S. lottery history with a cash value of $770.3 million. An analysis of Powerball data highlights the significant impact of state taxes on winners' net payouts, revealing that states like California, Florida, and Texas offer the highest take-home amounts due to no state tax on prizes. Conversely, winners in high-tax states such as New York and Minnesota would receive considerably less after federal and state deductions. The article also delves into the daunting odds of winning (1 in 292.2 million) and trends in drawn numbers, providing a comprehensive overview of the lottery's financial and statistical aspects.

Although Elon Musk was invited, he was unable to attend, sending a representative in his place. The article highlights Trump's praise for the "high-IQ group" and his efforts to cultivate close relationships with tech titans, some of whom, like Zuckerberg and Gates, spoke at the event. Gates notably discussed vaccine technology, a topic that gained relevance after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court upheld an injunction blocking the Trump administration's policy directive that sought to prevent transgender and nonbinary Americans from obtaining passports accurately reflecting their gender identities. This decision stems from President Trump's executive order, issued upon returning to office, which aimed to recognize only male and female biological genders, reversing a previous Biden administration policy allowing an "X" gender marker. The American Civil Liberties Union successfully argued the policy was arbitrary, unconstitutional, and rooted in "irrational prejudice." The article notes the appeals court concluded the government failed to meaningfully challenge the lower court's finding of "unconstitutional animus," marking a significant legal victory for LGBTQ+ rights.</p>
