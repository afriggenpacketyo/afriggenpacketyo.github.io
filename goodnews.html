          <h2>Republican Lawmakers Propose Constitutional Amendment to Withhold Congressional Pay During Government Shutdowns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of Republican representatives, led by Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, has reintroduced a proposal for a constitutional amendment to prevent members of Congress from receiving their salaries during a government shutdown. The proposed amendment argues that if federal workers are impacted by funding lapses, lawmakers should not be exempt from financial consequences for their inaction. This legislative push, which would also prohibit any back pay for the shutdown period, comes as the nation faces an imminent partial government shutdown due to a deadlock between Republicans and Democrats on a new spending agreement. The sponsors believe this measure would incentivize Congress to fulfill its constitutional duty to fund the government.</p>

          <p>Recently surfaced photos on Chinese social media appear to show a new, tailless fighter jet, believed to be the developmental J-50 sixth-generation stealth aircraft. The images are notable because the aircraft is seen without the nose-mounted air data boom, a sensor typically used during the early stages of flight testing. According to Chinese military observers, the removal of this testing equipment could signify that the development program has reached a more advanced stage. While the authenticity of the images has not been officially confirmed by Chinese authorities, they have sparked considerable discussion about the progress of China's advanced military aviation technology.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research indicates that the United States is approaching herd immunity against the human papillomavirus (HPV), the primary cause of cervical cancer, thanks to a successful and long-running vaccination program. A study published in JAMA Pediatrics found that high vaccination rates among both boys and girls have led to a dramatic decline in infections from cancer-causing HPV strains, even among unvaccinated women. This indirect protection suggests a strong community-level defense against the virus. However, experts caution that maintaining this progress is contingent on sustaining high vaccine uptake, as waning vaccination rates could reverse these public health gains.</p>

          <p>In Kathmandu, Nepal, a two-year-old girl named Aryatara Shakya has been chosen as the new Kumari, or "living goddess," a revered tradition among both Hindus and Buddhists. Selected from the Shakya clan based on strict criteria including physical perfection, she will live in a temple palace until she reaches puberty, at which point she will return to mortal life. The ceremony, part of a major Hindu festival, saw her paraded through the streets before beginning her sequestered life as a deity. While the position brings great honor to her family, former Kumaris have historically faced challenges readjusting to normal life after their tenure ends.</p>

          <p>The price of gold surged to a new record high as the United States government officially entered a shutdown, increasing investor anxiety and demand for safe-haven assets. The shutdown introduces significant market uncertainty, particularly as it will delay the release of critical U.S. jobs data, complicating the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decisions. Analysts suggest that while the shutdown was the immediate catalyst, the rally is also fueled by broader geopolitical instability, ongoing conflicts, and sticky inflation, leading some to predict that gold prices could climb even higher. This trend reflects a broader investor strategy to diversify portfolios with hard assets amid global volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Global real estate investment is undergoing a significant shift from traditional properties like offices and malls to "invisible" assets such as data centers, driven by the explosive growth of artificial intelligence. According to a CBRE survey, 95% of major investors plan to increase their data center investments, recognizing the surging demand for computing power. However, this gold rush is creating a funding challenge, as the multi-billion-dollar cost of building modern hyperscale facilities is straining the capacity of traditional lenders like banks. Experts note that while investor appetite is strong, securing sufficient capital to meet the projected $1.8 trillion investment needed by 2030 remains a major question. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge in Boston has ruled that the Trump administration abused its power and violated the First Amendment rights of non-citizens by targeting them for deportation based on their political speech. The 161-page decision by Judge William Young centered on cases like that of a Tufts University graduate student who was arrested by ICE after co-authoring an op-ed on the war in Gaza. The judge stated that the nation must not imprison and deport people because of their viewpoints, calling the targeted proceedings an unconstitutional chilling of free speech. This landmark ruling is seen as a significant vindication for immigrant rights and freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>In response to a rise in airspace violations by Russian jets and unidentified drones, several European countries, particularly those on the eastern flank like Poland and the Baltic states, are proposing the creation of a "drone wall." This concept is not a physical barrier but a coordinated, cross-border counter-drone system designed to detect, track, and intercept unauthorized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The initiative aims to serve as both a defensive and deterrent measure, pooling resources to bolster Europe's collective security. While facing financial and technical hurdles, the proposal is seen as a timely and necessary step to counter Russia's use of hybrid warfare tactics.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The word "hoax," used to describe grand deceptions and frauds, has a fascinating origin rooted in the world of magic. Etymologists trace the term to a clipped version of "hocus pocus," an incantation popularized in the 1620s by a magician named William Vincent, who used it as his stage name. The phrase "hocus pocus" itself is theorized to be a deliberate, playful corruption of the Latin Eucharistic prayer, "Hoc est enim corpus meum" ("This is My body"), reflecting the anti-Catholic sentiment in England at the time. Over time, the magician's brand name became shorthand for trickery, eventually evolving into the modern word "hoax" around the 19th century.</p>

This marks a substantial increase from 34% in the previous year, with the trend showing strong growth across all age groups, not just younger demographics. The convenience of tapping a phone or watch for contactless payments has led to a slight dip in the use of physical contactless cards. While digital payments are becoming increasingly mainstream, the report notes that cash usage continues to decline, raising concerns about financial inclusion and system resilience.</p>
