          <p>As a federal government shutdown continues, Representative Aaron Bean has introduced the "Aviation Funding Stability Act of 2025" to prevent disruptions to air travel. The proposed legislation would ensure that essential FAA personnel, such as air traffic controllers and safety inspectors, continue to receive pay. The bill aims to avoid flight delays and safety concerns by temporarily using funds from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which would be repaid after a funding agreement is reached.</p>

          <p>Recent drops in mortgage rates have provided financial relief for homebuyers, with the average 30-year fixed rate falling to 6.34% from 6.93% earlier in the year. For a $700,000 loan, this translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $4,351, a saving of about $273 per month compared to January's rates. Over the full 30-year term, this lower rate could save a borrower nearly $100,000 in total interest payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla announced it delivered 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter of 2025, a 7% increase over the same period last year, beating most analyst expectations. This sales surge was partly driven by U.S. buyers rushing to purchase vehicles before a key federal tax credit expired at the end of September. Despite the rise in deliveries, vehicle production saw a slight year-over-year decline, and the company's stock dipped following the report. (not investment advice)</p>
