          <p>A 20-year-old woman was likely bitten by a shark while swimming in waist-deep water at Jones Beach on Long Island, New York. She suffered non-life-threatening lacerations to her leg and foot and was treated at the scene. Experts believe the bite was from a juvenile sand tiger shark based on analysis of the injuries. Following the incident, authorities temporarily suspended swimming and conducted drone searches, though no sharks were spotted. The article notes that such incidents are statistically rare worldwide.</p>

          <p>Dallas Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd has announced an unconventional plan for number one draft pick Cooper Flagg during the upcoming NBA Summer League. Despite being a natural forward, Flagg will be given opportunities to play as a point guard to challenge him and expand his skillset. Kidd, supported by team part-owner Mark Cuban, wants to see how the 18-year-old phenom reacts to being made "uncomfortable" by running the team's offense. The coach drew parallels to his experience developing Giannis Antetokounmpo, emphasizing that allowing young players to fail is part of the growth process.</p>

          <p>Meta is reportedly engaged in an aggressive campaign to poach top artificial intelligence talent from rivals like Google and OpenAI, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally leading the recruitment efforts. The company is offering lucrative compensation packages, some allegedly worth up to $100 million, to attract leading researchers and recent PhD graduates. This hands-on approach has created a buzz in Silicon Valley and drawn criticism from competitors, who view the compensation as excessive. The strategy is part of Meta's broader ambition to build a "superintelligence team" and establish dominance in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.</p>

In his address, Scholz reflected on his time in government and issued a stark warning against having any illusions about Russian President Vladimir Putin's expansionist plans in Ukraine. The event comes as the SPD, now a part of the ruling coalition, grapples with its political standing after a poor showing in recent elections.

England's chase faltered early, with the team collapsing to 113 all out, struggling particularly against India's spin bowlers.

Deviating from the common advice to diversify, Breton began buying the stock in 2020, sold his real estate, and concentrated his funds into the single company. He continued to build his position even as the stock's value fell, and he now uses options strategies like selling covered calls to generate income from his shares.

Budapest's mayor supported the march by declaring it a municipal event, and it drew support from numerous European officials who attended in solidarity.
