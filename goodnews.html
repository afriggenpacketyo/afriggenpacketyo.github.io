          <p>The search for the thylacine, or Tasmanian tiger, continues to captivate enthusiasts in Australia, decades after the species was declared extinct in 1986. Despite thousands of reported sightings, no definitive proof of its survival has emerged. The obsession is fueled by hope and a sense of remorse over the animal's human-caused extinction. In parallel, a high-profile de-extinction project, backed by significant investment, is attempting to resurrect the thylacine by editing the DNA of its closest living relative, though many scientists remain skeptical about the project's feasibility.</p>

          <p>China has officially lifted its comprehensive ban on Japanese seafood imports, which was imposed in August 2023 in response to the release of treated wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant. The decision follows months of monitoring and sampling that Chinese authorities said "showed no abnormalities." The move is seen as an effort by Beijing to improve diplomatic and economic ties with Japan amid its ongoing trade disputes with the United States. While the blanket ban is lifted, some restrictions on food from specific Japanese prefectures, including Fukushima, will remain in place.</p>

The company is accused of imposing excessive sales quotas on its dealers and pressuring them by implying their contracts would not be renewed if targets were not met. This pressure allegedly led some dealers to purchase unsold motorcycles themselves to fulfill the quotas. The antitrust watchdog will also issue a cease and desist order to prevent the practice from recurring, which was reportedly discontinued after the investigation began. (not investment advice)</p>
