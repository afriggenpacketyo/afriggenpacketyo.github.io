          <p>President Trump addressed over 10,000 faith leaders on a conference call, rallying support for his "one big, beautiful bill" and highlighting its "pro-family" elements like an expanded Child Tax Credit. The call, which was almost postponed due to technical issues, was also used by Trump to celebrate his administration's efforts to defend religious liberty.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a bill to more than double the state's film and television tax credit program, increasing the annual cap from $330 million to $750 million. The move is intended to make California more competitive and lure back productions that have moved to other states and countries offering more lucrative incentives. Industry leaders hope the boost will stimulate production, which has slowed due to recent strikes and studio cutbacks, and help get people back to work.</p>

          <p>This article explains that while Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) can be an attractive borrowing option, homeowners should be aware of various fees that can increase the overall cost. These charges can include upfront application and appraisal costs, as well as ongoing annual maintenance or inactivity fees. To minimize expenses, borrowers are advised to compare offers from multiple lenders, inquire about fee waivers, and carefully read the fine print before committing to a HELOC.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked President Trump's directive aimed at severely limiting access to the U.S. asylum system for migrants crossing the southern border. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the administration overstepped its authority, stating that federal law does not grant the president the power to unilaterally supplant existing immigration statutes. The ruling is a significant legal setback for the administration's hardline immigration agenda, though it can be appealed.</p>

England's bowlers managed to take key wickets, but a late partnership between Gill and Ravindra Jadeja saw the tourists end the day with a slight advantage.</p>

Researchers believe a 2015 satellite image of Nikumaroro, a remote Pacific island, may show part of Earhart's Lockheed Electra aircraft protruding from the sand. Purdue University, where Earhart taught, is organizing a team to travel to the island in November to investigate the site and hopefully recover the plane's remains.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new trade deal with Vietnam, imposing a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports into the United States. This agreement avoids a much higher 46% levy that was scheduled to take effect as part of a global tariff plan. As part of the deal, Vietnam will reportedly eliminate all tariffs on U.S. products, and a steeper 40% tariff will be applied to goods transshipped through Vietnam to prevent evasion of other duties.</p>
