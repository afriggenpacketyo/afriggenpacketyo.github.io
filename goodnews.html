          <p>A 113-year-old wooden church in the Swedish city of Kiruna is being moved in its entirety to a new location 3 miles away to protect it from ground subsidence caused by over a century of iron ore mining. The 672-tonne structure has been lifted onto giant transporters for the slow, two-day journey to the new city center. This complex engineering feat is the most symbolic part of a wider project to relocate the city, which is at risk from ground fissures. For local residents, the move is a deeply emotional event, representing the preservation of their community's spiritual and historical heart.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly discussing a plan to take a 10% equity stake in chipmaker Intel, which would make the U.S. government its largest shareholder. The proposal involves converting some or all of the $10.9 billion in grants awarded to Intel under the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act into company shares. This potential move is part of a broader effort to revitalize the U.S. semiconductor industry and bolster national security, as Intel has fallen behind global competitors. The discussions come as Intel also secured a separate $2 billion investment from SoftBank, signaling significant external interest in the company's future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The private members' club chain Soho House is being taken private in a $2.7 billion (£2 billion) deal led by U.S. hotel group MCR Hotels and private equity firm Apollo. Actor and investor Ashton Kutcher is part of the consortium and will join the company's board. The move comes after Soho House struggled to achieve profitability since its 2021 stock market listing, with its share value declining amid concerns that its rapid expansion had diluted its exclusive brand. The acquisition aims to put the company on more stable financial footing away from the pressures of public market reporting.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a prototype of a crewed tilt-rotor aircraft, a design that combines the vertical takeoff and landing capabilities of a helicopter with the speed and range of a fixed-wing plane. Photos show the aircraft hovering in helicopter mode, and its cockpit design suggests it is manned, which would make it China's first such aircraft. This technology is famously used in the U.S. V-22 Osprey. While versatile, tilt-rotor aircraft are known for their significant mechanical complexity, high costs, and historical safety concerns, presenting major challenges for any nation developing them.</p>

          <p>The US Open has revamped its mixed doubles competition, attracting top singles stars like Carlos Alcaraz, Novak Djokovic, and Iga Swiatek with large cash prizes and a shorter format. The move is intended to elevate the event's profile and draw more fan interest, with a winning prize of $1 million. However, the new format has polarized the tennis community. While some praise it as an exciting innovation, many doubles specialists, like Jamie Murray, have criticized it as a "glorified exhibition" that sidelines dedicated doubles players while awarding huge sums to stars who are already earning millions.</p>

          <p>Researchers have used Artificial Intelligence to generate facial reconstructions of Welsh convicts who were deported to Australia in the 19th century. A team of volunteers traced the lives of 60 individuals from Anglesey, who were transported for crimes ranging from theft to trampling on a nobleman's turnips. The AI process utilized detailed prisoner records, historical sketches, and, in some cases, photos of modern-day descendants to create the images. This project sheds light on a period when an estimated 162,000 convicts were sent to Australia, forming a foundational part of the country's history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing travel trend, dubbed "coolcations," has tourists avoiding Europe's traditional summer hotspots in favor of cooler, quieter destinations amid record-breaking heatwaves and wildfires. Travelers are increasingly booking trips to places like Iceland, Norway, and the Scottish Highlands, or shifting their vacations to the spring and autumn shoulder seasons. This behavioral shift is driven by concerns over extreme weather in Mediterranean countries. While this may alleviate overtourism in some areas, it could also have significant economic consequences for southern European nations heavily reliant on peak-season tourism.</p>

          <p>Air Canada and the union representing its 10,000 striking flight attendants have returned to the negotiating table for the first time since the walkout began over the weekend. The strike, now in its fourth day, has caused the cancellation of approximately 700 daily flights, disrupting travel for about 130,000 passengers each day during the peak summer season. The union states that key issues include wages and compensation for ground duties like boarding passengers, for which flight attendants are currently not paid. The Canadian government is urging both sides to reach a quick resolution to end the widespread travel chaos.</p>

          <p>After entering the workforce during the isolating years of the pandemic, many members of Generation Z are now seeking out structured, in-person events to build friendships and professional networks. Fatigued by virtual interactions, young professionals are attending activity-based gatherings like dumpling-making classes and pub quizzes as a way to connect with peers in a low-pressure environment. This trend is a response to a declared loneliness epidemic and the social void created by remote and hybrid work models. Companies and social apps are beginning to cater to this demand, organizing events that facilitate real-life connections.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's latest visit to the White House is analyzed as a strategic success in buying more time for his country. In contrast to a previous ill-tempered meeting, Zelenskyy adopted a more conciliatory tone, which appeared to improve the diplomatic atmosphere with President Trump. The discussions centered on security guarantees and the potential for a direct meeting between Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin. While concrete details on a final peace plan remain elusive, the summit allowed Ukraine to avoid being pushed into immediate, unfavorable concessions, effectively maintaining the status quo while diplomatic channels remain open.</p>

          <p>According to a new report from S&P, Chinese exports to developing nations in the Global South have doubled since 2015, with a significant acceleration following the U.S.-China trade war. In the last five years, these exports have grown by 65%, far outpacing the 28% growth in exports to the United States over the past decade. China now exports approximately $1.6 trillion to the Global South, over 50% more than its combined total to the U.S. and Western Europe.
