          <p>Thirty-year-old tech billionaire Lucy Guo, co-founder of Scale AI and founder of Passes, maintains a famously frugal lifestyle, often seeking deals on Uber Eats and preferring Uber X, despite her $1.3 billion net worth. However, she also indulges in significant purchases, including a nearly $30 million mansion in Hollywood Hills and a vintage Ferrari. The article also mentions a class-action lawsuit filed against Guo and Passes in February, alleging distribution of child sexual assault material on the platform, which Guo's spokesperson vehemently denies as a "shakedown." This article offers a glimpse into the contrasting spending habits of the young entrepreneur.</p>

          <p>Clayton Kershaw delivered a masterful performance, pitching five innings of one-run ball to secure his fifth consecutive victory, propelling the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 6-3 win over the Cincinnati Reds. Despite a diminished fastball velocity and an early run conceded, the 37-year-old left-hander retired the final 14 batters he faced, showcasing his refined strategy of mixing pitches and relying heavily on his slider and curveball. The Dodgers' offense steadily contributed, erasing an early deficit and breaking the game open with a four-run rally in the sixth inning, including a home run from Will Smith. This article highlights Kershaw's impressive August and the team's strong push in the late season.</p>

Among the discoveries were a Kylie Minogue CD, a solar-powered calculator, a passport, a pocket TV, a snowflake hologram, and a photo of Princess Diana. The lead-encased wooden box, originally intended for unearthing in "hundreds of years," was excavated prematurely to make way for the construction of a new children's cancer center.

          <p>A report from SAP Concur indicates that leisure travel to the United States has decreased this year, but business travel to the country remains stable and even saw a slight increase of 1% in inbound volume compared to the first half of 2024. The U.S. emerged as the top global destination for business travelers in the first half of 2025, accounting for 15% of all business air travel bookings, significantly outpacing other nations. This trend, consistent despite broader negative travel sentiment in other regions and ongoing tariff policies, suggests that corporate interests continue to drive inbound travel.

          <p>China's industrial companies experienced a narrower profit decline of 1.5% in July, marking a notable recovery after months of steeper drops, signaling that Beijing's campaign against "involution" or excessive price wars is easing strain on profitability. While the mining sector continued to decline, manufacturing and utilities saw improved profits, and raw-material manufacturing rebounded with 36.9% growth. The government's policies aimed at recovering consumer price levels are credited with this improvement, though deflationary pressures persist. This article highlights the early effects of regulatory measures to address intense competition and support corporate financial health in China's economy. (not investment advice)</p>
