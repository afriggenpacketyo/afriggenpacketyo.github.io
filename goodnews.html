          <p>As autumn begins, several celestial events will be visible in the night sky, providing opportunities for stargazers. The season officially starts with the astronomical equinox on September 22, when day and night are nearly equal in length. Key events include Saturn reaching its opposition on September 21, making it appear at its biggest and brightest for the year and visible to the naked eye. Additionally, the Orionid meteor shower, originating from Halley's Comet, will be active from early October to early November, peaking around October 22 under ideal viewing conditions due to a new moon.</p>

          <p>In Austria, three nuns in their 80s have defied church authorities by leaving the care home they were placed in and returning to their historic convent near Salzburg. Sister Bernadette, Sister Regina, and Sister Rita claim they were moved against their will after their religious community was dissolved and the building was taken over by the Archdiocese. With the help of former students and a locksmith, they regained access to their former apartments, which had been left without electricity or water. Despite the archdiocese calling their return "incomprehensible," the nuns are determined to live out their days in their lifelong home.</p>

Fox, a makeup artist, rents her studio space from Pulliam and had been feeling a painful void as her wedding day approached without a father figure to escort her. Sensing her situation, Pulliam offered to do the honor, an offer she enthusiastically accepted. Fox described the moment he took her hand as feeling like "a wound had been healed in my heart," turning a business relationship into a meaningful family connection on her special day.</p>

          <p>Gustavo Dudamel has officially begun his role as the music and artistic director designate of the New York Philharmonic, opening the orchestra's new season. His debut program featured works with strong connections to New York, including Bartók’s Piano Concerto No. 3 and Charles Ives’ Symphony No. 2, famously premiered by the orchestra under Leonard Bernstein. The highly anticipated appointment has generated significant excitement, with hopes that Dudamel can reinvigorate the orchestra and capture the city's attention in a way not seen since the Bernstein era. His first performance was met with a warm reception from the audience at David Geffen Hall.</p>

          <p>As hundreds of thousands of new students prepare for university, current second-year students are offering advice on navigating the challenges of fresher's life. Key tips include understanding that everyone feels nervous about making friends, not placing too much importance on the social pressures of freshers' week, and joining societies to meet like-minded people. Students also emphasized practical advice, such as doing chores promptly to maintain good relationships with flatmates and planning ahead for those who commute. The overarching message is to be kind to oneself, seek support when needed, and remember that the university experience is a learning curve for everyone.</p>

          <p>The sequel to the iconic 1984 rock-mockumentary, "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues," reunites the original cast for one last concert but fails to recapture the magic of its predecessor. While seeing the clueless band members 40 years later provides some smiles, the film's concept of the band being revered by real-life music legends like Paul McCartney saps the satirical tension. The review suggests the movie feels more like a feature-length outtake reel, with gags that don't quite land and missed comedic opportunities. Ultimately, it serves as a nostalgia lap that confirms some classics are best left untouched.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook explained the company's decision to invest $2.5 billion in its partnership with Corning to manufacture specialized glass at a factory in Kentucky. Cook praised Corning's innovative "ceramic shield" technology, used for iPhones and Apple Watches, for its durability, thinness, and quality. The investment is expected to boost the factory's workforce by 50% and triple its production, making it a world-leading site for this type of manufacturing. Cook emphasized the importance of domestic manufacturing for creating economic hubs and supporting local communities, a sentiment echoed by Corning CEO Wendell Weeks.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have approved Senate Bill 79, a landmark piece of legislation designed to address the state's housing crisis by allowing for denser housing construction near public transit. The bill, which now heads to the governor's desk, overrides local zoning laws to permit buildings up to nine stories tall adjacent to major transit stops like train and bus stations. Proponents argue the measure is essential for creating hundreds of thousands of new homes in existing communities. However, critics, including the Los Angeles City Council, contend it is a "one-size-fits-all" mandate that strips local authorities of their control over responsible development.</p>
