        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wall Street eagerly awaits Friday's release of September's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which is expected to show a 0.4% monthly increase and a 3.1% annual inflation rate, the highest since January. Due to the ongoing government shutdown, this delayed report is the month's primary economic data point, making any deviation from expectations highly impactful. Economists anticipate little change in auto prices, a boost in car insurance, and a decline in airfare, with tariffs adding slight upward pressure. The data's reliability is questioned given shutdown-related disruptions, yet it remains crucial for market sentiment and the Federal Reserve's widely expected quarter-percentage-point interest rate cut next week.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-23 15:08:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates have dropped for two consecutive weeks, now averaging 6.19% for a 30-year mortgage, nearing a three-year low and just above the September three-year low. This positive trend offers new opportunities for homebuyers, but a judicious approach is advised due to elevated home prices and the likelihood of gradual, not rapid, declines. Buyers should recognize that rates could reverse course unexpectedly, despite anticipated Fed cuts. Acting now may also mean less competition than in the traditional spring homebuying season next year, allowing for potential refinancing later. This article suggests that while the climate is improving, careful consideration is crucial for current market entry. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold prices are experiencing sharp volatility, plunging from over $4,300 to $4,000 per ounce before rebounding to $4,136, driven by Federal Reserve rate cuts and fluctuating stock market appeal. This dynamic market offers opportunities for nimble investors to capitalize on price swings. Strategies include trading gold mining stocks or ETFs for leveraged exposure, using gold-backed ETFs or futures for short-term plays, which are more liquid than physical gold. Additionally, long-term investors can buy physical gold on dips using a dollar-cost averaging approach for hedging against inflation and geopolitical instability. Flexibility and strategic planning are key to finding success in this evolving gold market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Quantum computing stocks like IonQ and Rigetti Computing remained comfortably higher despite the Trump administration's denial of "currently" negotiating equity stakes in these firms. Investors interpret the word "currently" as leaving room for future deals or alternative structures, such as warrants, fueling continued optimism. The government views quantum technology as critical for national security and staying ahead of China, even though the technology is not yet commercially viable and companies have minimal revenue. This article highlights the speculative nature of the sector, with major tech companies like Google, IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon already having significant quantum programs and making breakthroughs.

Behaviors like constantly saying "no," claiming everything as "mine," engaging in sensory exploration, and resisting activity switches are explained as toddlers developing their sense of self and testing boundaries.

          <p>California will allow hunting of mute swans starting January 1, 2026, as part of an effort to cull the "destructive, non-native" species statewide, a move authorized by new state legislation expiring in 2031. Classified as a "restricted and detrimental species," the mute swan population has grown to 6,900 birds since 2007, posing a threat to local ecosystems. These territorial birds compete with native waterfowl for limited submerged aquatic vegetation, essential for sensitive indigenous species. Landowners and licensed hunters can kill the invasive waterfowl at any time.

Gold has seen significant inflows and record highs, supported by central bank buying and geopolitical risk.

          <p>President Donald Trump has reversed his plan to "surge" San Francisco with federal deployment, a decision influenced by phone calls from prominent tech CEOs Jensen Huang (Nvidia) and Marc Benioff (Salesforce), as well as Mayor Daniel Lurie.

This reversal marks a significant political win for Mayor Lurie, who has adopted a conciliatory approach with the administration, unlike other California officials. The article notes recent positive data on crime rates, which are down 30% from 2024, and rising business momentum in San Francisco, driven partly by the AI boom.</p>
