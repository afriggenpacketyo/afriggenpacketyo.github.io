          <h2>EPA to Reconsider Limits on Certain Forever Chemicals in Drinking Water</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 20:32:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The EPA plans to weaken limits on some PFAS, or "forever chemicals," in drinking water finalized last year, while maintaining standards for PFOA and PFOS. The move follows lawsuits from water utilities arguing the EPA lacked authority to regulate a mixture of PFAS and didn't properly support limits on newer types of PFAS. While limits on some PFAS will be reconsidered, the EPA will keep the standards for PFOA and PFOS at 4 parts per trillion, giving utilities until 2031 to comply. Health advocates criticize the move, while utilities argue treatment systems are expensive, potentially raising customer bills.</p>

          <p>State Farm customers in California are facing a 17% increase in homeowners insurance premiums following a judge's ruling and the decision by the California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara, intended to alleviate financial distress after the Los Angeles-area wildfires. The increase, lower than the initially proposed 21.8%, will take effect on June 1, pending another hearing. State Farm faced criticism from fire survivors over payment delays, while Lara assured residents he considered all options and is focused on ensuring State Farm pays claims fully and fairly. The company has also agreed to refrain from implementing new block non-renewal programs through the end of 2025.</p>

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States decreased by nearly 30,000 last year, signaling progress in combating the drug crisis. The CDC credited President Trump for adding resources to address the issue, but the announcement coincided with proposed cuts to federal health programs, including those addressing the drug crisis. Experts worry the cuts could undermine the progress made, despite the fact that drug fatalities remain high, with 80,391 deaths in 2024. Public health interventions are showing meaningful impact, though overdose remains a leading cause of death for Americans ages 18 to 44.</p>

The gang claimed to have breached Co-op's computer systems long before they were discovered and were planning to infect the company with ransomware but were detected.
