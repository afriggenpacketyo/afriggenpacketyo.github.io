          <p>A new COVID-19 variant, NB.1.8.1, linked to a surge in China, has been detected in multiple U.S. locations, with symptoms similar to earlier strains, including respiratory issues and fatigue. Experts suggest that while this variant appears more transmissible, it does not necessarily lead to more severe illness. The Trump administration plans to limit booster vaccine access to specific groups, such as seniors and those with underlying medical conditions, requiring new clinical trials for wider use, which could create barriers and confusion for the broader population, potentially reducing vaccination rates. Experts advise continued preventative measures such as good hygiene and mask-wearing to minimize the spread of respiratory viruses.</p>

          <p>iPhone shipments from India to the U.S. experienced a significant 76% increase in April, driven by Apple's efforts to diversify its manufacturing base amid trade tensions with China. While India surpassed China in iPhone shipments to the U.S. in March, this growth is expected to plateau due to limited manufacturing capacity, with U.S. demand projected to be met by 2026. Analysts caution that protectionist measures from both Washington and Beijing could impede India's ability to expand its iPhone production, with Trump threatening tariffs on iPhone shipments not manufactured domestically.

          <p>Data from the 2024 election and subsequent polling suggest a split within Gen Z, with older members (25-29) leaning more Democratic and progressive, while younger members (18-24) show increased openness to Republican ideas. This divide is influenced by factors such as the pandemic, the rise of smartphones, inflation, and the Trump presidency. Polling data indicates that younger Gen Z members hold more favorable views of Republicans in Congress and Trump, with a slightly larger share identifying with the GOP.

          <p>China, the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter, has experienced a decline in overall emissions even as energy demand increased, marking a significant shift. This decline is attributed to the country's aggressive build-out of clean energy, including wind, solar, and nuclear power. China's efforts align with its commitment to peaking emissions before 2030, although its future emissions trajectory depends on economic growth and trade relations with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Researchers are exploring treatments to slow down or eliminate menopause, which could extend women's healthy lifespans. While hormone therapy exists, new treatments aim to slow ovarian aging, potentially delaying or eliminating menopause. The concept raises questions about the societal pressure on women to remain young and fertile, balancing medical benefits with cultural expectations. Some experts believe that delaying menopause could improve women's health and reduce the risk of chronic illnesses, while others express concerns about potential risks and ethical implications.</p>

          <p>The European Union has approved the creation of a 150 billion-euro arms fund driven by fears of a Russian attack and doubts about U.S. security commitments. The Security Action for Europe (SAFE) scheme will use joint EU borrowing to provide loans to European countries for joint defense projects. The initiative aims to boost the continent's defense industry and break down national barriers by financing joint projects, with a strong emphasis on "buy European" policies.</p>
