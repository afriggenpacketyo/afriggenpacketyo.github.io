          <p>China experienced a surge in domestic tourism bookings due to the convergence of the Dragon Boat Festival and Children‚Äôs Day. Travel platforms reported a 23% year-on-year growth in short-haul domestic travel bookings, driven by ‚Äúsummer escapes‚Äù and family-friendly activities. Bookings for theme park tickets and campsites significantly increased, while family hotel packages also saw a rise.

          <p>Shares of Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson, also known as Soul Patts, and its affiliate Brickworks surged after both companies announced a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger. The new company will acquire all outstanding shares of Soul Patts and Brickworks, creating an entity worth around $9 billion with holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit. The merger will unwind a 56-year mutual ownership designed to fend off hostile takeovers, though critics argued it suppressed shareholder value and corporate transparency. Brickworks shareholders are set to receive an implied value of A$30.28 per share, reflecting a 10.1% premium over the stock's closing price last Friday. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Uganda, an affordable alternative to dirt floors is providing a big boost to human health. EarthEnable promotes and installs clay-based floors that are cheaper than concrete. These floors eliminate dust, reducing respiratory irritation, and help prevent infestations of jiggers, a parasitic flea. The company also does wall plastering to reduce dust, moisture, and insect infestations, creating employment opportunities for disadvantaged youth in the community.</p>

The team wore shirts reading ‚ÄúClub World Ca$h Grab‚Äù to highlight the disparity in bonus distribution. The MLSPA stated that FIFA will pay MLS teams large amounts to participate, but the league has refused to allocate a fair percentage of those funds to the players. The current collective bargaining agreement stipulates that players can only earn 50% of bonuses from outside tournaments, capped at $1 million for the entire team.</p>
