          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq saw modest gains, largely driven by a strong earnings report from Google's parent company, Alphabet, which boosted technology and chip-related stocks like Nvidia and Broadcom. In contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined, pulled down by disappointing results from IBM and Honeywell, as well as a drop in UnitedHealth shares following news of a Justice Department investigation. The article notes that despite recent underperformance, some stocks are showing signs of recovery, reflecting broader improvements in certain sectors. This market divergence highlights the significant impact of tech sector performance and corporate earnings on the major indices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent report from the Brookings Institution reveals a significant surge in job listings that mention artificial intelligence, with such postings increasing by over 100% in the last year alone. This demand is driven by more companies integrating AI into their operations, although AI-related jobs still constitute a small portion of the overall labor market. These positions, which range from specialized AI engineers to general software developers, offer an average salary premium of 28% compared to similar roles without AI requirements. While concentrated in tech hubs, AI-related jobs are beginning to spread to other regions and non-tech fields.</p>

          <h2>Comparing Potential Interest Earnings on a $25,000 Deposit in a CD Versus a High-Yield Savings Account</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 14:06:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers deciding where to place a significant sum like $25,000, the choice between a certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account involves a trade-off between guaranteed returns and liquidity. Based on current rates, a six-month CD could earn slightly more interest than a high-yield savings account, with the added benefit of a fixed rate that protects against potential market downturns. However, high-yield savings accounts offer the crucial advantage of penalty-free access to funds, making them a better option for emergency savings. The optimal choice depends on an individual's financial goals, timeline, and risk tolerance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has walked back its plan to eliminate paper checks for all beneficiaries, confirming it will continue the service for those without other means of receiving payments. The agency had previously announced a full transition to electronic deposits, but faced pushback over concerns for unbanked individuals, many of whom are elderly. The reversal followed a meeting between Senator Elizabeth Warren and SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano, where the commissioner committed that no one would be left behind. Approximately 600,000 Americans still rely on paper checks for their Social Security benefits.</p>

          <p>England has taken a commanding position in the fourth Test against India, thanks to a five-wicket haul from captain Ben Stokes and a blistering opening partnership. After Stokes' bowling helped restrict India to a first-innings total of 358, openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett scored rapidly, putting on 166 runs. Despite both falling short of centuries, their aggressive batting has left England at 225-2, significantly reducing their deficit. The day also featured a dramatic return by India's Rishabh Pant, who batted bravely despite a foot injury, but England's performance puts them in a strong position.</p>

          <p>Erik and Karin Vonk have transformed a retirement hobby into Richland Rum, one of Georgia's most acclaimed craft distilleries, contributing to a "rum renaissance" in the U.S. Their distillery is notable for being among the small percentage worldwide that produces rum directly from fresh sugarcane juice, which they grow on their 70-acre estate. This method, which Erik learned from his grandfather, distinguishes their product from more common molasses-based rums. The business has flourished, particularly after a 2017 change in Georgia law allowed distilleries to sell their products directly to consumers, turning their operation into a major tourist destination.</p>

          <p>Democratic Governor Tony Evers of Wisconsin has announced he will not run for a third term in 2026, setting up the first open gubernatorial race in the key battleground state in 16 years. Citing a desire to spend more time with his family after five decades in public service, the 73-year-old governor's departure opens up a high-profile contest. Evers' tenure was marked by frequent clashes with the Republican-controlled legislature, where he used his veto power extensively to block conservative priorities. His decision comes as Democrats hope to gain legislative control under new, more favorable electoral maps.</p>

          <p>Jeff Stewart, the actor famous for playing PC Reg Hollis in the ITV drama "The Bill," assisted police officers in arresting a suspected shoplifter in Southampton.

Body-worn camera footage released by the Hampshire Constabulary captured the moment, with officers thanking the actor for his help. The police department praised the "local TV legend," joking that while he may be retired from his fictional police station, "he's still got it."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly refuted claims that he plans to undermine Elon Musk's companies, such as Tesla and SpaceX, by revoking their substantial government subsidies. In a social media post, Trump stated he wants all businesses, including Musk's, to "THRIVE like never before," linking their success to the nation's prosperity. This statement comes amid a war of words between the two figures, which has included clashes over legislation and public criticisms. Musk's companies are heavily reliant on government contracts and regulatory credits, making any potential changes to these arrangements a significant financial risk.</p>

          <p>Despite high preseason expectations, the Los Angeles Dodgers are approaching the MLB trade deadline with notable roster flaws, particularly in their bullpen. While the team still holds a top record in the National League, recent struggles have tempered the "evil empire" narrative from the offseason. The front office's main priority is acquiring a high-leverage relief pitcher to bolster a bullpen that has been a clear weakness. However, it remains uncertain if they will pursue other significant upgrades, as the team appears to be betting on their underperforming, high-priced veteran stars to return to form.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced he will submit a new anti-corruption bill to Parliament, reversing course after an earlier version sparked widespread protests and condemnation from the European Union. The previous bill was criticized for undermining the independence of anti-corruption bodies, leading to the first large-scale unrest since the 2022 invasion. In response, Zelenskyy vowed the new legislation would guarantee the rule of law and the independence of these crucial institutions. This move is vital for Ukraine's ambitions to join the EU and maintain trust with international partners providing aid.</p>

          <p>The 27th season of "South Park" premiered with an episode that sharply satirized both President Donald Trump and its own parent company, Paramount. The episode was released just one day after creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker signed a new $1.5 billion licensing deal with the company. The plot directly references recent controversies, including Trump's lawsuit against Paramount, the cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," and the battle for control of Paramount Global. The premiere's defiant tone has been noted as a remarkable act of creative independence, given the massive new financial partnership.</p>
