          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the United States and China have made substantial progress in trade talks held in Geneva, with details expected to be released on Monday. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer indicated that a deal addressing national security concerns related to China's trade practices has been reached, though it remains unclear if tariffs will be reduced. These talks aim to de-escalate tensions following a trade war initiated by the Trump administration, which has imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting retaliatory measures from Beijing, disrupting global supply chains, and raising concerns about economic slowdown and inflation. This article provides context for the ongoing economic negotiations between the two countries.</p>
