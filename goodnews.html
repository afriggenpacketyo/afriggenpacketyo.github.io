          <p>Four giant pandas housed at the Adventure World amusement park in Shirahama, Japan, have been sent back to China as their loan agreement expires. The pandas‚Äîa 24-year-old female named Rauhin and her three offspring‚Äîwere transported to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding. Their departure leaves only two giant pandas remaining in Japan, both at Tokyo's Ueno Zoological Gardens, who are also scheduled to return to China by February of next year. The Wakayama zoo, which has had a successful breeding program since 1994, expressed hope in preparing to accept new pandas in the future.</p>

          <p>President Trump concluded a significant week marked by both major victories and looming challenges that could shape his presidency. The administration celebrated a favorable Supreme Court ruling limiting nationwide injunctions, increased defense spending commitments from NATO allies, and a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. However, several key issues remain unresolved, including dozens of trade deals facing a July deadline and the uncertain fate of his major tax and policy package, dubbed the "one big beautiful bill," in the Senate. The combination of successes and pending deadlines creates a period of intense pressure for the administration.</p>

          <p>Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) held a congress in Berlin where former Chancellor Olaf Scholz delivered a farewell speech, reflecting on his government's policies. In his address, Scholz defended his administration's actions and warned against underestimating Russian President Vladimir Putin's ambitions in Ukraine, emphasizing the need for a stronger German military and NATO cooperation. He also called for higher earners to contribute more to defense funding. The event marks a transition for the party, as former co-leader Saskia Esken also did not seek re-election, signaling a new chapter for the SPD.</p>

          <p>Deontay Wilder, former heavyweight world champion, made a successful return to boxing with a seventh-round stoppage victory over Tyrrell Herndon in a low-key event in Kansas. This marks Wilder's first win since October 2022, following three losses in his previous four fights. The 39-year-old, known as the "Bronze Bomber," appeared more composed, utilizing his jab and setting up shots rather than relying solely on his signature powerful right hand. After the fight, Wilder stated this is a "new beginning" for him and that he is focused on becoming a more complete fighter as he works his way back toward title contention.</p>

Louise Hill, founder of GoHenry, suggests using tangible methods like giving children physical cash as pocket money to help them understand its value and the concept of saving over time. For teenagers, she recommends "pizza budgeting," a visual exercise where a whole pizza represents income and slices are cut out for expenses like rent and bills. This approach helps children grasp the realities of household finances and the importance of earning before spending.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a top economist at China International Capital Corporation, China's established third-party payment systems like WeChat and Alipay give the country a "comparative advantage" in the developing field of stablecoins. Chief Economist Peng Wensheng argued that these platforms already function similarly to stablecoins by being pegged 1:1 with fiat currency and are supported by a mature regulatory framework. He noted that these systems are extensions of legal tender with strong safeguards, including backing by central bank money. This analysis comes as Chinese state media encourages policymakers to remain competitive in the global financial technology race. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has successfully completed the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted via blood vessels. This minimally invasive technique, which avoids open-skull surgery like that used by Elon Musk's Neuralink, was used to help a paralyzed patient regain some limb movement. Surgeons inserted a stent electrode into the patient's intracranial vasculature through a vein in the neck. This innovative approach reportedly reduces surgical risk and shortens recovery time, marking a significant advancement in the field of neurotechnology and BCI development.</p>
