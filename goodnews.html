          <p>Following last year's devastating floods in Valencia, Spain, a university-led initiative is working to salvage and restore thousands of family photographs. The project, named "Let's Save the Photos," was started after volunteers noticed entire photo albums being discarded amidst the cleanup of debris. Students and professors at Valencia's Polytechnic University are carefully cleaning, drying, and digitizing approximately 340,000 images, preserving precious memories for families who lost their homes and possessions in the disaster.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi has made history by being elected as Japan's first female prime minister after securing a majority in a parliamentary vote. Her victory was solidified after her ruling Liberal Democratic Party formed a coalition with the Japan Innovation Party, agreeing to support policies like a pause on food consumption tax. The political development caused fluctuations in financial markets, with the Nikkei 225 erasing earlier gains and the yen weakening slightly against the dollar, reflecting some uncertainty about the new administration.</p>

          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from China and Australia has identified a potential new strategy for combating prostate cancer. Their research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, pinpoints two protein enzymes that are critical for the growth, survival, and treatment resistance of prostate cancer cells. By understanding how these enzymes regulate the androgen receptor protein, which fuels the disease, the researchers believe it may be possible to develop new and more effective therapeutic interventions in the future.</p>

          <p>An exploratory voyage in the Gascoyne Marine Park off Western Australia has led to the discovery of several new deep-sea species by Australian scientists. Among the finds are a tiny, bioluminescent lantern shark that glows from its belly and a semi-transparent porcelain crab that uses hairs to filter-feed on plankton. These discoveries highlight the vast unexplored biodiversity in Australia's oceans, with researchers estimating that hundreds more specimens collected during the voyage have yet to be scientifically described and named.</p>

Offensively, Seattle quarterback Sam Darnold connected with Jaxon Smith-Njigba for a touchdown, while running back Zach Charbonnet scored twice to secure the victory.

Funded in part by the city, the project aims to restore marine ecosystems, create an ecotourism destination accessible to snorkelers, and serve as public housing for fish.</p>
