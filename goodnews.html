          <p>The Tokyo government has initiated a project to convert a two-kilometer expressway in the Ginza district into an elevated greenway, named the Tokyo Sky Corridor, expected to be completed by the 2040s. This redevelopment aims to replace the existing Tokyo Expressway, also known as the "KK Line," with a pedestrian-friendly promenade featuring trees, flowers, benches, and public restrooms. The project, inspired by New York City's High Line, intends to create a new tourist attraction with cafes and food trucks, but faces challenges such as managing summer heat and ensuring the structure can support the added weight of soil and plant life. The estimated cost is 14 billion yen ($97 million), potentially increasing due to rising material prices.</p>

          <p>Actor Danny Dyer revealed that a letter from his daughter Dani convinced him to stay in rehab in 2016, after initially wanting to leave. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Dyer explained that the letter made him realize the pain he was causing his family due to his addiction and the toxic nature of fame. Dyer, known for his role in EastEnders, admitted to making bad decisions and excessive drug use earlier in his career, but has since turned his life around, citing his family and his role in the show as key turning points. He emphasized the far-reaching impact of addiction on loved ones, not just the individual struggling with it.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating conflict between India and Pakistan following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, the Trump administration, initially hesitant, intervened to prevent a potential nuclear war. Vice President JD Vance and National Security Advisor Marco Rubio engaged with leaders from both countries after evidence suggested the conflict was spiraling out of control, including Pakistani air force activity near its nuclear arsenal. The intervention involved direct calls from Vance to Prime Minister Modi and Rubio to General Munir, urging de-escalation and proposing alternatives to continued strikes. President Trump announced a cease-fire, with Pakistan acknowledging American involvement while India remained silent on the matter.</p>

Speaking at a town hall in Pennsylvania, Gallego cited Joe Rogan as an example of someone the party effectively "canceled" due to ideological disagreements. Gallego, who won his Senate race in a state with more registered Republicans than Democrats, emphasized the need for alliances with those who may not agree with the party 100% of the time. He believes Democrats should focus on empathizing with voters' economic struggles and communicating a message of support and assistance.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan expressed reservations about cutting the consumption tax as a measure to alleviate inflation, citing potential strain on the country's finances. While opposition parties advocate for a consumption tax cut ahead of the upcoming House of Councillors election, Ishiba emphasized the need for thorough discussions on alternative support methods for those in need. He also stated that Japan would continue to seek the complete abolition of additional duties on Japanese exports in tariff negotiations with the United States. The Prime Minister's remarks come amidst debate between government officials and members of the ruling coalition regarding the feasibility and impact of a consumption tax reduction.</p>

          <p>As China seeks to diversify its food import sources amid global uncertainties, its southwestern province of Yunnan is playing a key role in agricultural cooperation with Southeast Asian nations. Yunnan's involvement dates back to the "alternative crop cultivation programme," aimed at reducing opium production by sharing agricultural technology. With China's rising demand for agricultural products and limited farmland, overseas agricultural investment and cooperation are seen as effective ways to support the country's food security. Changing food consumption patterns in China, with increased demand for meat, dairy, fruits, and vegetables, further drive the need for diversified food sources.</p>

          <p>Despite the Japanese government approving app-based digital salary payments two years ago, the method has yet to gain widespread popularity in the country. A recent survey showed that only a small percentage of workers are paid via mobile payment apps, even though most are aware of the option. Experts believe that more benefits are needed to incentivize adoption, and that targeting part-time workers could increase uptake. While Japan is slowly moving towards a cashless society, a significant portion of the population remains uninterested in receiving salaries through apps, citing a lack of perceived need.</p>
