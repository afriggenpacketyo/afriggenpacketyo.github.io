          <h2>Retired Police Dogs May Need Pensions to Cover Medical Costs, Advocates Say</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 01:12:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A charity is advocating for pensions for retired police dogs to assist with their often complicated and costly medical needs. Many of these dogs face chronic health issues and injuries resulting from their service, with annual costs averaging around ¬£3,000 more than typical dogs. One dog owner spent an estimated ¬£12,000 caring for three retired service animals, including vet bills and special care. Some fear that without financial support, potential adopters may be deterred, leading to ethical concerns such as euthanasia, but Nottinghamshire Police announced in 2013 it would start paying pensions to its retiring dogs. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>E-commerce giants Shein and Temu have experienced a significant decrease in U.S. demand, attributed to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports and the end of the 'de minimis' trade loophole. Temu's daily active users in the U.S. fell by 52% in May compared to March, while Shein's declined by 25%. These drops are also reflected in lower rankings on the Apple App Store for both platforms. The decline in user engagement coincides with a reduction in U.S. advertising spending by both companies following the tariff announcements, which ended the exemption for low-cost goods under $800.</p>

Khan held talks with Levesque, now WWE's chief content officer, in July of last year, further fueling speculation about London as a possible Wrestlemania destination, and he believes this will open a new market for the WWE.</p>

          <p>The rise of decentralized solar power, largely driven by cheap Chinese solar panels, is creating a disruption in Pakistan's energy market. A Pakistani think tank suggests that China should play a leading role in Pakistan's energy transition, setting an example for other countries in the Global South. The influx of Chinese solar panels is undercutting demand for power from coal-fired plants that China helped finance, leading to stranded assets. Pakistan has become the second-largest destination for Chinese solar panels due to its zero tax rate on imports, but a Chinese energy scholar questions whether this vision is too expensive.</p>

          <p>The Japan Tourism Agency is shifting its focus from inbound visitors to domestic travelers to revitalize regional economies. A government report highlights that domestic tourism has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels, despite a surge in foreign visitors. The agency aims to increase the frequency and duration of trips among Japanese travelers, particularly the younger generation, by promoting engagement with local communities. Initiatives include facilitating interactions between travelers and locals to foster repeat visits and creating a sense of returning home, such as the 'learcation' program in Aichi Prefecture, which allows working parents to take children out of school for educational experiences.</p>

The "Humboldt Project" involves building a 14,800-kilometer cable from Valparaiso, Chile, to Sydney, Australia, via French Polynesia. This initiative aims to provide a faster alternative for Chile's connectivity and is expected to benefit other South American countries like Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil. Google has invested between $300 million and $550 million in the project, with the Chilean government contributing $25 million, and the cable will also reduce the lapse between sending and receiving a signal.</p>

          <p>This weekend, Italians will participate in a referendum that includes a proposal to halve the time of legal residency required for non-EU adult foreigners to apply for Italian citizenship, from 10 to five years. For the past three decades, the Italian state has been tightening up its citizenship rules so that fewer and fewer are eligible. By relaxing the rules on naturalisation, Italians would be recognising the dignity and diversity of millions more of their should-be-compatriots, and enriching their own national story with new protagonists in the process. The government seems to be hoping that fewer than 50% of Italians will turn up to the polls, that the referendum will not reach quorum and that the organisers will be humiliated for their efforts.</p>

          <p>The Washington Department of Natural Resources used a firefighting helicopter to haul abandoned boats off an uninhabited island in Puget Sound, flying them to the mainland for deconstruction. This was the agency's largest operation of its kind, with 14 vessels removed. The state agency opts to airlift boats when towing them would disrupt the marine bed or surrounding environment too much, and the aquatic lands where the boats land often include kelp beds, which are critical for supporting the forage fish that salmon rely on. Since the boat removal program began in 2002, the department has hauled out more than 1,200 derelict vessels.</p>

          <p>Palisades Charter High School held its graduation ceremony at the Hollywood Bowl after the Palisades fire badly damaged their high school. The 740 graduating seniors were honored to relocate their graduation to the Hollywood Bowl, and students initially returned to school online and later resumed in-person classes at a Santa Monica building that formerly housed a Sears. Steve Kerr, coach of the Golden State Warriors, and comedian Billy Crystal spoke at the graduation, and Crystal said the Palisades fire offered the students important life lessons.</p>
