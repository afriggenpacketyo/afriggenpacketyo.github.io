          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have been directed to stop deportations under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The policy had allowed for the summary removal of migrants entering the country illegally, but the court ruled that the government cannot ignore other laws that protect individuals from being deported to places where they could face torture or persecution. This directive effectively reopens the U.S. asylum system, which the administration had credited for a steep drop in illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) has agreed to a $1.7 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit filed by 45 California counties alleging the company improperly disposed of hazardous waste. According to the suit, numerous UPS facilities irresponsibly discarded corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials in regular trash bins, which were then sent to landfills not equipped to handle such waste. Officials noted that UPS was cooperative and, in advance of the settlement, had already implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs.</p>

          <p>This time of year marks the peak of tarantula mating season in California, when the large, fuzzy spiders become much more visible as males leave their burrows in search of mates. Experts say sightings are common at dusk in desert, chaparral, and mountain areas throughout Southern California, including in popular parks like Joshua Tree and Griffith Park. While their appearance can be startling to those with arachnophobia, native tarantulas are generally shy, slow-moving, and pose no serious threat to humans unless severely provoked.</p>

          <p>In a significant archaeological find, researchers have discovered the remains of an auroch, an extinct species of large wild cattle, within a cave in the Yorkshire Dales. The discovery was made during a survey of caverns near Ingleborough as part of a larger heritage project. The team also found evidence that the cave system was used as a human burial site during the Neolithic period, shedding new light on the lives and farming practices of prehistoric communities who inhabited the region thousands of years ago.</p>

          <p>Shares for American Eagle Outfitters experienced a dramatic surge of over 20% after President Trump praised the retailer's controversial ad campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. The ad, which played on the word "genes/jeans," had been criticized online for allegedly promoting eugenics. Trump's endorsement on Truth Social, where he called it the "HOTTEST" ad, turned the backlash into a meme-stock rally for the company, which has recently faced significant financial challenges and slow sales.

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society reveals a significant increase in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among U.S. adults aged 45 to 49. The findings link this rise directly to a 62% increase in screening rates within this age group, following recommendations to lower the starting age for screenings from 50 to 45. While this is promising news for early detection, researchers emphasize that overall screening rates for younger adults remain suboptimal and are not equitable across different insurance and education levels.</p>
