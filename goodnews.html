          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from federalizing and deploying the Oregon National Guard to Portland. The judge ruled that the president's justification for the deployment was 'untethered to the facts' and likely exceeded his constitutional authority. This decision underscores the ongoing legal battles over the separation of powers between the federal government and individual states. The ruling highlights concerns about the potential for military intrusion into civil affairs and the importance of upholding the rule of law over executive actions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent trend shows that queuing for hours for product launches or store openings has evolved from an inconvenience into a social activity in itself. Many participants find excitement and a sense of camaraderie in the shared experience, often making new friends while they wait. Brands are capitalizing on this by creating 'experiential marketing' events with exclusive freebies, entertainment, and social media-worthy moments to generate buzz. Psychologists explain that the anticipation of a reward releases dopamine, making the act of waiting for something desirable a pleasurable event for many.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), a predominantly white denomination, has installed Reverend Yehiel Curry as its first-ever Black presiding bishop. This landmark appointment is seen as a significant step toward greater diversity and representation within the church's leadership. Bishop Curry, who will serve a six-year term, takes the helm of the 2.7-million-member church as it, like other mainline Protestant denominations, faces challenges of declining membership. His installation is celebrated as a moment of progress and hope for fostering more leaders of color within the ELCA.</p>

          <p>Thousands of demonstrators participated in a Pride march in the Hungarian city of Pecs, defying a police ban upheld by the country's Supreme Court. The rally was a protest against the increasingly restrictive policies toward the LGBTQ+ community under Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. Protesters, including some Members of the European Parliament, waved rainbow and EU flags, condemning the government's actions as an infringement on fundamental human rights. The event highlights the growing tension between Hungary's conservative government and citizens advocating for civil liberties and tolerance.</p>

          <h2>Vilnius Airport Temporarily Closes Airspace Due to Suspected Hot Air Balloons</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lithuania's Vilnius Airport experienced a temporary but complete closure of its airspace during the early hours of Sunday morning. The disruption was reportedly caused by the sighting of a series of hot air balloons potentially drifting into the flight paths near the airport. As a precautionary measure, all flights were suspended, with several being redirected to other airports, including Kaunas and Riga. The airport has since reopened, but the incident highlights an unusual and rare cause for airspace closure in European aviation.</p>

          <p>The UCLA Bruins, who were previously 0-4, secured a shocking 42-37 victory against No. 7 ranked Penn State in a dramatic turnaround. The win came just days after a coaching staff overhaul that saw tight ends coach Jerry Neuheisel elevated to offensive play-caller. Quarterback Nico Iamaleava had a standout performance, accounting for five touchdowns while leading an offense that had struggled all season. The upset provides a moment of redemption for the embattled program and its fans, marking one of the biggest surprises of the college football season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts explain that 'freshers' flu,' the wave of cold-like illness common among new university students, is not a single virus but an assortment of common respiratory infections. The phenomenon is fueled by thousands of students from diverse locations converging in close quarters, creating a 'mixing pot' for viruses they haven't previously encountered. Factors like stress, lack of sleep, poor diet, and increased alcohol consumption during the first weeks of term can weaken the immune system. This combination makes students particularly susceptible to catching and spreading these illnesses so rapidly.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order to halt a Trump administration policy that would keep unaccompanied immigrant children in custody after they turn 18. The ruling prevents their transfer to adult ICE detention centers, which advocates said was planned to begin immediately. U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that automatically detaining these young adults violates a 2021 court order requiring they be released to the 'least restrictive setting available.' This decision marks another legal setback for the administration's controversial and evolving immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>Thousands gathered in Tel Aviv's Hostage Square with a renewed sense of hope following Hamas's acceptance of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire proposal. The rally, a weekly event demanding the return of hostages, had a more optimistic tone as many attendees credited President Trump with brokering a deal they felt their own government could not. While celebrating the potential breakthrough, many protesters remained skeptical, fearing that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might find a way to sabotage the agreement. The sentiment reflects a deep public desire to end the conflict and secure the release of the remaining hostages.</p>

While cautious optimism surrounds the negotiations, significant obstacles remain, including Hamas's demand for a full Israeli withdrawal.

          <p>President Trump has urged Hamas to 'move quickly' on a U.S.-brokered peace plan, warning that 'all bets will be off' if there are delays. His statement comes as a U.S. negotiating team, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, travels to Cairo to finalize the details of the agreement. The plan requires Hamas to release all remaining hostages, after which a phased Israeli withdrawal and prisoner exchange would commence. While Israel has reportedly reduced its military operations to allow the process to proceed, the situation remains fragile as talks focus on the complex details of implementation.</p>
