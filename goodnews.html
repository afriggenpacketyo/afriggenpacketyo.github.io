          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar is set to win his fourth Tour de France after maintaining his overall lead in the penultimate stage. The final day is traditionally processional, meaning his victory is virtually assured barring any accidents. Australian sprinter Kaden Groves secured his first-ever Tour stage win in Pontarlier after a bold solo attack with 16 kilometers remaining. This victory marks a significant career milestone for Groves, as he has now won stages in all three of cycling's Grand Tours.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris narrowly beat his teammate Oscar Piastri to claim pole position for the Belgian Grand Prix. Norris edged out the championship leader by just 0.085 seconds in a thrilling qualifying session. Red Bull's Max Verstappen made errors on his final lap and will start in fourth, behind Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. In a significant upset, Lewis Hamilton was eliminated in the first session after his lap time was deleted for exceeding track limits, relegating the Mercedes driver to a 16th-place start for Sunday's race.</p>

          <p>A Japanese nutritionist living in the U.S. shared her experience shopping at a Costco in Kyoto, Japan, highlighting significant differences from American stores. She was impressed by the vast selection of traditional and healthy Japanese foods available in bulk. Among her notable finds were a wide variety of seaweeds rich in minerals, diverse soy-based products like freeze-dried tofu, and an abundance of seasonal Japanese produce. The store also offered a range of healthy ready-to-eat meals, traditional rice crackers, and a large selection of green teas.</p>

          <p>A routine pre-surgery X-ray led to a devastating diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) for Christopher Kennedy, a 68-year-old who had no prior symptoms. With his lung function rapidly declining and a prognosis of less than a year to live, doctors at the Cleveland Clinic offered a double-lung transplant as his only option. Despite initial resistance, Kennedy underwent the successful procedure and is now recovering, with his lung capacity at 98%. His journey highlights the silent progression of IPF and the life-altering potential of organ transplantation.</p>

          <p>According to sources, US President Donald Trump is interested in visiting China this autumn, with officials in Washington and Beijing working to arrange a trip in October or November. A previously rumored September visit is reportedly no longer being considered. A potential meeting could occur before or after the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in South Korea. The discussions follow a recent meeting between the US and Chinese foreign ministers, which was described as positive and a necessary step before any potential leader-level summit can take place.</p>

          <p>A provision in the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act has made a key student loan benefit permanent, encouraging more employers to help workers pay down their debt. The law solidifies a tax exclusion that allows companies to contribute up to $5,250 annually toward an employee's student loans on a tax-free basis. This move provides certainty for employers who were hesitant to offer the benefit due to its previous temporary status. As federal loan repayment options narrow, workplace benefits like these are becoming an increasingly important lifeline for millions of Americans with student debt. (not investment advice)</p>

This move signals the formation of competing technological camps, with China promoting a multilateral approach while the U.S. focuses on building alliances and countering China's influence in the critical AI field.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has unexpectedly released a new album, 'Swag,' with its lead single 'Daisies' quickly climbing to number two on the Billboard Hot 100, providing a potential 'song of the summer.' The album marks a departure from his previous pop sound, embracing a more subtle, R&B-influenced style with aqueous, muffled production. Critics note the album's downtempo yet intricate sound seems to capture the current cultural mood, offering a soothing and melancholic vibe rather than an upbeat party anthem. The release is Bieber's first since parting ways with long-time manager Scooter Braun.</p>

          <p>The U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) narrowly avoided a $400 million funding cut, but its long-term future remains uncertain under the Trump administration. The program, credited with saving 26 million lives since 2003, has faced significant disruptions due to a halt in foreign aid, impacting services and treatment adherence in countries like Mozambique. While the funding for the current year was preserved due to bipartisan support, experts worry about proposed cuts for next year and the cessation of most HIV prevention work, which could undermine decades of progress against the global epidemic.</p>

          <p>According to Harvard professor Alison Wood Brooks, taking just 30 seconds to prepare before even casual conversations can significantly improve their outcome and make you more influential. This brief mental rehearsal involves thinking about topics, questions, or goals for the interaction. Wood Brooks explains that this forethought allows you to be more present and prepared, as brainstorming during the conversation itself is cognitively overwhelming. This simple strategy can help build stronger relationships and enhance communication skills in both personal and professional settings by making you appear more considerate and prepared.</p>

The moment highlighted the unique challenges even elite athletes face in the U.S. employer-based healthcare system, where eligibility is tied to active employment.

The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to flip the balance of power in the legislature. The KMT and its allies currently hold a majority, enabling them to block legislation from President Lai Ching-te's government.
