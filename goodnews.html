          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was detained by ICE in March but has returned to Massachusetts after a judge ordered her release. Ozturk expressed gratitude for the support she received during her detention, mentioning the letters and books read to her by her labmates. Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley welcomed her home, emphasizing the importance of due process and free speech. Ozturk's lawyers argued that her First Amendment rights were violated when she was detained for co-authoring an op-ed about Israel's war with Hamas in the Tufts student newspaper, which the Trump administration cited as the reason for revoking her student visa.</p>

          <p>Willie Eugene Sims, 69, has been charged with the 1977 murder of Jeannette Ralston in San Jose, California, nearly 50 years after her death. Ralston was found strangled in her car after telling friends she would be back in 10 minutes, with the case going cold due to lack of leads. A thumbprint found on a cigarette carton at the scene, matched Sims through an upgraded FBI fingerprint search algorithm. Sims, who was stationed at Fort Ord at the time of the murder, had a prior conviction for assault to commit murder in 1978.</p>

The fishermen had been missing since mid-March and were found on May 7, reporting damage to their boat's alternator shortly after setting sail. The Ecuadorian Navy is coordinating with authorities to ensure their safe return to their respective countries. This rescue follows a similar incident earlier this year where another Peruvian fisherman spent 95 days at sea alone before being rescued by an Ecuadorian vessel.</p>

Despite multiple rounds of tit-for-tat tariffs, both sides have been sending signals that they want to break the deadlock. Except it wasn't clear who would blink first. The BBC found that Chinese exporters have been reeling from the steep tariffs, with stock piling up in warehouses, even as they strike a defiant note and look for markets beyond the US.</p>
