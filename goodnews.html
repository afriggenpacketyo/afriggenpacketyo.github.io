          <p>Former President Trump is actively working to coordinate a direct meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which would mark their first face-to-face interaction since the invasion. This diplomatic push follows Trump's recent White House discussions with Zelenskyy and European leaders, where security guarantees for Ukraine were a key focus. Hungary is among the potential host countries for the summit, with the White House aiming to finalize details soon. Trump emphasized the need for both leaders to show flexibility, suggesting he would join trilateral talks only after their initial bilateral meeting.</p>

          <p>The senior living real estate market is experiencing a significant supply-demand imbalance as over 4 million baby boomers approach age 80 in the next five years. Occupancy rates are rapidly increasing, while annual inventory growth has fallen below 1%, the lowest since 2006. High interest rates are a primary barrier to new development, with only about 4,000 new units expected this year and next, far short of the 100,000 annual beds needed through 2040. Despite these challenges, major investors like Ventas and Harrison Street are betting big on the sector, seeing strong returns and growth potential. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Diana Bojorquez, wife of Cleveland Browns punter Corey Bojorquez, revealed her unconventional solution for an emergency school contact for their daughter in Ohio. Due to the transient nature of NFL life and lack of local family or close friends, she listed the Cleveland Browns security number. This choice ensures reliable contact in emergencies, as the security team has direct access to her husband even during meetings. Other NFL wives have reportedly praised this innovative approach, highlighting a common challenge for families in professional sports.</p>

This action aims to combat forced labor practices, which Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called "repulsive."

          <p>The House Oversight Committee plans to release documents from the Justice Department related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, following an August subpoena. The committee expects to receive the files this week and will make them public after redacting victim identification and child sexual abuse material. This move comes amid ongoing controversy and public demand for transparency surrounding Epstein's case, particularly after an internal Justice Department review found no "client list" or evidence of blackmail. Chairman James Comer emphasized the Trump Administration's commitment to transparency in this matter.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission has filed a complaint against a group accused of using fake accounts and specialized software to fraudulently acquire and resell hundreds of thousands of concert tickets on Ticketmaster. The alleged scheme involved purchasing nearly $57 million worth of tickets for artists like Taylor Swift and Bruce Springsteen, then reselling them for a profit of nearly $7 million. This operation, which reportedly netted $1.2 million from Taylor Swift's Eras Tour alone, is deemed a violation of the Better Online Ticket Sales Act. The FTC's action highlights ongoing issues within the ticketing industry, previously criticized by artists like Taylor Swift for its inability to manage demand.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has lauded "steady progress" in improving bilateral relations with China during a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. This marks a significant thaw after years of strained ties, including a deadly border clash in 2020. Modi is set to visit China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, his first trip in seven years, signaling a new energy in diplomatic ties. The improved relationship comes as U.S. President Trump's aggressive tariff policies have increased friction between New Delhi and Washington, potentially influencing India's pivot towards China.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has stated that Intel must provide the U.S. government with an equity stake in return for CHIPS Act funds, a shift from previous grant-based arrangements. This proposal, which could involve a 10% stake making the government Intel's largest shareholder, aims to give the American people a "piece of the action" without voting rights. The move comes as Intel's stock rallied amid reports of potential Trump administration involvement and a new $2 billion investment from SoftBank. Lutnick suggested similar equity deals could be sought with other CHIPS recipients, reinforcing a focus on reshoring U.S. manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple is reportedly increasing iPhone production at five factories in India, including new plants and facilities belonging to Tata Group and Foxconn Technology. This expansion aims to reduce Apple's reliance on China, especially in light of recent trade tensions. The move comes as the White House expresses concern and imposes tariffs on India due to its continued purchases of sanctioned Russian oil, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent accusing India of "profiteering." Despite these geopolitical complexities, Apple's significant investments in U.S. manufacturing are expected to mitigate the impact of India-related tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The transfer saga involving Newcastle striker Alexander Isak and Liverpool continues, with no new offers since Liverpool's initial £110m bid was rejected. Newcastle maintains Isak is not for sale, but Liverpool is expected to increase their offer to at least £120m once Newcastle secures two replacement strikers. Newcastle faces challenges in finding suitable replacements for Callum Wilson, with targets proving expensive and difficult to acquire at this late stage of the transfer window. The situation remains a waiting game, with Isak currently training away from the main squad.</p>

          <p>NASA's Webb Space Telescope has made a significant discovery, spotting a previously unknown tiny moon orbiting Uranus. This new lunar addition, estimated to be just 6 miles (10 kilometers) wide, was detected by the telescope's near-infrared camera during observations in February. Scientists believe its faintness and small size allowed it to elude detection, even by the Voyager 2 spacecraft decades ago. This finding increases Uranus's known moon count to 29, with the new moon still awaiting a formal name.</p>

The diverse list of potential candidates includes current and former central bank officials, economists, and Wall Street experts. This selection process is critical as the Fed approaches its next policy meeting, where a quarter-percentage point rate reduction is widely anticipated. (not investment advice)</p>
