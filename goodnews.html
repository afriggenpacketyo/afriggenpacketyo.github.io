          <p>Uber's first-quarter earnings surpassed expectations, reporting 83 cents per share against an anticipated 50 cents, but revenue fell short at $11.53 billion compared to the expected $11.62 billion. Despite this, overall revenue grew by 14% compared to the previous year, and the company reported a net income of $1.78 billion, a significant turnaround from the previous year's net loss. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi anticipates gross bookings between $45.75 billion and $47.25 billion for the current quarter, with adjusted EBITDA between $2.02 billion and $2.12 billion. Khosrowshahi also addressed the FTC lawsuit regarding Uber One's billing practices, defending the subscription service's transparency and ease of cancellation.</p>

Khosrowshahi stated that the changes are not related to cost-cutting or planned layoffs, but rather a strategic move to ensure Uber operates at its best as a "Gen-AI powered company." He stated that the company needs to be on its A game, and employees should be more interested in learning and their impact on the company than on its benefits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that the Chav√≠n people of ancient Peru used psychoactive drugs during exclusive rituals to reinforce social hierarchies. Archaeologists discovered artifacts, including "snuff tubes," at Chav√≠n de Hu√°ntar containing traces of hallucinogenic substances like DMT and tobacco. These rituals, likely reserved for a select few, may have played a crucial role in the transition from egalitarian societies to stratified ones. By providing access to altered states of consciousness, the ceremonies potentially justified or normalized social, political, and economic inequality.</p>
