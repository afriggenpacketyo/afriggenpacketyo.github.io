          <p>A father is being hailed as a hero after he saved his four-year-old child from a mountain lion attack in Washington's Olympic National Park. The child was walking with family on a popular trail when the attack occurred and was subsequently airlifted to a trauma center, where they were reported to be in satisfactory condition and later released. Park rangers located and killed the cougar, which had been fitted with a tracking collar, and stated there is no ongoing threat to the public. Witnesses at the scene praised the father's quick actions, believing they were crucial to the child's survival.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has announced plans to invest $50 billion in its U.S. manufacturing and research operations by 2030. A key part of this commitment is a new facility in Virginia dedicated to producing its weight management and metabolic treatments, including an oral GLP-1 obesity pill. This move follows similar announcements from other major pharma companies and comes amid the Trump administration's push to reshore manufacturing and threats of steep tariffs on the industry. The investment is expected to create thousands of jobs and support AstraZeneca's goal of reaching $80 billion in annual revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Formula 1 Q&A article addresses several key topics, including the potential for Max Verstappen to move to Aston Martin, a move considered unlikely at present. It also discusses the challenges for new Red Bull team principal Laurent Mekies, who is replacing the ousted Christian Horner. The analysis delves into the technical aspects of the upcoming 2026 regulations, explaining why current car floor designs are not relevant for the new rules, which will reintroduce 'step-plane' floors. Finally, it explores how teams gauge competitors' engine development progress through industry chatter and personnel movement.</p>

          <h2>Large Rare Earth Deposit in Norway Offers Potential for European Supply Chain Independence</h2>

          <p>A massive deposit of rare earth elements discovered beneath the small Norwegian town of Ulefoss could be crucial for Europe's goal of securing its own supply of these critical minerals. The Fen complex, the continent's largest known deposit, is vital as the EU currently relies almost entirely on China for these materials used in technologies from electric vehicles to defense systems. The mining company, Rare Earths Norway, plans an "invisible mine" to extract the minerals with minimal disruption to the town above. If successful, the project could significantly reduce Europe's strategic dependency on China by 2030.</p>

          <p>Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the owner of the Los Angeles Times, has announced his intention to take the newspaper public within the next year. He stated the goal is to "democratize" the paper and allow public ownership, providing a platform for diverse voices. While specific details of the public offering were not disclosed, the move comes as The Times, like many news organizations, navigates significant financial challenges. Soon-Shiong, a billionaire who made his fortune in biotechnology, purchased the newspaper in 2018, returning it to local ownership after years under a Chicago-based company.</p>

The talks are expected to focus on countering China's assertiveness in the South China Sea and negotiating a trade deal to avert threatened U.S. tariffs. Marcos' visit underscores the strategic importance of the U.S.-Philippines alliance amid shifting regional geopolitics. U.S. officials have reiterated their commitment to the mutual defense treaty, which extends to attacks on Philippine vessels anywhere in the Pacific, including the contested waters.</p>

          <p>The race to commercialize solid-state batteries for electric vehicles is gaining momentum, with major automakers like Volkswagen, Toyota, and Stellantis targeting mass production before the end of the decade. Touted for their potential for higher energy density, improved safety, and faster charging, these batteries are seen as the next generation of EV technology. While some companies are focusing on semi-solid-state batteries as a practical intermediate step, the industry faces challenges like high production costs and technological hurdles. The push is also fueled by a desire for Western producers to localize production and reduce reliance on China's dominant supply chains.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a commentary piece, Slovenian writer Ana Schnabl reflects on the narrow expectations faced by authors from the Balkans in the Western literary market. She argues that U.S. and British publishers often seek stories that focus on the region's history of war, political turmoil, and cultural trauma, effectively typecasting writers as explainers of their "problematic" homelands. This unspoken condition, she contends, overlooks a diverse range of contemporary stories and reinforces a perception of the Balkans as a place of perpetual tragedy. She calls for publishers to embrace a wider variety of narratives beyond those that fit preconceived, self-exoticizing molds.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced "substantial changes" to the compensation scheme for victims of the infected blood scandal, which affected an estimated 30,000 people. The move comes after a critical report from the public inquiry chair described the scheme's rollout as "profoundly unsatisfactory." Key changes include allowing compensation to be passed to a family member's estate if they die before their claim is settled. While victims' groups cautiously welcomed the news, they expressed disappointment that some issues are still subject to further consultation, and noted that the changes will add an additional £1 billion to the scheme's cost.</p>
