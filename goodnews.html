          <p>Johns Hopkins University professor Yuen Yuen Ang discusses the critical role of innovation in shaping the future for China, the United States, and the world. In an exclusive interview, she reflects on the historical context of US-China engagement, emphasizing the deep investment past leaders made in fostering mutual understanding. Ang suggests that a decline in American expertise on China could be detrimental. She advocates for a renewed focus on building a community of experts to navigate the complex, adaptive relationship between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has affirmed a block on a Trump administration executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens and temporary residents. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the order unconstitutional, aligning with a lower court's decision. This ruling keeps a nationwide injunction in place, preventing the policy's enforcement while setting the stage for a potential Supreme Court review. The case was brought by several states arguing against the creation of inconsistent citizenship laws across the country.</p>

          <p>China and Russia have relaunched their joint oceanographic research for the first time in five years, signaling deepening scientific and strategic cooperation. A team of 25 scientists set sail from Vladivostok on a 45-day expedition to study climate change effects in the Bering Sea and the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The mission, focused on deep-sea environments and sediment processes, is officially aimed at addressing global climate change. However, the resumption of these joint missions is also seen as part of the two nations' broader strategic ambitions, particularly concerning the Arctic region.</p>

          <p>The MLS All-Star game provided entertainment but also fueled a debate about its purpose and future, highlighted by the absence of superstar Lionel Messi. While the match, which saw the MLS team defeat a Liga MX selection 3-1, offered a fun spectacle, Messi's decision to skip the event for rest has raised questions. The article suggests that while the game is a fixture of American sports culture, Messi's no-show may be a form of respect for more meaningful competitions. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged the need to re-evaluate the All-Star format to keep it compelling for players and fans.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has urged the European Union to enhance mutual trust and deepen cooperation, describing the two as "two big guys" on the world stage.

          <p>A major study indicates that walking just 7,000 steps a day is linked to significant health benefits, including a reduced risk of dementia, cancer, and heart disease. Published in The Lancet Public Health, the research suggests this may be a more achievable and evidence-based target than the popular but unscientific 10,000-step goal. The findings, which analyzed data from over 160,000 adults, showed substantial health improvements compared to low-activity levels. Researchers hope this more realistic benchmark will encourage more people to use step-tracking as a practical tool for improving their well-being.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing to commemorate the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations, though the summit was overshadowed by significant disagreements. The EU has voiced strong complaints about uneven market access for its firms, China's industrial subsidies, and its stance on Russia's war in Ukraine. Despite Chinese state media calling for partnership, Brussels has framed the talks as a chance for "frank" discussion on all aspects of the relationship. The meeting highlights the complex dynamic between the two economic powers, who are simultaneously partners and systemic rivals.</p>

          <p>A Scripps Institution of Oceanography researcher discovered a rare violet sea snail, Janthina janthina, on a La Jolla beach, a species not seen locally in a decade. These snails, which float on the open ocean using a self-made bubble raft, are typically found in warmer tropical waters. Their appearance in Southern California often coincides with warmer ocean currents moving ashore, raising questions among scientists about a potential link to climate change. While a direct connection is not certain, researchers will monitor for more sightings if warm water trends continue.</p>

          <p>South Korean semiconductor firm SK Hynix has announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, significantly exceeding market expectations. The surge is attributed to powerful, sustained demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are essential components for artificial intelligence technologies used by companies like Nvidia. The company's leadership in the HBM market has challenged competitors and solidified its position as a key player in the AI supply chain. SK Hynix anticipates strong demand will continue for the rest of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New regulations in the UK now require websites with pornographic content to implement robust age-verification systems to prevent access by children. The rules, enforced by the regulator Ofcom, move beyond simple self-declaration checkboxes and suggest methods like credit card checks or photo ID matching. However, concerns remain about user privacy and the potential for circumvention using tools like VPNs, which platforms are now required to discourage. The change impacts an estimated 14 million UK users and introduces significant fines for non-compliant websites.</p>

          <p>San Francisco Giants' Rafael Devers made a surprising admission after his debut at first base, stating he prefers playing a defensive position over being a full-time designated hitter. Devers explained that playing on the field helps keep him active and prevents him from overthinking his at-bats. This contrasts with his time at the Boston Red Sox, where he had been adamant about his desire to exclusively handle DH duties. The comments came after a successful game where he had two hits in the Giants' 9-0 victory over the Atlanta Braves.</p>

          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, beating expectations and successfully avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. The growth was primarily driven by a strong performance in exports, particularly semiconductors, as firms reportedly expedited shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. While government spending also contributed, analysts remain cautious, suggesting the pace of growth is unlikely to be sustained due to softening global trade. The outlook may influence the Bank of Korea's future decisions on interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has finalized new trade agreements with Indonesia and the Philippines, which will see U.S. shipments to those countries face no duties while imports will be subject to a 19% tariff. Analysts suggest these deals are an indirect tactic to contain China's economic influence by reshaping regional supply chains and securing access to resources like rare earth minerals. However, the effectiveness of this strategy may be limited, as Chinese companies have been proactively localizing their production within Southeast Asian nations. This reduces their reliance on the transshipment routes that previous U.S. policies targeted.</p>
