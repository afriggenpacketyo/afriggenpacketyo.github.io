          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams secured a remarkable victory at the DC Open, defeating Peyton Stearns 6-3, 6-4 to become the second-oldest woman to win a tour-level singles match. This win marks her first singles victory in nearly two years, following a long layoff for surgery to remove uterine fibroids. Williams, who had been officially listed as "inactive," showcased glimpses of her classic form with powerful serves and groundstrokes, overcoming a 22-year age gap with her opponent and delighting the supportive crowd.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced a significant trade deal with Japan, establishing "reciprocal" tariffs of 15% on the country's exports to the United States. This agreement notably reduces the U.S. tariff on Japanese auto imports from 25%, a key point of contention that provides relief to Japan's cornerstone auto industry. President Trump also stated that Japan would invest $550 billion in the U.S. and open its markets further to American goods, including agricultural products, a move he claimed would create hundreds of thousands of jobs.

          <p>Shares of major Japanese automakers, including Toyota and Honda, soared after the announcement that the U.S. would lower its tariffs on their vehicles to 15% from 25%. The news provided significant relief to the Japanese auto industry, a critical sector of the nation's economy that had seen exports to the U.S. plunge under the higher tariff rate. The positive market reaction extended to South Korean carmakers like Hyundai and Kia, which also saw their stock prices jump on the improved trade outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered evidence of a prehistoric battle between two apex predators from 13 million years ago. An analysis of teeth marks on the fossilized leg bone of a "terror bird," a large, fearsome avian reptile, suggests it was attacked by a giant caiman, an extinct crocodile-like creature up to five meters long. The fossil, found in Colombia's Tatacoa Desert, provides rare insight into the ancient ecosystem, indicating that even the formidable terror birds were vulnerable to other powerful predators in their environment.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have placed key relief pitcher Tanner Scott on the injured list due to elbow inflammation, though the team remains hopeful he can return this season. Scott exited a recent game with a "stinging sensation" in his forearm, but initial reports suggest the injury may not be season-ending. While Scott has had an inconsistent season, his potential long-term loss would have been a major blow to a bullpen already dealing with multiple injuries, highlighting the team's need to acquire another high-leverage reliever before the trade deadline.</p>
