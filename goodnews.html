          <p>A copy of "Your Child, His Family, and Friends" was returned to the San Antonio Public Library nearly 82 years after it was checked out in 1943. The book was discovered among the possessions of a deceased man by his child, who mailed it back from Oregon with an explanatory letter. The letter writer speculated their grandmother, who had moved to Mexico for a U.S. Embassy job, had borrowed it. Fortunately for the family, the library ceased charging late fees in 2021, avoiding a potential fine estimated at nearly $900.</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, a company backed by Jeff Bezos, is promoting a new electric pickup truck with a focus on affordability and customization. The strategy involves selling a simple, barebones base model and allowing owners to add features and accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. The company's initial sub-$20,000 price point was heavily reliant on federal tax credits that are now being rolled back. This raises questions about whether the truck can remain competitive at a higher price against established models like the Ford Maverick. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Salesforce shares saw a 4% rally as a securities filing revealed that activist hedge fund Starboard Value had significantly increased its stake in the company. This move has fueled market speculation that a new round of investor activism could be imminent, similar to a successful campaign in 2022-2023 that pushed the company to focus on profitability. Analysts suggest the increased pressure could force management to refocus on its core business and margin expansion. The stock had been underperforming recently due to concerns about its growth strategy and the impact of AI on its business model. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A DeKalb County judge has dismissed domestic terrorism charges against Jamie Marsicano, a protester involved in demonstrations against Atlanta's new police training center. The judge ruled that the state violated the defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial by failing to issue an indictment more than two years after the arrest. This decision is seen as a significant victory for opponents of the controversial facility. The defense attorney argued that the state was purposefully delaying the case, a tactic described as making "the process the punishment" for activists.</p>

          <p>The common kitchen spice cloves may offer several health benefits beyond their use in cooking, according to various research studies. Cloves contain eugenol, a compound with antimicrobial properties that can help control oral bacteria and reduce the risk of gum disease. Studies also suggest that clove extract can help lower blood sugar levels after meals. The spice is rich in minerals like calcium and magnesium and acts as a natural antioxidant, though consuming concentrated clove oil or pure eugenol can be harmful and should be avoided.</p>

          <p>Snooker legend Ronnie O'Sullivan made a perfect 147 maximum break in the first frame of his Saudi Arabia Masters semi-final, becoming the oldest player to achieve the feat in competition. This was the 16th maximum of his illustrious career and his first in seven years. The flawless display of skill involved potting all 15 reds with 15 blacks, followed by clearing all the colors. The achievement puts him in line to share a significant bonus prize with another player who also made a 147 break earlier in the tournament.</p>

          <p>The new horror film "Weapons," from director Zach Cregger, is being lauded for its daring narrative that provides definitive answers to its central mystery about a group of children who mysteriously vanish. The film follows a community grappling with the senseless tragedy, eventually revealing a supernatural villain whose defeat provides a moment of cinematic catharsis. However, the article argues that the film's true strength lies in its exploration of the aftermath, reminding viewers that vanquishing evil does not erase the trauma it caused, making it a uniquely "feel-bad, feel-good" experience.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check Finds Trump's Claims of 'Out of Control' Crime in D.C. are Misleading</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of President Trump's justification for federalizing the Washington, D.C. police force finds his claims about crime levels to be misleading. While D.C. did experience a crime spike in 2023, making its homicide rate high compared to states, recent data from the city's police shows a significant decrease in violent crime in 2024 and 2025. The article notes that comparing a city to entire states is an inapt comparison. The downward trend in D.C. crime aligns with a broader national decrease in violent crime reported by the FBI.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Reportedly Considering Taking a Government Stake in Intel</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly exploring the possibility of the U.S. government taking an ownership stake in the struggling semiconductor company Intel, according to a Bloomberg report. This potential intervention, which caused Intel's stock to rise, is being framed by some analysts as a necessary step for national security to ensure domestic chip manufacturing capabilities. The move would aim to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign chipmakers like TSMC and Samsung. Discussions have reportedly included using funds from the CHIPS Act to structure a potential government investment in the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent filings reveal that billionaire investor George Soros dramatically increased his investment in AI chipmaker Nvidia during the second quarter, boosting his holdings by 1,600%. The move, largely executed through options, signals a strong belief in the continued growth of the artificial intelligence sector. Soros's fund also increased its positions in other AI infrastructure companies like Broadcom and fintech firm Fiserv. These investments reflect a broader strategy of focusing on key supply-chain "pressure points" within the technology industry, particularly in semiconductors and networking.
