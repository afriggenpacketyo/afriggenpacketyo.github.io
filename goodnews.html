          <p>Daniel Noboa was sworn in as Ecuador's president for a second term, vowing to combat drug trafficking, corruption, and violent crime. In his inauguration speech, he emphasized reforms and collaboration with the private sector to stimulate job creation and investment, stating that Ecuador stands at the cusp of four years of progress. The ceremony was attended by international delegates, including U.S. Health Secretary Robert Kennedy, with a U.S. intelligence assessment suggesting Noboa's victory would better serve U.S. interests, especially amidst discussions about a potential U.S. military presence in Ecuador. Violence and unemployment remain significant challenges for Noboa, who aims to pass a crime-fighting bill despite opposition criticism.</p>

The Sunday Express warns of political backlash if the winter fuel allowance isn't fully restored to pensioners.

          <p>Arsenal's women's team defied expectations to win the Women's Champions League, completing a remarkable comeback after a rocky start to the season. After finishing third in the Women's Super League and navigating three qualifying rounds, Arsenal became the first team in Champions League history to play 15 games before lifting the trophy. Former manager Jonas Eidevall stepped down after a poor start, and interim manager Slegers was praised for stabilizing the team and leading them to victory. Despite being labeled underdogs, Arsenal overcame first-leg defeats against Real Madrid and Lyon to reach the final, showcasing their resilience and determination.</p>

          <p>Under new government plans in the UK, developers who leave housing sites unfinished for years could have their land handed over to local councils. Housebuilders will need to commit to delivery time frames before receiving planning permission and submit annual progress reports. Repeated failures to meet targets could result in denied future permissions and penalties paid to local planning authorities. The government aims to build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029, and housing charity Shelter welcomed the plans, accusing developers of delaying construction to keep prices high.</p>

The USS F-1 collided with its sister ship during training exercises and was lost until 1972, but a close-up survey was not possible until now.
