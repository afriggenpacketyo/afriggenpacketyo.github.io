          <p>In a "Face the Nation" interview, Rep. Mike Turner advocated for increased U.S. support for Ukraine, including lifting restrictions on long-range weapons and imposing sanctions on Russia to cripple its war economy. He described Ukraine as winning a "modern war" with advanced anti-drone technology and urged the U.S. to align with their innovative tactics. Turner also addressed recent reports about the number of FBI agents present on January 6th, stating that the new information warrants review to determine if it alters the current understanding of the event, while refraining from speculation.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup player Viktor Hovland was forced to withdraw from his Sunday singles match against Harris English of the U.S. due to a persistent neck injury. The Norwegian golfer had also pulled out of the fourballs on Saturday and was unable to recover in time for the final day's play. As a result of the withdrawal, the match was declared a half, with each team receiving half a point. This development brought Europe closer to retaining the Ryder Cup, needing only two more points to secure the victory.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to attend a meeting with generals and admirals from around the world at Quantico, a gathering called by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The meeting is considered unusual due to its large scale and the short notice given to the senior military leaders who were summoned. While the White House has not commented, President Trump expressed his approval of the meeting to reporters. The purpose and agenda of this rare assembly of top military brass have not been publicly detailed.</p>

          <p>In a close referendum, Swiss citizens have narrowly approved a government proposal to introduce a voluntary electronic identity card system, with 50.4% voting in favor. This revised plan addresses privacy concerns from a previously rejected 2021 proposal by ensuring data is stored only on users' smartphones and managed by the state, not private companies. The digital ID will be optional, allowing citizens to continue using traditional identity cards. Supporters believe it will streamline online bureaucratic processes, while opponents remain concerned about potential privacy risks.</p>

          <p>With a government funding deadline looming, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries stated he is "hopeful" that a shutdown can be avoided. President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with bipartisan congressional leaders to negotiate a spending agreement. A key point of contention is the extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits, which Democrats are pushing to include in any deal. Republicans, like House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, have advocated for a short-term funding bill to allow more time for negotiations, expressing confidence that an agreement can be reached.</p>

          <p>Residents of Zurich, Switzerland, have voted in favor of significantly restricting the use of leaf blowers and vacuums to combat noise and dust pollution. The new rules, supported by over 61% of voters, will completely ban gas-powered models within the city. Electric devices will only be permitted for use during a three-month period from October to December, with special exceptions requiring a permit. Proponents argued the measure protects public health and microorganisms, while opponents criticized it as an unnecessary and restrictive prohibition.</p>

          <p>The stock market's direction in the upcoming week will be heavily influenced by a series of key jobs data releases, which will shape expectations for future Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Investors will be closely watching reports like the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) and the monthly nonfarm payrolls report for signs of labor market weakness. Additionally, the performance of the Treasury market remains a critical factor, as rising long-term bond yields have recently created headwinds for stocks, influencing sectors sensitive to interest rates.

          <p>China is revolutionizing its space industry by implementing a "pull" production system designed to mass-produce rockets and satellites with the efficiency and consistency of car manufacturing. This new model contrasts with the traditional "push" system by having final assembly pull components from suppliers only as needed, reducing delays and waste. As global space activity is projected to grow exponentially, Chinese researchers believe that mastering this scalable production method will be key to dominating the future of the space industry. The goal is to lower costs and improve quality.</p>

          <p>As national chain stores close, rising vacancy rates in shopping centers are creating rare opportunities for small and local businesses to secure prime real estate. With demand softening, landlords are becoming more willing to negotiate flexible lease terms and lower rents with independent retailers, wellness practitioners, and service-based businesses. While overall rental rates are still rising, the pace has slowed, allowing smaller enterprises to move into spaces they were previously priced out of. This trend is helping to fill empty storefronts and allows local businesses to benefit from established high-traffic locations.</p>

          <p>For neurodivergent individuals who may struggle with executive dysfunction, a leading money coach advises that automating finances is the most effective first step toward financial stability. Challenges like impulsivity, decision fatigue, and time blindness can make traditional budgeting difficult. By setting up automatic bill payments, savings transfers, and investment contributions to align with paydays, individuals can reduce the mental energy required for money management. This strategy helps prioritize financial goals and creates more freedom for spending without the stress of potentially missing important payments.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has pledged to start building three new towns in England before the next general election as part of its plan to construct 1.5 million new homes by 2029. Housing Secretary Steve Reed announced that a taskforce has identified Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as the most promising initial sites. The plan emulates the post-war Labour government's new town developments and aims to create entire communities. The government has also accepted a recommendation that at least 40% of the new homes be classified as affordable housing.</p>
