          <p>Equinor will recommence construction on its New York offshore wind farm after the Trump administration rescinded its order to halt the project, following what appears to be a compromise regarding a gas pipeline with the state. The Empire Wind 1 project is set to be the first offshore wind farm to directly supply electricity to New York City. Governor Hochul stated that the decision came after discussions with Equinor and White House officials, emphasizing the project's support for 1,500 union jobs. Equinor aims to continue installation activities this year, with commercial operations expected to begin in 2027. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is contemplating measures to support its industrial sector by lowering electricity prices, however, the plan has raised concerns about potentially undermining market stability and climate objectives. The proposed measures include reducing the electricity tax, cutting surcharges, and expanding the electricity price compensation program for energy-intensive industries. While some experts view the relief positively, others worry that it could reduce incentives for energy efficiency and contradict the needs of a renewable energy system. The article further explores potential issues with EU state aid rules and the effectiveness of broad-based relief versus targeted subsidies. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Depot's CFO, Richard McPhail, stated that the retailer does not intend to raise prices due to tariffs, citing its scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity improvements. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's plan to increase prices to offset tariff costs. McPhail noted that over half of Home Depot's sales are domestic and that the company has diversified its import sources. Home Depot maintained its full-year sales forecast despite missing first-quarter earnings expectations, and shares rose in premarket trading following the announcement. The company's pricing strategy aims to maintain customer engagement amidst a challenging economic backdrop. </p>

The author suggests that the US should change the narrative about the opioid crisis if it wants China‚Äôs full support. The US has made it clear it will continue to aim for ‚Äúdecoupling‚Äù from China on ‚Äústrategic necessities‚Äù, therefore reversing tariffs to the level they were before so-called Liberation Day is not realistic, even though Beijing has repeatedly called on Washington to do so. </p>
