The mining company LKAB is funding the complex and emotional move, which aims to preserve the community's spiritual and historical centerpiece.</p>

The plan, which aligns with the administration's strategy of creating government-backed national champions, comes as Intel seeks to regain its market dominance and has also secured a separate $2 billion investment from SoftBank.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and a delegation of European leaders met with U.S. President Donald Trump in a concerted effort to align on a strategy for ending the war with Russia. The talks aimed to secure U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine and push for a ceasefire as a precondition for peace negotiations, a point of contention with Trump. While the atmosphere was reportedly constructive, significant challenges remain as the parties work to present a united front ahead of potential direct talks with Vladimir Putin.</p>

Both sides acknowledged a "positive trend" and discussed normalizing ties through trade, pilgrimages, and ongoing boundary negotiations, laying the groundwork for a potential visit by Prime Minister Modi to China.</p>

          <p>The US Open has revamped its mixed doubles tournament, attracting top singles stars like Carlos Alcaraz, Emma Raducanu, and Novak Djokovic with a $1 million prize and a shorter format. The move is intended to generate more fan interest and media attention but has drawn criticism from doubles specialists. Critics, including Jamie Murray, argue that it devalues the Grand Slam title by turning it into a "glorified exhibition" and diverts significant prize money away from career doubles players.</p>

          <p>Researchers have utilized Artificial Intelligence to generate facial reconstructions of Welsh convicts who were deported to Australia in the 19th century. By analyzing detailed prisoner records, historical sketches, and in some cases, photos of modern descendants, a team of volunteers traced the lives of 60 individuals from Anglesey. Many were transported for minor crimes like theft, and their stories shed light on the harsh justice system of the era and the foundational history of modern Australia.</p>
