This decision follows a nine-month investigation concluding that the tech giant holds "substantial and entrenched market power" in the U.K. While not a finding of wrongdoing, the designation means Google may be required to implement changes to ensure fairer search rankings and give publishers more control over their content. Google expressed concern that potential interventions could inhibit innovation in the U.K.</p>

          <p>The Israeli cabinet has approved a ceasefire agreement aimed at ending the two-year war with Hamas, prompting an initial pullback of troops from parts of Gaza. The deal includes the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas in exchange for approximately 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees. As Israeli forces began retreating to a buffer zone, Palestinian residents gathered, hoping to return to their homes amidst the devastation. The United States has committed about 200 troops to a multi-national effort to monitor the ceasefire, though they will not enter Gaza.</p>

          <p>Basketball Hall of Famer Charles Barkley has issued a warning to WNBA players as they head into contentious collective bargaining agreement (CBA) negotiations with the league. Citing his own experience with NBA labor disputes, Barkley cautioned players not to "overplay their hand" against billionaire owners, suggesting they could risk a lockout. His comments come as players, led by stars like Napheesa Collier, have increased pressure on WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert over issues of accountability and leadership. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has expressed optimism that a new deal will eventually be reached.</p>

          <p>The European Commission is formally requesting information from four major U.S. tech platforms—Apple, Google's YouTube, and Snapchat—regarding their child protection practices. Officials expressed concern that current measures are insufficient to ensure the high levels of privacy and safety required for minors under the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA). The investigation will examine issues such as easily circumvented age restrictions on YouTube, potential access to gambling apps on app stores, and Snapchat's enforcement of its age limit. Failure to comply with the DSA could result in significant fines for the companies.</p>

          <h2>Premiership Women's Rugby Chair Criticizes Proposed Breakaway Competition</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Genevieve Shore, the executive chair of Premiership Women's Rugby (PWR), has voiced concerns over R360, a proposed big-money breakaway series for women's rugby. Shore described the four-team R360 event as a "short-term showpiece" rather than a sustainable league, warning it may not adequately prepare players for international competition. Her comments follow a joint statement from eight top rugby nations, including England, barring players who join R360 from national selection. While acknowledging the appeal of higher pay, Shore contrasted R360's profit-driven model with PWR's investment in developing the sport from grassroots levels.</p>

          <p>Alex Kingston, the 62-year-old actress known for her roles in "ER" and "Doctor Who," has revealed she was diagnosed with womb cancer in 2024. She underwent a hysterectomy and radiation therapy, completing her treatment late last year before joining the cast of "Strictly Come Dancing." Kingston explained that she had initially dismissed symptoms like bloating and aches as signs of aging and urged other women not to ignore potential health warnings. She credits the health scare with inspiring her to embrace new opportunities like the dancing competition, stating that "life is too short."</p>

          <p>The puzzling discovery of a 1,900-year-old Roman grave marker in a New Orleans backyard has been solved. Erin Scott O’Brien revealed that the artifact belonged to her grandfather, a U.S. soldier who served in Italy during World War II and brought it home as a souvenir. O'Brien had inherited the marble tablet, unaware of its historical significance, and used it as a garden decoration before selling the house and forgetting it. The new homeowners, an anthropologist and her husband, identified the Latin inscription, leading to its recognition as a missing artifact from an Italian museum, to which it will now be repatriated.</p>

The author contends that the current Democratic leadership is too timid and that an early, bold campaign could capture public attention and frame the political debate for the next several years. Citing the success of Zohran Mamdani's mayoral primary win in New York, the piece calls for a candidate who can communicate bold ideas and connect with voters on key issues.

          <p>Phill Wilson, a pioneering AIDS activist who founded the Black AIDS Institute in Los Angeles, is reflecting on 40 years of public health advocacy as current political shifts threaten progress. After being diagnosed as HIV-positive in 1987 and given six months to live, Wilson dedicated his life to fighting the epidemic, particularly its disproportionate impact on Black Americans. Now 69, he expresses concern that recent Republican-led cuts to federal HIV/AIDS funding could reverse decades of life-saving work and dismantle crucial health systems. His story highlights the ongoing struggle for public health and the importance of resilience.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the enduring power of composer Leonard Bernstein's music to serve as a form of civic memorial, particularly his works honoring President John F. Kennedy. It highlights how Bernstein's "Kaddish" symphony and his choice of Mahler's "Resurrection" symphony after JFK's assassination helped a nation heal and process collective grief. As contemporary events and productions bring Bernstein's work back into focus, the article suggests his approach offers a model for using art to unite a divisive society.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores Washington Irving's "Rip Van Winkle" as a seminal piece of American literature that grapples with the creation of a new national identity after the Revolution. The story of a man who sleeps through the country's founding is presented not just as a comic tale but as a meditation on memory, change, and cultural continuity. By creating a character who becomes a living link to the pre-revolutionary past, Irving addressed the challenge of forging a common culture in a restless, forward-looking nation. The essay argues that the story itself became a shared myth that helped solve the very problem it identified.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay examines how Abraham Lincoln strategically invoked the spirit and ideals of the American Revolution to address the nation's failure to abolish slavery. Lincoln framed the Founders' vision not as a finished work but as an "unfinished project" whose promise of equality was meant to be "constantly approximated" over time. By casting the Civil War as a second founding necessary to fulfill the original's noblest values, he rescued the Revolution from being defined by its hypocrisy. The article suggests Lincoln's dynamic relationship with the past offers a valuable model for confronting historical contradictions today without dismissing founding ideals.</p>

The article notes that while popular history often focuses on powerful men, this biography successfully reorients the narrative to show how these women shaped and were shaped by the era's events. It particularly praises the focus on Eliza Schuyler Hamilton's long widowhood, during which she became a pioneering philanthropist and the primary architect of her husband's historical legacy.

The ruling emphasized that a reasonable listener would understand the accusations within the context of a "heated rap battle" known for its "hyperbolic vituperations."
