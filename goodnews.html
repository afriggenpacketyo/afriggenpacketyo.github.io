          <h2>Browns Quarterback Shedeur Sanders Expresses Frustration Over Preseason Benching</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders confirmed his visible frustration after being benched by head coach Kevin Stefanski before a game-winning drive in a preseason victory against the Rams. Despite a challenging performance with five sacks, Sanders, who took over in the second half, expressed his strong desire to lead the final two-minute drive, seeing it as an opportunity to be an "alpha." Stefanski defended his decision, citing the plan to use Tyler Huntley, who was later cut from the roster, and downplayed any suggestions of sabotaging Sanders' development. The article notes Joe Flacco has been named the Week 1 starter, with the backup quarterback situation still uncertain as the team finalizes its 53-man roster.</p>

          <h2>Debate Emerges: If Tackle Football is Unsafe for Girls, Why is it Acceptable for Boys?</h2>

          <p>As girls increasingly flock to flag football, a debate is emerging regarding the safety of tackle football for boys, questioning why a sport deemed too dangerous for girls is celebrated for boys. This article highlights the historical gendered adaptations in sports, such as softball for girls and limited-contact lacrosse, which often reflect outdated views of female physical limitations. Critics argue that while feminist progress has advanced women's sports, society has not adequately addressed the health dangers of narrow masculinity for boys, including the high risk of degenerative brain diseases like CTE. The piece suggests it is time to re-evaluate why boys play tackle football, advocating for a shift towards safer alternatives like flag football for all youth.</p>

          <h2>The Unanswered Questions Surrounding GLP-1 Drugs Like Ozempic and Their Long-Term Impact on Desire</h2>

          <p>GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic, initially for diabetes, are now widely used for weight loss and show promise for various conditions, from cardiovascular disease to addiction. With more than one in 10 Americans already using them and cheaper versions on the horizon, this article explores the potential societal shift into an "Ozempic era." The core unanswered question revolves around the drugs' mysterious ability to control compulsions and how modulating desire might impact fundamental human emotions, joy, and the broader human experience over decades. Experts remain cautiously optimistic about their benefits but stress the need for more long-term research into their psychological effects.</p>

Xi noted the steady development of China-Ukraine relations over 33 years, highlighting remarkable cooperation in various fields, and expressed readiness to work with Zelensky to guide bilateral ties towards stable and long-term development for mutual benefit and the peoples of both countries. This diplomatic gesture comes amidst international scrutiny over China's increasing closeness with Russia since the invasion, though Beijing insists it is neutral in the conflict. Zelensky appreciated the congratulations, emphasizing both sides' interest in developing a respectful, long-term dialogue for peace, stability, and prosperity.</p>

          <h2>Research Suggests Fish May Experience Pleasure from Being Groomed by Other Species</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B suggests that fish, specifically butterflyfish, may experience pleasure from being groomed by bluestreak cleaner wrasse, actively seeking out these interactions. Neuroscientists Caio Maximino and Marta Soares found that butterflyfish preferred areas where they had been cleaned, and their interest was modulated by opioid-mimicking and blocking drugs, indicating pleasure mediated by natural opioids. The study also differentiated between "liking" and "wanting" the cleaning, suggesting dopamine's role in motivation. This article challenges the common perception of fish as simple-minded, proposing they possess rich emotional-like states and a capacity for positive feelings, which could influence how they are treated in aquariums and aquaculture.</p>

          <p>The fashion industry is confronting the rise of AI models and digital clones, prompting models like Hannah James to consider digitally replicating themselves while fearing job displacement. Brands such as Guess and H&M have already featured AI models, sparking backlash over job security and unrealistic beauty standards. This article highlights how generative AI tools can create digital replicas that don't face human limitations, offering cost-cutting potential for brands but raising ethical questions about consent and fair compensation for human models. Advocacy groups like the Model Alliance are pushing for clearer standards as the industry navigates this technological shift, with some firms aiming for human and AI models to coexist.</p>

          <p>China is increasing e-commerce delivery fees, with minimum rates rising by 0.4 yuan in Guangdong province, to combat "disorderly low-price competition" and stave off harmful price spirals. This move, primarily affecting e-commerce clients rather than individual consumers, aligns with a directive from President Xi Jinping's Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission to lawfully regulate such competition. The initiative aims to guide companies towards improving product quality and promoting the orderly exit of outdated capacity, indicating a broader economic strategy.

In an interview, Merkel acknowledged the significant challenges of integration and that her "Wir schaffen das" (We can do this) statement was often criticized, but she stands by her morally necessary decision. She emphasized that using force to prevent entry was never an option and conceded that the policy contributed to the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.

          <p>This article explores the potential resurgence of left-handed players at the US Open, highlighting Ben Shelton and Jack Draper as key contenders who could challenge the dominance of top-ranked right-handers. Historically, lefties enjoyed a significant advantage in tennis, particularly at the US Open from 1974-1984, but their presence in Grand Slam finals has dwindled since. The piece delves into the inherent advantages left-handers possess, such as unique ball trajectories and spins that confound right-handed opponents. With both Shelton and Draper enjoying career-best years and armed with powerful serves and all-around games, the article suggests a "lefty renaissance" could be underway, adding new dynamics to the sport.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans' public school system has transformed into an almost entirely charter-based model, with significant improvements in test scores, graduation rates, and college attendance. This article highlights the journey from a struggling pre-Katrina district, plagued by mismanagement, to a system where individual schools have more autonomy. While researchers credit the charter model and the willingness to close underperforming schools for these gains, opinions remain mixed among parents, and challenges persist regarding equitable access and the limits of school closure as a strategy. The system is described as a continuous "work in progress," now exploring the idea of the district directly running some schools again.</p>

          <p>This article fact-checks the popular fitness trend of weighted vests, which social media influencers claim offer extensive benefits for posture, weight loss, cardiovascular health, and bone/muscle growth. While experts acknowledge some cardiovascular benefits and increased calorie burn, the research does not strongly support claims for significant bone density or muscle strength improvements. Exercise science researchers emphasize that traditional resistance training with weights is far more effective for muscle growth. The article advises caution against over-relying on weighted vests for bone and muscle health, especially for women in menopause, and suggests prioritizing proven weight-bearing exercises, though it notes their use can motivate physical activity.</p>

The Monetary Authority of Singapore attributed this to falling retail and other goods prices, alongside lower electricity and gas costs. This article highlights the central bank's forecast for moderate inflation in the near term, influenced by easing global crude oil prices and contained food commodity hikes.
