          <p>A four-minute audio clip from President Biden's 2023 interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur has been released, revealing Biden's struggles to recall key dates. The clip features Biden stumbling over the years his son died and when Trump was first elected. Republicans had long sought the release of the audio, alleging it might demonstrate a decline in Biden‚Äôs mental acuity. The Trump administration plans to release the full interview recording, despite the Biden administration blocking it, citing executive privilege.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm warning was issued for the Chicago area Friday night, marking only the second time in history that the National Weather Service's Chicago office has issued such a warning. The storm, caused by 60 to 70 mph winds over dry farmlands, significantly reduced visibility, especially on major interstates. The storms also prompted ground stops at O'Hare and Midway airports. Some areas experienced "mud rain" due to the combination of dust and scattered showers.</p>
