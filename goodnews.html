        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Prime Minister has announced a major 10-year plan to reform England's NHS by shifting many services out of hospitals and into local communities. The strategy involves creating approximately 200 new neighborhood health centers staffed by a mix of GPs, nurses, pharmacists, and mental health specialists, intended to be open 12 hours a day, six days a week. This move aims to make care more convenient, reduce hospital waiting lists, and better suit patient needs, with the goal of moving the majority of outpatient care to these hubs by 2035. However, nursing and medical unions have raised significant concerns about the plan's feasibility without a concrete strategy for funding and staffing the new services.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book, "Apple in China," has sparked a debate among analysts regarding the tech giant's extensive operational reliance on China. The book argues that Apple made a significant error by consolidating its production and supply chain so heavily within a single, authoritarian state. However, some experts, like Harvard Business School professor Meg Rithmire, contend that Apple likely had no better alternative. They suggest that tapping into China's immense wave of innovation and production was essential for Apple to become the global powerhouse it is today, and avoiding it would have meant missing out on a critical phase of industrial development.</p>

          <p>The historic Griffith Park Pool, a Los Angeles landmark built in 1927, will not reopen after being closed since 2020 due to a severely cracked foundation that was deemed irreparable. The city has announced a $28-million plan to demolish the old structure and replace it with two new, smaller pools and a splash pad, along with a renovated pool house. The project, which is fully funded, aims to provide a modern, year-round aquatic facility for local communities that have long relied on the public pool for summer recreation. Construction is tentatively scheduled to begin in the summer of 2026, with completion expected by early 2028.</p>

          <p>The B-2 bomber pilots who conducted a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities are expected to keep a low profile during a planned July Fourth visit to the White House. President Trump, who invited the pilots and their crews to be celebrated as heroes, has been told their identities will not be disclosed for security reasons. The Air Force emphasized the need to protect personnel involved in sensitive missions from adversaries who exploit open-source information. The visit follows controversy over the strike's effectiveness, with an initial intelligence assessment suggesting a setback of only "months" for Iran's program, a report that angered the President.</p>

The artwork was inspired by an Instagram post in which Hern√°ndez, a native of Puerto Rico, expressed his dismay over recent immigration sweeps in Los Angeles, a city he considers his second home. In his post, he stated that all people deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. The mural, located on Lankershim Blvd., features Hern√°ndez's image alongside the words "Born X Raised" and "Los Angeles," paying homage to his stance on what the artist calls "standing up for what is right."</p>

          <p>India's new cricket captain, Shubman Gill, delivered a remarkably composed performance, scoring an unbeaten 114 against England in the second Test at Edgbaston. His innings was statistically the most controlled Test century recorded in England since data collection began in 2006, with a false shot percentage of just 3.5%. This level of precision surpasses that of modern greats like Joe Root, Steve Smith, and Rahul Dravid during their centuries in England. Gill's secure batting anchored his team, helping India reach a respectable score of 310-5 on the first day and defying England's early advantage after they won the toss.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has blocked the Trump administration's policy that suspended the right to seek asylum at the southern border, ruling that the president exceeded his legal authority. Judge Randolph Moss stated that declaring an "invasion" to unilaterally ban asylum is not permitted under the Constitution or existing immigration law. The ruling came in a class-action lawsuit filed by asylum seekers and immigrant rights groups. The judge has stayed his decision for 14 days to allow the administration to appeal, but if it holds, it would require officials to resume processing asylum claims for migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>

          <p>Amazon has announced it will be shutting down its free, ad-supported streaming service, Freevee, in August. The company plans to consolidate its content by moving all Freevee shows, movies, and live TV channels exclusively to its main Prime Video platform. This change aims to create a simpler viewing experience for customers. After the Freevee app is discontinued, users will still be able to watch the formerly free content on Prime Video without needing a paid Prime subscription. The move follows Amazon's introduction of an ad-supported tier to its primary Prime Video service earlier this year.</p>

          <p>At the premiere of the new 'Superman' film, which kicks off a rebooted DC Universe, the cast shared their thoughts on what the iconic hero would make of the modern world. David Corenswet, the new Man of Steel, suggested Superman would wish for more kindness and inspire people to take on more responsibility. Co-star Rachel Brosnahan, who plays Lois Lane, believes he would step in to help wherever needed. The film, directed by James Gunn, presents a more optimistic version of the character and is seen as a critical test for the superhero genre, which has faced mixed results and audience fatigue in recent years.</p>
