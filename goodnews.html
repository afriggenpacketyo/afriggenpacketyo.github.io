          <p>Five people survived for 36 hours in an alligator-infested swamp in the Amazon region of Bolivia after their plane made an emergency landing due to engine failure. The pilot managed to land the plane near the Itanomas River, and the survivors stood on top of the plane surrounded by alligators. They were eventually rescued by local fishermen and transported to a hospital. The pilot believes that petrol leaking from the plane kept the predators at bay while awaiting rescue, they subsisted on cassava flour brought by one of the passengers.</p>

          <h2>Man Bitten Over 200 Times by Snakes Develops 'Unparalleled' Antivenom</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 02:29:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from the blood of Tim Friede, a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. The antibodies in Friede's blood have shown to protect against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snake species in animal tests. The current antivenom therapies have to match the specific species of venomous snake anyone has been bitten by. Friede's 18-year mission could be a significant step in finding a universal antivenom against all snakebites - which kill up to 140,000 people a year and leave three times as many needing amputations or facing permanent disability.</p>

          <h2>Hong Kong Monetary Authority Intervenes to Manage Local Dollar Amid Capital Inflow</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 01:09:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to weaken the local currency, which had appreciated due to capital inflows ahead of a potential US interest rate cut. The HKMA bought US dollars and sold Hong Kong dollars in its first market intervention in two years. This action aims to maintain the local currency within its trading band and manage the impact of increased demand for the Hong Kong dollar related to equity investment activities. Further interventions are expected if the US cuts interest rates, potentially driving more capital into Hong Kong.</p>
