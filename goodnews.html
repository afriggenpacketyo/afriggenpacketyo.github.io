        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York appellate court has thrown out the nearly $500 million penalty imposed on Donald Trump in his civil fraud trial, deeming the amount excessive and potentially unconstitutional. While the ruling nullifies the massive fine, it importantly upholds the original verdict that found Trump and his organization liable for fraudulently inflating property values to secure better loan terms. The decision is seen as a partial victory for both sides; Trump's team celebrated the financial relief, while the New York Attorney General's office highlighted that the finding of fraud remains intact and plans to appeal the penalty decision to the state's highest court.</p>

          <p>An active shooter alert that prompted a large-scale police response and a campus-wide lockdown at Villanova University has been declared a "cruel hoax" by the school's president. The report of a shooter at the university's law school triggered a significant mobilization of local and federal law enforcement, who conducted thorough sweeps of the campus buildings. Mercifully, authorities confirmed that there were no injuries, no victims, and no evidence of any firearms on the premises. The incident caused significant fear and disruption within the community before it was resolved.</p>

          <p>As part of his administration's anti-crime initiative in Washington D.C., President Trump visited a U.S. Park Police facility to thank federal agents and National Guard members. During the visit, he handed out hamburgers prepared at the White House and pizza from a local restaurant. This event occurred amid a significant surge of federal law enforcement in the capital, a move that includes the administration asserting federal control over the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department. The initiative has drawn criticism from local officials who argue it is an unnecessary overreach.</p>

          <p>In an effort to stabilize its economy, China is amending a 1998 law to combat what is known as "involution," or destructive, cutthroat price wars that have plagued various industries. Sectors such as solar panel manufacturing have been suffering from severe overcapacity, forcing companies to sell products at a loss just to maintain market share. The proposed legal revisions, drafted by the country's top economic planning and market regulation agencies, aim to rein in this aggressive undercutting and foster a more sustainable and less chaotic competitive environment.

The celebratory atmosphere, however, was tinged with sadness as the match was overshadowed by the imminent departure of star midfielder Eberechi Eze to rival club Arsenal. Manager Oliver Glasner confirmed after the game that Eze would not play for the team again. The evening encapsulated a bittersweet moment for fans, who cheered the milestone victory while simultaneously preparing to bid farewell to a key player.</p>

          <p>In a rare gesture of fan appreciation, the Colorado Rapids MLS team is allowing supporters to exchange their jerseys of recently traded star Djordje Mihailović for a new one. Mihailović's request for a trade to Toronto FC came as a surprise to many, and the club initiated the swap program to coincide with the announcement of his replacement, Paxten Aaronson. The move is being seen as a positive step to maintain goodwill with the fanbase and signify a fresh start for the team as it moves on from a key player.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is enabling wealthy investors to defer paying capital gains taxes on highly appreciated assets. The method involves exchanging a diversified portfolio of stocks for shares in a newly created exchange-traded fund (ETF), a transaction that is not immediately taxable. This allows investors to postpone the tax liability that would normally be triggered by selling their profitable assets. While the use of this strategy is growing, it typically requires a high minimum investment, making it accessible mainly to high-net-worth individuals. (not investment advice)</p>

This comment comes after her role in the critically acclaimed but more modestly profitable film "Civil War."

          <p>Recent market trends have challenged the conventional wisdom that potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts are always beneficial for high-growth technology stocks. An analysis of this week's trading shows that as speculation about multiple rate cuts increased, investors sold off momentum stocks and rotated into more cyclical, value-oriented companies. These more traditional businesses are seen as having more to gain in immediate earnings from lower borrowing costs. The article suggests that Wall Street's focus has shifted from long-term valuation models to the potential for near-term upward earnings revisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Newly obtained public records reveal that during the Trump administration's heightened immigration raids in Los Angeles, the U.S. military created a list of "LA Hotels to Avoid." This was done to prevent federal ICE and CBP agents from being "harassed" by protesters. Community activists had organized demonstrations, including late-night noise rallies, outside hotels where agents were reportedly staying. The documents, acquired by a government transparency nonprofit, indicate that these grassroots protests were effective in disrupting the operational logistics of the federal immigration enforcement actions in the city.</p>
