          <p>Fantasy sports operator Underdog is partnering with Crypto.com to offer sports prediction markets, a hybrid of financial trading and sports betting, in 16 states. This venture allows traders to buy and sell contracts on the outcomes of sporting events, with odds fluctuating based on market movements rather than a bookmaker. The partnership aims to tap into large markets like California and Texas where traditional sports betting is not yet legal, positioning itself in a rapidly growing industry that bypasses some state-level gaming regulations.</p>

          <p>AC Milan midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek has been recalled to the England national team for the first time in seven years for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers. The 29-year-old, who has 10 previous caps, is joined by Bayer Leverkusen centre-back Jarell Quansah, who was called up following an injury to another player. Quansah, 22, was part of the European Under-21 Championship-winning side and is seeking his first senior cap. The selections reflect both a reward for recent club form and a need to cover for injuries in the squad.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has ruled that the Trump administration violated the Posse Comitatus Act by deploying National Guard members and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles for domestic law enforcement. The 1878 law prohibits the use of the military for such purposes, and the judge found the administration's actions in response to immigration enforcement protests were illegal. The ruling blocks the administration from using military troops for civilian law enforcement activities like arrests and crowd control within California, though the injunction is temporarily stayed to allow for an appeal.</p>

          <p>Zack Polanski has been elected as the new leader of the Green Party in the UK, defeating two of the party's sitting MPs with a platform of bold communication and "eco-populism." With a background as an actor and therapist, Polanski aims to connect with voters on an emotional level and has stated his intention to "take the fight to Labour" from the left. His leadership signals a potential shift for the party towards a more confrontational style and a focus on linking the climate crisis with social inequality.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is bringing back its "Extra Value Meals" in an effort to win back customers who have cut back on spending due to persistent inflation. The fast-food giant will offer limited-time deals, including a $5 sausage and egg McMuffin meal and an $8 Big Mac meal, starting September 8. This move comes after the company's CEO acknowledged a significant drop in traffic among low-income consumers, who are facing increased financial pressure. The focus on value aims to boost sales and appeal to a more price-sensitive customer base.</p>

          <h2>Banking Experts Offer Four Strategies for Certificate of Deposit Savers in September</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 10:19:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, financial experts advise savers to consider strategic moves for their Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts this month. Key recommendations include locking in current high rates before they drop, considering no-penalty CDs for greater flexibility, and using a CD laddering strategy to balance access to funds with strong returns. Experts emphasize that while today's CD rates are still historically high, they are likely to decline by the end of the year, making timely action important for maximizing earnings.

          <h2>Financial Experts Highlight Opportunity for 0% Capital Gains Tax Under New Legislation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 10:13:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 0% tax rate on long-term capital gains is available to investors whose taxable income falls below certain thresholds, which for 2025 are $48,350 for single filers and $96,700 for married couples filing jointly. Financial experts note that new tax deductions introduced in President Trump's recent legislation could allow more people to qualify for this bracket. This creates a strategic window for "tax-gain harvesting," where investors can sell profitable assets without incurring taxes, potentially to rebalance portfolios or reset their cost basis for future tax savings.

          <p>In a landmark U.S. legal case, an identical twin has been convicted of a 1987 sexual assault based on cutting-edge DNA analysis. Scientists at Parabon Nanolabs were able to differentiate between the twin brothers by identifying rare, minute genetic mutations that occur after an embryo splits. This technique, which had not previously been successfully applied in a U.S. court, overcame the typical challenge of identical twins having nearly the same DNA, allowing investigators to definitively link Russell Marubbio to the decades-old crime scene evidence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage rates hovering near 7%, prospective homebuyers face a difficult decision on whether to lock in a rate now or wait for potential declines. Lending experts suggest that if a current rate fits one's budget, locking it in provides certainty and protection against market swings, especially for those already under contract for a home. However, for those with more flexibility, waiting could be advantageous as markets are anticipating a Federal Reserve rate cut this fall which may provide some relief, though this outcome is not guaranteed.
