          <p>A new report reveals that the average value of an NFL franchise has surged by 18% to $7.65 billion in 2025, solidifying the league's status as the world's most valuable. The Dallas Cowboys lead the pack with a valuation of $12.5 billion, followed by the Los Angeles Rams at $10.7 billion, driven by massive revenue streams and lucrative media deals. This financial growth is further supported by new league-level agreements, such as a stake in ESPN, and a rule change allowing private equity investment, which has significantly increased team sale prices. The article highlights the league's robust financial health, underpinned by its immense popularity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's financial sector saw a record-breaking year in sales of non-listed investment products, driven by a strong stock market rally that boosted investor confidence. Capital flowed into mutual funds, bonds, and other equity-linked products, with the number of active customers increasing by 28% compared to the previous year. An official from the city's Securities and Futures Commission attributed the significant surge in product sales to the dedication of financial firms and the strong trust investors have placed in Hong Kong's markets. This boom underscores the city's continued growth as a major international financial hub. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The world's most popular illegal live sports streaming site, Streameast, has been shut down following a joint operation between the anti-piracy group Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE) and Egyptian police. The network, which attracted over 1.6 billion visits in the past year, provided pirated access to major sporting events like Premier League matches and Formula One races. Two men were arrested in Egypt, where authorities seized equipment and uncovered a shell company allegedly used for laundering millions in advertising revenue. While broadcasters have praised the takedown, analysts note that the high cost of legal sports subscriptions continues to fuel piracy.</p>

          <p>Creatine supplements, long favored by bodybuilders, are gaining widespread popularity for benefits beyond muscle growth, including improved cognition and blood sugar regulation. Research confirms that creatine, a compound your body produces naturally, can help build lean muscle and enhance athletic performance when combined with exercise. While the evidence for cognitive and other health benefits is still emerging, scientists say it is a low-risk supplement for most healthy adults. Experts recommend using products containing only creatine monohydrate and looking for third-party certification to ensure product safety and purity.</p>

          <p>A young bald eagle, believed to be one of the famed Big Bear eagles Jackie and Shadow's offspring, recently made an unusual return to its childhood nest. The juvenile, identified as "Gizmo" by observers due to distinct features like a gap in its wing feathers and a unique "Mona Lisa smile," was spotted on a 24-hour webcam. While eaglets often return shortly after their first flight, it is rare for one to come back months later, making the visit a heartwarming event for the thousands of fans who follow the eagle family online. The visit provides a peaceful postscript to a nesting season that included both loss and survival.</p>

          <p>A new hotel named Reset has opened near Joshua Tree National Park, offering a unique, minimalist experience with 65 free-standing, modular rooms designed to evoke a futuristic colony on Mars. The project, led by architectural designer Ben Uyeda, was built with a focus on speed and efficiency in a remote location, with many of the hotel's furnishings being hand-built by Uyeda's team. The design emphasizes a connection to the stark desert landscape, encouraging guests to focus on the sky and stars.

          <p>In her new memoir, "All the Way to the River," author Elizabeth Gilbert explores her journey of recovering from what she identifies as an addiction to sex and love. The "Eat, Pray, Love" author realized she had a problem following the death of her partner, Rayya Elias, recognizing a lifelong pattern of using relationships for stimulation and sedation. In an interview, Gilbert discusses how recovery has taught her to build a healthy relationship with herself, finding contentment in solitude rather than constantly seeking an external partner. She now feels her purpose is to be of service to the world, which requires being emotionally whole herself.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to federal immigration enforcement actions, California lawmakers are advancing legislation to create stronger protections for immigrants at sensitive locations like schools and hospitals. The bills would require schools to notify families of any immigration operations on campus and would bar federal agents from nonpublic areas without a judicial warrant. A similar bill would prevent healthcare facilities from disclosing a patient's immigration status and restrict agent access. These measures, largely supported by Democrats, aim to ensure that schools and hospitals remain safe spaces where all residents can access services without fear of deportation.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition at Hauser & Wirth places the work of renowned L.A. artist Henry Taylor alongside that of his mentor, the late California Modernist James Jarvaise. Taylor credits Jarvaise, his professor at Oxnard College in the 1980s, with being the first person to truly see him as an artist and for teaching him to be fearless in his work. The show's title, "Sometimes a straight line has to be crooked," is a Jarvaise quote that has deeply influenced Taylor's spontaneous and emotive style. For Taylor, the exhibition is an honor, akin to a rookie athlete getting to play alongside a veteran all-star.</p>

          <p>Despite widespread panic about students using AI to cheat, new research suggests that the overall rates of academic dishonesty have not significantly increased since the advent of tools like ChatGPT. Education researchers found that cheating was already prevalent, and AI has simply become another tool for behaviors that were already occurring, such as copying work from online sources. The article notes that a small but significant percentage of students are using AI to write entire assignments. It calls for a nuanced conversation about why students cheat, what constitutes acceptable AI use, and how education must adapt to a future where AI is ubiquitous.</p>

          <p>World number one Aryna Sabalenka brings remarkable consistency into the US Open semi-finals, having reached the final four in 12 of her last 13 major tournaments. However, her powerful game is often undermined by a tendency to "lose control" in critical moments, resulting in only three titles from those deep runs. This year, she has fallen short in the final or semi-final of all three previous majors. As she prepares to face Jessica Pegula, her team, now including coach Max Mirnyi, is focused on helping her manage the emotional and mental aspects of her game to convert her consistent performances into another Grand Slam victory.</p>

          <p>West Ham United midfielder Lucas Paqueta is reportedly considering legal action against the English Football Association (FA) after an independent commission cleared him of all spot-fixing charges. The Brazilian player was accused of deliberately receiving yellow cards to influence betting markets, allegations that caused an £80 million transfer to Manchester City to collapse. Recently published written reasons from the commission criticized the FA's case, noting it rested on circumstantial evidence and questioning its use of an internal investigator as an expert witness. Paqueta's legal team is now exploring all options in response to the lengthy investigation.</p>
