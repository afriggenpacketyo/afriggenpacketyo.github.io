          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 20:38:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports contracted by only 0.1% year-on-year in August, a significant improvement from the 2.6% fall in July and better than the 1.9% decline economists had predicted. This smaller-than-expected contraction was largely driven by a rebound in shipments to Asia, which helped offset a sharp 13.8% drop in exports to the United States. The data, which shows a fourth consecutive month of decline, comes just ahead of the Bank of Japan's upcoming interest rate decision, where it is expected to hold rates steady.</p>

This public debut marks the culmination of a multi-year effort by the company, which faced previous delays. The move comes amid a resurgent IPO market that has seen several other major tech and finance companies go public successfully in recent months.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve is poised to make its most consequential decision of the year, with economists widely predicting an interest rate cut to address a cooling labor market. The central bank faces a complex situation, balancing the need to stimulate hiring against the risk of rising inflation, which has been influenced by the Trump administration's tariffs. The decision is further complicated by political pressure from the White House, making the Fed's announcement and future guidance highly anticipated by markets. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following his death at age 89, this article reflects on the career of actor and director Robert Redford, celebrating him as an artist who deliberately sidestepped easy, heroic roles to explore more complex characters. It highlights his ability to use his all-American good looks to critique the nation's self-image in films like "The Candidate" and "All the President's Men." Beyond his iconic acting roles, Redford's legacy is cemented by his founding of the Sundance Institute, which has championed independent filmmaking for decades.</p>

          <p>Five partially constructed homes in Los Angeles's Laurel Canyon, which have been a source of community frustration and legal battles for over 20 years, are set to be demolished. The city first ordered the structures torn down in 2003, but a series of new owners attempted to restart the project without complying. The current developers, who faced 35 criminal charges, reached a plea agreement requiring them to demolish the dangerous and dilapidated homes by August 2026.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer believes JPMorgan Chase could become the next non-technology company to be valued at $1 trillion, joining an exclusive club currently dominated by tech giants. He attributes this potential to the bank's excellence in lending, trading, and capital markets, as well as the statesmanship of CEO Jamie Dimon. Cramer also noted that the entire banking sector is performing strongly, with expanding price-to-earnings multiples that suggest Wall Street is increasingly willing to invest in financial institutions.

          <p>The Tottenham football club has demonstrated a significant strategic shift under manager Thomas Frank, focusing on a strong defensive structure over the attack-minded approach of the previous season. This new "clean sheet mentality" was evident in their 1-0 Champions League victory against Villarreal, marking their fourth clean sheet in five games. While the pragmatic style has proven effective in preventing goals, with the opposition failing to register a single shot on target, it has also limited Tottenham's own offensive output.</p>

Harris noted that the few publicly traded sports assets have generally traded below their perceived intrinsic value.</p>
