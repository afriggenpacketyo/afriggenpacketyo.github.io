          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced an upcoming visit from King Charles III and Queen Camilla, who will visit Canada later this month. Carney says he had invited the King to formally open Canada's 45th Parliament on 27 May, underscoring Canada's sovereignty in light of President Trump's remarks about making Canada the 51st US state. Carney will visit the White House on Tuesday, and he will strengthen relationships with "reliable" trading partners, pointing to recent conversations he has had with world leaders in Europe and Asia.</p>
