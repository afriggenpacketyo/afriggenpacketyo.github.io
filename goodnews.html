          <p>The village of Chimney Rock, North Carolina, is still struggling to recover from Hurricane Helene, which brought mudslides and flash flooding eight months prior, severely impacting homes and infrastructure. The town's remote location and unique geography are making recovery efforts slow and costly, leaving residents without running water and sanitation. Businesses, including the Chimney Rock Inn and Bubba O'Leary's General Store, remain closed, and the mayor emphasizes the stark contrast between the normalcy of nearby towns and the ongoing challenges faced by Chimney Rock. Despite the setbacks, the community remains resilient and determined to rebuild and restore the town to its former state. </p>

          <p>Khaby Lame, the popular TikTok personality, left the U.S. after being detained by immigration agents in Las Vegas for allegedly overstaying his visa. Lame, a Senegalese-Italian influencer, was detained at Harry Reid International Airport and allowed to leave without a deportation order. His departure comes amid increased immigration enforcement, and a voluntary departure allows him to avoid a deportation order on his record. Lame rose to fame during the pandemic for his silent reaction videos and has since signed partnerships with brands like Hugo Boss and was appointed as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador.</p>

          <p>General Motors (GM) is planning to invest $4 billion in three U.S. assembly plants, shifting production of the Chevrolet Blazer and Chevrolet Equinox from Mexico to American facilities. This move comes amid ongoing trade tensions and tariffs imposed on imported vehicles and auto parts. The investment will enable GM to assemble over two million vehicles annually in the U.S., and the company highlights its commitment to American innovation and manufacturing.

          <p>New federal data indicates a significant drop in drug-related deaths among young people in the U.S., reversing a concerning trend from the past decade where over 230,000 individuals under 35 died from fentanyl and other street drugs. This unprecedented decline is saving thousands of lives each year, prompting questions about the factors driving this positive change. The article considers whether this progress can be sustained, especially with potential federal funding cuts looming. It underscores the importance of understanding and supporting the initiatives contributing to this decline to continue saving young lives.</p>

          <p>The recent demonstrations in Los Angeles over immigration-enforcement operations by federal agents are emerging as the first mass movement against the second Trump administration. Despite concerns that the protests could provoke an overreach by the administration, the existence of large demonstrations indicates Trump's vulnerability. The article argues that Trump's reliance on the military to enforce his policies is a sign of his weak public support, and that peaceful protests can be effective at changing policy and public opinion. It notes that public opinion has already begun to shift against Trump's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>ABC News has decided not to renew its contract with national correspondent Terry Moran after he posted a social media message calling President Trump and advisor Stephen Miller "world-class haters." The network cited a clear violation of ABC News policies regarding objectivity, fairness, and professionalism as the reason for the decision. Moran's post, which was quickly deleted, drew criticism from Trump administration officials, and this action follows a recent settlement where ABC agreed to pay $15 million in a legal settlement with Trump.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a rally after Elon Musk showcased driverless vehicle testing in Austin, Texas, recovering from a previous dip caused by a feud with President Trump. The company appears poised to launch its autonomous driving technology on public streets with a limited rollout of robotaxis, monitored remotely by employees. Tesla is listed as "testing" on Austin's official website for autonomous vehicles. The stock bump early this week may be in part a reaction to a more contrite Musk, who has deleted some of the most pointed insults that he previously lobbed at Trump, and has appeared to endorse the president on other policy matters like immigration.</p>

Taste, defined as judgment with style, is crucial for leaders in making decisions that shape culture and reflect an organization's aspirations. AI can generate infinite variations, but it lacks the human discretion, cultural intuition, and lived experience necessary to originate style with intentionality. Cultivating taste requires exposure, curation, and reflection, making it an essential skill for leaders and individuals alike.</p>
