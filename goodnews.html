          <p>Washington Commanders wide receiver Terry McLaurin has been activated from the physically unable to perform list, signaling an end to his 'hold-in' amid an ongoing contract dispute. McLaurin had reported to training camp but abstained from practice due to an ankle injury and frustration over his contract status. While this move makes him eligible to practice for the upcoming season, it is not believed to be directly linked to a new contract extension agreement. The star player previously expressed significant disappointment with the progression of talks, stating he wants to feel valued by the organization where he has established his career, leaving his long-term future with the team unresolved.</p>

          <p>Sunderland marked their return to the Premier League with an impressive 3-0 victory over West Ham, securing their first top-flight win in the month of August in over a decade. After a goalless first half, the newly promoted side dominated the second period with goals from Eliezer Mayenda, Dan Ballard, and Wilson Isidor. The decisive win at home sparked jubilant celebrations among fans, who have endured a long period in lower divisions. The performance showcased the potential of their newly assembled squad, which includes several expensive summer signings like veteran midfielder Granit Xhaka, raising hopes that the club can successfully compete and remain in the Premier League this season.</p>

          <p>Australia's national rugby team achieved a historic victory against world champions South Africa, overcoming a 22-0 deficit to win their Rugby Championship opener 38-22 in Johannesburg. The Wallabies appeared headed for a decisive loss after the Springboks scored three early tries in the first 20 minutes. However, Australia rallied to dominate the remainder of the match, with captain Harry Wilson scoring two tries in an influential performance. The stunning comeback secured Australia's first win at the iconic Ellis Park since 1963, marking it as one of the most memorable victories in the team's recent history and a powerful start to their tournament campaign.</p>

          <p>Topshop, the once-dominant British fashion brand, is planning a major comeback with the relaunch of physical standalone stores on the High Street. The brand, which collapsed into administration in 2020 and was later acquired by online retailer Asos, recently held its first catwalk show in seven years to signal its revival. While the brand has cultivated nostalgia among millennial and Gen-Z consumers, industry experts caution that its success will depend on attracting a new generation of shoppers and re-establishing its 'cool' factor in a competitive market. Topshop's leadership confirmed the plan to reopen stores, aiming to fill a perceived gap for a distinctly British fashion presence on the High Street.</p>

          <p>During the Alaska summit, Donald Trump reportedly hand-delivered a personal letter from first lady Melania Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin concerning the plight of abducted Ukrainian children. While the full contents are unknown, administration officials indicated it addressed the thousands of children who have been forcibly transferred from occupied Ukrainian territories to Russia. This act has been classified as a war crime by the International Criminal Court, which has indicted Putin for his alleged role. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his gratitude to the first lady for her attention to the issue, which he described as a "true act of humanism," highlighting a humanitarian focus within the high-stakes political meeting.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes both reached new record highs this week, driven by investor optimism following a cooler-than-expected July inflation report. The data increased market expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its upcoming September meeting. While a subsequent report showed a slight rise in wholesale inflation, it did little to dampen speculation for an impending rate cut. The market rally was broad, with several major companies like Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and Nvidia hitting all-time highs. This positive momentum reflects Wall Street's confidence that the economic environment is becoming more favorable for corporate growth and investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales, along with their three children, are planning to move to Forest Lodge, an eight-bedroom home in Windsor Great Park. This move is being described as an opportunity for a "fresh start" for the family following a challenging period that included Princess Catherine's cancer diagnosis and treatment. The family has been living at Adelaide Cottage in Windsor since 2022, and the new residence is viewed as their long-term 'forever home.' The relocation is being funded privately, and the couple intends to continue raising their children with a focus on privacy, without live-in staff. The move allows them to remain settled in Windsor, where their children attend school.</p>

          <p>A Phoenix-based startup, Steel + Spark, is tackling the affordable housing crisis by transforming old shipping containers into temporary shelters for the city's unhoused population. Architect Brian Stark designed the "X-WING" shelters, each made from four containers arranged in an 'X' shape to create individual rooms and shared courtyards. The units are equipped with air conditioning and solar panels, and can be constructed in just one week, offering a rapid and sustainable housing solution. This innovative approach upcycles existing materials to provide safe, private spaces for individuals transitioning out of homelessness, with plans to expand the concept to build a larger apartment complex for low-income seniors.</p>

          <p>In their first head-to-head 100-meter race since the Paris Olympics, Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson defeated American Olympic champion Noah Lyles at the Silesia Diamond League meet. Thompson clocked a time of 9.87 seconds for the victory, with Lyles finishing second at 9.90 seconds. The result serves as a measure of revenge for Thompson, who lost the Olympic gold to Lyles by a mere five-thousandths of a second a year ago. Thompson's dominant, gun-to-tape performance solidifies his position as a top contender for the upcoming world championships in Tokyo. Lyles, meanwhile, viewed his sub-10-second finish as a positive step in his preparations for the championships.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was successfully rescued by helicopter after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area of California. The man, Ryan Wardwell, had been rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his lines, leaving him stranded. A search was launched after he failed to return to his car, and a dive and rescue team eventually located him using a drone. The California Highway Patrol executed the hoist rescue, and Wardwell was treated for minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family, bringing a dangerous ordeal to a positive conclusion.</p>

          <p>A top scientist from the Chinese Academy of Sciences is calling for China to accelerate its development of space-based solar power to compete with the United States in this emerging sector. The technology involves building large solar power stations in orbit that can continuously collect intense solar radiation without being affected by weather or nighttime. This energy would then be converted to electricity and transmitted to Earth via microwaves or lasers. The academic, Ge Changchun, argued for a top-down national strategy to overcome the current fragmented research efforts and close the technological gap with the U.S., which has been experimenting with the concept for decades.</p>
