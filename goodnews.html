          <p>Nintendo has released the Switch 2, its first new gaming console in over eight years, with strong preorder demand indicating positive prospects for the company. The Kyoto-based gaming giant anticipates selling 15 million units globally in the current business year, driven by larger-than-expected preorder interest.

          <p>Italians are participating in a referendum that includes a proposal to halve the legal residency requirement for non-EU adult foreigners to apply for Italian citizenship, from 10 to five years. The referendum, spurred by a grassroots organization that gathered half a million signatures, aims to address obstacles faced by many immigrants seeking citizenship due to clerical errors and systemic issues. While the government has been tightening citizenship rules, this vote presents an opportunity to make the bureaucracy more benevolent and recognize the diversity of its residents. Prime Minister Meloni and several ministers have discouraged participation in the referendum. </p>

The federal grant allowed the state to clean up boats on Squaxin Island, an area of cultural importance to the Squaxin Island Tribe. </p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found trapped in Burmese amber has shed new light on the evolution of flight feathers, which allowed early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences studied feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period. The study highlights the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift as an essential feature of bird evolution. While modern birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs, most feathered dinosaurs did not have the same ability to fly. </p>

          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria our bodies meet at birth can protect against dangerous infections. The study showed that good bacteria, particularly Bifidobacterium longum, seem to halve the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute collected stool samples from 1,082 newborns and tracked them for two years. The protective bacteria were found only in babies born via vaginal delivery rather than caesarean. </p>
