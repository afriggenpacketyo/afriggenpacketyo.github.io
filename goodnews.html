          <p>Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, stated that the United States is increasingly aware of Japan's economic importance after trade discussions with U.S. Cabinet members. Akazawa and U.S. officials agreed on the need to quickly conclude a trade deal, though securing major concessions for Japan seems unlikely. Prior to these talks, Prime Minister Ishiba and President Trump discussed the importance of productive negotiations, with Japan continuing to push for the removal of additional tariffs. Japan is seeking the elimination of tariffs on cars and auto parts, but is considering compromises to reach an early agreement.</p>

          <p>Following a black-tie gala for top investors in President Trump's meme coin, several attendees were invited to tour the White House, raising questions about the intersection of Trump's personal business ventures and official duties. The White House maintained that the meme coin event was separate from official duties, but the investors' visit to the White House has drawn criticism. Justin Sun, a Chinese crypto mogul, posted a video of his White House tour, while another executive said the firm's founder had also been invited.

The study, published in Global Change Biology, found that the beaks became longer and more slender, enabling the birds to access nectar more efficiently. Additionally, male hummingbirds' beaks grew pointier to compete for feeder access, and the birds expanded their range northward. The study underscores the impact of human activities on the evolution of species.</p>
