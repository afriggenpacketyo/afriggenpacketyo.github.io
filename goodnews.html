          <p>Microsoft has announced a new policy requiring employees to work from an office at least three days per week, beginning in February for those near its Redmond headquarters. The mandate will subsequently be rolled out to the company's other U.S. and international locations. In a memo, the company's human resources chief cited the need for the "energy and momentum that comes from smart people working side by side" to build new AI products. Microsoft clarified that this policy shift is not intended to reduce headcount but rather to enhance collaboration and better serve customers.</p>

          <p>A year after CEO Brian Niccol took charge, Starbucks is showing mixed progress in its turnaround efforts, with same-store sales and traffic still declining. Niccol has focused on returning the chain to its roots as a "third place," improving the customer experience and re-emphasizing coffee. While some changes, like improved hospitality programs, are showing positive signs, others have been met with resistance from customers and baristas. Investors remain cautious, as the company's stock has fallen 7% over the past year, indicating that a full recovery may take longer than initially anticipated.</p>

          <p>Chester-based artist Hayden Richard is celebrating the Philadelphia Eagles with a large, detailed painting of a bald eagle, a piece he began before the team's last Super Bowl victory. The artwork, created using a meticulous stippling technique, aims to embody the strength and pride of the team's namesake without depicting any players or stadiums. Richard, a former chef who returned to his passion for art, hopes the painting will be acquired by someone within the Eagles organization. His broader work often focuses on American landscapes and themes of unity.</p>

          <p>A 57-year-old man has been arrested following a partial evacuation of Terminal 4 at London's Heathrow Airport. The incident, which occurred Monday evening, was triggered after a can of CS spray was discovered, which caused irritation to about 20 people who were treated at the scene. Hundreds of passengers were forced to leave the terminal for three hours while authorities investigated. The Metropolitan Police have stated that the incident is not being treated as terrorism-related, and the suspect was arrested on suspicion of possessing CS gas and causing a public nuisance.</p>

          <p>The article details a portfolio adjustment, explaining the decision to sell a small number of Goldman Sachs shares as the stock reaches a record high. The move is intended to lock in recent gains driven by a strong market for mergers, acquisitions, and initial public offerings. The proceeds from this sale are being reinvested into Texas Roadhouse, a steakhouse chain whose stock has recently declined due to margin pressures from high beef prices. The rationale is that beef prices may have peaked, potentially easing the financial pressure on the restaurant company. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American consumers, particularly younger generations like Gen Z, are increasingly opting for debit cards over credit cards due to a growing aversion to debt. This trend reverses a long-standing preference for credit, driven by concerns over high interest rates and the financial instability witnessed after the Great Recession. In response, financial companies like Venmo and Cash App are launching debit cards with rewards programs to attract these debt-averse customers. The shift reflects a broader cultural and economic desire for greater control over personal spending and finances.</p>
