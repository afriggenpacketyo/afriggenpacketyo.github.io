          <p>Starbucks has reported its sixth straight quarter of declining same-store sales, with a global drop of 2%. Despite this, CEO Brian Niccol expressed confidence, stating the company's turnaround is ahead of schedule, drawing on his experience with Chipotle. The company is focusing on improving customer service with its "Green Apron Service" program and making cafes more comfortable, while also seeing a 2% sales growth in its key China market. For the upcoming quarter, the company remains conservative but plans significant investments in labor and future product innovations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Representative Tim Burchett, a Republican from Tennessee, is recovering after being kicked in the chest by a horse on his farm over the weekend. The incident, which resulted in a broken rib and bruising, occurred when a horsefly spooked the animal. Despite the injury, the 60-year-old congressman is reportedly in good spirits and has not altered his public schedule, even making light of the "cool mark" left by the horse's hooves. A doctor informed him he was fortunate the impact was not slightly higher on his chest.</p>

          <p>Officials in Anchorage, Alaska, are urging hikers to be cautious and avoid salmon-filled streams after two separate bear maulings occurred within a week. Both hikers survived the attacks, one of which involved a man whose dog encountered a brown bear with her cub near Eagle River. The other attack involved a woman on a popular hillside trail. Authorities believe the first bear was a mother protecting her cub and do not plan to euthanize it. They advise hikers to travel in groups, make noise, and carry bear spray.</p>

          <p>Venture capital investment in the Los Angeles area more than doubled to $5.8 billion in the second quarter, largely driven by a massive $2.5 billion funding round for defense technology company Anduril. This surge reflects growing investor interest in defense and aerospace startups amid heightened global geopolitical tensions. Anduril, which builds autonomous weapons systems, plans to use the capital for scaling production and further acquisitions. Southern California is re-emerging as a major hub for this sector, attracting significant investment due to its established talent pool and proximity to industry players. (not investment advice)</p>

Raised in a bilingual, first-generation household in Los Angeles, Rubio's music reflects her diverse influences, from Pedro Infante to No Doubt. After starting her career in alt-rock, she made a conscious decision to create music in Spanish to honor her heritage and tell her own story. The piece also touches on her activism, as she postponed her album release show to protest immigration raids and donated a portion of merchandise sales to an immigrant rights group.</p>

As part of the settlement, UCLA is prohibited for 15 years from facilitating the exclusion of Jewish individuals from campus areas.

          <p>This review describes the film "Together," starring real-life couple Dave Franco and Alison Brie, as a unique blend of body horror and relationship drama. The plot centers on an unhappy couple who move to a remote location and encounter a cave pool whose water causes a biological urge to merge with the nearest living being. The reviewer praises the film's direction, noting its clever use of misdirection and jump scares to build suspense. The film is described as an empathetic, if grotesque, metaphor for codependence, exploring how a long-term couple can lose their individual identities.</p>
