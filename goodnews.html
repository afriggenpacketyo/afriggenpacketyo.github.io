          <p>Pratika Rawal, a 25-year-old opening batter for India's women's cricket team, has emerged as a pivotal player at the ongoing World Cup, fulfilling a dream her father once held for himself. Raised in a cricket-centric family, Rawal was coached from a young age by her father and later mentored by former national player Deepti Dhyani. Despite an initial setback of being overlooked in the Women's Premier League auction, she quickly earned her first national call-up and has since become a consistent top-scorer. Her impressive average and key performances, including a high score against Australia, have positioned her as one of India's most promising cricket stars.</p>

          <p>A trial in North America for the Galleri blood test has yielded promising results, successfully detecting over 50 different types of cancer, many of which lack existing screening methods. The test identifies fragments of cancerous DNA in the blood, and the study found it could detect more than half of the cancers at an early, more treatable stage. Among 25,000 adults tested, the tool correctly identified cancer in 62% of positive results and ruled it out in over 99% of negative cases. While researchers believe this could revolutionize cancer screening, further data from a large-scale NHS trial is needed to confirm if it reduces mortality rates.</p>

In 1957, Yang and his colleague Lee Tsung-Dao were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their groundbreaking work on parity laws, which fundamentally altered the understanding of elementary particles. Born in China, Yang pursued his higher education in the United States, studying under Enrico Fermi at the University of Chicago. Throughout his distinguished career, he made significant contributions across various fields of physics and served as a professor at Beijing's Tsinghua University.</p>

          <p>A weekend trip to a Butlin's holiday park inadvertently saved Charlotte Morjaria's life after a playful mishap led to the discovery of a cancerous tumor. The 31-year-old from Newport went to the hospital believing she had a broken rib after being lifted over someone's shoulder. However, a precautionary CT scan revealed a large, previously undetected tumor on her kidney. She was diagnosed with a rare form of stage one kidney cancer and subsequently had the kidney removed. Now cancer-free, she credits the accidental injury with revealing the hidden illness that had produced only subtle symptoms.</p>

          <p>Cranberry farmers in Massachusetts, the nation's second-largest producer, are grappling with increasing economic pressures due to high costs for labor, utilities, and real estate. These challenges make it more expensive to operate compared to larger-scale farms in states like Wisconsin. In response, some growers are utilizing a state-run program that offers a "green exit strategy." This initiative allows farmers to retire unprofitable cranberry bogs and receive compensation for restoring them to their natural wetland state, providing a sustainable alternative for struggling family farms.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Cloud has introduced a new computing solution called Aegaeon that it claims can reduce the number of Nvidia GPUs required to run AI models by up to 82 percent. The system pools GPU resources to improve efficiency, addressing the issue of underutilized hardware when serving thousands of AI models concurrently. During a beta test in Alibaba's model marketplace, the system cut the number of required Nvidia H20 GPUs from 1,192 to 213. This innovation could significantly lower the high costs associated with deploying large language models at scale for cloud service providers.</p>
