          <p>President Trump announced a new trade deal with Vietnam that will impose a 20% tariff on goods imported into the United States, a reduction from a potential 46% levy. Under the agreement, Vietnam will eliminate tariffs on U.S. products, granting what the president called "TOTAL ACCESS" to its markets. The deal also includes a steeper 40% tariff on products that are trans-shipped through Vietnam from other countries, like China, to avoid duties. This development follows a period of intense negotiations as the Trump administration pursues its "reciprocal" trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An essay adapted from a new book reflects on the lasting cultural impact of Ritchie Valens, a founding father of rock 'n' roll who died tragically at age 17. The article highlights how Valens, a Chicano kid from Pacoima, skillfully blended traditional Mexican sounds with American rock, creating iconic hits like "La Bamba" and "Donna." His music not only launched his own brief but brilliant career but also paved the way for future generations of Chicano artists. The piece also discusses the making of the 1987 film "La Bamba," which introduced his story and music to a new audience.</p>

The 2021 US Open champion described the match as one of her best in a long time, setting up a highly anticipated clash with world number one Aryna Sabalenka. Her success is attributed to her strong grass-court game and a more relaxed mindset under coach Mark Petchey.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has blocked President Trump's policy that effectively banned migrants from seeking asylum at the southern border. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president overstepped his authority by declaring an emergency to bypass existing immigration laws. The judge found that the administration's proclamation and guidance created an illegal regime for removing individuals without allowing them to apply for asylum. The ruling has been temporarily stayed for two weeks to allow the government to appeal, representing a significant legal setback for the administration's immigration agenda.</p>

          <p>The 14th Dalai Lama has ended years of speculation by confirming that the centuries-old institution will continue after his death, meaning he will be reincarnated. In a statement ahead of his 90th birthday, the Tibetan spiritual leader asserted that the process of finding his successor should follow past traditions and be handled by his Gaden Phodrang Trust. This declaration is a clear rejection of China's claim that it has the sole authority to approve the next Dalai Lama.
