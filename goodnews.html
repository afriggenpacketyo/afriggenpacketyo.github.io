          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 00:13:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has announced an immediate but conditional resumption of seafood imports from certain regions of Japan, partially reversing a comprehensive ban. The measure excludes aquatic products from ten Japanese prefectures, including Fukushima, where the ban was originally imposed in July 2023. Beijing had initially suspended imports from these areas before Japan began releasing treated wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear plant. The full import ban on all Japanese seafood was enacted a month later, making this partial lift a notable, albeit limited, development in bilateral trade relations.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its digital services tax, which was set to take effect on Monday, following a threat from U.S. President Donald Trump to terminate all trade negotiations. The 3% levy would have applied retroactively to the revenue of large domestic and foreign tech companies, including U.S. giants like Google and Amazon. Canadian officials stated the move was made in anticipation of a comprehensive trade arrangement with the United States. The decision represents a significant reversal and aims to restart stalled negotiations on a new economic and security relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A trade deal between the UK and the United States has kicked in, reducing a 25% tariff on British cars to 10%, prompting manufacturers like Aston Martin to resume shipments. The deal is expected to unleash pent-up demand for UK-made vehicles, though the lower duty only applies to a quota of 100,000 cars annually. While the auto industry welcomes the relief, British farmers express concern that agricultural concessions, such as tariff-free quotas for US beef and ethanol, were used as bargaining chips. Negotiations are still ongoing to secure zero tariffs for the UK steel industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Researchers Investigate Why Electric Vehicles May Induce More Motion Sickness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 22:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers are now studying. Studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs, particularly their regenerative braking systems, are a likely cause. This system, which recovers kinetic energy to charge the battery, results in low-frequency deceleration that can provoke queasiness and discomfort in passengers. Chinese researchers are exploring potential solutions to mitigate this issue as the country continues its rapid transition to new energy transportation.</p>

          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has voiced concerns that the expanded 32-team Club World Cup could "destroy" his team's 2025-26 season due to fixture congestion. Speaking ahead of a match in the tournament, Guardiola acknowledged the demanding schedule and the short rest periods for his players. While respecting the competition, he sympathized with comments from former Liverpool manager J√ºrgen Klopp, who criticized the relentless calendar. Guardiola stated that while many teams would love the income and prestige of being in the tournament, the physical toll on players is a significant and unavoidable challenge.</p>
