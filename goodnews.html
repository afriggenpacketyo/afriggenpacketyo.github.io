          <p>South Korean chip heavyweights Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix experienced significant stock surges, reaching multi-decade highs, following their partnership announcement with OpenAI. This collaboration, integral to OpenAI's Stargate initiative, aims to boost the supply of advanced memory chips crucial for next-generation AI technologies and expand data center capabilities in South Korea. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman held meetings with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and top executives from both companies to solidify these agreements. This strategic alliance underscores the pivotal role these firms play in the global artificial intelligence value chain, particularly in high-bandwidth memory development. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has achieved a record $500 billion net worth, cementing his position as the world's richest person, significantly ahead of global tech rivals. This milestone is largely fueled by the surging valuations of his diverse portfolio, including electric car manufacturer Tesla, rocket company SpaceX, and artificial intelligence startup xAI. Investors have responded positively to Musk's increased focus on his business ventures rather than political engagements, contributing to Tesla's substantial stock gains this year. The company's board has also outlined an ambitious, trillion-dollar pay package for Musk if he successfully meets a series of challenging growth targets over the coming decade.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order vowing to use all lawful and appropriate measures, including diplomatic, economic, and potentially military action, to defend Qatar's security and territorial integrity. This pledge follows a recent Israeli attack on Doha targeting Hamas leaders, for which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later expressed deep regret during a Washington visit. The order highlights the "close cooperation" and "shared interest" between the US and Qatar, a nation critical to US military operations in the Middle East due to its vast Al Udeid airbase. The true legal weight of this executive order, however, remains subject to debate regarding treaty approval.</p>

          <p>Renault is reportedly exploring a partnership with China’s Chery to manufacture vehicles in South America, specifically targeting Colombia and Argentina. These discussions involve Chery gaining access to Renault’s established factory network in exchange for providing capital and product design expertise. Potential plans include producing combustion-engine cars, primarily rebadged as Renaults, at the Envigado plant in Colombia, and Chery investing in a plug-in hybrid pickup truck line at Renault’s Córdoba factory in Argentina. This collaboration, initiated under Renault’s previous CEO, now leans towards Chery fully funding the projects under the current leadership's more cautious investment approach.</p>

          <p>Six individuals were arrested on Sunday after they attempted to hang a banner on the iconic Hollywood sign in Los Angeles, according to authorities. The group allegedly trespassed in the landmark's area around noon and tried to affix a banner, which appeared to include a green-and-white pill capsule, to one of the "O's." Police detained the individuals without incident, and the Los Angeles city park rangers have taken over the investigation to determine the group's message and full intent. This incident underscores recurring challenges with unauthorized access and attempts to modify the famous landmark.</p>

          <p>Ecuador has significantly escalated its anti-drug operations, including increased police raids, in response to President Trump's declared war on drug cartels and with substantial US assistance. As a critical transit country for drug trafficking, Ecuador is receiving resources and military support from the US, with plans for a new military base. Ecuadorian security forces, like the specialized drugs squad led by an officer known as "Lynx," are actively disrupting criminal networks, aiming to gather intelligence from lower-level arrests to target higher-ranking figures.

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders employed a unique, non-verbal response to reporters' questions after Dillon Gabriel was promoted to the team's starting quarterback position. When asked about remaining the third-string QB, Sanders smiled broadly and offered only pantomimed answers, effectively "muting" himself. This unusual behavior may be a reaction to recent critical remarks from former NFL coach and analyst Rex Ryan, who took issue with Sanders' previous comments about his capabilities as a backup quarterback in the league. The incident offers a glimpse into player dynamics amidst team roster changes.</p>

Professor Nita Forouhi from the University of Cambridge asserts that rapeseed (vegetable) and sunflower oils are beneficial, particularly when replacing saturated fats, due to their high content of healthier mono- and polyunsaturated fats. The article also clarifies that modern margarines are suitable for a healthy diet, unlike older versions containing harmful trans fats. For cooking methods, it advises against deep-frying with extra virgin olive oil due to its low smoke point, recommending it for dressings instead.</p>
