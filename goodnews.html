        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Uber's first-quarter earnings per share exceeded expectations, but revenue fell slightly short, causing a 5% stock dip. Revenue grew 14% year-over-year to $11.53 billion, while net income rose to $1.78 billion. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi anticipates gross bookings between $45.75 billion and $47.25 billion for the next quarter. Khosrowshahi also addressed the FTC lawsuit regarding Uber One's billing practices, while defending the company's return-to-office policy, emphasizing the importance of in-person collaboration for the company's future, particularly in autonomous vehicle technology, with Uber reaching an annual run-rate of 1.5 million autonomous vehicle trips.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new approach to fighting respiratory diseases, called far-UVC, uses ultraviolet light to kill airborne pathogens without harming humans. The technology could be used in schools, hospitals, and offices to prevent the spread of diseases like Covid and tuberculosis. Recent advancements include the development of cheaper, solid-state lamps using secondary harmonics, which could make far-UVC disinfection more accessible. Research also suggests that the ozone effects of far-UVC are minimal when used in moderation and placed on the ceiling, maximizing disinfection while minimizing human exposure, although further study is needed on this technology.</p>
