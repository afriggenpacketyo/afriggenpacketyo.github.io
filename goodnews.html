          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard announced the seizure of over 40,000 pounds of cocaine in the Eastern Pacific Ocean as part of its enhanced counter-drug initiative, Operation Pacific Viper. The operations, which occurred over the last month, also resulted in the apprehension of 36 suspected smugglers. The agency released images from the interceptions, including one of a burning vessel, highlighting its efforts to disrupt narcotics transport from South America. These actions are part of a broader U.S. military and law enforcement push to combat drug trafficking in both the Pacific and the Caribbean.</p>

          <p>A new photograph captured by the International Gemini Observatory in Chile shows the expanding tail of comet 3I/ATLAS, the third-known interstellar object to visit our solar system. The image reveals that the comet's coma and tail have grown significantly, indicating it has become more active as it approaches the sun. Scientists are using these observations to study the comet's composition and chemistry, which could provide insights into its origins from another star system. The comet poses no threat to Earth and is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October.</p>

          <p>Broadcom's stock increased by 11% after the company announced it secured a new $10 billion order for custom artificial intelligence chips from a fourth major customer. While Broadcom did not name the client, multiple financial analysts believe it to be the AI firm OpenAI. This significant order has boosted Broadcom's AI revenue forecast for the coming years, with shipments expected to begin in 2026. The development solidifies Broadcom's position, alongside Nvidia, as a key hardware supplier for the rapidly growing AI industry, pushing its market capitalization past $1.6 trillion.

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage saw its most significant one-day drop in over a year, falling to 6.29% following a weaker-than-expected August employment report. This decline brought rates to their lowest point since early October, providing potential relief for homebuyers facing high housing prices. For a median-priced home, the lower rate could save a borrower nearly $170 per month. The market's reaction highlights the strong influence of economic data on borrowing costs, though it remains uncertain if this drop is substantial enough to reinvigorate mortgage demand.

          <p>Pop icon Debbie Gibson is reflecting on her decades-long career in her new memoir, "Eternally Electric: The Message in My Music." Gibson, who at 17 became the youngest female artist to write, produce, and perform a Billboard No. 1 hit, credits her late mother for her success. She recounts how her mother, acting as her manager, secured a loan to build a home studio and fought for her creative control in a male-dominated industry. Gibson believes her mother's advocacy helped pave the way for today's young female artists to have more agency in their careers.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has pulled out of the Great Britain team for the upcoming Billie Jean King Cup Finals. Instead, she has accepted a wildcard entry to the Korea Open, prioritizing the WTA Tour event to aid the long-term development of her game. This decision is also aimed at strengthening her new coaching partnership with Francisco Roig. Raducanu's absence is a significant setback for the British team, as she was a key player in their semi-final run last year, but she aims to defend ranking points in Seoul.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot reaching $1.8 billion, the second-largest in U.S. history, is driving a surge in business for lottery courier services like Jackpocket, which is owned by DraftKings. The company reported a massive increase in ticket sales through its app, with 15 million Powerball tickets ordered during the current jackpot run. This enthusiasm highlights the value of DraftKings' acquisition of Jackpocket, which it uses to cross-sell customers to its sports betting and iGaming platforms. The massive prize pool is generating significant revenue and customer engagement for the online gaming company. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Powerball jackpot climbing to an estimated $1.8 billion, the potential winner faces a substantial tax liability that would significantly reduce the final take-home amount. The lump sum cash option is estimated at $826.4 million, which would immediately be subject to a mandatory 24% federal withholding, reducing it by nearly $200 million. However, since the winnings push the recipient into the highest federal income tax bracket of 37%, a much larger tax bill will be due. State taxes could further diminish the prize, depending on where the winning ticket was purchased. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The city of Norwalk, California, has agreed to repeal a controversial law that banned the development of homeless shelters and other services for the poor, settling a lawsuit filed by the state. California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that under the settlement, Norwalk will also dedicate $250,000 to new affordable housing and submit to increased state monitoring. The city had passed the ban last year, arguing it was a response to a lack of support from other agencies in addressing homelessness. State officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, condemned the ban as unlawful and inexcusable.</p>

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot reaches $1.8 billion, an analysis of tax laws shows a winner's location significantly impacts their net prize. States with no income tax on lottery winnings, such as California, Florida, and Texas, offer the highest potential take-home amount. Conversely, states with high income taxes, like New York, would result in the lowest after-tax payout. The report details how federal taxes claim about 37% of the prize, with state taxes further reducing the winnings in most locations. This highlights the geographic lottery that winners face even after hitting the jackpot.</p>

This move allows him to prove his red-ball form ahead of the squad selection for the tour of Australia. The decision is part of several changes to England's white-ball teams, which also see opener Ben Duckett rested and all-rounder Sam Curran recalled. Potts' opportunity arises partly due to another bowler's retirement from red-ball cricket, opening a potential spot in the Ashes pace attack.</p>

          <p>The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage has fallen to 6.50%, its lowest point in 11 months, offering a glimmer of hope for prospective homebuyers. This decline is largely driven by market anticipation of an imminent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, which is expected at its next meeting. As the 10-year Treasury yield also cools, lenders are preemptively lowering their rates. The article advises potential buyers to act strategically by checking their credit, getting pre-approved, and calculating their budget to take advantage of the more favorable borrowing climate.

          <p>The Trump administration is set to issue an executive order that will create a formal "state sponsors of wrongful detention" designation, allowing the U.S. to impose penalties on countries that illegally detain American citizens. This measure, similar to the state sponsors of terrorism list, will provide the State Department with tools to punish nations that use detained Americans for political leverage. The move is intended to deter hostage-taking and has been praised by families of former detainees, such as that of Robert Levinson, who died in Iranian custody. The action follows several high-profile prisoner swaps.</p>
