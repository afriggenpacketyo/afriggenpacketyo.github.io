          <p>The UK government has signed a deal with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, to explore using artificial intelligence in public services like education, defense, and the justice system. The agreement, which is a non-binding statement of intent, aims to boost productivity and economic growth. As part of the partnership, OpenAI will expand its London office, and the two parties will collaborate on developing safeguards and potentially an information-sharing program to ensure the technology is used responsibly and upholds democratic values.</p>

The attack occurred on a popular trail, and the child was subsequently airlifted to a Seattle trauma center for treatment and has since been released. Park rangers, aided by a canine team, located and dispatched the cougar, which was fitted with a tracking collar. Witnesses praised the father's quick actions, stating they believe he saved the child's life during the rare and frightening encounter.</p>

A key part of this investment is a new multi-billion dollar facility in Virginia dedicated to producing its weight management portfolio, including a new oral GLP-1 obesity pill. This move follows similar announcements by other global pharma companies and comes as the industry anticipates potential U.S. tariffs on pharmaceuticals, reflecting a broader trend of reshoring manufacturing to the United States.

          <p>The UK government is set to enact a new sanctions regime targeting people-smuggling networks, a key part of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's strategy to stop illegal Channel crossings. The measures, which include asset freezes and travel bans, will target gang leaders, suppliers of small boats and fake documents, and financial middlemen. Foreign Secretary David Lammy described it as the first sanctions regime of its kind, though critics have questioned whether targeting individuals will be effective enough to dismantle the extensive and profitable smuggling industry.</p>

          <p>The small Norwegian village of Ulefoss is located above Europe's largest known deposit of rare earth elements, critical materials for modern technology currently dominated by Chinese supply chains. A mining company, Rare Earths Norway (REN), plans to extract the 9 million tons of oxides through an "invisible mine" by tunneling diagonally from outside the town to minimize disruption. While the project promises to boost Europe's strategic autonomy and bring jobs, it also raises local concerns about environmental impact and potential geological instability, which the company aims to mitigate.</p>

          <p>Kimi K2, a new large language model from the Alibaba-backed Chinese startup Moonshot AI, has seen a surge in popularity since its launch. The model utilizes a mixture-of-experts (MOE) architecture, which divides tasks among specialized sub-networks, significantly reducing computational costs for training and inference compared to larger models from competitors like OpenAI. Experts have praised this cost-efficient approach as a potential turning point in AI development, allowing for powerful performance without the massive financial investment typically required for cutting-edge AI.</p>

          <p>The race to develop solid-state batteries for electric vehicles is intensifying, with major automakers like Volkswagen, Nissan, and Stellantis, along with cell producers like CATL, setting timelines for mass production before 2030. These batteries promise higher energy density, improved safety, and faster charging compared to current lithium-ion technology. While some companies are focusing on semi-solid-state batteries as a practical bridge technology, persistent technical challenges and high costs remain, even as improvements in existing battery tech create a more competitive landscape for this next-generation power source.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced substantial changes to the compensation scheme for victims of the infected blood scandal, following a critical report from the public inquiry chair. Cabinet Office Minister Nick Thomas-Symonds stated the changes aim to restore trust for the thousands infected with HIV or hepatitis in the 1970s-90s. Key changes include allowing compensation to be passed to a deceased family member's estate and consulting on how to recognize psychological harm and the impact of treatments. Victims' groups have cautiously welcomed the news but noted some issues still require resolution.</p>
