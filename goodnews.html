          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have arrested 18 individuals and dismantled a major international criminal network suspected of smuggling up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones to China annually. The investigation, which is the largest of its kind in the UK, began after a single victim tracked their stolen iPhone to a warehouse near Heathrow Airport. The gang allegedly paid street thieves up to £300 per handset, with the devices, primarily Apple products, being sold for as much as £4,000 in China to bypass internet censorship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve recently cutting interest rates and more reductions anticipated, savers are weighing the benefits of certificates of deposit (CDs) versus high-yield savings accounts. For a $10,000 deposit, the earnings over terms ranging from three months to one year are currently very similar between the two options. However, the key difference is that a CD's rate is fixed, guaranteeing a specific return, while a high-yield savings account's variable rate is likely to decrease with future Fed cuts.

          <p>Shares of chipmaker AMD surged over 23% after the company announced a major strategic partnership with OpenAI, which could see the AI firm acquire up to a 10% stake in AMD. Under the deal, OpenAI will deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD's Instinct GPUs over several years, a move intended to secure the immense computing power needed for its future AI models. This multi-billion dollar agreement positions AMD as a key hardware supplier for OpenAI, reducing the AI leader's reliance on a single vendor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) is becoming a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners. A $150,000 HELOC currently has estimated monthly payments between $1,424 for a 15-year term and $1,811 for a 10-year term, which is significantly cheaper than a year ago. Because HELOCs have variable rates, their costs are expected to decrease further with anticipated rate cuts, making them an attractive tool for tapping into substantial home equity levels.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To qualify for a reverse mortgage, senior homeowners typically need to have at least 50% to 60% equity in their home, meaning their outstanding mortgage balance should be less than half of the property's value. While this is a common lender requirement for the popular FHA-backed HECM program, the actual amount one can borrow depends on additional factors like the borrower's age and current interest rates. For those who fall short of the equity threshold, options include paying down the existing mortgage or waiting for the home's value to appreciate further. (not investment advice)</p>
