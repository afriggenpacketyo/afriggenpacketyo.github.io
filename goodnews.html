        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Patrick McGee's 'Apple in China' argues that Apple's reliance on Chinese manufacturing has created a significant vulnerability for the world, not just the company itself. By training millions of workers in China, Apple has inadvertently fostered the growth of Chinese technology, potentially outpacing American innovation. The article highlights how Apple's massive investment in China has enabled the country's technological self-sufficiency, posing risks to global competitiveness. Despite some minor inaccuracies and a lack of Chinese perspectives, the article persuasively exposes the uncomfortable relationship between Apple and China, suggesting that Apple has played a crucial role in China's rise as a global power.</p>

          <p>The PL-15E, a Chinese-made air-to-air missile, was recently deployed by the Pakistan Air Force during a skirmish with India in Kashmir, marking its first combat test. This event highlights the growing capabilities of China's air-to-air missile systems and their potential impact on regional security in the Asia-Pacific, especially concerning Taiwan. While assessing the missile's performance has been challenging due to conflicting claims, its deployment sparks discussions about expanding air-to-air missile exports as China aims to challenge the Western-dominated global arms market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international research team has conducted an extensive genetic analysis tracing the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas. The study reveals that Native Americans descended from Asian populations, specifically from the West Beringian region. Early migrants to South America formed isolated groups due to environmental conditions. This research, led by the GenomeAsia 100K consortium, offers insights into disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations, who have faced significant population declines. Archaeological evidence suggests this migration occurred at least 23,000 years ago, with human presence confirmed at the southern tip of South America by 14,500 years ago.</p>

Meanwhile, King Charles' personal wealth has increased, making him richer than his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II. The Hinduja family tops the list for the fourth consecutive year, despite a decline in their fortune. The decrease in billionaires is attributed to various tax changes, including the abolition of non-dom status, which has angered affluent individuals and prompted concerns about the UK's attractiveness to the world's super-rich.</p>

          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April as investors sought refuge from U.S. markets following President Trump's trade policies. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen worth of equities and long-term bonds, marking the largest net inflows since 1996. This shift was driven by institutional investors diversifying away from the U.S. due to concerns about trade uncertainties. As the U.S. softens its trade stance and strikes deals, confidence in U.S. assets is returning, potentially impacting the appeal of Japanese assets. (not investment advice)</p>
