          <p>A Beijing-based think tank, the Grandview Institution, proposes that China and the US establish a security dialogue mechanism to mitigate conflict risks in the South China Sea. The report, prepared in collaboration with the Pacific Forum, highlights confrontational dynamics in aerial and maritime interactions. Researchers Liu Xiaobo and Sophie Wushuang Yi advocate for institutionalized dialogue focusing on regional security architecture, maritime legal order, and crisis response protocols. Despite the risks, the report suggests that competition in the area remains manageable, albeit prolonged. </p>

          <p>India is seeking to tap into its rare earth reserves to reduce reliance on China, which currently dominates the rare earth elements (REEs) market. Indian officials are exploring how Indian Rare Earths (IREL) can increase rare earth magnet production, following China's restrictions on exports. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal views this as a "wake-up call" and an opportunity for India to provide an alternative supply. McLarty Associates' Geoffrey Pyatt emphasizes the potential for deepened U.S.-India collaboration on this issue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Coffee's global consumption is deeply embedded in culture, colonialism, and even rebellion, with approximately two billion cups consumed daily. Originating in Ethiopia, coffee ceremonies and traditions vary widely, from the Ethiopian roasting rituals to Turkey's coffee ground readings. Unique flavors and preparations include Nordic coffee cheese, Vietnamese egg coffee, and Indonesia's kopi luwak. Cafes have historically served as centers for social and political discourse, while modern coffeehouses offer a "third place" for work and relaxation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to tariffs imposed by the United States, China is encouraging the use of domestic letters of credit (L/Cs) to help exporters target the home market. Domestic L/Cs function similarly to international ones, ensuring payment security and enhancing credit for Chinese firms. These L/Cs, issued by major Chinese banks, typically have a payment period of one year and can be used for both goods and services. This initiative aims to mitigate the impact of trade tensions by boosting domestic sales.</p>

          <p>Japan hopes to secure special treatment in its tariff deal with the United States, according to Tokyo's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa. This expectation follows U.S. President Donald Trump's indication of a potential rise in import levies on cars. Akazawa's visit to Washington marks his fourth in as many weeks, aiming to advance talks before a potential meeting between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump. Japan is seeking concessions on auto tariffs and the removal of other sector-based tariffs.</p>
