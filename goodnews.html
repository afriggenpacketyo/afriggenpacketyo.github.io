          <p>Chelsea secured a 2-1 victory over Palmeiras to advance to the Club World Cup semi-finals, but the match was highlighted by a goal from their own future star. Eighteen-year-old Brazilian phenom Estevao Willian, recently signed by Chelsea in a deal worth up to £52m, scored a brilliant equalizer for Palmeiras in his final game before his transfer. Despite his impressive performance, a late own goal from Palmeiras sent Chelsea through. The match served as an exciting preview of the young talent set to join the London club.</p>

          <p>The Hamas militant group has announced a "positive response" to the latest ceasefire proposal, which was mediated by the United States and presented by Qatari and Egyptian officials. The group stated it is prepared to enter negotiations to implement the framework, a development President Trump called "very positive" and expressed optimism about. The proposed deal reportedly includes a two-month ceasefire, though Israeli sources indicated they had not yet fully committed. The war, which began after the October 7, 2023 attacks, has resulted in over 57,000 Palestinian deaths according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.</p>

          <p>Iconic Britpop band Oasis performed their first concert in 16 years, launching a highly anticipated reunion tour in Cardiff, Wales. Brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher, whose feuding led to the band's split in 2009, took the stage together before a crowd of over 60,000 fans. The two-hour set was packed with classic hits from their 1990s albums, including "Wonderwall" and "Champagne Supernova," sparking massive sing-alongs. While the brothers kept their distance for much of the show, their performance marked a momentous occasion for fans worldwide.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was awarded the Order of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, the Caribbean nation's highest civilian honor, during a two-day state visit. This marks the first time a foreign leader has received the award, symbolizing the deep historical ties between the two countries, which date back to the arrival of indentured Indian laborers in 1845. The visit focused on strengthening strategic partnerships in sectors like energy and health. Modi also announced that citizens of Indian origin in the nation would now be eligible for Overseas Citizen of India cards.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are maintaining their trade deadline plans despite a knee injury to third baseman Max Muncy. While the initial injury appeared severe, Muncy only suffered a bone bruise and is expected to return in approximately six weeks, leaving him time to recover before the playoffs. General Manager Brandon Gomes stated the team is content to rely on internal options to fill the position in the interim. The front office believes it can weather Muncy's absence without making a desperate trade, given his expected return and the team's current strong performance.</p>

          <p>Beaches in the Far Rockaway area of Queens, New York, were temporarily closed on the Fourth of July after multiple sharks were spotted swimming dangerously close to the shore. The city's emergency management agency used drones to monitor the sharks' activity and ensure public safety, with lifeguards clearing swimmers from the water. The sightings occurred just days after New York state officials announced enhanced shark surveillance measures for the holiday weekend. The beaches were reopened after about an hour once the immediate danger had passed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prompted by a UK politician's recent emotional appearance, this article examines the evolving perceptions of crying at work. While traditional views often label workplace tears as unprofessional or a sign of weakness, many career coaches and executives now argue it can demonstrate emotional intelligence and humanity. The piece includes anecdotes from both men and women who have cried at work due to stress, frustration, or personal issues. It concludes that while some bias may still exist, a single emotional moment is unlikely to derail a career in modern workplaces that increasingly value authenticity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research highlights the crucial role of tiny marine animals called zooplankton in mitigating climate change. These creatures engage in an epic migration in the Southern Ocean, gorging on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface before sinking deep into the ocean to hibernate. By burning their fat stores in the deep ocean, they effectively lock away vast amounts of carbon that would otherwise enter the atmosphere. Scientists estimate this process sequesters as much carbon as the annual emissions of 55 million cars, making these overlooked animals unsung heroes of the planet.</p>

          <p>This article details the surprising story of Bishara Bahbah, a Palestinian-American professor from Arizona who has become a key backchannel negotiator between Hamas and the Trump administration. After being contacted by a senior Hamas official in April, Dr. Bahbah has been in Qatar, relaying messages to help secure a ceasefire and hostage release. His involvement, facilitated by his connections as president of "Arab-Americans for Trump," reportedly played a role in the "good faith" release of an Israeli-American hostage in May. The story showcases an unusual and informal diplomatic effort running parallel to official channels.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has voiced strong support for a decade-old proposal from Warren Buffett to curb the national deficit. Buffett's idea, stated in a 2011 interview, was to pass a law making all sitting members of Congress ineligible for reelection if the federal deficit exceeds 3% of GDP. Musk reposted a clip of the interview, writing "100% This is the way," endorsing the blunt accountability measure. The idea has gained renewed traction among fiscal conservatives and frustrated taxpayers as a simple, if radical, solution to Washington's recurring budget shortfalls. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A same-sex pair of male Humboldt penguins, named Scampi and Flounder, are successfully raising a chick at the Chester Zoo in the United Kingdom. Zoo experts entrusted the pair with one of two eggs laid by another penguin couple to increase the chances of both chicks surviving. The zoo reports that Scampi and Flounder are proving to be excellent parents, sharing incubation and feeding duties for the young chick. The event highlights a bumper breeding year for the vulnerable species at the zoo and adds to a growing number of documented same-sex penguin parenting examples.</p>
