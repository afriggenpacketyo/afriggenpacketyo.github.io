          <p>Authorities in Atlanta arrested a man at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport who had allegedly threatened to commit a mass shooting. The suspect's family alerted police after he streamed on social media that he was heading to the airport with an assault rifle to "shoot it up." Police apprehended the 49-year-old man, a felon with known mental health challenges, as he was reportedly returning to his truck to retrieve the weapon. An AR-15 with 27 rounds of ammunition was found in his vehicle. Officials praised the family's intervention and the swift police collaboration for preventing a potential tragedy at the world's busiest airport.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola's third-quarter earnings and revenue surpassed Wall Street expectations, yet the company noted that consumer demand for its beverages remains weak. The beverage giant reported an adjusted earnings per share of 82 cents on $12.41 billion in adjusted revenue, slightly above analyst forecasts. While global unit case volume saw a modest 1% increase, key markets like North America and Latin America remained flat, suggesting that lower-income consumers are still hesitant to spend. The company's water, sports, coffee, and tea segments drove the volume growth, while its flagship sparkling soft drinks saw no change and its juice segment declined.</p>

          <p>The Toronto Blue Jays have advanced to the World Series for the first time since their back-to-back championship wins in 1992 and 1993. They will face the Los Angeles Dodgers, who are aiming to become the first team to win consecutive titles in 25 years. Toronto secured home-field advantage by finishing the regular season with one more win than Los Angeles. The series marks a significant moment for Canadian baseball, bringing the championship event north of the border after a 32-year absence. The Dodgers enter as a formidable opponent, backed by a high payroll and dominant postseason performance.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Ants Architecturally Adapt Nests to Mitigate Disease Spread</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 07:13:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that black garden ants actively redesign their nests to reduce the transmission of deadly pathogens, a concept termed "architectural immunity." When exposed to a lethal fungus, the ants build more compartmentalized and less interconnected nests with entrances spaced farther apart, effectively creating a form of social distancing. These structural modifications complement their known behavioral changes, such as self-isolation by infected individuals, to protect the colony's most valuable members, like the queen and nurses. Scientists suggest these findings could offer inspiration for designing human public spaces that better balance functionality with disease prevention.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced a plan to boost business growth by reducing administrative burdens, which she claims will save firms nearly £6 billion annually. The reforms include simplifying the corporate merger process and removing requirements for small businesses to submit extensive reports to Companies House. Speaking at an investment summit, Reeves positioned the measures as key to making the UK a more attractive destination for global capital. The plan also includes potential temporary exemptions from regulation for new AI software to foster rapid development and commercialization, aiming for a pro-worker and pro-business economic environment.</p>

          <p>General Motors has increased its 2025 financial forecast after reporting third-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street estimates and lowering its projected costs from tariffs. The automaker announced an adjusted earnings per share of $2.80 on revenue of $48.59 billion, beating expectations. In response, GM raised its full-year adjusted earnings guidance to between $12 billion and $13 billion. However, the company's net income fell by 57% compared to the previous year, largely due to a $1.6 billion charge related to its strategic pullback from all-electric vehicles, as profitability in the EV sector is taking longer than anticipated to achieve.

          <p>Virginia's 2nd Congressional District is becoming a key battleground, with six Democratic candidates now vying to unseat Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans. The district, which includes Virginia Beach and has a large military and federal employee population, is considered highly competitive and sensitive to issues like the recent government shutdown. Democrats view Kiggans as one of the most vulnerable incumbents, making the seat a top target for flipping in the next election. The latest entrant, physician Dr. Nila Devanath, joins a crowded primary field of candidates hoping to capitalize on the district's swing-state nature and challenge Kiggans' conservative record.</p>

          <p>The German government has placed an order for 20 Eurofighter Typhoon jets, one of the world's most advanced combat aircraft, to be delivered between 2031 and 2034. Manufactured by a consortium including Airbus, the Eurofighter is known for its high speed, maneuverability, and advanced weaponry and sensor systems. The jet can reach Mach 2.0 at altitude and is constructed with minimal metal, making it difficult to detect on radar. Airbus CEO Mike Schoellhorn stated that the acquisition will mark a new technological era for the German Air Force and enhance its capabilities as a NATO member.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists report that the population of the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale has grown slightly for the fourth consecutive year, reaching an estimated 384 individuals. This slow but encouraging recovery follows a significant decline in the previous decade due to ship collisions and entanglement in fishing gear. Researchers credit conservation efforts, particularly new protective measures in Canadian waters, for the positive trend. While the population remains fragile, there are also promising signs of improved reproduction, with several new mother whales giving birth this year, offering cautious optimism for the species' future survival.</p>

          <p>Following last week's significant rainfall, parts of Southern California could see more light precipitation this week, with a small chance of thunderstorms. The National Weather Service forecasts a 10% chance of rain for Los Angeles County on Tuesday night, primarily affecting interior valleys and mountain areas. Meteorologists noted a slight risk of dry lightning in some mountain regions, which occurs when rain evaporates before hitting the ground. However, they emphasized that the overall chance of storms is low and that last week's soaking has temporarily reduced the immediate fire danger in the region.</p>

          <p>Staff at the Sequoia Park Zoo in Eureka, California, were surprised to find a wild American black bear inside the facility before opening hours. The bear was observed on a trail, peering into the habitat of the zoo's three resident black bears and interacting with them through the fencing. The wild bear, described as "very polite," did not act aggressively and stayed on the designated paths. Officials from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife were called to safely guide the curious visitor out of the zoo and back into the adjacent wooded park from which it is believed to have come.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition in Los Angeles, co-organized by the Museum of Contemporary Art, is displaying nearly a dozen removed Confederate monuments to confront America's history of slavery and racial injustice. The show, titled "Monuments," juxtaposes the defaced and graffiti-covered statues with works by contemporary artists that elicit emotionally charged responses to the ongoing culture wars. The exhibition gains urgency as the Trump administration begins reinstalling some of these memorials. One featured piece is a statue of Gen. Stonewall Jackson that artist Kara Walker physically deconstructed and reassembled, transforming a symbol of the Confederacy into a violent and challenging new form.</p>
