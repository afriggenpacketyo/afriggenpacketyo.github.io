          <p>Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Allen, Texas, emerged as the winner of the 100th Scripps National Spelling Bee, securing over $50,000 in prizes. Zaki, who was a favorite and last year's runner-up, triumphed after a dramatic final round against Sarv Dharavane and Sarvadnya Kadam, who both misspelled their words, setting up another round between the three. In the final showdown, Zaki correctly spelled "√©claircissement" to win the bee. The competition, held just outside Washington, D.C., began with 243 young spellers who qualified through local and regional bees. The victory marks the 110th champion due to ties in previous years.</p>

          <p>Kell Morris, an Alaska man, survived after being pinned face down in an icy creek by a 700-pound boulder for three hours, sustaining only minor injuries. His wife, Jo Roop, a retired Alaska State Trooper, kept his head above water while awaiting rescue. A sled dog tourism company provided helicopter assistance, enabling rescuers to reach the remote location. It took seven men and inflatable airbags to lift the boulder, and Morris was airlifted to a hospital, where he spent two nights for observation. Morris attributes his survival to luck and his wife's quick thinking, and he plans to stick to established trails in the future.</p>

          <p>China has agreed to begin procedures to resume imports of Japanese seafood, lifting a ban imposed after the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. The two nations have agreed on "technical requirements for the resumption of seafood exports" to China. Japan will continue to seek the removal of remaining restrictions on food imports from 10 Japanese prefectures, including Fukushima, imposed after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. It may take a few months for shipments to begin, as the registration process must be completed and the products must pass radiation checks.</p>

          <p>The coastal rail line connecting Orange and San Diego counties is expected to resume service on June 7 after nearly six weeks of reinforcement work to address landslides and coastal erosion. Crews placed 5,900 tons of large boulders along the rail and will place up to 240,000 cubic yards of sand between Mariposa and North beaches. The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) is also preparing to construct a 1,400-foot-long catchment beside the rail. The OCTA acknowledged the recurring interruptions to passenger rail service due to eroding bluffs, noting that the rail line has operated largely uninterrupted for more than 125 years.</p>
