          <p>Karin Prien, post-World War II Germany's first Jewish federal cabinet member, is using her position as Minister for Education, Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth to combat rising antisemitism. Prien, born in the Netherlands to Holocaust survivors, aims to promote democratic values and Jewish identity as integral parts of German society. She advocates for Holocaust education to expand beyond atrocities to include the history of Israel and the contributions of Jewish Germans, emphasizing that Jewish people are not only victims but also active members of society, and that young Jews should stay in Germany.</p>

          <p>Indiana native John Mellencamp expressed his embarrassment over Pat McAfee's speech that riled up Pacers fans during Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals. McAfee took shots at celebrity Knicks fans, which Mellencamp felt was poor sportsmanship and not in line with "Hoosier Hospitality." Mellencamp apologized on behalf of most Hoosiers for the behavior, while McAfee's words did not ultimately haunt the Pacers as they secured a 3-1 series lead. The Knicks now face the challenge of winning the next three games to advance to the NBA Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Credit card debt forgiveness, often synonymous with debt settlement, offers borrowers a potential reduction of 30% to 50% of their balance. To qualify, borrowers typically need a minimum debt balance between $5,000 and $10,000, be behind on payments, and demonstrate financial hardship. While credit card debt forgiveness can occur through negotiated debt settlement, bankruptcy, or debt management programs, having a debt settlement agreement in place is essential. Borrowers should research various debt relief companies to find the criteria easiest to qualify for and make informed decisions to regain financial freedom. (not investment advice)</p>
