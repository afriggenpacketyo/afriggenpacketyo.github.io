        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>West Ham United has appointed Nuno Espirito Santo as their new head coach after sacking Graham Potter just eight months into his tenure. The decision followed a poor start to the season, with the team in 19th place after securing only three points from their first five Premier League games. The club's board stated that results had not met expectations and a change was necessary to improve their standing. Nuno, previously with Nottingham Forest, is expected to take charge before their next match against Everton.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study from Mass General Brigham indicates that daily consumption of cocoa extract could help slow down age-related inflammation in older adults. Researchers tracked nearly 600 adults around 70 years old for two years, finding that those taking 500 milligrams of cocoa extract experienced a significantly slower increase in a key inflammatory blood marker compared to a placebo group. While the findings are promising for potentially reducing the risk of diseases like cardiovascular disease, experts caution that more research is needed and supplements should not replace a healthy lifestyle.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto has rapidly strengthened into a major Category 4 storm over the Atlantic Ocean, with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph. As of Saturday morning, the storm was located northeast of the Leeward Islands and is forecast to continue strengthening over the weekend. The National Hurricane Center has not issued any coastal watches or warnings for the U.S., though it is one of two systems being monitored that could have downstream impacts on the Southeast coast. A second system near the Caribbean is expected to become a tropical storm and approach the Bahamas.</p>

          <p>"The Rocky Horror Picture Show" is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, with its legacy kept alive by dedicated fan groups and "shadowcast" performers around the world. Groups like the Michigan Rocky Horror Preservation Society continue the tradition of acting out the film live in theaters while it plays on screen, complete with audience callbacks. For many fans, the experience has evolved from a simple cult movie screening into a vital, inclusive community and a safe space, particularly for neurodivergent and queer individuals. This unique form of immersive entertainment has provided a sense of belonging for five decades.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 06:07:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is pushing for an ambitious youth migration agreement with the European Union, hoping it will improve the country's economic outlook ahead of the autumn Budget. Reeves argues that an exchange scheme for workers aged 18-30 would stimulate growth and wants the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to factor its potential positive impact into its forecasts. If the OBR agrees, a more optimistic forecast could reduce the need for politically difficult spending cuts or tax increases to fill a potential multi-billion-pound fiscal gap. The proposal faces criticism from conservatives who view it as a partial return to freedom of movement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Columnist Reflects on Authenticity After Actors Reveal Pressure to Change 'Ethnic' Names</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion column reflects on the importance of authenticity in Hollywood, sparked by recent revelations from Leonardo DiCaprio and Benicio del Toro about early career pressure to adopt less "ethnic" stage names. DiCaprio was advised to become "Lenny Williams," while an agent suggested "Benny Del" for del Toro. The article uses a fictional fable about an aspiring actor who constantly changes his appearance to fit in, only to be told that the key to success is to be himself. The columnist concludes that both actors made the right choice by retaining their names, underscoring the value of individuality over conformity.</p>

          <h2>Cardiologists Explain the 'Thumb Test' and Its Potential Link to Aortic Aneurysms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 05:16:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A simple self-check known as the "thumb test" could offer a clue about one's risk for an aortic aneurysm. The test involves placing your thumb across your flat palm; if it extends beyond the edge, it may indicate joint laxity associated with connective tissue diseases like Marfan syndrome, which weaken blood vessel walls. However, cardiologists caution that the test is not a diagnostic tool, as many healthy people can have a "positive" result, and most aneurysm patients have a "negative" one. They advise that a positive test should prompt a conversation with a doctor about proper screening through imaging.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The American state fair, a beloved seasonal tradition, has evolved significantly from its 19th-century origins as a showcase for agriculture and livestock. The first state fair, held in Syracuse, New York, in 1841, centered on farming competitions, a core element that remains today. Over the decades, fairs have transformed into massive events incorporating arts and crafts, live music, and a vast array of amusement rides and novelty fried foods. This blend of tradition and entertainment continues to draw large crowds, contributing an estimated $30 billion to the U.S. economy annually while preserving a space for local culture.</p>

          <p>A specialized UK Ministry of Defence unit has identified the remains of two Scottish soldiers, Lance Corporal Gordon McPherson and Lieutenant James Grant Allan, who were killed in the 1915 Battle of Loos. Their bodies were discovered among more than 100 others at a construction site in northern France in 2021. Investigators used regimental artifacts, including unusual tramway buttons found with one soldier, and historical records to narrow down the identities before confirming them with DNA from living relatives. The soldiers were laid to rest with full military honors this week, bringing closure to their families.</p>
