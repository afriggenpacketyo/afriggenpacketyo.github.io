Two individuals were exposed to the substance, but officials reported no immediate threat to the public and no known injuries. The FBI is now investigating the incident and has sent the envelopes to its laboratory in Quantico for further analysis, while noting the building has recently been a site of protests.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy grew by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing economists' forecasts despite facing significant trade headwinds from U.S. tariffs. The growth was primarily driven by strong net exports, which contributed positively to the GDP. This resilience comes even as the nation's key automobile sector contended with 25% duties from the U.S. during the quarter. While the Bank of Japan has upgraded its forecast, it remains cautious about the impact of global trade policies on future economic performance. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll found that two-thirds of Americans believe expectations for tipping have grown in recent years, though few view this as a positive development. For many, tipping is a way to show appreciation or supplement service workers' income, but a significant portion sees it as an additional, often unwelcome, cost. This sentiment appears linked to broader concerns about rising prices and the cost of living that have been prevalent across various income levels.</p>

The campaign aims to educate people about potential dangers, such as botched surgeries, and urges them to consult UK doctors and secure proper insurance before traveling for treatments. This initiative is part of a broader effort to protect patients and reduce the burden on the NHS, which often has to address complications from procedures gone wrong abroad.</p>

          <p>Eleven Madison Park, the three-Michelin-star New York restaurant that famously went fully plant-based in 2021, is reintroducing animal products to its menu. Chef Daniel Humm cited a desire for inclusion and business challenges, noting a decline in private event bookings and wine sales since the transition. The move marks a significant reversal from Humm's previous stance that luxury dining needed to evolve beyond meat for sustainability, highlighting the commercial difficulties of high-end vegan cuisine.</p>

          <p>A new AI-driven tool called DeepEditor is transforming foreign language film dubbing by digitally altering actors' lip movements to match the new dialogue, creating a more seamless viewing experience. Developed by the company Flawless, the technology is intended to help international films overcome the "language hurdle" in markets like the U.S., where audiences often dislike traditional dubbing or subtitles. The system has already been used on a Swedish sci-fi film for its U.S. theatrical release, potentially opening up wider distribution for non-English language cinema.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors not to exit the market even if it appears "frothy," arguing that there are enough strong, rational stock stories to balance out the irrational speculation. He contrasted the current environment with the dot-com bubble, stating that today's market is different because legitimate companies like Amazon and Eli Lilly are making substantive moves. He pointed to the explosive gains of some recent IPOs as irrational froth but insisted that these should not deter investment in fundamentally sound companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As economic growth slows and spending in major Chinese cities becomes more cautious, consumers in smaller, lower-tier cities and counties are becoming a key engine for consumption. With lower living costs and faster income growth, residents in these areas exhibit stronger purchasing power and greater willingness to spend on a wide range of goods. This trend represents a significant shift, tapping into a previously overlooked market that is crucial for China's goal of transitioning to a consumption-driven economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The Maryland-based judge ruled that the Department of Education's guidance, which broadly interpreted a Supreme Court ruling on admissions, represented an unlawful "sea change" in regulation without following proper procedure. This decision is a significant victory for educational and civil rights groups who argued the memos constituted government censorship.</p>
