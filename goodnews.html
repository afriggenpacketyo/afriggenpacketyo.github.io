          <p>Hamas has reportedly issued a "positive response" to the most recent U.S.-mediated ceasefire proposal aimed at ending the conflict with Israel. The group stated its readiness to enter negotiations to implement the framework, a development President Trump described as optimistic. An Israeli delegation is expected to travel to Qatar for further talks, although Israel has not yet formally committed to the terms. The proposal follows a nearly 21-month war that began with Hamas's attack on October 7, 2023, and has resulted in over 57,000 Palestinian deaths, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the British Grand Prix, narrowly beating McLaren's Oscar Piastri on his final qualifying lap. The session was intensely competitive, with McLaren's Lando Norris finishing third and Mercedes' George Russell fourth, all separated by fractions of a second. Lewis Hamilton placed fifth for Mercedes, expressing that a slight mistake in the final corner cost him a potential front-row start. The results set the stage for a highly anticipated race, with Verstappen noting the car's low-downforce setup made navigating Silverstone's high-speed corners particularly challenging but ultimately successful.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as the most significant event in world history since the birth of Christ, arguing it created the concept of a "citizen." He emphasized that the nation was born from deep division and bloody civil war, a context he believes makes its founding ideals even more inspiring. Burns asserted that understanding the founders' complexities and flaws is crucial for appreciating their achievements. He advocated for history that embraces complexity, arguing it provides a necessary lifeline and perspective for navigating the divisions of the present day.</p>

          <p>Actress Charlize Theron recently shared her decision to raise her children as a single parent, citing her own experiences with a tumultuous family dynamic and a tendency to lose herself in romantic relationships. Speaking on a podcast, Theron explained she realized she was not equipped to have children with a partner and that being a single mother was the healthier choice for her. Relationship experts support her decision, framing it as a sign of strength, self-awareness, and alignment with her personal values. They note that with greater financial independence, more women are choosing to prioritize their well-being and break unhealthy cycles.</p>

          <p>England and Wales face a significant challenge at the Women's Euro 2025, having been drawn into what experts are calling the "toughest group of all." Group D also includes international powerhouses France and the Netherlands, meaning three of the four teams are ranked in the world's top 11. Statistical analysis suggests a 37% chance that the tournament winner will emerge from this group. While England are defending champions and the Netherlands won in 2017, France boasts an impressive winning streak, and Wales aims to prove itself as a competitive underdog in its first major tournament appearance.</p>

          <p>A so-called "cortisol cocktail" has gone viral on social media, with proponents claiming the alcohol-free drink can lower the stress hormone cortisol. The beverage typically combines coconut water, orange juice, lemon, magnesium powder, and sea salt. However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence that these ingredients can reduce cortisol levels. Endocrinologists note that cortisol is a necessary hormone and that doctors rarely aim to lower it outside of specific medical conditions like Cushing's Syndrome. While the drink is likely harmless for most and can aid hydration, it is not a proven stress-reduction tool.</p>

          <p>A prototype of the MingKwai, a revolutionary Chinese typewriter invented by linguist Lin Yutang in the 1940s, has been discovered after being lost for decades. The machine is a crucial artifact in the history of modern Chinese computing, as its design principles prefigured key concepts used in digital input methods today. Instead of phonetics, the typewriter organizes thousands of Chinese characters by their component shapes, allowing a typist to find them via a "magic eye" screen. Now housed at Stanford University, the discovery highlights an early, globalist vision for integrating complex non-alphabetic languages into modern technology.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, Parisians are legally swimming in the Seine River after a century-long ban due to pollution was officially lifted. The milestone follows a $1.5 billion cleanup project tied to the Olympics, which has successfully brought the river's water quality up to European standards on most days. On Saturday, Mayor Anne Hidalgo joined eager residents in taking a plunge in designated swimming areas near the Eiffel Tower. The event marks the fulfillment of a long-held dream for the city and offers a new way for people to cool off amid rising summer temperatures.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Oregon State University's Chapple Big Fish Lab are working to change the public's negative perception of sharks while studying their crucial role in marine ecosystems. The research team, led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, studies hundreds of sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay. By temporarily capturing sharks and examining their stomach contents, scientists can assess the animals' health, which serves as a key indicator of the overall health of the ocean. Despite the importance of this research, scientists say it has been challenging to secure financial support due to the persistent fear and misunderstanding surrounding these creatures.</p>

          <h2>Happiness Researcher Advocates '90-Second Rule' for Managing Negative Emotions</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google executive and happiness researcher, promotes a "90-second rule" to better handle anger and stress. Based on neuroscientific findings, the rule acknowledges that the physiological response to an emotional trigger, like a surge of cortisol, lasts about 90 seconds. After that, any continued feeling of anger is a choice sustained by replaying the negative thought. Gawdat advises allowing yourself that initial 90 seconds to feel the emotion, and then consciously choosing to shift your focus. This practice, he argues, empowers individuals to recover more quickly from life's upsets and regain control over their emotional state.</p>

          <p>An Emory University professor shares how dedicating a year to trying 17 different hobbies fundamentally changed her life for the better. Inspired by the hobby-centric culture in Denmark, she experimented with activities ranging from pickleball to woodworking, which helped her kick a doomscrolling habit and feel less lonely. She found that engaging in hobbies forced her to set better boundaries between work and personal life, and it deepened her connections with others. The experience transformed her definition of self-care from passive appointments to active, joyful pursuits, ultimately making her more confident and fulfilled.</p>

          <p>Florida continues to be the most popular state for retirees, attracting the highest net inflow of residents aged 60 and over in 2023, according to a new study. The state saw a net gain of over 44,500 older residents, drawn by its sunny weather and tax-friendly policies, including no state income tax on Social Security benefits or other retirement income. In contrast, California experienced the largest net loss of retirees. While Florida's net migration was down from the previous year, it still more than doubled the intake of the second most popular state, North Carolina, solidifying its status as a retirement haven.
