          <h2>Dodgers to Maintain Trade Deadline Strategy Despite Max Muncy's Knee Injury</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 22:27:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are not planning to alter their trade deadline strategy despite an injury to third baseman Max Muncy. Initially feared to be a season-ending injury, Muncy was diagnosed with a bone bruise and is expected to miss approximately six weeks. The team's management expressed relief that the injury was not as severe as it appeared, giving Muncy ample time to return before the playoffs. The Dodgers will rely on internal options like Tommy Edman to cover third base in the interim, avoiding a desperate search for an external replacement.</p>

          <p>Several beaches in Queens, New York City, were temporarily closed on the Fourth of July after multiple shark sightings occurred dangerously close to shore. The sightings, reported in the Far Rockaway area, prompted immediate action from city officials to ensure the safety of holiday beachgoers. Authorities utilized drone technology and lifeguards to monitor the situation, and the beaches were reopened after about an hour. New York officials had previously announced increased shark surveillance measures for the holiday weekend to protect the public.</p>

          <p>South Korea and Japan are positioning themselves to compete more aggressively with China in the global shipbuilding industry, particularly as the U.S. targets China's sector. South Korea's new presidential administration has labeled the domestic industry as being in a "major crisis" and has pledged significant support to revitalize it. The government's new policy guide focuses on developing advanced, eco-friendly, and autonomous vessels through improved technology and better working conditions. These measures are intended to re-establish South Korea as a leading maritime power in the face of intense international competition.</p>

          <h2>Indian Artisans and Politicians Criticize Prada for Releasing Footwear Resembling Kolhapuri Sandals</h2>

          <p>Italian luxury brand Prada is facing accusations of cultural appropriation from artisans in India over a new line of footwear that closely resembles traditional Kolhapuri sandals. The controversy has ignited a debate about the recognition and protection of cultural heritage, as local craftspeople struggle with low wages and difficult working conditions. While Prada has since acknowledged the sandals' origins, Indian industry associations are now pushing for better legal protections and a share of the profits for the artisans. The incident highlights a recurring issue where global fashion brands draw inspiration from traditional crafts without compensating or collaborating with the source communities.</p>

          <h2>New Research Reveals Tiny Zooplankton Play a Major Role in Storing Ocean Carbon</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 19:10:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study has uncovered the significant role of tiny marine animals called zooplankton in combating global warming through a massive annual migration. These creatures feast near the surface in Antarctica's Southern Ocean, growing fat before sinking deep into the ocean to hibernate, effectively locking away vast amounts of carbon. This process, known as the seasonal vertical migration pump, is estimated to store as much carbon as the annual emissions of 55 million cars. The findings highlight the underappreciated importance of these small organisms in regulating the global climate, even as they face growing threats.</p>

          <p>A same-sex pair of male Humboldt penguins, named Scampi and Flounder, are raising a chick at the Chester Zoo in the UK. The chick is one of ten born this year in a successful breeding season for the vulnerable species. Zookeepers entrusted one of the eggs to the male pair, who have taken on the shared parenting duties of incubating the egg and feeding the chick. This instance is another example of same-sex animal pairings successfully raising offspring, highlighting a natural behavior that contributes to conservation efforts for at-risk species.</p>

          <p>Hamas has formally submitted what it calls a "positive response" to the latest proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, indicating it is ready to enter negotiations. However, a senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks stated that Hamas has requested several key amendments to the plan. These include a U.S. guarantee that hostilities will not resume if permanent ceasefire talks fail, and changes to how humanitarian aid is distributed. The response now puts the focus back on Israel and the U.S. to determine the next steps in the protracted conflict.</p>

          <p>Germany began its Women's Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory over Poland, thanks to goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller.

Gwinn has a history of two previous ACL injuries, raising significant doubt about her ability to continue in the tournament. The team's performance was solid but not flawless, leaving room for improvement as they prepare to face tougher opponents in their group.</p>
