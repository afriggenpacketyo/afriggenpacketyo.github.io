          <p>The Buss family is reportedly in agreement to sell a majority stake in the Los Angeles Lakers at a $10 billion valuation to Mark Walter, the CEO and chair of TWG Global. Walter, who is already a minority owner in the Lakers and the primary owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Los Angeles Sparks, is set to take majority ownership. Jeanie Buss will remain as governor after the sale, continuing her involvement with the team. The late Jerry Buss bought the Lakers in 1979, transforming it into a prominent and valuable franchise. </p>

          <p>A heat dome is set to bring stifling temperatures and high humidity to a large portion of the United States, with the most severe conditions expected in the Midwest and East Coast. Daytime temperatures are predicted to reach the 90s, with overnight lows only dropping to the mid-70s, making it feel even hotter due to the humidity. The National Weather Service warns of dangerous temperature impacts, particularly in Nebraska, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa, where individuals without effective cooling or sufficient hydration could face health risks. Residents are advised to minimize sun exposure, wear light clothing, stay hydrated, and seek air-conditioned spaces. </p>

          <p>An additional 2.7 million households in Britain will receive ¬£150 off their energy bills this winter as the government expands eligibility for the Warm Home Discount. The qualification criteria regarding property size and home energy score are being removed, allowing more homes, including those with children, to benefit from the extra energy bill assistance. Energy companies will fund the discount, potentially leading to a slight increase in bills for all customers to cover the cost. This expansion follows the government's decision to reinstate the Winter Fuel Payment to most pensioners. </p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of murdering her Boston police officer boyfriend in a retrial, nearly a year after her first trial ended in a mistrial.

Cheers erupted outside the courthouse as the verdict was read, and Read embraced her legal team and cried. A new "20/20" special examines the case, which has been highly publicized and divisive. </p>

The list includes iconic movies such as 'Star Wars,' 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,' 'Batman,' 'Jurassic Park,' and more recent hits like 'The Avengers' and 'Top Gun: Maverick.' These films have collectively grossed over $15 billion during the summer months, demonstrating the enduring appeal of summer movie season.

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved lenacapavir for HIV prevention, a drug with the potential to significantly curb the HIV epidemic. Clinical trial data suggests that just two injections a year provide near-complete protection against HIV infection. The twice-yearly injection offers a more convenient alternative to the current standard of care, a daily pill called Truvada. The drug's high cost, roughly $28,000 a year, could price out many, potentially limiting its reach in countries with the highest HIV burden. </p>

          <p>Experts have weighed in on the potential consequences if the U.S. were to deploy powerful 'bunker buster' bombs on suspected underground nuclear weapons sites in Iran. While these bombs could cause significant damage to facilities like the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, which processes uranium isotopes, the risk of widespread contamination is considered low. Due to the heavy nature of uranium hexafluoride gas, any contamination is likely to remain localized. However, the potential release of hydrofluoric acid, formed when the gas reacts with water, poses a more immediate hazard. </p>
