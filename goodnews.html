          <p>A petroleum analyst predicts that US gasoline prices will be their cheapest since 2021, potentially dropping below $3 a gallon by September. The recent price spike, driven by the Israel-Iran conflict, is expected to be temporary, with prices resuming a slow decline. Factors contributing to the expected drop include the switch to summer-blend gasoline leveling off, increased refinery production, and softening consumer demand after early summer travel peaks. Despite recent volatility, the article notes that, adjusted for inflation, gas prices are near a 20-year low. (not investment advice)</p>

The article praises the film for its fidelity to the sport's technical details while grounding the story in a familiar but effective character study.

          <p>Activists in Budapest are proceeding with the annual Pride march despite threats of "legal consequences" from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The event defies a new "child protection" law that restricts gatherings seen as promoting homosexuality, with attendees facing potential fines and organizers facing prison time. Organizers and participants, including EU officials, are marching to defend LGBTQ rights and promote diversity in the face of increasing pressure from the nationalist conservative government.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City mayoral primary was significantly fueled by the grassroots movement for Palestinian liberation. The author contends that Mamdani's unapologetic support for Palestine, long considered a political liability, resonated with a new coalition of voters, including students and activists organized against the genocide in Gaza. His campaign's success is presented as evidence that Palestine has become a central issue in domestic politics, mobilizing a base that rejects the Democratic establishment's pro-Israel stance. The win is framed as a victory for a people-powered, progressive movement.</p>

          <p>As it turns 20, Reddit is facing a major challenge from AI, which threatens to scrape its vast user-generated conversations for training large language models. The company is fighting back legally, suing AI firm Anthropic for unfair business practices, arguing that its data is being commercially exploited without permission. Simultaneously, Reddit is leveraging its own data by launching "Reddit Answers," an AI tool that generates responses based solely on conversations from its platform. This strategy aims to defend its valuable content while providing users with the simplicity of an AI chatbot.</p>
