        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to end the recruitment of care workers from abroad as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced that firms will be required to hire British nationals or extend visas for overseas workers already in the country. The government expects these changes to result in up to 50,000 fewer lower-skilled visas issued over the next year. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp criticized the plans as insufficient, advocating for an annual migration cap.</p>

The speaker reflects on the violence and slaughter that persist, mirroring the experiences of his mother finding and burying her loved ones among the slain. Kisses are presented as both sealing and opening, closing eyes and opening them, questioning the difference between these acts. Ultimately, the poem suggests that in the meeting of souls, one can glimpse an infinite longing that transcends beginnings and ends.</p>

          <p>British plane parts, including Rolls-Royce engines, are set to be exempted from US import tariffs as part of the evolving trade agreement with the Trump administration. The wider aerospace industry would have ‚Äúa specific guarantee of zero tariffs‚Äù in the agreement. The US is investigating whether imported aircraft and parts represent a threat to national security, which could pave the way for higher tariffs. However, the aerospace and aviation industry has been lobbying the White House to retain a 45-year-old treaty that allowed aircraft and parts to be traded duty-free across borders.</p>
