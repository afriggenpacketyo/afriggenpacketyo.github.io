          <h2>Labour Gains Scottish Seat from SNP in By-Election</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 14:39:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scottish Labour's Davy Russell won the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse constituency from the SNP in a closely contested by-election following the death of SNP MSP Christina McKelvie. Russell secured 8,559 votes, surpassing the SNP by 602 votes, marking a significant victory for Labour and a setback for the SNP, who had held the seat since 2011. The result reflects a shift in voter sentiment and prompts the SNP to reassess their strategies for future elections, with Scottish Constitution Secretary Angus Robertson stating the SNP would need to "look very closely" at the result and "learn the lessons" for the Holyrood elections. Reform UK finished third, with the Tories in fourth, and Prime Minister Keir Starmer congratulated Russell, saying people in Scotland have once again voted for change.</p>

          <p>The article discusses how medical debt can impact your credit score and what steps you can take to manage it. It explains recent changes in credit reporting rules that provide more leniency for medical debt, such as a one-year waiting period before unpaid bills are reported and the exclusion of debts under $500. Strategies for managing medical debt include reviewing and negotiating bills, applying for financial assistance, and considering debt relief programs. Monitoring your credit report is crucial to ensure accuracy and address any errors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>International stocks are currently outperforming U.S. stocks in 2025, with the MSCI ACWI ex-USA index returning 15.7% compared to the S&P 500's 1.5%. This shift is driven by concerns over market volatility in the U.S. and relatively weaker performance compared to global counterparts. Financial professionals suggest diversifying portfolios with foreign stocks to tap into different economic cycles and mitigate U.S.-specific risks. Adding international stocks can provide exposure to unique industries and growth drivers, offering a hedge against domestic market fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Texas Roadhouse is experiencing a rebound in foot traffic and sales, according to UBS analysts, who raised their price target for the stock to $220 per share from $200. UBS estimates a 5% increase in second-quarter to-date same-store sales, which is particularly encouraging given normalizing dining trends. The company is on track to open 30 new restaurants this year, primarily under the Texas Roadhouse banner. Despite beef inflation headwinds, analysts remain optimistic about the company's potential for sustainable outperformance. (not investment advice)</p>

The luxury carmaker, like Volkswagen's Audi, does not produce vehicles in the U.S., making it vulnerable to tariffs. Porsche's finance chief stated that localization made no sense given its low vehicle sales. Volkswagen's Audi brand plans to produce its best-selling models in the U.S., with a location announcement expected this year.</p>

          <p>Alex Warren's song "Ordinary" has achieved its 12th week at number one in the UK, making it the longest chart reign since Ed Sheeran's "Shape of You" in 2017. The song has been streamed 107 million times in the UK and has surpassed Slim Whitman's record for the most consecutive weeks at number one by a US artist. Warren, who gained fame as a founder of the Hype House, wrote the song for his wife after their wedding. Despite its success, changing media habits mean "Ordinary" hasn't become a ubiquitous phenomenon like past long-running hits.</p>
