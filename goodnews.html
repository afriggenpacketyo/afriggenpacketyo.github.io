          <p>Shares of Firefly Aerospace increased by 8% following the announcement that it will acquire defense technology contractor SciTec for $855 million. The space company stated the deal is intended to bolster its national security capabilities by integrating SciTec's software for missile warning, tracking, and defense systems. This move comes shortly after Firefly's stock fell due to a rocket explosion during a ground test, but it reflects the company's continued focus on securing key government and defense contracts. The acquisition is expected to close by year-end. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a widespread push from major corporations for employees to return to the office, work-from-home rates have remained stable since early 2023. Researchers suggest this is due to a "compliance gap," where middle managers are reluctant to enforce strict attendance policies. In response to mandates, workers are adopting forms of passive resistance, such as "coffee badging"—showing up for just a few hours—and "micro-shifting" their work schedules to maintain flexibility. This trend indicates that workers are finding ways to retain the autonomy gained during the pandemic.</p>

CEO Andrew Feldman explained that the company's business has evolved significantly since its initial filing a year ago, necessitating an updated prospectus that reflects its new cloud business and recent $1.1 billion funding round.

          <p>Wales head coach Craig Bellamy has commented on the formidable depth of the English national football team, describing their squad as "ridiculous" ahead of an upcoming friendly match. He highlighted the vast difference in the market value of the two teams' players, comparing the matchup to an unfair boxing promotion. Bellamy noted that England manager Thomas Tuchel can afford to leave top-tier players like Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden out of the squad without diminishing its strength. Despite the disparity, competing against such an opponent serves as key motivation.</p>

          <p>Nike CEO Elliott Hill stated in an interview that the company's strategic turnaround is underway but will "take a while" to restore profitable growth, as its stock has fallen about 12% over the past year. Hill is reversing his predecessor's focus on direct-to-consumer sales, instead rebuilding relationships with wholesale partners to regain lost shelf space. The company is also restructuring internally to focus more on individual sports categories to spur innovation. Despite progress, Hill acknowledged that macroeconomic challenges, including tariffs, will continue to present headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>
