        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple's iPhone exports from India to the U.S. experienced a significant surge of 76% in April, contrasting with a 76% drop in shipments from China, according to Omdia estimates. This shift reflects Apple's strategic adaptation to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic, by investing heavily in Indian supply chains. While India surpassed China in iPhone shipments to the U.S. in March, experts anticipate a slowdown in this growth due to India's limited manufacturing capacity. Analysts also note that this shift primarily involves final assembly, with most sub-assemblies still originating from China, and President Trump has threatened tariffs if iPhones are not manufactured domestically.

          <p>Famed Sherpa guide Kami Rita reached the summit of Mount Everest for a record-breaking 31st time, further solidifying his reputation as "Everest Man." The 55-year-old guide led a group of climbers to the summit early Tuesday morning and descended safely to base camp, according to Seven Summits Treks in Kathmandu. Kami Rita, whose father was also a Sherpa guide, has been climbing Everest since 1994 and has also summited other high-altitude peaks, including K2, Cho Oyu, Manaslu, and Lhotse. Despite the inherent risks, Sherpa guides like Kami Rita are vital to the success and safety of foreign climbers attempting to summit Everest, where two climbers died earlier in May.</p>

          <p>England goalkeeper Mary Earps has announced her retirement from international football just weeks before the Lionesses are set to defend their European Championship title. The 32-year-old Earps made 53 appearances for England over eight years, playing a key role in their Euro 2022 victory and their journey to the 2023 Women's World Cup final. Earps stated that this was the right time for her to step aside and give younger players the opportunity to thrive, while also expressing her support for the team's success in the upcoming Euro 2025. Having recently lost her starting place to Hannah Hampton, Earps was recognized with the Best Fifa Goalkeeper award in both 2022 and 2023.</p>

          <p>KFC plans to invest almost ¬£1.5 billion in the UK and Ireland over the next five years, aiming to create thousands of jobs as it expands its presence in the region. The fast-food chain intends to open 500 new restaurants and upgrade over 200 existing locations, with a focus on building sites and drive-through outlets, especially in the north-west of England. This expansion is expected to generate more than 7,000 new jobs across its UK and Ireland business and supply chain, including restaurant managers, kitchen staff, and guest experience leads. KFC's general manager Rob Swain cited strong demand for fried chicken as the driving force behind this significant investment, estimating the UK fried chicken market to be worth ¬£3.1 billion annually.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap, a policy that prevents most families from claiming means-tested benefits for any third or additional children born after April 2017. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson acknowledged that the policy has pushed people into poverty but cautioned that unwinding it would be costly. The decision is expected to be announced in the autumn when the government publishes its child poverty strategy, which is being led by Phillipson and Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall. Labour's manifesto at the 2024 election stated they would get rid of the cap "when fiscal conditions allow," with Phillipson emphasizing that "nothing is off the table" during the task force's review.</p>

The Merseyside Police, also involved in the Southport case, aimed to avoid similar speculation and unrest by promptly disclosing the suspect's race and nationality.

Meanwhile, Giovanni Reyna needs a fresh start after limited playing time at Dortmund, and Yunus Musah's performances at Milan were inconsistent.</p>

Garber argues that cutting research funding hurts the country, not just Harvard, and that the university is working to address issues on campus, particularly regarding free speech.

          <p>ITV soap *Emmerdale* is highlighting the importance of early detection of cervical cancer through a new storyline in which character Sarah Sugden receives an early-stage diagnosis. The storyline aims to raise awareness about the importance of regular medical check-ups, especially given that cervical cancer often has no warning signs. While the disease is most common in women aged 30-35, the NHS offers routine screening to anyone with a cervix aged 25 to 64, and the storyline aims to encourage greater uptake of these screenings. Other risk factors for cervical cancer include HIV, other sexually transmitted infections, and smoking, with regular screening and HPV vaccination being key to prevention.</p>

Hartley says the garden center work settles him on the field, knowing there is something for him there after cricket, and takes the pressure off a little bit.

This amount represents over 30 percent of the 300,000 tons planned for release through direct sales contracts with major retailers, a change from earlier auction-based releases. Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi stated that contracts with some companies would be finalized soon, with deliveries potentially beginning Thursday, while adding that the government will consider revising eligibility criteria to include smaller supermarkets and rice shops. Supermarket giant Aeon Co. plans to sell the rice in stores from early June at around 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms, aligning with the government's target. (not investment advice)</p>
