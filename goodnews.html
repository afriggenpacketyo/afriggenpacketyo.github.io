          <p>The appearance of a senior Taiwanese officer at a US military exercise in Alaska has sparked interest in Taiwan, suggesting potentially closer defense cooperation with the United States. Major General Wu Chia-hsing, head of the air force's flight training division, observed the Red Flag Alaska 25-2 exercise, which involved 1,500 personnel and 70 aircraft from the US, Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines. Analysts suggest the move indicates the US commitment to its security partners in the region despite previous concerns about transactional approaches. This event underscores the ongoing strategic importance of Taiwan in US foreign policy and defense strategy.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer stated that Kneecap's scheduled performance at Glastonbury Festival is "not appropriate" following terror offense charges against one of the band members. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch also expressed her opposition, urging the BBC not to broadcast Kneecap's performance, given that one member faces charges under the Terrorism Act. The BBC responded that its programming will adhere to editorial guidelines and that decisions about output will be made closer to the festival. The controversy follows a previous discrimination case where Kneecap won against the UK government after Badenoch attempted to block their funding.</p>

The policy change, which could have stripped universities of millions of dollars, was deemed arbitrary and contrary to law. The universities argued the cuts would threaten critical research in areas such as artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. The ruling follows similar blocks on funding caps placed on grants by the Energy Department and the National Institutes of Health.</p>
