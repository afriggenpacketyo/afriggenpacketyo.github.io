          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-09 00:02:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has reformed its civil service summer internship program, restricting applications to individuals from lower socio-economic backgrounds to enhance diversity. The move has been met with mixed reactions from students aspiring to work in public service. While some, like first-generation university student Adam Allen, feel the change gives them a fairer opportunity, others feel unfairly excluded. Students like Nell Ashworth, whose parents are a nurse and a town planner, argue the new criteria are too narrow and could dissuade talented individuals from middle-income, working-class families from pursuing government careers.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have successfully created high-purity hexagonal diamonds in a laboratory, a significant breakthrough detailed in the journal Nature. This type of diamond, first discovered in a meteorite in 1967, has a unique atomic structure that researchers have long struggled to replicate. The Chinese team produced pure hexagonal diamond crystals up to 100 micrometres in size, a notable achievement compared to previous attempts that yielded mixed-phase samples. This success provides definitive proof of the material's macroscopic existence and opens new avenues for materials science research.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders delivered a notable performance in his NFL preseason debut, earning praise from figures like LeBron James. Sanders completed 14 of 23 passes for 138 yards and two touchdowns, leading three scoring drives against the Carolina Panthers. Despite being a fifth-round draft pick and low on the depth chart, his poise and effectiveness have sparked discussion about his future role. Coach Kevin Stefanski acknowledged the strong performance but stated it is too early to make decisions about the quarterback competition.</p>

          <p>Actor Chris Hemsworth has described learning he has a high genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's disease as a significant "gear shift" in his life's motivations. During the filming of his show "Limitless," a genetic test revealed he carries two copies of the APOE4 gene, increasing his likelihood of developing the disorder by eight to ten times. Hemsworth stated the discovery prompted a deeper reflection on his purpose and a greater focus on living well to maximize time with his family. This change in mindset reportedly influenced the more personal and educational approach of the show's second season.</p>

          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is reportedly booming as people seek small morale boosts amid ongoing economic uncertainty. This phenomenon expands on the classic "lipstick effect," where consumers purchase small luxuries like makeup when larger purchases are unaffordable. Today, it also includes spending on larger experiences, like concert tickets, by cutting back on everyday essentials. Analysts suggest this trend is driven by a re-evaluation of personal well-being and the unattainability of traditional life milestones like home ownership for younger generations, who instead celebrate smaller moments.</p>

          <p>A fire broke out inside the historic Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba in southern Spain but was quickly extinguished by firefighters, preventing a major disaster. The blaze reportedly started in a chapel within the Almanzor naves, possibly due to a short circuit in an electrical device. Officials praised the rapid response of the fire crews, who controlled and put out the flames in a short time. The building, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a jewel of Islamic architecture from the 8th century that was converted into a cathedral in the 13th century.</p>

          <p>Actress Gina Carano and Disney have settled a lawsuit regarding her 2021 firing from the series "The Mandalorian" over her controversial social media posts. While settlement details are private, a Lucasfilm statement praised Carano's professionalism and expressed hope for future collaboration. The article argues that while politically motivated corporate actions are a concern, this settlement was the right decision, correcting what it calls an overreaction by Disney. It suggests her firing was an extreme response to posts that, while provocative, were less toxic than much social media content.</p>

          <p>An unexpected political friendship has developed between U.S. Vice President JD Vance, a conservative Republican, and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, a prominent Labour Party figure. Vance is currently on a personal holiday in the UK, staying with Lammy at his official country residence. Despite their vast political differences, the two have bonded over shared experiences of difficult childhoods, their Christian faith, and family life. This personal relationship is seen by analysts as potentially valuable for UK-U.S. relations, especially given the personalized nature of the Trump administration's foreign policy.</p>
