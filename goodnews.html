          <p>A new trade agreement between the United States and the European Union is expected to disproportionately benefit the U.S. while potentially harming the EU's economy. The deal imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, a significant increase, while American goods will face no new tariffs in Europe. Economists have described the pact as "asymmetric and unbalanced," forecasting a reduction in the EU's annual GDP. Despite the negative financial impact, the EU likely agreed to the terms to avoid a more severe trade war and reduce market uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent visit to his golf courses in Scotland provided an unconventional but valuable opportunity for UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to strengthen their diplomatic relationship. The trip, though notionally private, involved very public interactions, including an extended, free-wheeling press conference covering a wide range of global topics. This direct engagement and face time are seen by Downing Street as invaluable for aligning perspectives on key issues like the conflict in Gaza. For Starmer, navigating the president's unpredictable style presents both an opportunity to build rapport and a political risk.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's autonomous driving unit, Waymo, has announced plans to expand its robotaxi service to Dallas, Texas, in 2026. The company will partner with Avis Budget Group, which will manage the fleet of driverless vehicles in the new market. This expansion is part of Waymo's broader strategy to enter several new U.S. cities, including Miami and Washington, D.C. Waymo is currently testing its Jaguar I-PACE electric vehicles in downtown Dallas, and customers will eventually be able to hail rides through the Waymo app, solidifying its position in the autonomous transportation sector.</p>

          <p>Oil prices increased, with both Brent and U.S. crude futures seeing gains, driven by positive developments in international trade and geopolitics. The market reacted favorably to the new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union, which averted a more severe trade war. Additional support for prices came from the possibility of an extended trade truce between the U.S. and China, as well as President Trump's new deadline for Russia to make progress in ending the war in Ukraine, which reignited supply concerns.

          <p>California's state parks department is implementing a new lottery-style drawing system to make it easier for people to reserve campsites at some of the state's most popular locations. The system, which is being rolled out at Malibu Creek, Morro Bay, and McArthur-Burney Falls, aims to provide fairer access to sites that previously sold out within minutes of becoming available. Unsuccessful applicants in a drawing will receive a point, increasing their chances in future lotteries. This change is part of a broader effort to reduce no-shows and improve the reservation experience.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggested that major U.S. trade deals, including the recent agreement with the European Union, failed to spark a market rally because investor focus lies elsewhere. He argued that Wall Street is currently more preoccupied with upcoming Big Tech earnings reports, the Federal Reserve's interest rate meeting, and forthcoming employment data. Cramer noted that investors may be experiencing "tariff ennui," as the pattern of threatening high tariffs followed by a negotiated deal has become predictable, thus muting the market's reaction to such announcements.

One prominent name linked to the team is Minnesota Twins outfielder Harrison Bader, a premium defender who is also having a strong offensive season. While the Dodgers' superstar hitters are expected to rebound, the team recognizes that preventing runs will be crucial for a deep playoff run, making a defensive upgrade a key priority.</p>

          <p>Following the death of Hulk Hogan (Terry Bollea), legal experts are reflecting on the significant impact of his 2016 lawsuit against Gawker Media. The case, in which Hogan was awarded $140 million over the publication of a private sex tape, is seen as a cultural turning point for media law and digital privacy. While it didn't set new legal precedent, it sent a powerful message to media outlets about the limits of First Amendment protections when publishing graphic content. The verdict ultimately bankrupted Gawker and reinforced privacy rights for both celebrities and ordinary people in the internet age.</p>
