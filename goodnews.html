          <p>A former software CEO, Mike Conner, has completed a five-year, multi-million-pound renovation of Thorne Island, a derelict 19th-century Napoleonic fort off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales. After purchasing the abandoned island for £555,000 in 2017, he overcame significant logistical challenges, including having no running water or electricity, to transform it into a luxury off-grid retreat with 40 beds and a nightclub. The historic property, originally built to defend against French naval attacks, is now back on the market for £3 million, with potential to be a unique tourist attraction or private party destination.</p>

          <p>With food prices rising, parents in the UK are sharing creative strategies to manage the extra cost of feeding children during the six-week summer holidays. Many families who rely on subsidized or free school meals during term time face increased financial pressure. Tactics include meticulous planning, freezing reduced "yellow-sticker" items, batch cooking, and organizing daily food rations to prevent snacks from disappearing too quickly. Charities report a significant increase in demand for meal support, highlighting the widespread financial strain many households are experiencing despite nominal wage growth being offset by rising living expenses.</p>

The Gower Mausoleum provides final resting places for approximately 13,000 people and is already partially sold out. The structure is designed with marble, natural light, and views of city landmarks, aiming to provide a peaceful and comfortable space for visitors. This architectural addition reflects the cemetery's evolving role as a cultural hub that also hosts movie nights, concerts, and festivals for the living.</p>

          <p>A collection of anecdotes from people over 50 reveals how many once-normal aspects of high school life would be considered shocking and unacceptable today. The stories highlight a range of problematic practices, including teachers openly bullying students, the common presence of firearms in student vehicles for hunting, and designated smoking areas on school grounds. Other shared experiences include forced gender-specific classes, corporal punishment by principals, and a general lack of seriousness in addressing bullying. These recollections provide a stark contrast between past and present educational and social standards.</p>

          <p>A group of GCSE students in the UK have opened time capsule letters they wrote to their future selves four years ago, as 11-year-olds just returning to school after a COVID-19 lockdown. The letters reveal their anxieties about the pandemic, their hopes for the future, and their personal ambitions, such as one student asking if his future self had a girlfriend yet. The exercise was organized by a teacher to instill motivation during a disruptive and isolating period. Revisiting their younger thoughts provided a moment of reflection for the students on their personal growth and perseverance through a uniquely challenging school experience.</p>

          <p>Twenty-year-old British heavyweight prospect Moses Itauma delivered a powerful statement by stopping veteran Dillian Whyte in the first round of their highly anticipated fight. In his first headline event, Itauma sent Whyte to the canvas with a strong right hand, and the referee waved off the contest just 119 seconds into the bout. The decisive victory extends Itauma's undefeated professional record to 13-0, with 11 of those wins coming by knockout. The performance solidifies his position as a major rising star in the heavyweight division and a potential future title contender.</p>

          <p>Nine prison guards who were held hostage by inmates in Guatemala City for three days have been freed, according to authorities. The riot was initiated by members of the Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha gangs, who were demanding the return of 10 of their leaders from a higher-security facility. This incident followed a similar hostage situation earlier in the week where 11 other guards were also taken and later freed. The events highlight the ongoing power struggles and violence between major gangs within Guatemala's prison system, with one prison official having been killed during the unrest.</p>

          <p>A new box set titled “Sunset Boulevard” chronicles the final burst of studio creativity from Elvis Presley, compiling music he recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975. This period includes his last Top 10 hit, “Burning Love,” and soulful ballads recorded as his marriage was ending. The article revisits this era through the eyes of his friend Jerry Schilling, who believes Presley's career faltered after he was passed over for a role in the 1976 film “A Star Is Born.” The collection offers a poignant look at the King of Rock and Roll's later work, when he was a pioneer grappling with a culture that had evolved beyond him.</p>

          <p>Samsung is regaining ground against Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's declined. This renewed competition is driven by Samsung's innovation in screen technology, particularly its popular Z series of foldable phones, which offer a new form factor compared to the standard iPhone design. While Apple still leads the U.S. market, Samsung's wider range of price points and novel designs are attracting consumers. Analysts suggest Apple may release its own foldable iPhone by 2026 to compete in this growing segment of the premium market. (not investment advice)</p>
