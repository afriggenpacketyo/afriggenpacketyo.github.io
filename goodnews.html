          <p>Rod Stewart has canceled several US concerts due to the flu, ahead of his scheduled performance at the Glastonbury Festival later this month. Stewart expressed his apologies to fans via Instagram, citing his devastation for any inconvenience caused. The canceled dates include shows in Las Vegas and Stateline, Nevada, with two California shows to be rescheduled. Despite scaling back on large-scale tours starting in 2026, Stewart affirmed his readiness to perform at Glastonbury, where he will be the first artist to headline and play the legends slot, performing with his former Faces bandmate Ronnie Wood. The festival's headliners this year include The 1975, Neil Young, and Olivia Rodrigo, and Stewart is scheduled for an hour and a quarter on the Pyramid Stage, though he has requested an extra fifteen minutes.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has granted final approval to a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow colleges and universities to directly pay their athletes, marking a significant shift in college sports. The settlement permits each school to share up to $20.5 million with athletes over the next year, and allocates $2.7 billion to be paid over the next decade to former players previously barred from revenue sharing. Payouts will vary based on the sport and career length, with football and men's basketball players potentially receiving nearly $135,000 each, and the highest payout estimated at nearly $2 million. The agreement resolves three antitrust cases challenging NCAA compensation rules dating back to 2016, and also calls for a clearinghouse to ensure NIL deals are valued at fair market value (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>South Korea's newly elected progressive President Lee Jae-myung is expected to adopt a more cautious approach towards Taiwan and prioritize strengthening economic ties with China. Lee's election follows the impeachment of his predecessor, Yoon Suk-yeol, and signals a potential shift in Seoul's foreign policy. While Yoon emphasized stronger military cooperation with the US and Japan, Lee is likely to focus on improving relations with both China and North Korea. Observers anticipate continuity in trilateral military cooperation with the US and Japan, but expect a more nuanced stance on regional security issues.</p>

The goal is to lift travel bans and restore tourism, which once contributed significantly to Lebanon's economy. While some Gulf countries have lifted travel bans, Saudi Arabia's decision is still pending, and the country is also in talks with the IMF for a recovery plan to address corruption and improve public services.</p>

          <p>While tech billionaires focus on extending lifespan through technology, life expectancy is declining in some high-income countries. The emphasis on personal responsibility for health distracts from the importance of public policy, infrastructure, and community in affecting health chances and longevity. In places where people live longer, healthier lives, such as Japan and South Korea, healthy living is normalized by government and culture. Achieving longevity requires a collective responsibility, including policies that promote nutritious food, active cities, clean air, preventive healthcare, and public provision of water, which should be at the core of what a government provides its citizens.</p>

          <p>A man in southern England discovered that his father had been swapped at birth in a hospital nearly 80 years ago, after noticing discrepancies in his family history and DNA matches. The man's father, who had brown eyes and black hair, looked nothing like his blue-eyed, blond-haired parents, leading to a running joke in the family. The discovery was made possible through DNA testing and genealogy databases, revealing that another baby boy had been registered at the same hospital on the same day with a similar surname. The incident highlights the rare but increasingly uncovered cases of babies being accidentally switched in maternity wards before the implementation of modern identification practices.</p>

This event is potentially advantageous for the UK as it seeks its own trade agreement with the US, and having the American principals in London could provide opportunities for sideline discussions.</p>
