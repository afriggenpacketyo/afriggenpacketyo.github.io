          <p>Former professional boxer Duke Tanner, who received clemency from President Trump and a subsequent pardon, shares his experiences with the criminal justice system. Tanner, who served 16 years for drug trafficking, reflects on his time in prison, his dedication to Christianity, and his efforts to rehabilitate himself. He recounts the dream that led him to write letters to the White House, ultimately resulting in his release. Tanner also touches on the possibility of a pardon for Sean "Diddy" Combs, emphasizing the importance of due process and accountability within the criminal justice system. He highlights the need for clemency for others who deserve a second chance, while contrasting his situation with Hunter Biden's pardon. The discussion is centered on the topic of clemency, not the direct promotion of financial instruments. </p>

While relations improved under Lee's predecessor, Japanese officials are monitoring for any shifts in South Korea's stance on wartime history issues. Ishiba aims to promote open dialogue and exchanges to strengthen ties, acknowledging Lee's view of Japan as an important partner during his campaign.

          <p>Lee Jae-myung, the opposition party leader, has been elected as the new president of South Korea in a snap election following the impeachment of former leader Yoon Suk Yeol.

He will be sworn in immediately, skipping the usual transition period, and will determine the trajectory of South Korea's trade negotiations with the U.S. and its policies toward China and North Korea. The Kospi index experienced a jump, and the South Korean won strengthened modestly against the U.S. dollar, indicating positive market reaction to the election results.

          <p>Lee Jae Myung of South Korea's liberal Democratic Party has begun his five-year presidential term, succeeding Yoon Suk Yeol, who was removed from office following impeachment proceedings related to the imposition of martial law. Lee, who narrowly lost to Yoon in 2022, has pledged to tighten martial law legislation, support smaller businesses, and boost the economy. He aims to strengthen ties with the United States and Japan to counter North Korea, while also seeking improved relations with China and Russia. Lee also faces challenges in talks with the U.S. regarding higher import tariffs, and will be watched closely for changes in South Korea's stance toward Japan regarding wartime issues. The turnout among eligible voters was notably high, reaching the highest level in 28 years. Optimism surrounding the stability of the South Korean peninsula may be reasonably expressed. </p>

          <p>With women's football gaining global prominence, Japan is looking to emulate the success seen in Europe, where some clubs attract more spectators to women's games than men's. The WE League in Japan, established in 2021, aims to empower women but still struggles financially compared to its European counterparts. Barcelona's women's team, for example, has built a strong fan base and generates significant revenue through sponsorships and ticket sales. The WE League is working to acquire sponsors and collaborate with the J-League to stabilize its financial base and increase attendance.

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass will not be called as a witness in a federal court hearing determining whether the city's homelessness programs should be placed in receivership. An attorney for the L.A. Alliance for Human Rights withdrew subpoenas issued to Bass and two City Councilmembers, citing potential delays from legal challenges. The alliance, which sued the city in 2020, argues that the city has failed to comply with a settlement agreement requiring it to provide 12,915 beds for the unhoused population by 2027. City officials maintain they intend to comply, highlighting efforts such as Inside Safe, which moves unhoused individuals into interim housing. The situation reflects the ongoing challenges and debates surrounding homelessness in Los Angeles. </p>

          <p>A man accused of writing letters threatening to assassinate President Trump was framed, according to investigators. Ramon Morales-Reyes, an undocumented immigrant, was arrested after officials alleged he threatened to shoot Trump, but prosecutors now claim Demetric Deshawn Scott wrote the letters. Scott allegedly wrote the letters to prevent Morales-Reyes from testifying against him in a robbery case. Morales-Reyes doesn't speak fluent English, and his handwriting differs from the letters. Scott admitted to writing the letters, stating his intention was not to threaten Trump but to prevent Morales-Reyes from testifying. The incident underscores the complexities of the legal system and the potential for manipulation. </p>

          <p>Elon Musk has criticized President Trump's policy bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination." This marks a widening rift between Musk and Republicans. Musk's criticism could embolden fiscally conservative Republican senators to defy Trump during negotiations. The situation highlights the challenges of unifying the Republican party around a specific agenda. </p>

          <p>President Trump's Truth Social platform has taken a step toward launching a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with a NYSE Arca filing. The Truth Social Bitcoin ETF is designed to track the price of bitcoin and offer a simpler way for investors to gain exposure. The filing follows an announced partnership between Trump Media and Crypto.com. If approved, the ETF would represent one of the most politically connected entries into the booming market for bitcoin funds. (not investment advice)</p>
