          <p>England has decided not to make any changes to its cricket team for the second Test match against India, meaning pace bowler Jofra Archer's anticipated return is postponed. Archer, who has been absent from Test cricket for four years due to injury, rejoined the squad but missed a training session due to a family emergency. England is aiming to secure a 2-0 series lead at Edgbaston, a venue where India has historically struggled. Meanwhile, India may rest its star pace bowler Jasprit Bumrah as part of a strategy to manage his workload throughout the five-Test series.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has announced it will rescind its digital services tax on large technology firms, a move aimed at restarting trade talks with the United States. The decision came just before the first tax payments were due and followed President Trump's threat to halt all trade negotiations over the issue. The 3% tax would have affected major U.S. tech companies like Amazon and Google and was expected to generate billions in revenue for Canada. This reversal is seen as a significant concession to de-escalate trade tensions and focus on achieving a broader economic partnership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Moderna has announced that its experimental mRNA-based influenza vaccine demonstrated a stronger immune response than an existing flu shot in a late-stage clinical trial. The positive results are a crucial step for the company, paving the way for regulatory submission of both the standalone flu vaccine and a combination COVID-19 and flu shot. The company had previously withdrawn its application for the combination vaccine but plans to resubmit it with this new efficacy data. If approved, the vaccines could represent a significant new product line for Moderna in the multibillion-dollar respiratory virus market.</p>

Speaking ahead of his 90th birthday, he told followers that a framework for its continuation would be discussed, a shift from previous statements where he suggested he might be the last. The succession is a critical issue, as Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama chooses his reincarnation, while the Chinese government sees him as a separatist and may attempt to name its own successor.

While the news may signal that inflation is being brought under control, some economists caution that persistent service inflation and volatile energy prices remain risks.
