          <p>The UK will end British Summer Time (BST) on Sunday, October 26, 2025, when clocks go back one hour to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) at 02:00 BST. This annual shift, which grants an extra hour of sleep, has occurred for over a century, with its origins in World War One to conserve fuel. While some advocate for permanent BST due to potential economic and safety benefits, critics highlight the significantly darker winter mornings it would cause, especially in northern regions like Scotland.</p>

The article explores the process at Cardiff University, where donated bodies are used for anatomy education, highlighting the profound impact on students and the long wait for families to hold funerals, while also noting a recent decline in UK body donation rates.</p>

          <p>A recent report indicates a growing trend of holidaymakers using AI, like ChatGPT, for travel planning, from suggesting destinations to crafting itineraries. Alan Smith successfully used AI to discover a "highlight" seaside town in northern Spain, while Hannah Read found an AI recommendation for a ferry route to Norway to be outdated. Experts caution users to fact-check AI suggestions, as chatbots can be overly optimistic and sometimes provide incorrect information, emphasizing that human research remains crucial for a smooth travel experience.</p>
