          <p>Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, is spearheading a campaign to lower rice prices in Japan, reminiscent of his father's reformist approach. Koizumi's efforts come amid rising household burdens and public frustration with price hikes outpacing wages, potentially boosting his political prospects. By releasing government stockpiled rice at reduced prices and addressing controversial issues in the agricultural sector, Koizumi is capturing public attention and drawing comparisons to his father's media-savvy strategy. Analysts suggest that Koizumi's actions could position him as a strong contender in upcoming elections and a potential future leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).</p>

          <p>Los Angeles city officials have created a curfew exemption for ticket holders of indoor events and performing arts venues downtown, including the Music Center, allowing evening performances to proceed. The move comes as Mayor Karen Bass' 8 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew impacts businesses and arts organizations across the area. Center Theatre Group canceled performances of "Hamlet," while L.A. Opera proceeded with its scheduled performances. The Broad museum will close all weekend, while other events have been postponed, due to major protests planned nationwide, which coincide with Trump's 79th birthday and a military parade in Washington, D.C.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles has inadvertently given California Governor Gavin Newsom a platform to respond on national television. Newsom criticized the militarization of the streets and accused Trump of inflaming a combustible situation. Newsom's strong address is likely to boost his standing within the Democratic Party and revive speculation about a potential 2028 presidential bid. The situation has allowed Newsom to position himself as standing up to Trump, who often uses California and its progressive politics as a punching bag.</p>
