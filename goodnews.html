          <p>CBS News correspondent Norah O'Donnell is set to release a new book titled "We the Women," which highlights the stories of often-overlooked female pioneers from 1776 to the present day. The book, described as a passion project, was inspired by the lack of female representation in historical education. O'Donnell features figures like Mary Katharine Goddard, whose name is on the Declaration of Independence, and Emily Warren Roebling, who was instrumental in building the Brooklyn Bridge. The book aims to celebrate the grit and courage of these women and is scheduled for release ahead of America's 250th birthday. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 15:34:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As homeowners increasingly tap into their home equity, financial experts are highlighting several costly mistakes to avoid in the current economic climate. One major error is choosing a variable-rate Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) when predictable payments are needed, as interest rates could rise. Another pitfall is borrowing more than necessary, which increases interest payments and financial risk if home values decline or income changes. Homeowners are also advised to carefully scrutinize closing costs and hidden fees, as these can significantly increase the total cost of the loan, even in so-called "no-closing-cost" offers.

          <p>Amazon is set to report its second-quarter earnings, with investors closely watching the impact of tariffs and the company's progress in artificial intelligence. Analysts are monitoring key metrics for its e-commerce business, which faces uncertainty from President Trump's trade policies, although some believe Amazon may be gaining market share from Chinese competitors affected by tariffs. Another major focus is the growth of Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud division, where performance has been linked to AI-related capacity constraints. The company has pledged to spend up to $100 billion this year, largely on AI investments for AWS. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to construct a 90,000-square-foot state ballroom in the White House's East Wing, a project President Trump has long advocated for. The new venue, estimated to cost $200 million, will be funded by Trump and other private donors and is designed to host up to 650 guests for large functions. For decades, the White House has used large outdoor tents for state dinners, which Trump has criticized as unsightly and overpriced. Construction is set to begin in September, replacing the current East Wing structure, which has been modified many times since its construction in 1902.</p>

          <p>United Talent Agency (UTA) and Michael Kassan, the founder of strategic advisory firm MediaLink, have agreed to drop their respective lawsuits against one another. The legal battle stemmed from UTA's $125 million acquisition of MediaLink in 2021, which led to mutual accusations of breach of contract. UTA had alleged uncontrolled spending by Kassan, while Kassan claimed UTA failed to honor the terms of their agreement. Both parties released a joint statement confirming they have amicably ended their dispute, though the specific terms of the settlement were not disclosed.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase has marked the opening of its 1,000th new bank branch since launching an ambitious expansion plan seven years ago. The milestone was celebrated at a new location in Charlotte, North Carolina, a key market for rival Bank of America. This expansion is part of a multi-billion dollar investment to add over 500 more locations by 2027, solidifying JPMorgan's position as the American bank with the most branches. The strategy aims to capture more deposits by increasing physical presence in fast-growing areas, countering a long-term industry trend of branch closures since the 2008 financial crisis.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched "Project Crypto," an initiative aimed at updating federal securities laws to accommodate trading and other financial activities on blockchain networks. SEC Chair Paul Atkins stated the goal is to help make America the crypto capital of the world by considering the benefits of moving markets "on-chain." The project will focus on creating an efficient licensing structure for innovations like "super apps" and preventing companies from moving offshore due to burdensome regulations. This move aligns with growing investor interest in the tokenization of real-world assets and a recent report on boosting U.S. dominance in digital markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell reveals that the modern potato evolved from an ancient interbreeding event between a wild potato species and a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago. Researchers analyzed hundreds of genomes and solved the long-standing puzzle of how potatoes developed their starchy tubers. The findings show that the ancient tomato provided a crucial gene that signals the plant to form tubers, while the wild potato ancestor contributed a gene that controls their growth. This discovery illustrates how hybridization between different species can lead to the evolution of entirely new traits and organisms.</p>

In a new documentary series, Brady and chairman Tom Wagner express bullish ambitions, including an eventual return to the Premier League and competing against city rivals Aston Villa. The owners have invested heavily in the club, which was in a state of disrepair, and are planning a new 62,000-seat stadium.

          <p>With the U.S. set to impose a 15% tariff on many European-made goods, American buyers of luxury yachts are expected to use legal strategies to avoid the new tax. The most common method will likely be registering the vessel in a foreign country, such as the Cayman Islands or Malta, which allows it to enter U.S. waters as a visiting vessel without being subject to import duties. While this strategy involves registration fees, the savings on a multi-million dollar yacht would be substantial. This approach is more feasible for larger superyachts, while owners of smaller boats will likely have to absorb the tariff cost.</p>

Before the injury, England's bowlers had a mixed performance, reducing India to 204-6 in the 64 overs possible. The day's play was marked by erratic bowling and a calamitous run-out of India's captain, leaving the crucial match evenly poised but with major concerns for England's bowling depth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key consumer protection for federally backed reverse mortgages is the "95% rule," which can be crucial for heirs who wish to keep a family home. The rule stipulates that if a homeowner with a reverse mortgage passes away or moves out, their heirs can settle the debt by paying either the full loan balance or 95% of the home's current appraised value, whichever is less. This prevents a situation where the heirs would have to pay more than the property is worth, especially if the loan balance has grown larger than the home's value. This FHA-insured provision offers peace of mind and a predictable path for estate planning. (not investment advice)</p>
