          <p>Sea temperatures around the UK and Ireland have risen sharply, with some areas 4¬∞C warmer than normal, creating a marine heatwave. This phenomenon, most intense off the west coast of Ireland, is attributed to climate change and a warm spring. Scientists are monitoring the potential impact on marine life, including disruptions to breeding patterns and influxes of jellyfish and harmful algae. While the temperatures haven't exceeded tolerance limits for most species, the long duration of the heatwave is unusual and concerning. Higher sea temperatures could also influence land temperatures through sea breezes.</p>

          <p>The Army is preparing to transport Abrams tanks and other military vehicles to Washington, D.C., for a parade marking the Army's 250th anniversary, which coincides with President Trump's birthday. The event, estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million, has drawn comparisons to Trump's previous attempts to hold a large-scale military parade. The parade will showcase the Army's evolution from the Revolutionary War to the present day, featuring reenactors, historical equipment, and aircraft. Security measures are being heightened, and soldiers will be housed in unused federal buildings.</p>

          <p>Southern California experienced a heat wave this week, with temperatures reaching the mid-90s in some areas. However, the heat is beginning to subside, with cooler temperatures expected due to an incoming low-pressure system. The return of 'May gray,' characterized by overcast skies and cooler temperatures, is anticipated for the weekend, potentially affecting Memorial Day beach weather. The recent heat increased the risk of brush fires, but no red flag alerts were issued due to recent rains. Forecasters are monitoring for another potential heat wave next week.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) have regained control of their headquarters after a judge deemed the Trump administration's takeover 'null and void.' The ruling followed a lawsuit by USIP leaders challenging their ouster by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The Justice Department plans to appeal the ruling. The USIP, established by Congress, provides analysis and resources for peace-building efforts worldwide. The White House maintains that reducing the organization is justified, but the judge's decision has allowed the original leaders to resume their duties.</p>

          <p>California's E-Bike Incentive Program, designed to encourage alternative transportation, has faced technical difficulties, leading to frustration among applicants. A surge in traffic caused the program's website to malfunction, preventing eligible residents from applying for vouchers worth up to $2,000. The California Air Resources Board has rescheduled the application window for May 29 and implemented measures to prevent future glitches, including a virtual waiting room managed by cybersecurity and cloud computing experts. The program has approved over 1,000 vouchers to date and aims to fund another 1,000 in the upcoming round.</p>

          <p>Tech and music industry leaders testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, advocating for the passage of the No Fakes Act to protect against AI-generated deepfakes. They emphasized the need to safeguard individuals' voices and likenesses from unauthorized replication, while still allowing for responsible use of AI technology. The No Fakes Act would hold individuals or companies liable for producing unauthorized digital replicas and establish a process for removing deepfakes from online platforms. The testimony follows President Trump's signing of the Take It Down Act, which addresses non-consensual intimate imagery and deepfakes.</p>

Trump said he would consult with economic advisors before making a final decision, stating that the time would seem to be right for this transition. (not investment advice)</p>
