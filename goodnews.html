          <p>Tyrese Haliburton's last-second three-pointer capped off a remarkable comeback for the Indiana Pacers, securing a 2-0 series lead against the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Pacers overcame a 20-point deficit, with Haliburton scoring 11 of his 19 points in the final quarter. Donovan Mitchell's impressive 48-point performance was not enough for Cleveland, who were missing key players due to injuries. The Pacers' victory marks their first time winning the first two games of a playoff series on the road since 1994, setting the stage for Game 3 in Indiana.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have unveiled a comprehensive set of measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, to stimulate economic growth amid trade concerns. The People's Bank of China will lower the seven-day reverse repurchase rates by 10 basis points to 1.4% and the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points. These measures aim to support key sectors like technology and real estate, while also establishing a 500-billion-yuan relending tool for consumption and elderly care. The announcement comes ahead of planned trade talks between Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Switzerland.</p>

The rise in tourism demonstrates resilient consumer sentiment and prioritization of experiences over retail goods, impacting marketing strategies for both international and local brands.

          <p>The United States and China are set to hold talks in Switzerland to de-escalate trade tensions, marking the first high-level, in-person contact since President Trump imposed hefty tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the talks aim to agree on future discussion topics rather than achieving a major trade deal immediately. The U.S. intends to decouple from China in strategic industries like semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, but not in areas like textiles. China's Commerce Ministry confirmed Vice Premier He Lifeng will meet with Bessent, signaling a willingness to engage after considering global expectations and U.S. business appeals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is reportedly planning to announce that the U.S. will officially refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf, aligning with the preference of Arab nations. This move, expected during his trip to Saudi Arabia, could inflame tensions with Iran, which maintains its historical ties to the name Persian Gulf. The International Hydrographic Organization works to standardize geographic names, but countries often use different names in their own documentation. This action follows Trump's earlier suggestion to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with the new Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, in the Oval Office, adopting a friendlier tone after months of belittling Canada. Trump, who had previously joked about Canada becoming the 51st state, expressed his love for Canada and its people. Despite the cordial atmosphere, Carney remained guarded, while Trump veered off-topic, discussing subjects ranging from Obama's library to diplomacy with the Houthis. The New York Times article highlights the awkwardness and recrimination stemming from Trump's earlier rhetoric.</p>

          <p>A plant in China's Shanxi province is being upgraded with French technology to produce aluminium from China's low-grade ore, which was previously unusable. The technology, developed by Yves Ocello from IB2, neutralizes silica and sulphur, allowing high-silica bauxite to be refined using the Bayer method. This development could reduce China's reliance on imported aluminium ore from Guinea and Australia. In 2023, IB2 signed a 22-year agreement with Chinese firm Liulin Senze Coal & Aluminum to implement the technology.</p>
