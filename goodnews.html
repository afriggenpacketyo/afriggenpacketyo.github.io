          <p>An opinion piece discusses concerns about Hong Kong's legal system after 2047, when the 'one country, two systems' framework is set to expire. The author reflects on initial worries in the 1970s regarding the 1997 handover and urges calm, suggesting that dwelling on the post-2047 scenario is unproductive. The author highlights the need to address the issue of land leases and contract law, which were previously raised but largely ignored during the lead up to 1997. The piece ultimately encourages a measured approach to future uncertainties. </p>

          <p>Poland began voting in a high-stakes presidential election that will shape the country's political future, particularly regarding abortion rights, LGBTQ protections, and EU relations. The front-runners are pro-EU Warsaw Mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski and nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki, with polls suggesting a likely runoff. The election occurs amidst a power struggle between the Polish prime minister and the outgoing conservative president, Andrzej Duda, potentially influencing the government's policy reform efforts. There are also concerns about foreign interference in the campaign, including denial-of-service attacks and allegations of foreign-funded political ads. </p>

          <p>An opinion piece contrasts the resurgence of night train travel in Europe with the decline of long-distance public transport in the United States. Europe is investing in rail networks to compete with short-haul flights, while the U.S. continues to prioritize cars and air travel. The author argues that America's focus on individual freedom and car dependence has led to congestion and unhappiness.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is shifting its financing approach in Africa by promoting Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to fund large infrastructure projects, moving away from direct government loans under the Belt and Road Initiative. This model grants Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for construction financing, addressing African governments' debt concerns. Examples include the extension of Kenya's Standard Gauge Railway, where Chinese financiers would contribute 40% of the project cost and operate the railway for at least 25 years to recoup their investment. </p>
