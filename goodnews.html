          <p>Principal Benjamin Honoroff revitalized Middle School 50 in Brooklyn, New York, by integrating debate into every class and expanding the debate team. Once a 'persistently dangerous school' with declining enrollment, the school saw proficiency scores in English and math jump significantly. The debate program, which even produced national champions, deepened students' conceptual understanding and fostered a sense of pride within the community. This article showcases how an innovative educational approach can dramatically improve school performance and student engagement.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard a case challenging Illinois' ballot counting regulations, with justices from across the ideological spectrum expressing skepticism towards both sides. Rep. Michael Bost, who won his election, sued claiming harm from mail-in ballots that lowered his victory margin and incurred staff costs. Justices questioned the standing of a winning candidate to sue, while also challenging Illinois' argument that only candidates with a real chance of winning should be able to sue. This article highlights the complexities of election law and the justices' varied reactions to the arguments presented.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled for a 'routine yearly checkup' at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday, his second exam there since April. The visit follows a July diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition in older adults causing leg swelling. Trump's physician previously declared him 'fully fit' after his April physical, attributing hand bruising to frequent handshaking and aspirin use. This article notes that Trump is also considering a trip to the Middle East to finalize a peace deal after his medical consultation.</p>
