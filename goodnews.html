          <p>A South Korean court is retrying the case of Choi Mal-ja, who was convicted of grievous bodily harm in 1964 for biting off her sexual attacker's tongue in self-defense. At 19, she was attacked, but the legal system of the time punished her more harshly than her aggressor. Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi, now 80, sought a retrial to clear her name after decades of living as a convicted criminal. Prosecutors have apologized and requested the court to quash the original verdict, marking a significant moment for victims' rights in the country.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Mike Lawler has announced he will not run for governor of New York in 2026, opting instead to seek reelection for his Hudson Valley House seat. Lawler stated the decision was made for his family and district, emphasizing the importance of his seat for maintaining the Republican House majority. His district is a key target for Democrats, making his reelection campaign critical for national party control. The decision comes after former President Trump appeared to endorse Lawler for reelection, potentially clearing a path for other candidates in the GOP gubernatorial primary.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon are collaborating to allow institutional investors to purchase money market funds as digital tokens recorded on a blockchain. This initiative aims to transform the $7.1 trillion money market industry by increasing transaction efficiency, enabling 24/7 trading, and improving settlement times. Major fund companies like BlackRock and Fidelity are already involved. The move is seen as a significant step in digital asset adoption, potentially allowing these tokenized funds to be used as collateral, thereby increasing capital efficiency in the financial system.

          <p>The UK Supreme Court has quashed the convictions of former traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, who were jailed for manipulating the Libor and Euribor interest rate benchmarks. The court ruled that the directions given to the juries in their original trials were incorrect, making the convictions unsafe. Hayes and Palombo had argued their actions were common practice and known to their superiors. The decision concludes a decade-long legal battle and raises questions about other convictions related to the scandal, with calls for a public inquiry into the prosecutions.</p>

          <p>Australian rugby wing Harry Potter has dismissed claims that the national team has a "losing mentality" following criticism from Sir Clive Woodward and David Campese. The criticism arose after Australia's captain ended the first Test match against the British and Irish Lions while trailing, a move seen by some as a lack of fighting spirit. Potter defended his team, stating their intention was to win and that suggesting otherwise is "ridiculous." With the series on the line, he emphasized that the team has learned from the loss and is emotionally prepared for the crucial second Test.</p>

          <p>James Talarico, a 36-year-old Texas state representative, has emerged as a potential rising star in the Democratic party following a widely discussed appearance on "The Joe Rogan Experience." A former teacher and current seminary student, Talarico used the platform to discuss his progressive Christian faith and critique Christian nationalism, earning both praise and scrutiny. His ability to engage with a broad audience has fueled speculation about a potential 2026 statewide run, possibly for the U.S. Senate. Talarico's rise highlights a growing desire among some voters for authentic candidates who can articulate progressive values in unconventional forums.</p>

The total order volume also fell by 18.2%. Analysts suggest this decline is partly due to shipowners' caution in ordering oil and LNG tankers from Chinese shipyards, given the United States' significant role in energy exports and the threat of new port fees. Despite the dip, China is expected to maintain its overall competitive advantage in the shipbuilding industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers from the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Centre claim to have developed a new aircraft design platform that breaks the "dimensionality curse" in aviation. This long-standing problem involves balancing competing factors like stealth and aerodynamics, which can exponentially increase computational load. The team demonstrated their method by creating a dramatically improved design for a plane similar to the US Navy's X-47B stealth drone, a project cancelled due to such trade-offs. The new software reportedly allows for an unlimited number of variables without increasing the computing burden, a significant potential breakthrough.</p>

While New Hampshire ranked poorly for weather, it scored first for neighborhood safety and was in the top 10 for healthcare and tax-friendliness. The results suggest a shift in retirement priorities, with factors like public safety and healthcare access becoming as important as climate and taxes.</p>

          <p>The sea slug Elysia chlorotica presents a fascinating case study in symbiosis, blurring the lines between plant and animal. This small creature consumes algae and incorporates the algae's chloroplasts into its own body, allowing it to generate food from sunlight for the rest of its life. This process, known as kleptoplasty, challenges traditional evolutionary theory, which primarily focuses on random mutation rather than the transfer of abilities between species. Scientists are still working to understand the exact genetic mechanism, but the slug serves as a potent example of how symbiosis may be a more significant driver of evolution than previously thought.</p>

To secure the best possible rate, experts advise strengthening one's credit profile, as top rates are typically offered to borrowers with scores in the mid-700s or higher.

The article compares the protagonist to *Taxi Driver*'s Travis Bickle, exploring how the film immerses the viewer in the chaotic perspective of a man who sees himself as a vigilante hero.
