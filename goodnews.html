        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decided to maintain its key policy rate at 5.5%, a move that was widely anticipated by economists. This decision follows a significant 50-basis-point cut in June, after which the RBI shifted its stance from "accommodative" to "neutral." While recent low inflation figures might support a rate cut, the economy showed stronger-than-expected growth of 7.4% in the March quarter. The central bank's cautious approach comes as India faces potential economic pressure from the U.S. over its trade relationship with Russia. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite Clark's vocal presence from the bench, the Fever's five-game winning streak came to an end. The Sparks, now enjoying a fully healthy roster for the first time in over a year, were led by strong offensive performances from Rickea Jackson, Kelsey Plum, Dearica Hamby, and Azurá Stevens. The win strengthens the Sparks' position as they move closer to securing a playoff berth in the league.</p>

As part of the deal, the NFL will receive a 10% equity stake in ESPN, valued at an estimated $2.2 billion to $2.5 billion. The arrangement will also see ESPN gain distribution rights for the RedZone channel and merge its fantasy platform with the NFL's.

          <p>OpenAI is reportedly in early-stage talks with investors for a secondary share sale that would value the artificial intelligence leader at approximately $500 billion. The potential deal would allow current and former employees to sell their shares, with existing investor Thrive Capital possibly leading the round. This valuation marks a significant increase from the company's $300 billion valuation during a funding round in March, reflecting intense investor interest in the generative AI space. The news comes as OpenAI's ChatGPT is nearing 700 million weekly active users and its annual revenue is projected to exceed $20 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

This article highlights efforts like those of a 12-year-old guide in Hiroshima who shares the city's tragic history with foreign tourists.

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of the state prison in Norco by fall 2026. The decision is attributed to a significant decline in the statewide inmate population, which has nearly halved since its peak in 2006, and is expected to save the state $150 million annually. The facility, which currently houses nearly 3,000 inmates and employs 1,200 staff, will see its population and workers transferred to other locations. The site, originally a luxury hotel in the 1920s, may be repurposed, with local officials hopeful for its restoration.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Economists Debate Implementing Formal Consumption Targets in Economic Planning</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As China prepares its next five-year plan, economists and policy thinkers are debating whether to include specific, measurable targets for consumer spending. Proponents, like economist Chang Xiuze, argue that setting a goal for the "household consumption rate" as a share of GDP could help address the country's relatively low domestic consumption. However, other experts are skeptical, questioning if such metrics are operationally feasible as policy goals. The discussion reflects Beijing's ongoing strategic effort to rebalance its economy by expanding domestic demand and reducing its reliance on investment and exports for growth.</p>

          <p>After a challenging start to his MLB career followed by a shoulder injury, Dodgers rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki is showing promising signs of a comeback. The Japanese phenom, who had an underwhelming 4.72 ERA before being sidelined, has been progressing in his throwing program and could begin a rehab assignment soon. The Dodgers have been encouraged by adjustments to his delivery and the addition of a new two-seam fastball, with his velocity returning to the mid-90s. While his role is uncertain, a healthy and effective Sasaki could provide valuable pitching depth for the team's postseason ambitions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to redirect over $4 billion in FEMA disaster mitigation funding. The injunction was granted in response to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued that the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The judge ruled that the states demonstrated that reallocating the funds could cause "irreparable harm" to communities needing the money for projects like flood protection. The ruling temporarily halts the transfer of funds while the court further considers the legality of the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>A massive copper mining project in Afghanistan, backed by a state-owned Chinese company, is showing significant progress toward starting operations this year after being stalled for 17 years. The Mes Aynak mine, holding one of the world's largest copper deposits, was delayed by security issues, archaeological concerns, and a lack of infrastructure. The Taliban government's decision to switch to underground mining is seen as a key step, as it is less destructive to ancient Buddhist relics at the site. This development signals a potential economic boost for Afghanistan and a major strategic gain for China's resource ambitions.</p>

          <p>A new COVID-19 variant, known colloquially as "Stratus" or XFG, has been spreading in the U.S., accounting for an estimated 14% of cases by late June. The variant, a combination of two other strains, was first detected in Southeast Asia and has since been identified in 38 countries. While its mutations may help it evade some immune responses, the World Health Organization has assessed its global public health risk as "low." Health officials have stated that there is no evidence it causes more severe disease or different symptoms than previous Omicron variants, and current vaccines are expected to remain effective.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has passed a new ordinance requiring landlords in unincorporated areas to ensure their rental units do not exceed 82 degrees Fahrenheit. The law, aimed at protecting vulnerable tenants from the health dangers of extreme heat, will take effect next month but will not be enforced until January 2027 to allow for compliance. Officials are encouraging landlords to use passive cooling methods like reflective roofing and blackout curtains in addition to air conditioning. The measure reflects a growing trend of local governments implementing policies to mitigate the public health impacts of climate change.</p>
