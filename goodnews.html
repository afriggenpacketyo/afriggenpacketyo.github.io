        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a new blue food color additive derived from the fruit of the gardenia plant. The dye is cleared for use in various products, including sports drinks, candies, and non-carbonated beverages. This approval is part of a broader push by health officials to replace petroleum-based dyes with natural alternatives in the American food supply. The additive is created using soy protein, and the FDA is currently reviewing a request to exempt it from allergen labeling requirements.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has asked the Fed's inspector general to review a controversial $2.5 billion building renovation project. The move follows sharp criticism from the White House, with officials including President Trump accusing the central bank of "fiscal mismanagement" and excessive spending. The project, which involves upgrading the Fed's main Washington, D.C., buildings, has been defended by the Fed as necessary for safety remediation and modernization. Since the Federal Reserve is not taxpayer-funded, it is not under the direct oversight of the Office of Management and Budget. (not investment advice)</p>

This move places Amazon in direct competition with similar AI coding tools from Google and Microsoft, a field often referred to as "vibe coding." Kiro is designed to simplify the development process by helping users define project requirements and system design before writing code, creating diagrams and task lists to improve clarity. The tool currently uses AI models from Anthropic and will be offered in free and premium tiers after the preview period.</p>

          <p>Following Morgan Stanley's downgrade of CrowdStrike to "equal weight," CNBC's Jim Cramer advised that the subsequent dip in the cybersecurity firm's stock could present a buying opportunity. Morgan Stanley analysts cited the stock's high valuation after a 50% rise since April, suggesting the near-term potential is already priced in. Cramer, however, remains confident in the company's long-term growth, particularly anticipating a strong second half as customer package deals introduced after a major 2024 IT glitch expire. Concerns about potential federal cybersecurity budget cuts have also recently impacted the stock's performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thirty-five years after the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), prospective parents with disabilities still face significant discrimination from adoption agencies. The article highlights the story of Kelly and Larry Peterson, a couple with spina bifida who were initially rejected by an agency due to their condition. They eventually adopted a child who also has spina bifida, believing their shared experience makes them uniquely qualified caregivers. Adoption specialists emphasize that adults with disabilities are often unfairly discounted, despite the ADA's prohibitions, and that with proper resources, they can be excellent parents.</p>

          <p>A new federal spending bill is anticipated to boost the private jet market by reinstating a significant tax benefit for buyers. The provision allows businesses to immediately write off 100% of the purchase price of a new or used jet, a policy known as "bonus depreciation." Jet brokers report a surge in interest from clients who were waiting for the bill to pass, as the tax incentive makes purchasing or upgrading an aircraft more financially attractive. The stimulus arrives as the private jet market was experiencing a slowdown after a post-pandemic boom. (not investment advice)</p>
