          <p>Actress and comedian Amy Schumer is recovering at home after undergoing a laminectomy to address a long-standing back injury. She shared an update on social media, explaining the surgery was for her L5 vertebra, which has caused her pain since a past surfing accident. The article also touches upon her recent positive experiences with the weight-loss medication Mounjaro, which she has found more suitable than Ozempic, and her use of hormones to manage perimenopause symptoms.</p>

          <p>Historian Rana Mitter, a leading expert on modern China, explains that the impact of the Second World War on the nation's development is often underestimated. The conflict, particularly the Japanese invasion, shattered much of the infrastructure and communications that had been built in the preceding decades. According to Mitter, this widespread destruction forced China to essentially restart its development process after the war. He argues that understanding this historical context is crucial for analyzing China's contemporary political and social landscape.</p>

          <p>NASCAR Xfinity Series driver Connor Zilisch sustained a broken collarbone after an unfortunate accident during his victory celebration at Watkins Glen. After winning the race, the 19-year-old was climbing onto his car's roof when he slipped and fell headfirst onto the ground. Zilisch was transported to a hospital but later confirmed on social media that he was recovering and that CT scans of his head were clear. The incident capped an eventful day for the driver, who had also been involved in a wreck with his teammate earlier in the race.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Hawaii has blocked a Trump administration move that would have allowed commercial fishing within the Pacific Islands Heritage marine national monument. The ruling overturns a letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service that sought to reverse protections established under the Obama administration. Environmental and Native Hawaiian groups filed the lawsuit, arguing the administration bypassed the required public comment process for changing the rules. The decision immediately halts fishing in the protected waters, which are home to pristine coral reefs and vulnerable marine species.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool's 2-2 draw and subsequent penalty shootout loss to Crystal Palace in the Community Shield offered a first look at Arne Slot's revamped team. The match showcased the potential of new signings, with debut goals from Hugo Ekitike and Jeremie Frimpong, and an impressive performance from record acquisition Florian Wirtz. However, the article highlights significant defensive vulnerabilities, as Liverpool twice surrendered a lead and looked shaky at the back. The analysis suggests that while the team's attack looks promising, time and further adjustments, particularly in defense, are needed for the new-look squad to fully cohere.</p>

          <p>England's Rehan Ahmed was the star performer, leading the Trent Rockets to a five-wicket victory against the Northern Superchargers in the men's Hundred competition. Ahmed first contributed with the ball, taking two wickets for 23 runs to help restrict the Superchargers to a modest total of 124-9. He then played a crucial role with the bat, scoring 31 runs to stabilize the chase after the openers were dismissed in quick succession. The win maintains the Rockets' unbeaten start to the tournament, as they reached their target with four balls remaining.</p>

          <h2>Liverpool Manager Defends Crystal Palace Fans Over Disruption of Memorial Silence</h2>

          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot stated he does not believe Crystal Palace fans had any "bad intention" when they disrupted a minute's silence before the Community Shield match at Wembley. The silence was held to remember former Liverpool player Diogo Jota and his brother, who died in a car crash. The referee cut the tribute short after shouts were heard from the Palace supporters' end. Slot suggested the noise was likely from an unaware fan cheering, which then caused a chain reaction as other fans tried to quiet them, rather than a deliberate act of disrespect.</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has pushed back against President Trump's threats to exert federal control over the city, defending her administration's handling of public safety. In response to White House claims of "out-of-control" violence, Bowser highlighted that violent crime has been on a steep two-year decline and is currently down 26% compared to last year. While expressing a willingness to work with the president, she suggested his plan to surge federal officers is more about showing force than addressing a non-existent crime spike. She argued the city needs more federal prosecutors and judges, not a federal takeover of its police force.</p>

          <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has characterized the upcoming meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin as an important opportunity to "test" the Russian leader's seriousness about ending the war in Ukraine. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Rutte praised Trump's strategy of engaging in dialogue while also increasing pressure on Russia. He emphasized that while the Alaska summit is a crucial first step, any final peace deal must involve Ukraine and European allies. The meeting will determine if a broader negotiation process is viable or if Putin is not genuinely interested in peace.</p>
