          <p>The United Kingdom is set to purchase twelve new fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear weapons, signaling a significant expansion of its nuclear deterrent to match China and Russia. Prime Minister is expected to announce the purchase at the upcoming NATO summit in the Hague. This move is part of a broader National Security Strategy that prepares the UK for potential direct threats, including wartime scenarios, and will be equipped with US-owned nuclear warheads while Trident submarines remain the ultimate independent deterrent. Meanwhile, various newspapers also cover Donald Trump's use of strong language regarding the Israel-Iran conflict and Labour MPs' rebellion against welfare bill cuts. Optimism remains relatively stable in light of the UK's defense preparations. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, but voiced frustration after both countries were accused of violating the agreement shortly after it was supposed to take effect. Despite the initial violations, bombardments appeared to cease following Trump's intervention, including a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The US Embassy in Jerusalem is set to reopen, but travel restrictions for US government employees remain in place. The conflict between Israel and Iran, which began on June 13, has resulted in at least 1,000 deaths, and drones have hit bases in Iraq housing US troops. The announcement of a ceasefire is a positive sign amidst the conflict. </p>

          <p>Representative Brittany Pettersen brought her 5-month-old son Sam to a House Committee on Financial Services hearing, questioning Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell while holding him in her lap. Pettersen, who has been vocal about the challenges of being a new parent in Congress, used the opportunity to advocate for parental privileges for members of Congress. The event highlights the ongoing struggle for work-life balance and the need for more family-friendly policies in government. The inclusion of a baby in a congressional hearing is a positive step toward normalizing parenthood in the workplace. </p>

          <p>Childhood vaccinations have avoided an estimated 154 million deaths since the launch of the WHO's Essential Programme on Immunization 50 years ago. However, a recent study in The Lancet found that efforts to boost vaccination rates have stalled or reversed in many places since 2010. The COVID pandemic was a major hurdle for vaccination efforts, but there's been a concerted effort to find those kids and vaccinate them. The progress in vaccination rates, as well as the setbacks, create a mixed sentiment. </p>

          <p>The Natural History Museum in London will display a rare dog-sized dinosaur, Enigmacursor mollyborthwickae, which was previously misclassified. The dinosaur lived about 150 million years ago and ran around the feet of famous giants like the Stegosaurus. Scientists concluded the creature was a new species based on clues in the bones, particularly the leg bones, and formally erased the whole category of Nanosaurus. The discovery should help scientists understand the diversity of dinosaurs in the Late Jurassic period. The discovery of a new dinosaur species is an exciting development. </p>

He noted that AI stocks are breaking out, and the data center renaissance is back in focus.
