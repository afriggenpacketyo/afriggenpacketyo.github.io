          <p>Japan and the United States are continuing negotiations on tariff issues, aiming to reach an agreement by mid-June, according to Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa. Despite ongoing disagreements, Akazawa expressed optimism about the progress made after talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in Washington. Japan is seeking the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, while proposing joint efforts to strengthen supply chains and expand imports of U.S. farm products. The two countries aim for a mutually beneficial deal during their leaders' meeting at the Group of Seven summit in Canada. (not investment advice)</p>

Managing director Rob Key famously said Dawson was "not someone who wants to go around India as the 15th or 16th man". However, in a new era under captain Harry Brook, England realized that Dawson's dependable nature was a strength.</p>
