          <p>A 26-year-old German backpacker, Carolina Wilga, has been found alive after being missing for nearly two weeks in western Australia. She was discovered by a passerby in a remote bush area following an extensive, multi-day search operation by authorities. Police had previously located her abandoned van in a remote part of the outback, sparking a wide-scale search. Wilga was last seen in the town of Beacon on June 29, and her family had reported being unable to contact her, which they said was highly unusual for her.</p>

The shirt has become a top seller on the WWE Shop, with fans appreciating its ironic or literal application to their own jobs.

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has indicated that the likelihood of a summit between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping is "high." The statement followed what Rubio described as "constructive and positive" talks with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, on the sidelines of a regional meeting. This was the first in-person meeting between the two top diplomats since Rubio took office in January. Rubio acknowledged that there are still issues to resolve between the two global powers but noted the meeting provided a foundation for future collaboration.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has become the second-largest investor in Throne Sport Coffee, a brand focused on healthier ready-to-drink coffee options. Mahomes, who is also the brand's lead pitchman, explained that his coffee habit began in his first year in the NFL and he was drawn to Throne's low-sugar, high-protein formula. The company's CEO highlighted that the product, containing 10 grams of protein and only 1 gram of sugar, offers a better alternative to competing brands. The investment places Mahomes in the rapidly growing multi-billion dollar ready-to-drink coffee market.</p>

          <p>Actor Nathan Fillion, star of "The Rookie" and the new "Superman" movie, describes his perfect Sunday in Los Angeles. His ideal day begins by waking up with the sun, doodling with his cat Bowie nearby, and enjoying eggs Benedict at Sweet Butter on Ventura Boulevard. He favors a hike in the Hollywood hills for the views and exercise, followed by a relaxed backyard gathering with friends, ribs, and swimming. The afternoon might involve decluttering his house, while the evening is for ordering sushi, binging television shows, and late-night gaming with friends on Xbox Live.</p>

          <p>A San Diego County chef is suing foam foodware manufacturer WinCup, alleging the company continues to sell and distribute banned polystyrene foam products in California. A state law, SB 54, prohibited the sale of such items starting January 1 unless producers met a 25% recycling rate, which they did not. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of all Californians, seeks an injunction to stop sales and accuses the company of deceptive advertising by labeling the non-recyclable products with a recycling symbol. The state's enforcement agency, CalRecycle, has been criticized for its delayed action on the ban.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Roger Hutson, a Denver oil and gas executive who once actively worked to prevent Donald Trump from winning the presidency but has since become an admirer of his administration. Hutson, who supported Marco Rubio in 2016 and the "No Labels" effort in 2024, now says he is "very impressed" with Trump's accomplishments. He credits the president with securing the border, compelling allies to increase defense spending, and addressing unfair trade practices. While still disliking Trump's personality, Hutson's shift illustrates that some voters remain open to persuasion based on policy results rather than partisan loyalty.</p>

This structure allows the show to explore the biographical context of hits like "Sweet Caroline" and "America."

          <p>Laurie Gwen Shapiro's new book, "The Aviator and the Showman," offers a vibrant look at the marriage between famed pilot Amelia Earhart and her publisher husband, George Palmer Putnam. The biography details how the ambitious Putnam masterfully crafted Earhart's public image, turning her into a mass-market icon of American womanhood. However, the book also suggests that Putnam's relentless promotion and intrusive management of her career, driven by profit, may have contributed to the circumstances of her final, fatal flight. The review praises the narrative for its layered exploration of early aviation, publishing, and celebrity culture.</p>

          <p>This article addresses common fears about microwave ovens, explaining that they are generally safe for both people and food. Microwaves use non-ionizing radiation, a low-energy form similar to radio waves, which does not make food radioactive or damage human DNA like ionizing radiation from nuclear reactions. In fact, the short cooking time of microwaves can help food retain more nutrients compared to methods like boiling. The primary risks associated with microwaves are burns from hot food and containers, and the potential for chemicals to leach from unsafe plastic containers when heated.</p>

The bank's tech chief, Marco Argenti, stated that Devin will augment the firm's 12,000 human developers, initially handling tasks like updating internal code. He anticipates that this "hybrid workforce" of humans and AI agents could boost productivity significantly. The move signals a shift toward more powerful "agentic AI" that can execute complex, multi-step jobs, which could eventually automate tasks beyond software development and spark fresh debate about AI's impact on jobs.</p>

          <p>Residents of Cape Coral, Florida, have noted a proliferation of car washes, sparking conversations about their abundance. The industry's growth is attributed to a consumer shift toward professional services, with nearly 80% of drivers now opting for them over washing cars themselves, and the cost-efficiency of automated facilities. While the city has 43 car washes, this number is comparable to other businesses like law or accounting firms. An economist suggests their large, visible structures make them seem more numerous. In response to resident concerns, the city temporarily paused new permits and has since implemented new location and building restrictions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has issued a nationwide block on President Trump's executive order that sought to end birthright citizenship. The ruling, delivered on Thursday, prevents the controversial order from taking effect anywhere in the United States. The executive order aimed to deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, a direct challenge to the long-held interpretation of the 14th Amendment. This judicial action represents a significant legal setback for one of the administration's key immigration policy goals, setting the stage for further legal battles.</p>

According to scientists at the University of Oxford, the object may be over seven billion years old, making it three billion years older than our own solar system. It is only the third interstellar visitor ever detected. Researchers believe it originated in the Milky Way's "thick disk," a region of ancient stars, and is likely composed of water ice. As it approaches the sun later this year, it is expected to develop a glowing tail, potentially becoming visible with amateur telescopes.</p>

A year before their home World Cup, Hiddink's team suffered heavy losses, much like the criticism Pochettino now faces. Hiddink's strategy focused on creating the fittest team possible and fostering a club-like atmosphere, which was aided by having most players based domestically.

With states facing budget shortfalls, advocates and families worry the funds, intended for addiction and recovery services, will be diverted to fill other gaps. The new website allows the public to submit examples of potential misuse, such as funds going to a county's road department. The project aims to pressure state attorneys general, who secured the settlements, to provide more robust oversight and ensure the "blood money" is spent responsibly.</p>
