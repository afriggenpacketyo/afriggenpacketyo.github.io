          <p>In an economy with persistent inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a method for savers to earn returns that can outpace the inflation rate. This article outlines the current national average CD yields and contrasts them with the higher rates available from top providers, particularly online banks. It explains that shorter-term CDs currently offer higher yields than long-term ones, a phenomenon known as an inverted yield curve. Strategies for securing favorable rates, such as exploring online banks and considering a CD ladder, are also discussed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers in Europe are studying the oldest continuous ice core ever drilled, a 1.2-million-year-old sample from Antarctica. By analyzing air bubbles trapped within the ice, scientists can measure past concentrations of greenhouse gases like CO2. They hope to understand a major shift in Earth's ice age cycles, from occurring every 40,000 years to every 100,000 years. This ancient climate archive is expected to improve predictions of how the planet will respond to current and future greenhouse gas levels, providing vital context for modern climate change.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board has awarded CEO Elon Musk a new stock package worth approximately $29 billion, aiming to incentivize his continued leadership amid a fierce talent war for AI experts. This move follows a Delaware court's decision to strike down his previous $56 billion pay package from 2018, a ruling Musk is currently appealing. The company stated that if the original deal is reinstated by the court, Musk will forfeit the new award to prevent double compensation. The decision comes as Tesla pivots towards becoming an AI and robotics-focused company, emphasizing the need to retain Musk's expertise.</p>

The attack occurred nine miles offshore, and a series of fortunate events, including the timely arrival of a nurse and a fast boat, aided in his rescue. Jameson credits his survival to his faith, recounting a vision of Jesus that gave him a sense of peace during the ordeal. Despite the life-altering injury, he remains active in surfing and baseball and has even returned to the reef where the attack happened to face his fears.</p>

          <p>Nvidia is set to resume sales of its H20 chips to China after receiving assurances from the Trump administration, but analysts predict its market dominance will decline. U.S. export controls have inadvertently created an opportunity for domestic Chinese AI chipmakers like Huawei to gain prominence, with one report forecasting Nvidia's market share to drop to 54% in 2025. Furthermore, Nvidia is facing new scrutiny from Beijing, which has raised national security concerns about the chips. This complex dynamic highlights the ongoing tech tensions between the U.S. and China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Millions of UK car buyers who used financing over the past 18 years could be eligible for compensation following a Supreme Court ruling on hidden commissions. The court found that some dealers charged excessive interest rates to earn higher commissions from lenders without properly informing customers. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is now establishing a compensation scheme, with the first payments expected in 2026. Consumers who took out loans with discretionary commission arrangements, which were banned in 2021, are particularly likely to be eligible for a payout.</p>
