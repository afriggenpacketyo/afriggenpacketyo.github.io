          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese achieved a significant victory by winning a second consecutive term, defying the historical "incumbency curse." Albanese's center-left Labor government is set to increase its majority following a substantial defeat of the conservative Liberal-National coalition. Cost-of-living concerns, healthcare affordability, housing, climate change, and energy were central issues in the campaign. Albanese has pledged to address these issues while also advancing reconciliation with First Nations people, referencing the failed Voice referendum of 2023. The election results signify a tempering of the trend of voters abandoning the two major parties.</p>

          <p>Florida lawmakers have approved a measure aimed at alleviating the financial burden on condominium owners facing rising costs in aging buildings, following strict new requirements enacted after the Surfside collapse in 2021. The bill extends the deadline for completing structural integrity inspections and grants condo associations a two-year grace period to fully fund reserves. It also permits associations to secure loans for repairs with member approval. The legislation seeks to balance resident safety with the financial impact on condo owners, particularly in older buildings where special assessments have threatened displacement.</p>
