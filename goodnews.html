          <h2>Former Trump Aide Criticizes GOP Tax Hike Proposal for the Wealthy</h2>

          <p>Marc Short, a former chief of staff to ex-Vice President Mike Pence, argues that raising taxes on wealthy Americans is counterproductive, especially since many small businesses file taxes as individuals. Congressional Republicans are considering allowing the rate on individuals making $2.5 million or more to revert from 37% to 39.6% to help pay for middle- and working-class tax cuts. Short dismisses new Trump priorities like eliminating taxes on tips and Social Security as gimmicky, arguing they complicate the tax code. Conservative groups like the Heritage Foundation and Americans for Prosperity also oppose tax hikes on the wealthy.</p>

          <p>The US and UK have agreed to reduce import taxes on British cars and allow some steel and aluminum into the country tariff-free, offering relief to key UK industries. The agreement reduces the import tax on cars to 10% for 100,000 cars a year and slashes tariffs on steel and aluminum. It also includes "reciprocal access" for beef exports, with a quota of 13,000 metric tonnes for UK farmers. While leaders from both countries hail the agreement as significant, analysts note that it does not meaningfully alter the terms of trade between the countries as they stood before the changes introduced by Trump.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with the United Kingdom that he says will include billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports, particularly agricultural products. The deal will cut tariffs on U.K. cars from 27.5% to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum, while setting a quota of 100,000 U.K. vehicles that can be imported to the U.S. at a 10% tariff. The announcement boosted investor confidence, with markets making gains in early trading. Trump also indicated that more trade deals are in the works with countries like Canada, Italy, India, and Japan.</p>

Balelo stated that Ohtani could have pursued deals of as many as 15 years, and maybe even longer, but Ohtani rejected those overtures.</p>

          <p>Pinterest shares rose 15% after the company reported first-quarter earnings and provided better-than-expected guidance. The social media company said second-quarter sales should come in the range of $960 million to $980 million, higher than analysts' expectations. Pinterest had 570 million monthly active users in the first quarter, ahead of Wall Street estimates. However, Pinterest's finance chief Julia Brau Donnelly noted that "there have been small pockets of spend that have been impacted by tariffs in recent weeks," pointing to Asia-based e-commerce retailers curbing their digital advertising spend.</p>
