          <p>CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure provider, announced strong first-quarter earnings, surpassing revenue expectations with a 420% increase compared to the previous year. The company anticipates revenue between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion for 2025, supported by significant capital expenditures. A five-year deal with OpenAI, valued at up to $11.9 billion, is a key factor in CoreWeave's growth, in addition to Microsoft's reliance on CoreWeave for 62% of its 2024 revenue. Despite long-term uncertainties regarding AI supply and demand, CoreWeave is working to diversify its client base and does not expect significant impact from President Trump's tariffs.

          <p>Former Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney expressed disapproval of the UK government's invitation to US President Donald Trump for a second state visit, stating that Canadians were not "impressed" by the gesture. Carney emphasized that the invitation coincided with repeated comments from Trump about making Canada the 51st US state, undermining Canadian sovereignty. He highlighted Canada's reaffirmation of its sovereignty through an invitation for King Charles III to attend the opening of Canada's Parliament, a move seen as a direct response to Trump's remarks. Carney, who recently met with Trump to negotiate trade and security, reiterated that Canada is "not for sale, ever."</p>

While box-office revenue has improved, domestic ticket sales are still down compared to 2019. AMC's CEO, Adam Aron, believes the improved box office results in recent months make this initiative viable, potentially driving attendance, increasing concession sales, and exposing audiences to trailers for new films.</p>
