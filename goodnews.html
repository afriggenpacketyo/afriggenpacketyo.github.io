          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2bn of investment to build the new Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline. The Treasury said Sizewell C will create 10,000 direct jobs, thousands more in firms supplying the plant, and generate enough energy to power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called it a "landmark decision" that would "kickstart" economic growth, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the investment was necessary to usher in a "golden age of clean energy". The government insists that nuclear power provides enormous amounts of low-carbon, non-intermittent energy. </p>
