          <p>Microsoft announced exceptional quarterly results, with revenue and earnings per share significantly beating analyst expectations, driven by accelerated growth in its Azure cloud division. The company revealed Azure generated over $75 billion in revenue for the fiscal year, a 34% increase, and provided an optimistic forecast for the upcoming quarter. Following the report, Microsoft's shares surged, pushing its market capitalization over the $4 trillion mark in extended trading, joining Nvidia in this exclusive group.

          <p>The Trump administration announced a comprehensive trade deal with South Korea, establishing a 15% blanket tariff on South Korean exports to the United States, a reduction from a threatened 25% rate. As part of the agreement, South Korea will invest $350 billion in U.S.-controlled assets, with a significant portion allocated to the American shipbuilding industry. The deal also includes a commitment from Seoul to purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy products, while U.S. goods will not face any tariffs from South Korea.

          <p>The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee announced its decision to keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged, maintaining the current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The committee cited ongoing economic uncertainty and inflation that remains above the 2% target as key reasons for its "wait-and-see" approach. The decision was not unanimous, with two Fed governors dissenting in favor of a rate cut, a rare occurrence. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated the economy remains in good shape and is not being unduly held back by current policy, though he acknowledged risks from tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a 3% annualized growth rate in the second quarter, a significant rebound from the 0.5% contraction in the first quarter of 2025. This growth surpassed economists' forecasts and was largely driven by a sharp decrease in imports, which is linked to the Trump administration's trade policies. While the headline number appears strong, some economists caution that it may overstate the economy's underlying health, as a key measure of private domestic demand showed weak growth. The report suggests the economy is slowing but not reversing, with consumer spending showing modest improvement. (not investment advice)</p>

In exchange, the Phillies are reportedly sending top prospects, including right-hander Mick Abel and catcher Eduardo Tait, to the Twins. Duran, known for his triple-digit fastball, is expected to bolster Philadelphia's bullpen as the team aims for a World Series run. The deal is notable not just for its immediate impact but also because Duran is under team control through the 2028 season, providing long-term value.</p>

          <p>Despite being one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded, the recent magnitude 8.8 temblor off Russia's coast resulted in surprisingly little widespread damage. Scientists explain that the tsunami's energy was primarily directed into an open, unpopulated stretch of the Pacific Ocean, between Alaska and Hawaii. This trajectory allowed the waves to dissipate significantly before reaching more populated coastlines like the U.S. West Coast. While the immediate area near the epicenter in Russia saw damaging waves, experts consider it a 'best-case scenario' for a distant tsunami, highlighting how location and directionality are critical factors in determining a tsunami's impact.</p>

          <p>A cultural analysis from The Atlantic suggests that audience tastes may be shifting from escapist "comfort TV" toward shows that induce anxiety and reflect real-world pressures. Series like "The Bear" and "The Pitt" utilize hyperrealistic filmmaking and real-time tension to immerse viewers in high-stress environments, a formula that has resonated and earned critical acclaim. Psychologists suggest that watching such shows can create a form of "vicarious stress" that is engaging because it's relatable and risk-free. This trend may indicate a waning appetite for pure spectacle and a growing desire for catharsis through stories that acknowledge the mundane, everyday anxieties of modern life.</p>

          <p>Design software company Figma priced its IPO at $33 per share, exceeding its initial range of $30 to $32 and raising $1.2 billion. The offering values the company at $19.3 billion, just shy of the $20 billion valuation from its collapsed acquisition deal with Adobe, which was blocked by regulators in 2023. The successful pricing indicates a strengthening market for tech IPOs, following strong debuts from other companies earlier in the year. Figma, founded in 2012, has shown robust revenue growth, with sales for the most recent quarter up approximately 40% year-over-year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article in the Los Angeles Times makes a case for several independent and avant-garde Latin artists who deserve recognition at the upcoming Latin Grammy Awards. While major commercial acts are likely to dominate nominations, the piece argues that some of the most creative and progressive music of the year comes from artists without major label backing. The list of deserving artists includes Argentine electronic musician Juana Aguirre, Chilean songwriter Gepe, and Guatemalan-born cellist Mabe Fratti. The piece champions their innovative work, suggesting they should be considered for top categories like Album of the Year, not just niche alternative fields.</p>

          <p>Singer Nezza has released her Spanish-language rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner," titled "El Pendón Estrellado," as an official single. The release follows a controversy last month when she performed the song at Dodger Stadium, reportedly against the wishes of a team representative who had asked her to sing in English. Nezza stated her performance was a response to ongoing immigration sweeps in Los Angeles and an act of solidarity with the Latino community. A portion of the proceeds from the new recording will be donated to A Place Called Home, a South-Central L.A. youth organization, and various immigrant rights groups.</p>
