          <h2>Survey Reveals Few German Employees Fear Job Loss Due to Artificial Intelligence</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-14 07:13:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey by health insurer AOK indicates that only about 5% of employees in Germany are concerned that artificial intelligence could threaten their jobs within the next five years. The vast majority of respondents reported feeling unconcerned, although the survey also revealed a limited understanding of AI, with fewer than 40% having received any related training. This widespread complacency contrasts with expert analysis suggesting that nearly 40% of German jobs involve tasks that could be automated. The findings highlight a potential disconnect between public perception and the transformative impact AI is expected to have on the workforce.</p>

          <p>China's military is training soldiers to become "human abacuses" by using an ancient mental calculation technique as a backup for when advanced technology fails in combat situations. A recent state broadcast showcased a drill where a soldier mentally calculated the trajectories of multiple targets in seconds after a simulated radar failure, enabling precise targeting with analog tools. This training highlights a strategy to ensure operational readiness in high-stakes scenarios where sophisticated electronic systems could be compromised or destroyed. The promotion of these skills aligns with a broader national push to bolster military confidence and capability.</p>

          <p>Maine Governor Janet Mills has officially entered the 2026 U.S. Senate race, launching a campaign to unseat longtime Republican incumbent Susan Collins. Mills, a Democrat, is seen as a strong contender by the national party, but her entry sets up a potentially divisive primary against progressive challengers like Graham Platner, who has been endorsed by Senator Bernie Sanders. The race is expected to be a key battleground as Democrats aim to regain a majority in the Senate. Collins has a long history of winning in Maine, successfully defending her seat against a well-funded challenge in 2020.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has passed a series of new laws aimed at protecting children online by regulating artificial intelligence chatbots and social media platforms. One landmark law requires chatbots to disclose that they are AI and to periodically remind minor users to take breaks. Other bills mandate that social media apps add labels warning of potential mental health risks and increase penalties for the distribution of deepfake pornography. Another key law requires device makers like Apple and Google to implement age verification tools in their app stores, reflecting growing concerns over the impact of technology on youth.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in economics has been awarded to economic historian Joel Mokyr, along with Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt, for their research explaining how technology drives sustained economic growth. Mokyr's work focuses on why the Industrial Revolution began in Britain, highlighting the role of the Enlightenment in fostering scientific discovery and, crucially, its practical application by a skilled class of entrepreneurs and mechanics. Aghion and Howitt's theories center on "creative destruction," the process where new technologies replace outdated ones, which they argue is essential for progress. Their collective work provides a framework for understanding innovation's importance in modern economies.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams are taking an unconventional approach to prepare for their upcoming game in London against the Jacksonville Jaguars. After defeating the Baltimore Ravens, the team will remain on the East Coast, using the Baltimore Orioles' baseball stadium, Camden Yards, as their temporary training facility for the week. This strategy aims to help players acclimate to the time zone changes more gradually before flying to London. The extended road trip requires adjustments to player routines, but team leadership and veteran players view it as an opportunity for focused preparation and team bonding in a different environment.</p>

          <p>Perimenopause, the transitional stage before menopause, can significantly affect mental health due to fluctuating hormone levels, particularly estrogen. These hormonal shifts can lead to symptoms like anxiety, depression, irritability, and brain fog, which are often mistaken for stress or burnout. The decline in estrogen can disrupt brain functions related to mood and cognition, while also indirectly causing issues like insomnia through hot flashes and night sweats. Experts recommend lifestyle adjustments such as diet changes, exercise, and symptom tracking, as well as medical options like hormone therapy, to help manage these challenging mental health symptoms.</p>
