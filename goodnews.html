          <p>Acoustic piano sales have plummeted dramatically, from over 300,000 in 1925 to just over 17,000 in 2024, reflecting cultural shifts away from traditional family gatherings around the instrument. Economic factors, particularly for millennials struggling with homeownership, also contribute to this decline. However, the article highlights a resurgence in piano playing through digital and hybrid pianos, which offer more affordable and compact options. Piano technicians and music retailers are optimistic that these modern alternatives provide accurate sounds and functional keys, fostering a new generation of players who may eventually seek the musicality of acoustic instruments.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), a denomination historically characterized by its predominantly white membership, has installed the Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, signifying a landmark moment. Curry, who previously served as a regional bishop for the Metropolitan Chicago Synod, commences his six-year term, succeeding the first woman to hold the ELCA's top leadership position. His election is widely viewed as a crucial advancement towards fostering greater diversity and inclusion within the church, which has recently navigated challenges such as declining membership and theological debates concerning LGBTQ+ inclusion.

          <p>Costco has partnered with Novo Nordisk to offer GLP-1 anti-obesity medications like Ozempic and Wegovy to its members at approximately half the usual cost. Through its prescription program, members with a valid prescription can purchase a four-week supply for $499, an offer exclusively for those paying out of pocket due to limited insurance coverage. This move addresses soaring drug prices and limited supply, which have driven some consumers to seek cheaper, compounded versions. This article suggests Costco's entry could significantly boost access and demand for these popular weight-loss drugs, which nearly 12% of Americans have already used. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been officially added to the Dodgers' National League Division Series roster, signaling his expected return to playoff contention after being omitted from the wild-card round.

          <p>Xavier Booker, a 6-foot-11 forward, is embracing a new role as center for UCLA, a strategic career reboot after two underperforming seasons at Michigan State. Head coach Mick Cronin specifically recruited Booker to play closer to the basket, emphasizing traditional big-man skills such as rim protection, rebounding, and finishing, rather than his previous focus on perimeter shooting. Booker has diligently committed to the physical demands of the position, gaining weight and refining his post moves. This article highlights his unique combination of size, athleticism, and latent shooting ability, suggesting that this new focus could enable him to become a dominant force in college basketball, moving beyond his past miscasting.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are increasingly recommending that investors consider boosting their exposure to international markets, pointing out a significant "home bias" among U.S. investors who disproportionately allocate funds domestically. Despite American stocks recently achieving record highs, the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF recorded a notable nearly 3% gain this week, reaching a 52-week high, indicating potentially better value opportunities overseas. This article emphasizes that diversifying into specific international funds or countries, particularly in rapidly developing emerging markets like India, presents substantial growth potential. Experts attribute India's appeal to its vast population, advantageous demographics, and accelerated economic growth, which are robustly driving consumption, akin to China's earlier market expansion.
