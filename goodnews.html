          <p>At 45 years old, pitcher Rich Hill is set to make his debut for the Kansas City Royals, which will be his 14th Major League Baseball team. This move will tie the record for the most teams played for by a single player, a mark currently held by Edwin Jackson. Hill's career has spanned 20 seasons and includes notable stints with the Los Angeles Dodgers and Boston Red Sox. His start against the Chicago Cubs will make him the oldest pitcher to start an MLB game since 2012, showcasing remarkable longevity in a demanding professional sport.</p>

          <p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff is scheduled to travel to Europe to continue pushing for a ceasefire and peace deal in the Israel-Hamas conflict. According to officials, indirect negotiations are ongoing, with mediators awaiting Hamas's response to a recent proposal for a 60-day truce. A key sticking point remains the positioning of Israeli forces within Gaza during the ceasefire. The Trump administration is described as cautiously optimistic about a potential breakthrough that could lead to the release of hostages and an influx of humanitarian aid.</p>

          <p>Following his passing at age 76, this article reflects on Ozzy Osbourne's essential musical contributions, both with Black Sabbath and as a solo artist. It highlights ten key songs, from the proto-metal urgency of "Paranoid" to the anti-war anthem "War Pigs" and the iconic power ballad "Mama, I'm Coming Home." The piece characterizes Osbourne as a soulful balladeer within a headbanger's persona who helped invent and popularize the heavy-metal genre. His work is noted for its emotional depth, which transcended the typical boundaries of the genre he pioneered.</p>

          <h2>Trump Considers Eliminating Capital Gains Tax on Home Sales</h2>

          <p>President Trump has indicated he is considering the elimination of the federal capital gains tax on home sales, a move that would significantly alter real estate taxation. Currently, sellers can exclude up to $250,000 (or $500,000 for joint filers) in profit from their taxable income, a threshold unchanged since 1997. Proponents argue that removing the tax would unlock housing inventory by encouraging older homeowners to sell, while critics contend it would primarily benefit wealthy individuals and could further inflate home prices. The proposal aims to address market stagnation but raises concerns about housing affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has released the framework for a trade agreement with Indonesia that would see Jakarta eliminate most tariffs on American imports. In return, U.S. tariffs on Indonesian goods would be set at 19%, a rate lower than the 32% initially proposed under President Trump's broader tariff plan. The deal also includes future commercial agreements for aircraft and energy products valued at several billion dollars. Final negotiations are underway to formalize the agreement, which aims to provide U.S. producers with greater access to the Indonesian market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has drawn attention for his choice of hiking attire after being photographed climbing Camelback Mountain in Arizona in dark blue jeans. The hike took place as temperatures exceeded 90°F, prompting online commentary and confusion about his decision to wear denim in the extreme heat. Kennedy, 71, is known for his unconventional exercise habits, having previously been filmed working out in jeans. The CDC, part of his own department, recommends wearing lightweight, light-colored clothing to prevent heat-related illness during hot weather.</p>

          <p>Recently passed legislation has created a new income-driven student loan repayment option called the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), which will become available to borrowers by July 2026. Under RAP, monthly payments will range from 1% to 10% of a borrower's adjusted gross income, with a minimum payment of $10, and loan forgiveness will occur after 30 years. As the government phases out other repayment plans, RAP may become the primary affordable choice for new borrowers, who will also receive a $50 monthly credit per qualifying dependent.

          <p>Venture capital funding for artificial intelligence startups reached a massive $104.3 billion in the first half of the year, nearly matching the total for all of 2024. Major investments in companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have driven this boom, with AI now accounting for almost two-thirds of all U.S. venture funding. However, the exit market tells a different story, with only $36 billion realized through acquisitions and IPOs. This indicates that while investors are pouring unprecedented amounts of capital into the sector, lucrative returns through public listings or sales remain comparatively scarce.
