          <p>President Trump has appointed Todd Blanche, his former defense lawyer, as the acting Librarian of Congress, raising eyebrows due to Blanche's lack of experience in libraries or archives. The appointment follows the firing of Carla Hayden, the previous Librarian of Congress, who was targeted by conservative groups. Blanche, previously known for his work in investigations and criminal litigation, including defending Trump in a hush money trial, will now oversee the largest library in the world. The Library of Congress is a legislative branch agency, and has not yet received direction from Congress on how to move forward.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire between India and Pakistan, brokered by the US, has held for a second day, halting fighting that some analysts say was the most serious since 1971. The ceasefire has not affected India's suspension of a water treaty, which Pakistan views as an existential threat. Prime Minister Modi ruled out discussions on the water treaty, saying talks would focus only on Kashmir and terrorism. Civilians welcomed the stop in fighting, but many remain displaced.</p>

          <p>Despite trade deals with China and the UK, the U.S. tariff rate remains higher than any point since the 1930s, according to a Yale Budget Lab report. The average effective tariff rate is 17.8%, a 15.4 percentage point increase from before Trump's second term. These policies are expected to cost the average household $2,800 in the short term. Consumers are likely to alter their buying habits to avoid higher costs.</p>
