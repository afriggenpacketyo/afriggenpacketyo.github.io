          <p>The European Union is intensifying its "de-risking" strategy from China by developing plans to regain control over key industrial sectors and reduce dependencies on Chinese supply chains. These efforts include measures like stockpiling, implementing stricter trade defenses, and diversifying supply sources for critical materials where China holds a near-monopoly. The initiative is part of a broader EU agenda that views economic resilience and industrial policy as essential tools for geopolitical alignment. This reflects a growing acknowledgment of the challenges posed by China's economic dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thirty-one workers were successfully rescued following the collapse of a large wastewater management tunnel under construction in Los Angeles. The incident occurred several miles from the access portal, but the trapped individuals were able to navigate over a pile of debris to safety. An extensive rescue operation involving over 100 LAFD personnel, including Urban Search and Rescue teams, was launched. All workers were brought to the surface and evaluated by paramedics, with no serious injuries reported in what officials called a "great outcome."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has decided against implementing a "zonal pricing" system for electricity, which would have set bills based on a consumer's location relative to energy generation sources. Instead, it will pursue reforms to the existing national pricing system. Proponents argued zonal pricing could lower bills in energy-rich areas like Scotland, but some energy firms warned it might deter investment. The industry group Energy UK welcomed the decision for providing policy clarity, though critics argue the move fails to address deeper issues in the electricity market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A combination of sporting success and diplomatic progress is fostering a sense of optimism in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The men's national football team is on the verge of qualifying for the World Cup for the first time since 1974, while a new peace deal with Rwanda offers hope for an end to decades of conflict in the country's eastern region. If stability is achieved, it could allow for the resumption of local football leagues and greater investment in sports infrastructure.

          <p>A journalist recounts taking his neurodivergent nine-year-old son to his first professional soccer game, a Club World Cup semi-final at MetLife Stadium. The overwhelming noise and spectacle of the FIFA-organized event initially caused his son distress, leading to tears. However, empathetic stadium staff provided noise-canceling headphones and moved the family to a quieter area, transforming the experience. The article reflects on how this act of human kindness shone through the commercialism of modern sports, providing a valuable perspective on the game's impact beyond the corporate veneer.</p>

          <p>Owen Farrell has been selected as a replacement for the British and Irish Lions' upcoming match against an Australia/New Zealand Invitational XV. This will be the final tour game before the highly anticipated Test series against Australia begins. The selection marks a potential return to high-level rugby for Farrell, who recently joined the tour as an injury replacement and has not played in over two months. The match also provides a key opportunity for other players, such as scrum-half Ben White and full-back Hugo Keenan, to make their case for a spot in the Test squad.</p>

          <p>An article in the People's Liberation Army Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese military, has called for careful ethical and legal consideration regarding the use of humanoid robots in combat. The analysis warned against falling into "moral pitfalls" and cited science fiction author Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. The authors argued that militarized humanoid robots would inherently violate the first law, which prohibits a robot from injuring a human being. The piece underscores growing global concerns about the ethical implications of autonomous weapons systems.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is concluding a three-day state visit to the U.K., which has been filled with royal pageantry, including a state banquet with King Charles III. While the visit aims to strengthen Franco-British ties on issues like migration and defense, it is overshadowed by the looming threat of U.S. trade tariffs. The unpredictable nature of the Trump administration's trade policy is a major concern for both nations and the wider EU. Hopes are rising for a U.S.-EU trade deal, but the terms remain uncertain as European leaders navigate the complex geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have announced a major breakthrough in autonomous surgery, with a robot successfully performing a gallbladder removal on a life-like model. The machine, which was trained using videos of human surgeries and powered by an AI similar to ChatGPT, operated with the skill of an expert human surgeon. It was able to adapt to unexpected scenarios and respond to voice commands, demonstrating a significant leap from pre-programmed robotic tasks to truly understanding surgical procedures. The team believes this shows that clinically viable autonomous surgical systems are now a realistic possibility.</p>
