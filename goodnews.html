          <p>Nvidia's shares surged after the company reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, sparking a rally in semiconductor stocks worldwide. Despite facing headwinds from US chip export restrictions to China, Nvidia's financial results exceeded market expectations, allaying fears about dwindling demand for its graphics processing units. The company wrote off $4.5 billion of H20 chip inventory due to export curbs, also calculating $2.5 billion of lost revenue. The positive results from Nvidia, considered a bellwether for the semiconductor industry, boosted shares of companies like Tokyo Electron, SK Hynix, ASM International, and Qualcomm.

          <p>Global markets rallied after a US court blocked President Trump from imposing some of his steepest tariffs, easing concerns about a trade war's impact on economic and corporate growth. Futures for the S&P 500 index jumped, driven by the court ruling and strong earnings from chip giant Nvidia. While the ruling is subject to appeal, it has lifted investor sentiment and reduced some uncertainty in the market. The dollar rose, oil prices increased, and gold prices slipped as investors reacted to the news, with analysts suggesting that extreme tariffs are now less likely in the long run.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an era marked by increasing cruelty and exploitation, the author argues for embracing subversive kindness and promoting images of hospitality. The article contrasts the aesthetics of exploitation, such as videos of migrants being chained, with images of people embracing prisoners and welcoming those from foreign lands. Drawing on experiences in the Foreign Service and observations of figures like Pope Francis, the author emphasizes the power of small moments of encounter to transform individuals and combat violence. The author's forthcoming novel seeks to capture these moments of communion in the face of neo-Nazis' dark impulses.</p>
