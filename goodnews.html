          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 13:39:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that families can sue the federal government for damages caused by wrong-house raids conducted by federal law enforcement, protecting victims of misconduct. The decision revives a lawsuit filed by Trina Martin and Toi Cliatt, whose Atlanta home was mistakenly raided by the FBI in 2017, causing property damage and emotional distress to Martin's young son. Justice Neil Gorsuch noted that while the Federal Tort Claims Act permits some suits for wrong-house raids, the scope of its permission is not entirely clear, and the case has been remanded to a lower court for further consideration regarding potential legal defenses the FBI could invoke. The ruling confirms that victims of federal abuse have a tool to seek accountability. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 13:29:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of gold could potentially reach a new record high this week, surpassing $3,400 per ounce, due to the recent uptick in inflation. The inflation report release showed a 0.1% rise in the rate for May, moving away from the Federal Reserve's desired trend. Historically, rising inflation tends to drive investors to gold as a safe-haven asset. Geopolitical tensions also contribute to the potential for increased gold prices, with trade deals and overseas stability influencing investor motivation to hold gold. (not investment advice)</p>

He added that he offered to play in friendly matches before the Gold Cup but was declined, and expressed disappointment with criticism from former players.

          <p>The charitable foundation launched by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and his wife, Lori, has experienced significant growth due to the company's soaring stock price. Over the past five years, the foundation's assets have increased from $828 million to over $9.1 billion, making it one of the 15 largest private foundations in the U.S. This growth is primarily attributed to Nvidia shares donated by Huang to the foundation, which have surged in value. The foundation is now required to distribute a substantial amount of its assets annually, with an estimated $369 million to be given this year. </p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar has fallen to a three-year low, while the FTSE 100 reached a record high, driven by concerns over Trump's trade policies and a weakening U.S. economy. Investors are selling the dollar in favor of the yen and the euro, with the dollar down nearly 10% against a basket of currencies since the start of the year. The FTSE 100 closed at 8,884 points, surpassing its previous high, as investors seek alternatives to U.S. shares.

          <p>The New York City mayoral race is heating up with former Governor Andrew Cuomo facing a strong challenge from democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in a ranked-choice election. Cuomo, with a substantial r√©sum√© and financial backing, is facing criticism for his past scandals and unpopularity, while Mamdani, a progressive with grassroots support, is gaining traction with his policy proposals. The ranked-choice voting system is complicating the race, as candidates are considering cross-endorsements and voters strategize on how to rank their choices. The primary election is being held in June of an odd year, meaning most city residents will not vote. </p>

Analysts attribute Oracle's resurgence to a new wave of enterprise popularity not seen since the Internet era, with the company making headway in the cloud infrastructure market.

          <p>A teenager who was tricked into moving to boarding school in Africa has won a legal victory against his parents, with the Court of Appeal ordering the case to be reheard. The 14-year-old boy was taken from London to Ghana after being told a relative was ill, and he claims he is culturally displaced and alienated. The parents say they wanted to get him out of London because they feared he was being drawn into criminal activity. The case centers on the question of parental responsibility and whether the parents acted unlawfully by sending their son to boarding school without his consent. </p>
