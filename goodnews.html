He emphasized that while Biden has had a remarkable life and demonstrated resilience, this does not negate the fact that running for reelection was a misjudgment.</p>

          <p>The 40th anniversary of Nike's Air Jordan is being celebrated, recalling the company's significant investment in then-rookie Michael Jordan. Howard White, a Nike veteran, recounts the initial meeting with Jordan, whose parents had to persuade him to attend. Nike offered Jordan $2.5 million, triple what any other player was making, and hoped to net $3 million in four years, but instead, they sold $126 million in the first year alone. The Air Jordan brand now generates approximately $7 billion annually for Nike, with Jordan remaining actively involved in the design and operation.</p>

          <p>The UK's strawberry season is experiencing a "stonking start" due to warm days and cool nights, resulting in sweeter than usual fruit. Growers report a "really good crop" with strawberries of good size and exceptional sweetness, attributed to lower night temperatures allowing the fruit to concentrate energy into natural sugars. Despite drought warnings, farmers have irrigation systems in place, though rain would still be welcomed. This contrasts with the delayed ripening experienced in 2024 due to a wet winter, with the warmer weather leading to increased production and lush-sweet tasting fruit.</p>

          <p>Actor Christian Bale is spearheading the construction of Together California, a foster care home designed to keep orphaned siblings together, inspired by the fact that up to 75% of siblings are separated in the foster care system. Bale emphasizes the importance of keeping siblings together to mitigate trauma and believes society should prioritize caring for its children. He recruited Tim McCormick, a veteran foster home operator, to help create the village-like setting in Los Angeles, aiming to provide a nurturing environment where foster parents can focus solely on the children's well-being. Bale considers this project one of his greatest accomplishments.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence is advising President Donald Trump to reject the gift of a $400 million jet from the Qatari royal family, citing national security concerns. Pence emphasized Qatar's history of "playing both sides" and argued that accepting such a gift is inconsistent with U.S. security and intelligence needs. Trump, however, has stated that the plane would be donated to the U.S. Department of Defense and would not be personally owned by him, aiming to save American taxpayers money. Pence suggests that if Qatar wishes to make a gift, they should invest in infrastructure on a U.S. military base.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has discovered that a document in its archives, previously thought to be a copy, is an original version of King Edward I's reaffirmation of the Magna Carta. The discovery coincides with President Trump's decision to freeze federal grants and contracts to the university, which he accuses of promoting radical left ideology. The Magna Carta, a symbol of rights and limits on power, serves as a reminder of the importance of checks and balances, particularly during a time when the administration values loyalty above all. The article suggests that this discovery is a reminder of the importance of pushing back and that no person is above the law.</p>
