          <h2>China Reveals New Military Drone with Vertical Takeoff and Landing Capabilities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 22:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has unveiled a new unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that can take off and land vertically on its tail, similar to a rocket. Developed by the state-owned Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, the drone recently completed a reconnaissance test in a mountainous region, demonstrating its advanced autonomous capabilities. The design, which resembles the U.S. military's V-BAT drone, allows for high-speed flight combined with the flexibility of not needing a runway. This makes it highly adaptable for deployment in remote or rugged terrains for military operations.</p>

          <h2>Homeland Security Secretary Signals Potential Easing of TSA Liquid Restrictions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:34:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is reviewing its long-standing restrictions on liquids in carry-on baggage. Speaking at a conference, Noem said she is questioning "everything TSA does" and that the rules on liquid sizes might be the next policy to change. This follows the recent elimination of the requirement for passengers to remove shoes during security screening. The current "3-1-1" rule for liquids was implemented in 2006 after a foiled terrorist plot involving liquid explosives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An ice core, believed to be the oldest ever retrieved at over 1.5 million years old, has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey for analysis. Drilled from deep within the Antarctic ice sheet, the core contains trapped air bubbles, dust, and volcanic ash that hold crucial information about Earth's past climate. Scientists will carefully melt the ice to study these ancient materials, hoping to understand a mysterious shift in the planet's glacial cycles that occurred around one million years ago. The findings could provide vital insights into the mechanisms of long-term climate change.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes volatile fresh food prices, cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high. The easing was partly attributed to a slight decline in the rapid pace of rice price increases, though inflation has now remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months. This data comes amid concerns over economic growth due to U.S. tariffs and the rising cost of living. While persistent inflation could support an interest rate hike, some analysts believe the central bank will wait until 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New regulations in the United Kingdom will require "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) providers like Klarna and Clearpay to conduct stricter affordability checks on shoppers starting next July. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is implementing the rules to prevent consumers from accumulating excessive debt and to provide them with greater protections, such as the right to complain to the Financial Ombudsman. While the move is praised by debt charities, it means some consumers may be refused credit, and it could slow down the seamless checkout process that made BNPL services popular.

Slovakia had been holding up the unanimous approval required from all 27 member states due to concerns over a separate EU plan to phase out Russian gas imports. Fico stated that Slovakia received guarantees from the EU regarding its future energy security, making it "counterproductive" to continue the blockade. The new sanctions target Russia's energy and banking sectors, including further restrictions on its oil trade.</p>
