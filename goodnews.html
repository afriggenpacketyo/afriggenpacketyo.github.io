          <p>Daniel Noboa was sworn in as Ecuador's President for a second term, vowing to combat corruption, drug trafficking, and violent crime. Noboa, who first became president in November 2023, pledged to implement reforms and foster job creation by collaborating with the private sector. Violence and high unemployment are significant challenges for his administration, which holds a narrow majority in Congress. Experts suggest Noboa will likely maintain his focus on using state power to combat crime, though some emphasize the need to address the root causes of violence by improving opportunities in jobs, healthcare, and education.</p>

          <p>Arsenal Women defied the odds to win the Women's Champions League, overcoming challenges including finishing third in the Women's Super League last season and playing 15 games before lifting the trophy. Written off as underdogs, the team, under interim manager Slegers, gained momentum after a rocky start to the season. Slegers, who took charge in October, was permanently appointed in January after an unbeaten run, steadying the ship and leading Arsenal to comeback victories against Real Madrid and Lyon. The team's historic victory in 2007 served as inspiration for this year's squad.</p>
