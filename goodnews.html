          <p>The United Kingdom has recorded its hottest day of the year, with temperatures exceeding 32¬∞C, and Suffolk has become the first area to officially enter a heatwave after surpassing 27¬∞C for three consecutive days. Amber heat health alerts are in effect across England until Monday, raising concerns about increased pressure on health and social care services. The Met Office forecasts temperatures could reach 33¬∞C on Saturday in central and eastern England, with possible "tropical nights" where temperatures remain above 20¬∞C. Regional fire services are issuing water safety warnings, while health organizations advise precautions for those with heart conditions and encourage checking on elderly neighbors as the heatwave continues. The rising temperatures are due to an area of high pressure across the UK drawing in hot weather from Western Europe. Optimism is mixed as authorities are preparing for the worst case scenario.</p>

He has six children conceived naturally with three different partners and over 100 children fathered through sperm donations. Durov also mentioned his strict daily routine, which includes intense workouts and abstaining from alcohol, coffee, tea, and sugar, as well as his denial of charges by French authorities alleging Telegram is used for criminal activities.</p>

The BRICS grouping is seen as a counter to Western-led forums, and Russia has proposed deepening military, security, trade, and nuclear ties with Indonesia.

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers are undergoing a major shift as the majority ownership is being sold to Mark Walter, president of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and his group TWGC Global, valuing the franchise at $10 billion. This move is seen as a positive change for the Lakers, who have lacked a sustained championship vision since the death of Jerry Buss in 2013. Walter's group is expected to invest heavily in the team's infrastructure, coaching staff, and scouting, similar to their successful revitalization of the Dodgers. The new ownership may lead to changes in player dynamics, with less sentimentality towards aging superstars like LeBron James, and a stronger focus on building a championship-winning team, rather than catering to individual players.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has extended the deadline for TikTok's sale in the US for another 90 days, marking the third delay in enforcing the law requiring the app to be sold by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The extension allows more time for a deal to be reached for the sale of TikTok in the US, which must now occur by September 17, according to Trump. The law was prompted by concerns that TikTok or ByteDance could be forced to hand over data on US users to the Chinese government, a risk that TikTok denies. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the extension aims to ensure the deal is closed, safeguarding the data of American users.</p>

The defense argued that Read was framed by a group of people, including law enforcement, and that O'Keefe was involved in a fight inside another home before his death.

          <p>Roberto Minervini's "The Damned" strips away the traditional elements of a war film to create an existential drama set during the Civil War. The film follows a group of volunteer soldiers in the U.S. Army, focusing on their everyday lives and internal struggles rather than combat. Minervini's naturalistic style and collaboration with the cast create a sense of place and time, highlighting the uncertainties and spiritual purgatory of the soldiers. By avoiding typical antiwar tropes, the film offers a prescient exploration of the economic inequalities, brutality, and thwarted masculinity that continue to plague America.</p>

          <p>The Buss family has agreed to sell a majority stake in the Los Angeles Lakers to businessman Mark Walter, CEO and co-founder of Guggenheim Partners, valuing the team at $10 billion. This sale sets a new record for NBA valuations, with Jeanie Buss retaining a minority stake and her position as governor. Walter, who also owns the Los Angeles Dodgers and other sports teams, has received praise from former Lakers legend Magic Johnson for his ability to carry on the team's legacy. NBA valuations have significantly increased since the league's latest media rights agreement, with the sale reflecting the Lakers' status as a marquee franchise.</p>

          <p>The upcoming Test series between England and India is being viewed as a defining moment for the England team under captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum. This series, along with the subsequent Ashes series, will determine whether the team is remembered as glorious winners or simply ideological entertainers. Stokes' leadership and McCullum's coaching have already had a significant impact, but success in these major series would solidify their legacy. Stokes has said that he's not worried about what other people are going to say about what he's done as a captain at the end of it, and that the results will be the results and hopefully they'll have more in favor than not.</p>

          <h2>Public Pools Are Vital for Community Health</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Public pools are essential for mental, physical, and social well-being, offering a place for exercise, relaxation, and community interaction. Swimming boosts moods and provides a sense of buoyancy and embrace, offering a unique and beneficial experience. Historically, public pools served as social hubs, but desegregation led to a decline in their use as some retreated to private pools, creating racial tensions. Revitalizing public pools can provide equitable access to these benefits, promoting health, happiness, and community cohesion.</p>

          <h2>Wales to Ban Plastic Wet Wipes in 2026</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 12:58:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wales will ban plastic wet wipes starting in December 2026, becoming the first UK nation to implement such a ban to reduce environmental harm. The motion passed in the Senedd prohibits supplying wet wipes containing plastic to customers, with exemptions for medical-grade wipes and business-to-business supply. The Deputy First Minister stated that this action is another step towards reducing plastic and microplastic pollution, encouraging manufacturers and consumers to shift towards reusable and non-plastic products. Research from Cardiff University highlighted the significant risk wet wipes pose to the environment, contributing to sewage blockages and river pollution.</p>
