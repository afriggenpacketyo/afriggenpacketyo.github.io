          <p>The Eurobasket 2025 basketball championship will be jointly hosted by Cyprus, Poland, Finland, and Latvia, aiming to capitalize on the growing number of European NBA stars. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the tournament, highlighting the participation of NBA talents like Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Luka Doncic, despite some notable absences. It details key differences between FIBA and NBA rules, such as shorter quarters and a closer three-point line, which often lead to tighter games. Serbia is considered the heavy favorite, though defending champions Spain and World Championship winners Germany also have strong title aspirations, reflecting the continent's rising basketball prowess.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Transport for London (TfL) has launched a new campaign urging passengers to use headphones or hands-free kits for mobile devices, addressing the "disruptive behavior" of playing music or making calls on loudspeakers. TfL's research indicates that 70% of surveyed passengers find such noise a nuisance, with some finding it highly stressful, particularly those with sensitivities like autism. Posters will appear across the Elizabeth line and other services, reminding travelers that TfL by-laws prohibit loud content without permission. Enforcement officers can ask individuals to stop, and refusal may lead to removal from service or prosecution, reflecting a broader push for quieter public spaces, as seen in a similar fine in France.</p>

          <p>A Chinese woman, identified as Zhou, was dramatically rescued after being trapped in a guesthouse room for 30 hours, with no food or toilet access. She managed to alert authorities by biting her finger and writing "110 625" in blood on a pillow, which she then threw from her sixth-floor window. The message, containing the emergency number and her room number, was spotted by a food delivery driver, Zhang Kun, who promptly called the police. Videos show a disheveled Zhou thanking officers after they kicked open the malfunctioning door. Zhang was subsequently awarded 3,000 yuan for his quick thinking and good Samaritan act.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand is projected to continue weakening over the central Atlantic Ocean in the coming days, posing no threat to land. The National Hurricane Center reported Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is located east-northeast of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph and is moving northeast. Forecasters anticipate it will transition into a post-tropical cyclone later tonight or early Wednesday before fully dissipating by Thursday. This development follows an above-normal hurricane season forecast by NOAA, with the previous Hurricane Erin also remaining offshore despite reaching Category 5 intensity.</p>

          <h2>Congressional Budget Office Report Sparks Debate on Trump's Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 05:00:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report indicates that tariffs implemented under President Trump could significantly reduce primary deficits by $3.3 trillion over the next decade, with an additional $0.7 trillion in reduced interest outlays, totaling $4.0 trillion in deficit reduction. This article, an opinion piece, highlights the surprising findings that challenge conventional free-trade arguments, as inflation has not spiked, and growth has not plummeted. Economists remain divided, with some acknowledging tariffs as a threat to promote freer trade, while others emphasize that tariffs are ultimately a tax that can diminish domestic incomes. The article also raises constitutional questions about presidential authority to impose such sweeping edicts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has launched the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (Juno) in Guangdong province, establishing it as the world's largest and most powerful detector for elusive "ghost particles" known as neutrinos. The massive facility has commenced data collection, housed in a 20,000-ton liquid scintillator detector 700 meters underground. Juno's primary mission is to measure the mass of different neutrino types produced by nearby nuclear power plants. Particle physicist Wang Yifang hailed the completion of the detector filling and the start of data-taking as a "historic milestone" for the international project, initially proposed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2008.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, Becky Copeland, a Park Ranger, discovered a high school ID belonging to Catherine Hamel on Horn Island, Mississippi. Hamel, who lost everything when the storm decimated her home in Bay Saint Louis, was reunited with the ID after its details became legible over time. The ID, found 55 miles from her former home, was likely carried by floodwaters in a metal box. This article highlights the enduring impact of Katrina, which displaced thousands and left many with little physical connection to their past. The return of this small memento offers a poignant, albeit rare, instance of recovery and connection to a lost history.</p>

          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot expressed strong criticism of Newcastle United's tactical approach during his side's 3-2 Premier League victory, stating he was "not too sure he saw a football match." The game, which saw Liverpool's 16-year-old Rio Ngumoha score a 100th-minute winner, was characterized by an exceptionally low ball-in-play time, the lowest in a Premier League match since 2010. Slot highlighted Newcastle's reliance on set-pieces and long throws, suggesting it lacked tactical depth. The feisty atmosphere, intensified by transfer rumors and a red card for Newcastle's Anthony Gordon, resulted in 32 fouls, the most in a Premier League game this season.</p>
