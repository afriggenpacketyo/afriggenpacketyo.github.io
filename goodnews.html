          <p>An unexploded World War II bomb discovered in the Spree River prompted the evacuation of thousands of people in a densely populated area of central Berlin. Authorities established a 500-meter security perimeter and opened emergency shelters to accommodate displaced residents overnight. The bomb was found during construction work, a common occurrence in German cities that necessitates checks for unexploded ordnance before major projects. The disposal operation, complicated by the bomb's underwater location, is scheduled for early Friday, with residents expected to return home afterward.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes volatile fresh food prices, fell to 2.7% in August, marking its lowest level since November 2024 and the third straight month of decline. The figure aligns with economists' expectations and comes as the Bank of Japan concludes a policy meeting where it is widely expected to maintain its current interest rates. Despite the easing inflation, which was partly driven by a softening in the surge of rice prices, analysts anticipate a potential rate hike in the near future to address economic resilience and lingering price pressures.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts at Forestry England anticipate an exceptionally vibrant autumn leaf display across the United Kingdom this year, attributing the phenomenon to the very warm and sunny summer. The favorable weather allowed trees to produce higher levels of sugar in their leaves, which leads to the creation of brighter red, orange, and gold pigments. While some trees experienced a 'false autumn' due to drought stress, recent rainfall has spurred some regrowth. The most spectacular colors are expected to emerge from mid-September and last into November, provided the weather remains mild with cool nights.</p>

          <p>A $60 million deal has at least temporarily saved Georgia's Okefenokee Swamp from the threat of a mineral mine proposed nearby. The Conservation Fund, a nonprofit, purchased the land from a company that had sought permits to mine for titanium and zirconium, a project that hydrologists warned could increase the risk of severe droughts and fires in the pristine wetland. The effort to protect the swamp was championed by a bipartisan coalition, including local Republican activists who argued for the preservation of the vital ecosystem. However, the fight may not be over, as other nearby private lands still hold mineral rights.</p>

          <p>Recent efforts by the Chinese government to curb a damaging price war in the solar-equipment industry appear to be yielding positive results, according to market analysts. A series of government-industry meetings and proposals, including limits on manufacturing power usage, have contributed to a recovery in prices for polysilicon and solar wafers. This price stabilization is expected to help leading manufacturers return to profitability after an extended period of losses. Analysts note that upstream solar product prices have risen, supported by policy sentiment favoring industry capacity consolidation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia has committed over $900 million in a deal to hire key employees from AI hardware startup Enfabrica, including its CEO Rochan Sankar, and to license the company's technology. The transaction, involving cash and stock, resembles recent 'acqui-hire' deals by other tech giants to secure top AI talent without a formal acquisition. Enfabrica, founded in 2019, specializes in networking technology that can connect vast numbers of GPUs, which could enhance Nvidia's ability to offer powerful, integrated AI systems. Nvidia had previously been an investor in the startup.</p>
