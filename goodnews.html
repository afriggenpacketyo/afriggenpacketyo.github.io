          <p>A recent FlexJobs report reveals that 76% of American workers would look for new employment if their companies mandated a full return to in-person work, a significant increase from last year. Remote work is now the top factor motivating job applications, surpassing salary and work-life balance for 85% of job seekers. Only 2% prefer full-time office work, highlighting a strong preference for flexibility. While companies push return-to-office for collaboration, many employees are resisting, with 27% knowing someone who quit or plans to quit over such requirements. This article suggests workers should proactively seek remote-friendly workplaces if flexibility is non-negotiable.</p>

This release, part of a ceasefire agreement, involved approximately 250 convicted prisoners and 1,700 detainees held without charge, in exchange for 20 Israeli hostages. While families expressed profound happiness, many reported that the released prisoners appeared gaunt and had faced beatings in Israeli detention, claims the BBC could not independently verify.

          <p>Jim Cramer, host of CNBC's "Mad Money," advocates for young investors to engage in "wise speculation" as a means of building long-term wealth. He suggests a portfolio strategy where about half is in diversified index funds, and the other half includes high-quality growth stocks, with one or two speculative investments. Cramer argues that youth offers the advantage of time to recover from potential losses in higher-risk ventures. He believes this approach, while some might deem it reckless, is actually prudent for maximizing returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southeast Asia has achieved a remarkable reduction in tobacco consumption since 2010, dropping from the highest per capita use globally to second place, now behind Europe. This significant decline, particularly among men, is attributed to society-wide efforts including government regulations, public health campaigns, and in-school education. The region is on track to meet the WHO's target of a 30% reduction in tobacco use by 2030. However, challenges remain, especially concerning the pervasive use of smokeless tobacco products and the rise of e-cigarettes among adolescents.
