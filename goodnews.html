          <h2>Democrats Should Prioritize Policy Over Messaging, Argues Vox Correspondent</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eric Levitz from Vox argues that Democrats should focus more on policy and governance rather than getting caught up in messaging debates. He references a recent poll from Demand Progress which suggests voters prefer a candidate who fights corporate power over one who focuses on regulatory bottlenecks. Levitz contends that the political case for abundance policies rests on their material benefits, such as addressing housing shortages and infrastructure inefficiencies, and not merely on rhetorical appeal. He suggests that Democrats can pursue both abundance liberalism and populism simultaneously, as there is no inherent conflict between the two approaches. The article suggests that Democrats need to understand why blue states struggle with housing and infrastructure in order to effectively serve working people.</p>

          <p>Vogue has declared the word "chic" to be overused and devoid of its original meaning, suggesting it has been co-opted to describe monied strains of taste rather than unique style. The author reflects on the overuse of "chic" and suggests rehabilitating alternative words like "snazzy," "trendy," and "swish" to add linguistic plurality. The article humorously explores the possibility of influencers describing luxury items with these older, more playful adjectives. Despite the call for change, the author anticipates that "chic" will remain a ubiquitous term.</p>

          <p>Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual is considering expanding its operations in Asia by opening a new office in Hong Kong. This move is driven by growing demand for data centers among Chinese AI firms and the strengthening trade and investment ties between China and Brazil. BTG executives recently toured major Chinese cities with a delegation of Brazilian entrepreneurs and family offices, seeking investment opportunities in Brazil's electricity sector and other areas. The potential revival of BTG's Hong Kong office reflects the deepening economic relationship between the two countries.</p>

          <p>California is moving towards mandating phonics-based reading instruction in schools, aiming to improve persistently low test scores. A bill moving through the legislature would require districts to adopt instructional materials based on the "science of reading," which emphasizes phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. This shift marks a departure from the "whole language" approach, which has been dominant in California for decades. The proposed law has garnered support from teachers unions and advocacy groups, but some remain concerned about its impact on English-language learners.</p>

          <p>California legislators are on the verge of significantly overhauling the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a landmark environmental law. Two proposals are advancing: one would exempt most urban housing developments from CEQA, and the other would weaken the rules for most other projects. These changes, endorsed by Governor Newsom, aim to streamline development and address the state's housing shortage. Opponents, including environmental and labor groups, argue that the changes would limit community groups' ability to shape development and reduce environmental protections.</p>

She suggests that students' embrace of AI reveals a utilitarian view of education, which undermines the true purpose of the humanities.

          <p>The UK government plans to modernize its airspace, potentially leading to quicker flights and fewer delays for passengers. The UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) will redesign flight paths, many of which were established 70 years ago. The changes are intended to allow planes to climb and descend more smoothly, reduce aviation's climate change impact, and pave the way for new technologies like flying taxis. However, a community aviation group warns that the plans could introduce new flight paths over previously unaffected residential areas.</p>

          <h2>Britain Boosts Defense Spending, Sending Messages to Moscow and Washington</h2>

          <p>The United Kingdom is increasing military spending to build new nuclear-powered attack submarines and create an army ready to fight in Europe. This defense boost is intended to send a message to Moscow and to demonstrate to Washington that Europe is taking its defense responsibilities seriously. The changes, prompted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the re-election of President Trump, include increasing weapons stockpiles and establishing a cyber command. While some welcome the increased spending, skepticism remains about the government's ability to meet its defense spending goals.</p>
