          <p>A volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, just days after a massive magnitude 8.8 earthquake struck the region. The eruption of the Krasheninnikov Volcano prompted an aviation alert as it sent a cloud of ash and gas 27,000 feet into the air. While officials state there is no immediate threat to the sparsely populated area, seismologists are investigating the strong possibility that the powerful earthquake may have triggered the subsequent volcanic activity, providing a rare opportunity to study the connection between these geological events.</p>

          <p>Marvel's "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" held the top spot at the North American box office for a second week, earning $40 million, though this represented a significant 66% decline from its debut. The animated sequel "The Bad Guys 2" opened in second place with a solid $22.2 million, while the reboot of "The Naked Gun" landed in third with $17 million. Analysts noted the sharp drop for the weekend's leader, which was steeper than other recent Marvel films. However, the overall summer box office is still tracking ahead of last year.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has indicated that the company is open to making a major acquisition if it can accelerate its product roadmap, a statement that has fueled speculation about a potential purchase of AI-chatbot company Perplexity. While Apple typically focuses on smaller "bolt-on" deals, acquiring Perplexity could instantly provide Apple with an established, monetizable AI model that aligns with its user-experience focus. Perplexity, currently valued at around $18 billion, has seen rapid growth in users and revenue, making it a costly but strategic target for Apple as it aims to bolster its position in the competitive AI landscape.

          <p>A small, magnitude 3.0 earthquake centered in northern New Jersey rattled parts of the New York City metropolitan area on Saturday night. The U.S. Geological Survey located the epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, at a depth of about 10 kilometers. While the quake was minor and no significant damage or injuries were reported, residents described a loud boom and brief, sharp shaking that startled them. This event follows a more notable magnitude 4.8 earthquake that struck the same region in April 2024, reminding residents that seismic activity, though rare, does occur on the East Coast.</p>

          <p>Pauline Ferrand-Prévot has won the Tour de France Femmes, making her the first Frenchwoman to claim victory in the prestigious race since its modern revival four years ago. The 33-year-old Olympic cross-country champion finished the grueling nine-day race with a commanding lead over her closest competitors. After the final Alpine stage, she called the victory a "dream come true," especially after shifting her focus from mountain biking back to road racing this season specifically to compete in Le Tour. Her win marks a historic moment for French cycling.</p>

          <p>Florida has quietly surpassed California in the installation of new utility-scale solar energy, adding over 3 gigawatts of capacity last year. This growth is primarily driven by utility companies like Florida Power & Light, which are taking advantage of streamlined regulations for projects under 75 megawatts and the falling cost of solar power. Despite the state government removing "climate change" from official policy, the economic advantages of solar over natural gas are fueling the boom. However, future growth faces challenges from the rollback of federal tax credits and increasing strain on the existing power grid. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Test match between England and India at The Oval is set for a tense conclusion, with the result hanging in the balance. England ended the fourth day needing just 35 more runs to secure a historic series win, but with only four wickets remaining. Centuries from England's Harry Brook and Joe Root put them in a strong position to chase down the target, but a late surge from India's bowlers shifted the momentum dramatically before bad light stopped play. The outcome on the final morning will determine whether the series ends 3-1 to England or a 2-2 draw.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced plans to impose prison sentences of up to five years for people smugglers who use social media to advertise illegal immigration services. This new measure aims to give law enforcement more tools to combat gangs that promote dangerous crossings of the English Channel online. According to the Home Office, a record 25,000 people have made the journey this year, with an estimated 80% using social media to connect with smugglers. The Labour government is under pressure to address the "small boats" crisis and views this as a key step.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers overcame a recent scoring slump to defeat the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0, relying on manufactured runs rather than power hitting. After struggling offensively for 18 straight innings, the Dodgers broke the deadlock with aggressive baserunning and situational hitting, including key RBI singles from Freddie Freeman. Pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5 ⅔ scoreless innings, and the bullpen closed out the game to secure a winning 5-4 record on their nine-game road trip. The victory provided a much-needed boost for the team amid ongoing concerns about its lineup performance.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed a compensation scheme for victims of car finance mis-selling, with potential payouts estimated to be less than £950 per deal. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while hidden commissions were not broadly unlawful, excessively high commissions could be deemed unfair. The FCA will consult on the details of the scheme, which could cover agreements dating back to 2007 and cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion.
