          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for accelerated efforts to build a unified national market, framing it as essential for China to gain a competitive advantage globally and achieve its development objectives. In an article published in the Communist Party's journal Qiushi, Xi outlined key tasks, with a primary focus on curbing excessive and damaging price competition among domestic firms. The directive encourages industry associations to prioritize product quality over low prices, signaling a strategic shift to strengthen internal economic cohesion and phase out obsolete industrial capacity.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 00:27:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite severe floods and heavy rains damaging large areas of farmland in India, particularly in the state of Punjab, economists forecast that the impact on overall inflation will be limited. Analysts suggest that sufficient cereal stocks and the contained nature of the crop damage will likely prevent consumer price growth from surpassing the central bank's 4% target midpoint. A recent cut in the goods and services tax is also expected to help keep inflation in check, providing the Reserve Bank of India with continued flexibility to implement monetary easing policies to support economic growth.

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to a "framework" deal concerning the U.S. operations of TikTok, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The agreement, reached during trade talks in Madrid, is intended to pave the way for American ownership of the popular social media app and address national security concerns. The final details are expected to be completed by President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Friday, just ahead of a looming deadline that would have banned the app in the U.S. if its parent company, ByteDance, did not divest.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has hired Mike Liberatore, the former chief financial officer of Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup xAI, to serve as its new business finance officer. Liberatore will be responsible for managing OpenAI's significant infrastructure spending as it continues to scale its operations. This move marks the latest development in the escalating rivalry between OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Musk, who were co-founders of OpenAI in 2015 but have since become competitors in the rapidly advancing AI industry. Liberatore's departure from xAI occurred after just three months with the company.</p>

          <p>A group of teenagers in Bradford, UK, participated in a five-day challenge to remove all technology from their bedrooms, leading to some unexpected positive outcomes. The teens, who typically spent hours on phones and gaming consoles in their rooms, reported sleeping better and feeling more rested for school. The experiment also prompted them to spend more time with family in common areas and discover new offline activities, such as baking and researching ballet lessons. While the participants found it difficult to be without their devices for private conversations, most acknowledged the benefits of the digital detox.</p>

          <p>Technology giant Oracle is reportedly a key member of a consortium of companies that will enable TikTok to continue its U.S. operations under a new framework deal between the United States and China. While the exact structure of the agreement remains unclear, it is expected to involve multiple American companies to address national security concerns. The deal still faces significant hurdles, including determining who will control TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm and ensuring that U.S. user data is securely managed domestically. Presidents Trump and Xi are scheduled to finalize the terms later this week.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are primarily planning to use Shohei Ohtani as a starting pitcher during the upcoming playoffs, but the team has not ruled out deploying him as a reliever in critical situations. Andrew Friedman, the team's president of baseball operations, confirmed that while Ohtani is viewed as a starter, the high-stakes nature of postseason baseball means all options remain open. Using Ohtani out of the bullpen would present logistical and rule-based challenges, as current MLB rules would force the Dodgers to lose him as a designated hitter once he is removed from the mound in a relief appearance.</p>

This marks the second consecutive week Mayfield has led a game-winning drive in the final minute, as the Buccaneers start their season with a 2-0 record.

If signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom, the bill would authorize public schools and community colleges to close for the holiday and allow state employees to take the day off. Proponents, like Assemblymember Ash Kalra, argue that the move recognizes the cultural and religious significance of Diwali for California's large South Asian population. The five-day festival, which marks the new year in the Hindu calendar, is celebrated by millions worldwide.</p>
