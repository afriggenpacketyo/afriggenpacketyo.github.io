          <p>Experts are advocating for school-based screenings to detect lazy eyes early, as an increasing number of children are being missed for treatment due to limited availability of early screenings. The British and Irish Orthoptic Society (BIOS) recommends vision screening for amblyopia in all schools in England, similar to Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Early detection and treatment, ideally before the age of seven, are crucial for effective correction. A survey reveals that approximately 75,000 children reside in areas without school screenings.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have created an edible, washable protein-based coating that can more than double the shelf life of fruits by reducing moisture loss and microbial growth. The low-cost coating has been tested on various fruits, effectively delaying rot by almost a week or more at a cost of just 9 US cents per kilogram of fruit. This eco-friendly strategy is as effective as existing preservation methods while reducing carbon dioxide emissions and potential toxicity, offering a promising solution to global food waste.</p>
