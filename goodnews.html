          <p>Harvard University sued the Trump administration following the Department of Homeland Security's announcement to block international students from attending the university. The lawsuit accused the administration of a ‚Äúcampaign of retribution‚Äù for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights. Harvard argued that the decision would destabilize the university's existence, as international students contribute significantly to its mission. A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against the federal edict, agreeing that its implementation would cause ‚Äúimmediate and irreparable injury‚Äù to the university. The White House responded by accusing Harvard of failing to address antisemitism on campus. </p>

The legislation sets aside $5 billion to fund vouchers for families to pay for private school tuition, home-schooling, or virtual learning, including religious education. The plan could be popular with wealthy taxpayers, offering a larger tax break than donations to other charities. Critics argue the bill would siphon funding from public schools, benefiting private institutions without accountability. </p>

          <p>A cargo ship, the NCL Salten, ran aground in Norway, narrowly missing a house on the shore in Byneset. The police are investigating the officer guiding the ship, who said he fell asleep before the crash. The ship missed the bedroom by only a few yards, and the resident, Johan Helberg, was alerted by a neighbor. No injuries or oil spills were reported, and authorities are working to refloat the vessel. </p>

          <h2>GOP Tax Bill Could Impact Workers With Overtime or Tips</h2>

          <p>The Republican-backed budget bill includes new tax rules that could significantly impact workers who earn tips or overtime pay. The bill extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts and includes provisions to eliminate taxes on tipped income and overtime pay. While it could save workers about $1,700 annually, restrictions in the bill may limit the financial benefit, particularly for low-income workers. The bill faces potential changes in the Senate, and critics argue it includes cuts to social safety net programs. </p>

          <p>Flor Molina, a survivor of human trafficking, supports California Assembly Bill 381, which aims to prevent human trafficking and forced labor. Molina shares her experience of being trafficked and forced to work in a textile factory in Los Angeles. The bill seeks to ensure California does not ignore the human suffering behind the products it buys with public funds. If AB 381 had been in place when she was trafficked, it could have provided her with information about her rights and a way out of her dangerous situation. </p>
