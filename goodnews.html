          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from requiring 20 Democratic-led states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive transportation grant funding. The judge granted an injunction, stating that the states were likely to succeed in their claims that the policy was unlawful. The states argued that the transportation secretary lacked the authority to impose immigration-enforcement conditions on funding appropriated by Congress. This ruling is part of a broader legal battle over sanctuary jurisdictions and immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that plastic bag bans and fees are effective in reducing shoreline pollution. The research found that local and state plastic bag policies enacted from 2016 to 2023 reduced the share of waste consisting of plastic bags collected during shoreline cleanups by up to 47%. The study also suggests that fee-based policies are more effective than partial bans. California's experience with plastic bag regulations highlights the importance of well-designed policies with fewer loopholes to curb plastic waste.</p>
