          <p>China is making significant strides in developing AI 'agentic frameworks,' the foundational tools for creating autonomous AI agents. Tech giants like Tencent and ByteDance have recently open-sourced their own frameworks, directly challenging U.S. counterparts such as AutoGen and OpenAI Swarm. Tencent's Youtu-Agent, for example, demonstrated strong performance on a key web traversal benchmark. This move signals an intensification of the U.S.-China technology competition, as both nations vie for leadership in the next generation of artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Argentina have recovered 'Portrait of a Lady,' an 18th-century painting looted by the Nazis during World War II, after it had been missing for 80 years. The breakthrough came when the artwork was unwittingly featured in an online real estate listing by the daughter of the Nazi officer accused of stealing it. The recovery is a significant victory for the heirs of the original owner, Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker, who have long sought the return of his stolen collection.</p>

Despite this positive sentiment, investors remain watchful of the global bond markets, where long-term borrowing costs are under pressure, and await key economic data from Australia.

The company's second-quarter performance surpassed expectations, with its CEO crediting the celebrity endorsements for a notable increase in customer awareness and engagement. The success comes despite, or perhaps because of, a divisive 'Great Jeans' ad with Sweeney that sparked widespread public debate.</p>

          <h2>Appeals Court Blocks Deportation of Venezuelan Migrants Under 18th Century Law</h2>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants, ruling that the current situation does not legally constitute an 'invasion or predatory incursion.' This decision is a significant setback for the administration's strategy of employing the obscure wartime law for rapid removals of individuals accused of gang affiliations. The ruling upholds a preliminary injunction for the migrants who sued, though they can still be removed under other legal authorities.</p>

          <p>The municipal government of Shaoxing, China, has introduced a novel stimulus plan to boost its local economy by offering subsidies for large-scale dining. Residents who host banquets with five or more tables and spend over 10,000 yuan will be eligible for financial incentives of up to 5,000 yuan. This policy is part of a broader effort to encourage consumer spending in sectors like catering, cars, and housing, as local officials navigate the balance between stimulating growth and adhering to national anti-extravagance directives.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has ruled that the Trump administration acted unlawfully when it froze $2.2 billion in federal research funding for Harvard University. In her decision, Judge Allison D. Burroughs stated that the administration used allegations of antisemitism as a 'smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault' and failed to follow the proper legal process. The frozen funds were designated for over 900 vital research projects, including work on cancer, Alzheimer's, and heart disease.</p>

          <p>In Montana's Blackfoot Valley, a group of ranching families is challenging the conventional food system by implementing regenerative agriculture and forming a cooperative. The Old Salt Co-op allows them to process their own livestock and sell beef directly to consumers, ensuring better margins and promoting sustainable land management. By focusing on soil health and allowing land to rest, they have increased grass production even in dry years, creating a resilient and replicable model for the future of ranching.</p>

          <p>Democrats and voting rights advocates have secured an agreement with the Department of Justice to ensure approximately 98,000 North Carolina voters will not be prevented from voting.

The negotiated settlement will allow these voters to provide the required information using a provisional ballot at the polling place, effectively curing the issue and preserving their right to vote.</p>

His aide explained that Roberts' rare rebukes of political figures are a response to a long-term erosion of public trust in the courts, rather than reactions to specific events. The Chief Justice reportedly believes the judiciary has a 'tiny megaphone' and must play a 'long game' to maintain its standing.</p>
