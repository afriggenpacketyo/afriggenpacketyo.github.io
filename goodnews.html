          <p>A new study reveals that state and local policies regulating plastic bags have significantly reduced shoreline litter in the U.S. The research, analyzing over 600 bag policies and 45,000 shoreline cleanups, found that plastic bag litter decreased by 25% to 47% in areas with such policies. The study suggests that fees on plastic bags are more effective than bans, especially partial bans, in limiting shoreline litter. These findings highlight the positive impact of plastic bag regulations on marine environments.</p>
