          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's effort to prematurely end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for around 521,000 Haitian immigrants. The ruling found that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem acted unlawfully by not following the congressionally mandated process for reviewing current conditions in Haiti before making her decision. This provides temporary relief for the immigrants, allowing them to legally live and work in the U.S. while their home country faces severe instability.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid's decision to pay an ¬£8.4 million fee to sign Trent Alexander-Arnold from Liverpool has already proven to be a financially sound investment. In a Club World Cup match, a crucial assist from the right-back led to a winning goal that earned the club ¬£10 million in prize money, more than covering the transfer cost. The move highlights the immediate impact a high-caliber player can have, both on the field and on the balance sheet.</p>
