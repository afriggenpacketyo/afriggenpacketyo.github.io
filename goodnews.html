          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's proclamation that sought to bar Harvard University's international students from entering the country. Judge Allison Burroughs issued a temporary restraining order, stating the policy risked causing "immediate and irreparable injury." Harvard refiled a lawsuit, arguing the proclamation violates the First Amendment and is retaliatory. The judge had previously blocked a similar plan to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll international students, citing concerns about academic freedom. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers are increasingly seeking food products with fewer ingredients, driven by concerns about ultra-processed foods (UPF). Retailers and food brands are responding by offering simpler items, though nutritionists caution against sacrificing fortified nutrients. The trend is influenced by books like "Ultra-Processed People," which raises questions about the healthfulness of processed foods. Some experts argue that UPF as a term is not a helpful indicator of health, as processing can ensure food safety and extend shelf life. </p>

QSDC sends the actual message directly through a quantum channel making the system efficient and secure. </p>
