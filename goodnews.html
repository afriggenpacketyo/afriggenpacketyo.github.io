          <p>The Dashixia Water Control Project in Xinjiang, China, has officially begun storing water, marking a significant milestone in engineering and technology. The dam, which is the tallest of its kind in the country, was constructed using advanced intelligent technologies, including AI, digital twins, and unmanned equipment. This innovative "3D-printing-like" construction method allowed engineers to overcome significant seismic and geological challenges in the region. The project represents the world's first dam of its type to be completed using a fully intelligent construction process from start to finish.</p>

          <p>Struggling Chinese property developer Seazen Group is seeking to raise more funds in the offshore dollar bond market, signaling a potential reopening of financing channels for the beleaguered sector. This move is part of a broader trend where issuers from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau are returning to dollar bonds, with issuance reaching its highest level since 2022. The renewed interest highlights a shift in the interest-rate environment, allowing companies to refinance debt on more favorable terms. This could help rebuild investor confidence in a sector that has been severely impacted by China's property crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A potential meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping is more probable for early next year rather than this fall, according to U.S. Ambassador to China David Perdue. The ambassador's comments came during a press conference with a visiting bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation in Beijing, the first of its kind since 2019. While President Trump had previously suggested a meeting could occur soon, the ambassador indicated that discussions with Chinese officials point toward a 2026 timeline. The visit by U.S. lawmakers is aimed at improving communication, particularly on military issues, between the two global powers.</p>

          <h2>Pediatrician Affirms Safety of Paracetamol Use During Pregnancy Amid Political Controversy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to recent political comments linking paracetamol to autism, pediatrician and parliamentarian Dr. Mike Freelander has emphasized that the medication is safe for use during pregnancy. He states there is no scientific evidence of causation, citing large-scale studies that have disproved a direct link, and warns that such unscientific claims cause significant distress to parents. Dr. Freelander notes that medical regulators worldwide, including Australia's TGA, have concluded paracetamol is safe based on rigorous assessment of available evidence. He urges the public to trust established regulatory bodies for health advice rather than poorly informed statements from political figures.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has mandated that the Trump administration restore $500 million in frozen federal grant funding to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The ruling for a preliminary injunction stated the administration likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act by suspending the grants without specific explanations. The funding, primarily for medical research at the National Institutes of Health, was suspended over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action. This is the latest development in the administration's use of federal funding to pressure elite universities it claims are dominated by liberal ideologies.</p>

          <h2>Modern Football Tactics Seemingly Embrace the Playbook of Former Manager Sam Allardyce</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent trend in modern football, characterized by a more direct style of play, increased emphasis on set-pieces, and the use of tall strikers, appears to mirror the tactics famously employed by manager Sam Allardyce years ago. Allardyce, who was often criticized for his pragmatic approach, notes that many top clubs are now adopting strategies he pioneered, such as long balls and data-driven analysis from the stands. The article explores how this shift away from a purely possession-based game is changing the sport, with current coaches recognizing the effectiveness of a more direct and physically imposing style.</p>

          <p>Alaa Abdel Fattah, one of Egypt's most high-profile political prisoners, has been released after nearly six years of imprisonment following a presidential pardon. The British-Egyptian pro-democracy blogger and activist was seen celebrating with his family at home after his release. He was arrested in 2019 and sentenced to five years for "spreading false news." His freedom comes after a persistent international campaign and an extensive hunger strike by his mother, Laila Soueif, which brought global attention to his case and put pressure on the Egyptian government.</p>

          <p>The Detroit Lions defeated the Baltimore Ravens 38-30 in a Monday night upset, powered by a formidable ground game and a relentless defense. Running backs Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery each scored two touchdowns, and the Lions' offense outrushed the Ravens 224 to 85 yards. Detroit's defense was equally impressive, sacking Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson seven times and forcing a critical fourth-quarter fumble. The victory was a significant road win for the Lions and a surprising physical defeat for the Ravens on their home field, where they have historically been very successful in primetime games.</p>

          <p>Jack Thorne, the writer of the upcoming ITV drama "The Hack," has praised the "remarkable" work of the journalists who uncovered the phone-hacking scandal. The series stars David Tennant as Nick Davies, the Guardian reporter whose investigations exposed widespread illegal practices at the News of the World. Thorne noted that unlike the Post Office scandal, which journalism struggled to bring to public prominence, the phone-hacking story is a celebration of journalists successfully holding their own powerful industry to account. The drama aims to explore the troubling relationship between the press, politics, and the police that the scandal revealed.</p>

          <p>Many new parents experience a significant drop in their sex drive after childbirth, a topic explored by reality TV star Holly Hagan-Blyth and relationship experts. The decline can be attributed to a combination of physical healing, drastic hormonal shifts, and the psychological adjustment to parenthood. Experts note that the postpartum period involves major changes, with lower estrogen levels potentially causing physical discomfort, while the emotional weight of new responsibilities can affect both mothers and fathers. Open communication between partners is highlighted as crucial for navigating this period and alleviating pressure.</p>

          <p>New York Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, who had previously withdrawn from an ABC-hosted town hall, has agreed to participate following the network's decision to reinstate Jimmy Kimmel. Mamdani had boycotted the event to protest Kimmel's suspension, which he called an act of "cowardice" by corporate leaders in the face of government pressure on free speech. His initial withdrawal was a protest against what he saw as an attack on the freedom of the press. With Kimmel's show scheduled to return, Mamdani reversed his decision and will now take part in the televised event.</p>
