          <p>A power outage, suspected to be caused by sabotage, disrupted the final day of the Cannes Film Festival, affecting around 160,000 homes in Cannes and surrounding areas, with authorities investigating arson at an electricity substation and damage to a pylon. Despite the disruption, festival organizers confirmed that the closing ceremony would proceed as planned due to an alternative power supply. The incident caused traffic issues and shop closures, but power was restored in the afternoon, allowing the festival to continue. The quick response ensured the prestigious Palme d'Or ceremony was not impacted. </p>

          <p>Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi, who has faced decades of state censorship and imprisonment, won the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for his political film "It Was Just an Accident". Despite being banned from filmmaking and international travel since 2010, Panahi continued to create films clandestinely. The article details the film's plot, which confronts state violence and repression, and highlights Panahi's dedication to filmmaking as a form of resistance. He insists that his films are inspired by conversations with prisoners and stories of government brutality, stating that the Islamic Republic inadvertently contributes to his subversive work by imprisoning him. </p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army helicopter near Washington D.C. on May 1, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The 20-second loss of contact occurred as the Black Hawk helicopter approached the Pentagon, attributed to a temporary antenna's location. The Army stated that the aircraft's location was continuously broadcast via its ADS-B Out system, and the go-arounds were executed out of an abundance of caution. The incident has raised concerns about close calls between government helicopters and commercial planes after a deadly midair collision in January. </p>

          <p>Archaeologists have uncovered a key component of a mysterious artifact at Sutton Hoo, England, finding the base of a sixth-century Byzantine bucket containing cremated animal and human remains, along with an intact comb. The bucket, depicting a North African hunting scene, was found to contain parts of an ankle bone, a skull vault, and animal bones. The discovery sheds light on why the vessel was buried and the status of the individual laid to rest, with hopes of extracting DNA from the comb. This find adds to the understanding of Anglo-Saxon life at Sutton Hoo. </p>

          <p>Swiss brand On is emerging as a global challenger in the sportswear market, reporting a significant increase in net sales. Analysts attribute On's success to innovative products and strategic timing. The company capitalized on Nike's declining sales and Adidas's partnership issues, offering a unique aesthetic that resonated with consumers. While Nike and Adidas still dominate the market, On's growth rate has surpassed both companies. The brand faces potential headwinds from Nike's turnaround plan and tariff uncertainties. </p>

          <p>Specialist mental health crisis centers will be established across England over the next decade to alleviate overcrowding in A&E departments. These centers will offer specialized care for individuals experiencing acute mental distress, with walk-in access and referrals from GPs and police. The NHS aims to provide appropriate care in a calm environment, reducing long waits in emergency rooms. However, concerns have been raised about the model's effectiveness and the need for adequate funding. </p>
