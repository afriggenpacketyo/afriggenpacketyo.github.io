          <p>Qingzhou Wang, a Chinese company executive, has been sentenced to 25 years in a US prison for trafficking chemicals used to manufacture fentanyl. Wang, a principal executive of Amarvel Biotech, was convicted alongside a marketing manager for fentanyl precursor importation and money laundering. This case marks the first time Chinese companies were charged by the US for trafficking these chemicals directly into the country. The article highlights ongoing US efforts to combat the fentanyl crisis and the diplomatic tensions with Beijing over these indictments.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump announced a "productive" phone call with Chinese Premier Xi Jinping, claiming Xi approved a deal for TikTok's US operations to be sold to American investors. China's state news agency, however, offered a more cautious statement, welcoming negotiations without confirming a deal. The potential agreement aims to allow TikTok to continue operating in the US, using algorithm technology licensed from ByteDance, but concerns about Chinese Communist Party influence persist among US lawmakers. Trump emphasized the app's "tremendous value" and its role in his 2024 campaign.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. Forecasters expect Gabrielle to strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday, though its current track predicts it will remain over open waters, north of the Caribbean islands and away from land. The storm could potentially impact Bermuda early next week. This season, initially predicted to be busier than average by NOAA, has so far seen quieter hurricane activity than anticipated, with only one of the six previous named storms making US landfall.</p>

Her initiative addresses a growing problem, as reported losses for those 60 and over doubled in five years to $4.8 billion.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US federal judge has dismissed President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, citing the complaint's "decidedly improper and impermissible" political language and excessive length. The judge, Steven Merryday, stated that a legal complaint should not serve as a "megaphone for public relations or a podium for a passionate oration." While the judge did not rule on the lawsuit's merits, he granted Trump's lawyers 28 days to file an amended, more concise complaint. The New York Times welcomed the ruling, calling the original complaint a political document intended to stifle independent reporting.</p>

          <p>Martin Jennings, the sculptor chosen for the national memorial to Queen Elizabeth II, plans to capture her "grandeur and dignity" in the forthcoming statue. The memorial, to be located in central London's St James's Park, will also feature a bridge, new gardens, and a statue of Prince Philip, with its final design revealed in 2026. Jennings, known for depicting other royals, expressed his elation at the commission and his intent to consider public sentiment in the design. However, the anti-monarchy group Republic has called for the Royal Family to fund the memorial, rather than the government.</p>
