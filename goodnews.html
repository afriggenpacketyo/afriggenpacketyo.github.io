          <p>Shares of Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank Group jumped 13% to a record high, marking their best single-day performance in five years. The surge followed the company's announcement of a fiscal first-quarter profit of 421.8 billion yen, significantly exceeding analyst expectations. This marks the group's second consecutive profitable quarter, driven by a $4.8 billion gain in the value of its Vision Funds, the largest such increase since 2021. The positive results were attributed to strong performance from both private and publicly listed portfolio companies, including Grab Holdings and Swiggy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed an increase in the presence of federal law enforcement agencies throughout Washington, D.C., to address a recent surge in violent crime. The operation, which involves the FBI, DEA, and Homeland Security Investigations, will focus on high-traffic tourist areas and known crime hotspots. This action is part of the "Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force" established by an executive order in March. The White House stated that the move delivers on a campaign promise to restore safety and order to the nation's capital for its residents and visitors.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued a nationwide preliminary injunction, blocking the Trump administration's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens. This marks the fourth court decision to halt the policy since a Supreme Court ruling in June limited the scope of such injunctions. The judge certified the lawsuit as a class action, covering all children born in the U.S. who would be affected by the order. The ruling stated that the plaintiffs were "extremely likely" to win their argument that the order violates the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause.</p>

          <p>Actress Gina Carano has reached a settlement with Disney and Lucasfilm in her lawsuit over being fired from the Star Wars series "The Mandalorian." Carano, who played Cara Dune, was dismissed in 2021 after making controversial social media posts, which she argued constituted wrongful termination and discrimination. The lawsuit was notably funded by Elon Musk as part of his pledge to support individuals facing professional repercussions for their speech. Carano described the undisclosed settlement as the "best outcome for all parties involved" and expressed hope that it would bring "healing to the force."</p>

          <p>The Southern Small White butterfly, a species typically found in Southern Europe, has been officially recorded in the United Kingdom for the first time. A volunteer at the Landguard Bird Observatory in Suffolk photographed the female butterfly, whose species has been rapidly expanding its range northward through Europe in recent decades. While a warming climate is believed to be a contributing factor, the species' expansion has been faster than models predicted. It is not yet known if the butterfly will establish a breeding population in the UK, as its primary food source is not widely planted there.</p>
