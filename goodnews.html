          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the Fed's commitment to preventing an "ongoing inflation problem," noting that policymakers will remain cautious until the impact of tariffs on prices is clearer. Powell characterized economic growth as strong with the labor market near full employment, but acknowledged that inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. His cautious stance contrasts with President Trump's criticism, who expressed frustration with Powell's policies. Powell is scheduled to present his comments to congressional committees this week.

Krispy Kreme will now focus on expansion through high-volume retail points and international franchise growth, and the companies noted that the agreement was a small part of McDonald's business.
