          <p>US podcaster Johnathan Walton, who was instrumental in the capture and conviction of con artist Marianne Smyth, has voiced his disappointment with her four-year prison sentence in Northern Ireland. Smyth was found guilty of defrauding four people of over $155,000 while working as a mortgage adviser. Walton, who was also a victim of Smyth in Los Angeles and detailed her schemes in his podcast, stated that the sentence was too lenient for a woman he described as an "inveterate con woman." He fears that without a longer period of confinement, she will inevitably return to scamming innocent people upon her release.</p>

          <p>Pratika Rawal, a 25-year-old opening batter for India's national cricket team, is making a significant impact at the Women's World Cup, a journey that began with her father's unwavering support. Her father, Pradeep Rawal, a former university-level cricketer himself, encouraged her passion from the age of three, determined to help her achieve the dream he could not. Despite initial setbacks, such as being overlooked in the Women's Premier League auction, she earned her first national call-up shortly after. Now a key player, Rawal has demonstrated immense promise with a high batting average and several standout performances on the international stage.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that the Galleri blood test can successfully identify more than 50 different types of cancer, potentially revolutionizing early diagnosis and screening. Results from a trial in North America involving 25,000 adults showed the test detected cancer in nearly one in 100 participants, with cancer later confirmed in 62% of those positive cases. Significantly, more than half of the cancers were found at an early stage, and three-quarters were types for which no routine screening programs currently exist. The NHS is conducting its own large-scale trial, with results expected next year to determine its future use in the UK.</p>

          <p>Chen Ning Yang, a highly influential theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate, has passed away at the age of 103. In 1957, he and his colleague Lee Tsung-Dao were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their groundbreaking work on parity laws, which led to significant discoveries about elementary particles. Born in China in 1922, Yang later moved to the United States, where he had a prolific career across many areas of physics. He was also a professor at Beijing's Tsinghua University, where his father had been a mathematics professor, and was celebrated for his immense contributions to science.</p>

          <p>As the global resale market for luxury goods expands at a rate three times faster than the primary market, robust authentication has become the new gold standard for trusted platforms. With increasingly sophisticated "superfakes" entering circulation, companies like Carousell and Bunjang are investing heavily in verification systems combining expert inspection, AI, and proprietary databases. This focus on trust is boosting business, as consumers are willing to pay a premium for the assurance that their pre-owned designer items are genuine.

          <p>A weekend trip to a Butlin's holiday park unexpectedly saved Charlotte Morjaria's life after a minor accident led to the discovery of a large, cancerous tumor on her kidney. The 31-year-old from Newport went to the hospital believing she had a broken rib after being playfully picked up during a game. A precautionary CT scan revealed the 7cm tumor, which she had been unaware of as its symptoms were masked by other factors. Following a successful surgery to remove her kidney, she is now cancer-free and credits the "miracle" mishap with revealing the hidden danger.</p>

Speaking to the BBC, Stubb suggested that forcing Russia to the negotiating table requires more of a "stick" than a "carrot," a role he believes Trump is attempting to fill. He expressed cautious optimism, noting that peace negotiations seem to have advanced more during Trump's second term than in the previous three years. Stubb also reiterated Finland's position that it would never recognize occupied Ukrainian territories as part of Russia.</p>

While Japanese brands like Toyota and Suzuki still lead in overall sales volume, their market dominance is declining as Chinese competitors gain traction.

          <p>Alibaba Cloud has developed a new computing pooling solution named Aegaeon, which it claims can cut the number of Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to serve its AI models by 82%. During a three-month test in Alibaba's model marketplace, the system reduced the required Nvidia H20 GPUs from 1,192 to just 213. The technology addresses a major inefficiency in cloud services, where a large number of GPUs are often allocated to serve AI models that are only used sporadically. This innovation could lead to significant cost savings and more efficient resource allocation for cloud providers running concurrent large language model workloads.</p>
