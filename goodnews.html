        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is renaming its streaming platform Max back to HBO Max, reversing a decision made two years prior. The company aims to emphasize quality over quantity in its programming, focusing on distinct and great content for adults and families. This move comes as WBD seeks to scale back its content volume and focus on quality programming, mirroring a similar strategy shift by competitor Disney. CEO David Zaslav stated that the rebranding aims to leverage the HBO brand, representing the highest quality in media, to further accelerate growth, as the streaming business has turned around its profitability by almost $3 billion in the last two years and scaled globally with around 22 million subscribers added in the last year.</p>

          <p>A court ruled that the European Union should not have denied a journalist's request for text messages exchanged between Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, and Pfizer's CEO, Dr. Albert Bourla, during Covid-19 vaccine negotiations. The New York Times challenged the commission's denial of access to the texts, arguing that the messages were covered by EU transparency laws. The court found that the commission did not provide enough explanation for refusing the request and failed to explain why the messages would not contain important information.

          <p>The US has announced plans to lift sanctions on Syria, a move that has sparked jubilation in Damascus and is expected to lead to an investment boom. The sanctions, which have been in place for 14 years, have crippled the Syrian economy and exacerbated humanitarian crises. The lifting of sanctions will allow aid agencies to speed up deliveries of vital supplies and pave the way for wealthy neighbors to make large investments.

          <p>House Republicans have advanced trillions of tax breaks as part of President Donald Trump's economic package, but the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) remains undecided. The House Ways and Means Committee passed its portion of the legislation, which would raise the SALT cap to $30,000 for those with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less. Some House lawmakers are seeking a higher limit before a full House vote. The current $10,000 SALT cap was added to help fund the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.</p>
