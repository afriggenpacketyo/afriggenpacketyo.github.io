          <p>A federal judge in New Jersey has ordered the release of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention while his immigration proceedings continue. Judge Michael Farbiarz ruled that Khalil, a green card holder detained in March, does not pose a flight risk or a threat to the community, describing his detention as "highly unusual." The Department of Homeland Security had detained Khalil based on allegations of omitted details from his green card application after Secretary of State Marco Rubio's declaration was deemed insufficient justification for detention. The judge emphasized the lack of evidence of violence or incitement, suggesting the immigration charge was being used to punish Khalil for his anti-Israel speech. </p>

The House has its own stablecoin legislation in development, and analysts believe the GENIUS Act could upgrade dollar payment rails and promote dollar dominance.  (not investment advice)</p>

The plant, worth 4 billion yuan ($556 million), is a collaboration between Tesla, the Shanghai local government, and China Kangfu International Leasing. Utility-scale battery energy storage systems are vital for balancing electricity supply and demand, especially with intermittent renewable energy sources. Tesla's Shanghai factory produced over 100 Megapacks in the first quarter of the year, and the new power station will help solve urban power supply pressures. </p>
