          <p>Rivian Automotive adjusted its 2025 targets for vehicle deliveries and capital spending due to the impact of President Trump's tariffs, despite exceeding Wall Street's expectations for the first quarter and confirming its 2025 earnings targets. The company anticipates incurring additional expenses of a couple thousand dollars per vehicle due to tariffs, including a 25% tariff on imported auto parts. Rivian's new guidance includes deliveries of between 40,000 and 46,000 units, a decrease from the previous range of 46,000 to 51,000 units, and increased capital expenditures of $1.8 to $1.9 billion. Rivian reconfirmed plans to achieve a modest positive gross profit this year.</p>

          <p>Travelers without a Real ID, passport, or other federally recognized document will face additional security screening at U.S. airports, but will still be allowed to fly, according to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. While the federal deadline to enforce the Real ID law approaches, the government is initially giving travelers some leeway. The Real ID law was passed in 2005 in response to the September 11th terrorist attacks. Travelers are advised to arrive at the airport early, as the identity verification process may take longer.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada met with President Trump days after being elected on an anti-Trump platform, as relations between the two allies are at a historic low. Carney aimed to assert Canada's sovereignty and avoid public conflict, succeeding in conveying that Canada is not for sale to the U.S. Despite earlier criticisms, Trump praised Carney's electoral victory. The leaders discussed trade, tariffs, and foreign affairs, but no major breakthroughs were achieved, though both struck a cautiously optimistic tone.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed a $7.5 billion federal tax incentive to keep more film productions in the U.S., following President Trump's call for tariffs on films produced overseas. Hollywood insiders have long advocated for a federal tax incentive program to compete with foreign countries offering generous incentives. However, the proposal faces significant obstacles, including political optics and competing national priorities. A coalition of Hollywood unions and industry trade groups supports the idea, citing its potential to reshore American jobs and stimulate economic growth.</p>

          <p>During Donald Trump‚Äôs meeting with Canada‚Äôs new prime minister, Mark Carney, tensions simmered beneath the surface as both leaders sought to play it cool.

Carney employed a strategy of "elbows up," offering a stiff defense and asserting Canada's sovereignty. The meeting highlighted the potential effects of Trump's trade war and the growing trend of voters electing leaders who will stand up to an unpredictable U.S. leader.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have agreed a trade deal that will make it easier for UK firms to export whisky, cars and other products to India, and cut taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports. The British government said the "landmark" agreement, which took three years to reach, did not include any change in immigration policy, including towards Indian students studying in the UK. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the deal would boost the economy and "deliver for British people and business".</p>
