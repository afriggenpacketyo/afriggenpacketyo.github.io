          <p>Robert Jarvik, a key figure in the development of the first permanent artificial heart, has died at the age of 79. Jarvik collaborated with a team at the University of Utah to create a mechanical heart, which was later used as a bridge for patients awaiting organ transplants. His work marked a significant milestone in medical science, offering hope for individuals with severe heart conditions and paving the way for future advancements in cardiac technology. The artificial heart provided a temporary solution, sustaining patients until a suitable donor heart became available for transplantation.</p>

          <p>Credit card debt forgiveness, also known as debt settlement, offers borrowers the possibility of having a portion of their debt forgiven, typically ranging from 30% to 50%.

While debt settlement agreements can be reached through various avenues, it's essential to clarify the specific terms and criteria with the debt relief company.
