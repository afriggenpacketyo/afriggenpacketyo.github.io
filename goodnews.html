          <p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has admitted that the company needs to improve its relationship with its workforce and rebuild trust following recent layoffs and a new return-to-office mandate. During an internal meeting, Nadella responded to an employee's question about a perceived lack of empathy, stating that the leadership team "can do better, and we will do better." The comments come after Microsoft cut 9,000 jobs and required employees near its headquarters to return to the office three days a week. The internal friction contrasts with the company's strong financial performance and rising stock value.</p>

          <p>David Ellison's newly formed Paramount Skydance is reportedly preparing a takeover offer for Warner Bros. Discovery, a move that could create a massive media and content conglomerate. While no formal offer has been made, news of the potential bid caused Warner Bros. Discovery's stock to surge nearly 30%. Acquiring WBD would significantly expand Paramount's portfolio, adding major franchises like DC superheroes, Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter to its existing library. The potential merger would also combine their streaming services and sports media rights, creating a more formidable competitor to industry giants like Disney.</p>

          <p>During the first round of the BMW PGA Championship, English golfer Matt Fitzpatrick experienced a bizarre incident where he believes his ball was stolen by spectators after an errant tee shot. The event occurred just as play was suspended for weather. Because the ball could not be found upon resumption of play, Fitzpatrick was able to take a penalty drop instead of playing a provisional ball from a worse position. He stated that the "stolen ball" was ultimately a "good result" that likely saved him at least one stroke in a round where he finished six-under-par.</p>

Adobe also provided an optimistic forecast for the fourth quarter, with projections for earnings and revenue that are above consensus estimates.

          <p>Manchester United's goalkeeper, Andre Onana, has been loaned to Turkish club Trabzonspor for the remainder of the 2025-26 season. The move was completed just before the close of the Turkish transfer window. Onana, who was signed from Inter Milan for £47.2 million in 2023 to be the team's starting keeper, had not featured in any of the club's first three Premier League matches this season under new manager Ruben Amorim. His only appearance this season was in a surprising Carabao Cup defeat to a lower-league opponent, signaling a shift in the team's goalkeeping preferences.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year mortgage has fallen to 6.35%, its lowest level in almost a year, creating a potential window of opportunity for homebuyers and those considering refinancing. This decline is attributed to expectations of an upcoming Federal Reserve rate cut and a cooling 10-year Treasury yield. While waiting for rates to drop further is a possibility, it also carries the risk that they could rise again. Homeowners are advised to consider refinancing if current rates are at least a percentage point lower than their existing mortgage rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nadine Menendez, wife of former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, has been sentenced to 54 months in federal prison for her conviction in a major bribery case. She was found guilty of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, gold bars, and a luxury car in exchange for her husband's political influence. While prosecutors sought a longer sentence, the judge considered her ongoing cancer treatment in the decision, setting a surrender date for July 2026. During sentencing, Nadine Menendez expressed accountability but also claimed she had blindly followed her husband, who is currently serving an 11-year sentence for his role.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the U.S. will share profits equally with Japan from American-based projects funded by Tokyo's $550 billion investment until the initial amount is recouped. This arrangement is part of a new trade deal where Japan accepted a 15% baseline tariff in exchange for investing in U.S. manufacturing and infrastructure. After Japan's investment is paid back, the profit-sharing model will shift heavily in America's favor, with the U.S. receiving 90% and Japan 10%. The deal aims to bolster domestic manufacturing in critical sectors like nuclear power and antibiotics.</p>

          <p>A debate is growing in Germany over the continued focus on classic literature by authors like Goethe in high school curriculums. Critics and some students argue that the required reading lists are dominated by white male authors and lack relevance to the lives of a modern, diverse student body. While education officials have made some moves to include contemporary and female authors, systemic change is slow. Proponents of the classics maintain that these works are essential for understanding history and developing critical thinking, even as student representatives call for more modern skills like AI literacy.</p>

The Ravens organization stated it has addressed the matter internally with Jackson and is implementing additional security protocols to better protect players from negative fan interactions during games.</p>

          <p>Eastman Kodak's new product, the "Kodak Charmera," a line of 1980s-inspired digital toy cameras, has sold out quickly after its launch, indicating strong consumer interest. The small, fashionable cameras, created in collaboration with Reto, are designed to mimic the look of vintage film photography and are sold in "blind box" packaging. The successful launch provides a potential bright spot for Kodak, which has been facing significant financial struggles, including a recent warning about its ability to continue operations. The product's popularity taps into a growing Gen Z trend of embracing nostalgic, pre-digital technology and aesthetics.</p>
