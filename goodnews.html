          <p>A federal judge has blocked a Trump administration order that halted construction on the Revolution Wind farm off the New England coast. The Danish company Orsted announced it will resume work on the nearly completed project, which is set to power over 350,000 homes. The judge ruled that the Interior Department's stop-work order was likely arbitrary and unlawful, marking a significant setback for the administration's efforts to curtail the offshore wind industry. This legal victory allows the fully permitted project to proceed despite broader political opposition to renewable energy development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut is making home equity loans more affordable for homeowners, who are currently sitting on record levels of equity. A typical $100,000 home equity loan now has a lower monthly payment compared to earlier in the year, although the decrease is not dramatic. The article breaks down the potential monthly costs for 10- and 15-year loans, comparing them to previous rates and also to variable-rate HELOCs. With further rate cuts anticipated, homeowners may find borrowing against their home equity an increasingly attractive option for accessing funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bruce Pearl, the head coach of Auburn University's men's basketball team, is reportedly set to retire before the 2025-26 season, with his son Steven expected to succeed him. The announcement has intensified speculation that Pearl may pursue a political career, potentially running for a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama. Pearl, who has been an outspoken supporter of Israel and former President Trump, has previously discussed the possibility of entering politics but questioned if he could make a greater impact there than as a coach. He led the Tigers to two Final Four appearances during his tenure.</p>

His firm, EMJ Capital, has taken a position in the company, though the size was not disclosed. The endorsement caused a massive, immediate spike in the stock's value during Monday's trading session.

          <p>Southern California is expected to experience another week of high humidity and potential showers due to tropical moisture being drawn in from the Pacific. While significant rainfall is not anticipated for the Los Angeles area, the atmosphere will remain unusually muggy and unstable, creating chances for isolated storms through the weekend. Forecasters note that the highest probability for precipitation is on Tuesday and Wednesday, mainly north and east of L.A. County. A new developing storm, Tropical Storm Narda, could bring additional moisture to the region by the end of the week.</p>

          <p>Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silva has criticized the Premier League's scheduling, claiming it gave Arsenal an "unfair advantage" in their recent match. City had only 66 hours to recover after a midweek Champions League game, whereas Arsenal had a significantly longer rest period following their match. Silva stated that it is not right to play such an important game with a clear disadvantage in terms of rest and physical condition. His comments echo previous complaints from manager Pep Guardiola about the demanding schedule faced by English teams competing in European competitions.</p>

          <p>The arrival of peak fall foliage is being delayed by about a week compared to historical averages, a trend researchers attribute to climate change. While warmer fall temperatures can postpone the color change, other factors like drought and rainfall also impact the timing and vibrancy of the leaves. Online foliage trackers can provide general predictions, but local conditions create significant variations, and experts recommend exploring different elevations or areas to find the best views. Despite the delay, the annual spectacle remains a major tourism driver, especially in regions like New England.</p>

The inspiration came from Rosenthal's visit to a diner in Maine while filming his show "Somebody Feed Phil." The menu will feature Silverton's refined takes on comfort food staples, including matzo ball soup, meatloaf, and what they promise will be the "best patty melt you ever had."</p>

          <p>The cost of Medicare supplemental insurance, or Medigap, varies significantly in 2025, with monthly premiums ranging from as low as $32 to over $550. The average beneficiary, however, can expect to pay between $90 and $300 per month for popular mid-level plans like Part G or Part N. Costs are influenced by factors such as the chosen plan's coverage level, the beneficiary's age, location, and tobacco use. To lower premiums, experts advise enrolling when first eligible to avoid penalties for pre-existing conditions, comparing insurers carefully, and considering high-deductible options if appropriate.

Miran cited factors like changing immigration policies, easing rental costs, and tariff revenues as disinflationary pressures that justify a more significant rate reduction.

Gold typically performs well during periods of low interest rates and geopolitical instability. For investors looking to gain exposure, most experts recommend using an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the price of physical gold rather than buying bullion directly. Financial advisors generally suggest limiting gold to a small portion of a well-diversified portfolio, typically less than 3%. (not investment advice)</p>
