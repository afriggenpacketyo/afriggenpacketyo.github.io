          <p>Analysts suggest that US President Donald Trump's leadership, characterized by his control over his team of China hawks and reluctance to antagonize Xi Jinping, could serve as a unique stabilizing factor in US-China relations. Despite ongoing trade tensions and critical remarks from US officials like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Trump has shown restraint on sensitive issues such as Taiwan. Experts believe Trump's direct influence over his administration means leader-to-leader diplomacy plays a crucial role in shaping the fraught relationship between the two global powers. This article posits that his "paramount leader" approach may offer a distinct guard rail against escalating conflict.</p>

          <p>Actress Mariska Hargitay, widely recognized for her role in "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit," shared that her first name is frequently mispronounced by fans, colleagues, and even her own family members. She clarified on Amy Poehler's podcast that the correct pronunciation is "Muh-rish-kuh," explaining its Hungarian origin as a nickname meaning "Little Maria." Despite her decades-long career, the persistent mispronunciation has led her to write her name phonetically on set to guide others.

          <p>Ahead of an upcoming Apec summit, analysts and former government officials in Washington are skeptical that US President Donald Trump's reliance on personal chemistry and "gut instinct" will significantly sway Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Experts like Ryan Hass, a former China director, describe Xi as calculating and not easily swayed by charm or emotional appeals. This article explores Trump's characteristic diplomatic approach, where he often brushes aside extensive preparation, believing it puts opponents on the defensive. The effectiveness of this personal style in navigating complex US-China relations with a pragmatic leader like Xi remains a central question for the summit.</p>
