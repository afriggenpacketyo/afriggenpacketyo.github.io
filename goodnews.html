          <p>Amazon is extending its annual Prime Day event to four days, starting on July 8th and running through July 11th. The company plans to introduce themed "deal drops" that will change daily and be available while supplies last, adding a sense of urgency for shoppers. Prime Day was initially launched in 2015 to attract new members to its Prime loyalty program and boost sales during the summer. The event has since become a significant revenue driver for other retailers as well, who often host competing discount events during the same period.</p>

          <p>Aryna Sabalenka has written an apology to Coco Gauff for her "unprofessional" comments following her defeat in the French Open final, acknowledging that she let her emotions get the better of her.

She emphasized her respect for Gauff and acknowledged that Gauff deserved to win the tournament, viewing the experience as a valuable lesson in managing emotions after losses.

          <p>An F1 Q&A addresses whether McLaren should prioritize Oscar Piastri over Lando Norris, noting that Piastri has had a better season due to Norris' errors. Despite similar outright performance, Piastri is delivering more consistently, capitalizing on Norris' mistakes in qualifying. The article questions whether Norris is feeling pressure from Piastri or the opportunity to win a world title, leading to over-striving. McLaren's policy is not to prioritize drivers except in specific circumstances, as both drivers are performing well and the team is leading the championship.</p>

          <p>For the first time, streaming services have surpassed traditional television in overall U.S. viewership, according to a Nielsen report.

YouTube led with 12.5% of viewership, followed by Netflix at 7.5%. While broadcast networks still command a significant audience, especially during NFL season, the trend indicates a continued shift towards streaming, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the increasing availability of content on platforms like Amazon Prime Video and Disney+.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Criticism is emerging around the portrayal of women in media, particularly those who are perceived as catering to male attention. The controversy stems from observations that certain women's lyrics and images are too "male-centered," leading to labels like "pick-me" or "not a girl's girl." This criticism is fueled by concerns about gender, power, and the influence of social media, where conservative propaganda and patriarchal trends can easily spread. The discourse echoes previous feminist movements, highlighting ongoing tensions around gender and sexuality in a climate where every image feels like a weapon in a cultural gender war.</p>

Cultural links between the US and Britain, along with the UK's avoidance of trade and foreign policy conflicts with Washington, contribute to the preferential relationship.

          <p>The pharmaceutical industry is optimistic that antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), a class of targeted cancer therapies, could potentially replace chemotherapy for some patients. ADCs are designed to deliver chemotherapy directly to cancer cells, sparing healthy cells and reducing side effects. Companies like AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Merck have invested billions in developing ADCs, with some showing promise in clinical trials. However, challenges remain in refining these treatments, identifying the right targets, and managing side effects, and it may take years before ADCs fully replace chemotherapy.</p>

The proposal has garnered support from a majority of people and aims to revitalize the high street, but faces opposition due to concerns about traffic diversion and accessibility. Key questions remain about traffic management and the impact on bus routes, with some critics suggesting the focus should be on improving the retail offering.
