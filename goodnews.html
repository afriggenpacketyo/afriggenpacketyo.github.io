          <p>South Korea's newly elected progressive president, Lee Jae-myung, is expected to adopt a more "prudent" stance on Taiwan and prioritize strengthening economic ties with Beijing. This shift follows the impeachment of his predecessor, Yoon Suk-yeol, and signals a potential recalibration in Seoul's foreign policy. While Lee is considered more friendly towards China and North Korea compared to Yoon, continuity is expected in trilateral military cooperation with the U.S. and Japan. Under Yoon, Seoul emphasized its commitment to the U.S. alliance and stronger three-way cooperation with Washington and Tokyo.</p>

Following discussions with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Japan's top negotiator Ryosei Akazawa expressed that progress was made, but significant differences persist. Akazawa reiterated Japan's stance that the Trump administration's additional tariffs should be removed promptly due to their adverse impact on the Japanese economy.

          <p>Achieving longevity requires more than just individual optimization through diet and exercise; it necessitates a collective responsibility towards public health. While personal health choices are important, factors such as public policy, infrastructure, and community play a crucial role in determining health outcomes and life expectancy. Countries like Japan and South Korea, where healthy living is normalized by government and culture, demonstrate the impact of societal factors on overall health. The focus should shift from individual self-improvement to supporting policies that promote nutritious food, active cities, clean air, and preventive healthcare for all.</p>

          <p>A man in southern England discovered that he had been swapped at birth in a hospital nearly 80 years ago, resolving a long-standing family joke about his lack of resemblance to his parents. The discovery was made through DNA testing and genealogical research, revealing a mix-up with another baby at the same hospital in east London. This case is one of several instances of babies being accidentally switched in maternity wards from the late 1940s to the 1960s, a period before the widespread use of wristbands for identification. Lawyers anticipate more cases will emerge due to the increasing availability of affordable genetic testing.</p>

          <p>Despite competition from Shanghai, Hong Kong remains China's undisputed hub for global finance. Mainland companies are increasingly turning to Hong Kong's stock exchange for capital infusions, drawn by its access to international capital and strong connectivity to global markets. The city's financial infrastructure and global outlook continue to attract businesses seeking to expand internationally. Shanghai has not been able to compete.</p>

          <p>The Belmont Stakes will feature a rematch of the top three finishers from the Kentucky Derby, Sovereignty, Journalism, and Baeza. Sovereignty, who won the Derby, skipped the Preakness to prepare for the Belmont, while Journalism won the Preakness. The Belmont will be held at Saratoga Race Course this year and will be 1 1/4 miles long instead of the usual 1 1/2 miles. Journalism is the morning-line favorite, but Sovereignty will try to achieve a rare feat of winning both the Derby and the Belmont.</p>

          <p>Facing rising public discontent over soaring rice prices, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is planning to overhaul Japan's rice policy ahead of a key national election. With rice prices doubling from the previous year, Ishiba aims to reform the decades-old production adjustment system. He is pursuing a more consumer-focused approach by releasing reserve rice to lower prices. The Prime Minister hopes that this change will boost the economy.</p>
