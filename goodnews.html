          <p>David Marcus argues that President Trump's border security measures have significantly reduced illegal immigration and the flow of fentanyl, thereby saving American lives. He contrasts the current border situation with the previous administration, noting a drastic decrease in illegal migrant releases and border encounters. Marcus claims that Trump's policies have effectively closed the border and ended the catch-and-release system, leading to fewer overdose deaths. While acknowledging the reliance of some industries on illegal labor, he asserts that the ongoing deportations deter illegal immigration. The author's tone reflects strong support for Trump's border policies.</p>

          <p>A significant heat wave is expected to impact much of the United States, particularly the Midwest and East Coast, with potential record high temperatures. The National Weather Service has issued extreme heat alerts for over 140 million Americans, warning of major to extreme heat risk. Temperatures are forecast to reach well into the 90s or even triple digits, with little overnight relief. Experts advise staying indoors with air conditioning, staying hydrated, and avoiding strenuous outdoor activities to prevent heat-related illnesses. The author's tone reflects the seriousness of the heat wave and the need for precautions.</p>

          <h2>US Sunscreens Less Effective Than Those Abroad, Experts Say</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-21 10:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave approaches, experts say that US sunscreens are often less effective than those available in other countries, particularly in protecting against UVA rays. Regulatory differences are cited as a primary reason, with the FDA's lengthy approval process hindering the introduction of new UV-filtering ingredients. While American sunscreens are effective at blocking UVB rays, they often lag behind in UVA protection compared to products in Europe and South Korea. A bipartisan bill in Congress aims to modernize sunscreen regulations, but dermatologists still stress the importance of wearing sunscreen properly. The author's tone reflects concern about sunscreen effectiveness and advocacy for regulatory reform.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Easy returns on Amazon create significant problems for small businesses due to rising returns fraud, leading to customers receiving used products and some sellers exiting the Fulfillment by Amazon program. In response, Amazon introduced a new fee for items exceeding certain return rate thresholds, which has led to a decrease in return rates but also potentially to rising prices. Some sellers have implemented measures like installing camera systems to track returns and filing appeals against fraudulent claims. One founder left FBA after a customer received a product with someone else's bodily fluids inside, prioritizing customer safety over profit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appellate court has blocked a Louisiana law mandating the posting of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms, ruling it unconstitutional.

Louisiana plans to appeal the ruling, potentially taking the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Similar laws in Arkansas and Texas are also facing legal challenges.

The author argues that we need better air conditioning, with more efficient units powered by cleaner electricity, rather than less air conditioning.
