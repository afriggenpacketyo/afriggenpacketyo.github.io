          <p>A number of prominent Chinese companies, including AI firm SenseTime and dairy producer Mengniu, are actively raising capital as investor sentiment shows signs of recovery. SenseTime plans to raise funds by issuing 1.67 billion new shares to support AI infrastructure and research into new areas like robotics. Meanwhile, Mengniu is set to issue yuan-denominated bonds to refinance existing debt and fund green and social-responsibility projects. This trend reflects a broader increase in equity fundraising within China's consumer and technology sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has affirmed a lower court's decision to block a Trump administration order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the executive order's interpretation of the 14th Amendment is unconstitutional, keeping a nationwide injunction in place. The case was brought by several states arguing that inconsistent citizenship laws would create significant problems. The 2-1 decision marks a significant legal setback for the policy, with a dissenting judge arguing the states lacked legal standing to sue.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has stated her party must focus on "offering hope" and fixing problems, rather than simply being a "repository of disenchantment." In a recent interview, she expressed admiration for Argentine President Javier Milei, known for his aggressive cost-cutting measures, identifying him as a "template" for her own leadership style. Amidst poor polling numbers and concerns over her command of the party, Badenoch reshuffled her shadow cabinet and asserted she is focused on the economy and opposing what she describes as wealth-driving tax policies.</p>

          <p>For the first time in five years, China and Russia have launched a joint oceanographic expedition, signaling renewed cooperation in marine science. A team of 25 researchers set sail from Vladivostok on a 45-day mission aboard a Russian research vessel to study deep-sea environments in the Bering Sea and the northwestern Pacific. The stated goal is to better understand the effects of climate change and the evolution of oceans. This ninth joint expedition is seen as marking a new chapter in bilateral research cooperation, with potential implications for shared strategic interests in regions like the Arctic.</p>

          <p>The MLS All-Star game, which saw the MLS team defeat a Liga MX selection 3-1, delivered an entertaining spectacle for fans in Austin. However, the event was overshadowed by the absence of Lionel Messi, the league's biggest star, who skipped the festivities, potentially facing a suspension for his team's next match. His no-show highlights a growing debate about the relevance and demands of the All-Star format in a global sport. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged the need to re-evaluate the event to ensure it remains compelling for players and grows the league's audience.</p>

          <p>A significant study published in The Lancet suggests that walking 7,000 steps a day is sufficient to reduce the risk of major health issues like dementia, cancer, and heart disease. This finding challenges the widely promoted but less evidence-based goal of 10,000 steps, which originated from a 1960s marketing campaign. Researchers analyzed data from over 160,000 adults and found substantial health benefits at the 7,000-step mark compared to lower activity levels. Experts believe this more attainable target could encourage more people to use step tracking as a practical tool for improving their health.</p>

          <p>An oceanography student at Scripps Institution of Oceanography discovered a rare violet sea snail, Janthina janthina, on a La Jolla beach, a species not seen locally in a decade. These pelagic snails, known for their vibrant purple shells and bubble rafts for flotation, typically inhabit warmer tropical waters. Their appearance in Southern California often coincides with warmer offshore currents moving toward the coast. While a direct link to climate change isn't confirmed, researchers suggest the discovery warrants monitoring as ocean temperatures continue to rise.</p>

          <p>South Korean semiconductor firm SK Hynix announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, significantly exceeding market expectations. The surge was primarily fueled by sustained, high demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are crucial components for artificial intelligence technologies. The company's leadership in the HBM market has been a key driver of its success, and it anticipates strong demand to continue for the rest of the year. SK Hynix also plans to increase capital expenditure to support its HBM customers in the future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As of Friday, websites operating in the UK that contain pornographic material are required by the Online Safety Act to implement robust age-verification systems. Ofcom, the media regulator, has outlined several acceptable methods, including credit card checks and photo ID matching, to prevent minors from accessing adult content. However, concerns remain about the effectiveness of these measures, particularly the use of VPNs to bypass them, and user reluctance to share personal data. Non-compliant websites face substantial fines of up to £18 million or 10% of their global revenue.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the origins of the band Black Sabbath and how they created the genre of heavy metal. Formed in working-class Birmingham, the band, fronted by Ozzy Osbourne, reacted against the "hippy-dippy" music of the late 1960s. Inspired by horror films, they adopted a darker theme and developed a heavier sound, characterized by Geezer Butler's bass, Bill Ward's slowed tempo, and Osbourne's wailing vocals. Guitarist Tony Iommi's unique, detuned style, developed after an industrial accident, became the cornerstone of the genre, influencing countless bands.</p>

          <p>San Francisco Giants' Rafael Devers, who recently made his debut at first base, made a surprising admission following the team's game against the Atlanta Braves. Devers stated that he prefers playing a defensive position on the field over serving exclusively as a designated hitter. He explained that being on the field keeps him active and prevents him from overthinking his next at-bat. This contrasts with his time at the Boston Red Sox, where there was public tension over his role, and he was ultimately assigned to full-time designated hitter duties before being traded.</p>

          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter compared to the previous one, allowing the country to avoid a technical recession. The growth, which beat economists' expectations, was primarily driven by a strong performance in exports, particularly for semiconductors and petroleum products. This rebound followed a 0.2% contraction in the first quarter. However, analysts remain cautious, noting that the export surge may have been fueled by firms shipping ahead of potential U.S. tariffs and that domestic demand, while improved, still faces headwinds.

The M817 boasts 912 horsepower, a significant all-electric range for a hybrid, and is equipped with Huawei's latest advanced driving assistance system.
