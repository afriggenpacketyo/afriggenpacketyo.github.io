          <p>Europe's Viktor Hovland has been forced to withdraw from his Sunday singles match at the Ryder Cup because of a persistent neck injury. His scheduled match against Harris English of the United States has been declared a half, awarding each team half a point. Hovland had previously pulled out of Saturday's fourballs session. This development shifts the overall score to 12-5 in favor of Europe, which now needs only two more points from the remaining 11 matches to retain the Ryder Cup.</p>

The gathering of senior military leaders from around the world will take place in Quantico, Virginia. While regularly scheduled meetings with military leadership are common, the scale and abruptness of this particular event are considered highly unusual, if not unprecedented.

          <p>In a close referendum, Swiss citizens have voted to approve a government proposal for a voluntary electronic identity card system, with a slim 50.4% majority. This decision comes after a similar plan was rejected in 2021 over concerns that private companies would control the data. The new, approved system places the data storage and management entirely in government hands, with information stored only on users' smartphones. Supporters believe it will simplify online transactions, though opponents still harbor concerns about privacy and potential data tracking.</p>

          <p>Syria's interim President, Ahmad al-Sharaa, addressed the United Nations General Assembly, marking a significant step in the country's return to the international stage after ousting dictator Bashar Assad. In his speech, al-Sharaa condemned Israeli strikes and promised justice for sectarian violence, while also calling for the lifting of remaining international sanctions. Despite growing international recognition and domestic optimism, his government faces criticism over upcoming elections that exclude some minorities and centralize power, raising concerns about the inclusivity of Syria's political future.</p>

Jeffries emphasized that Democrats aim to find bipartisan common ground in their upcoming meeting with President Trump and Republican leaders. A key sticking point remains the extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits, which Democrats argue is urgent as notices impacting Americans' healthcare costs are set to go out soon. Republicans have advocated for a short-term funding bill to allow for further negotiations.</p>

          <p>In a move to combat noise and air pollution, residents of Zurich, Switzerland, have voted to impose significant restrictions on the use of leaf blowers. The new rules, supported by over 61% of voters, will completely ban gas-powered models. Electric leaf blowers and vacuums will only be permitted for use from October to December, with special permission required at other times of the year. Proponents argued the devices are harmful to microorganisms and spread fine dust, while opponents criticized the measure as an example of an excessive "culture of prohibition."</p>

          <p>The Zombies, a key band from the 1960s British Invasion, are being celebrated for their lasting impact on rock music, decades after their initial success proved elusive. Known for hits like "She's Not There" and "Time of the Season," the band struggled financially and disbanded before their seminal album "Odessey and Oracle" gained recognition. That album is now considered a classic, and the surviving members were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Their story is one of artistic perseverance, with their unique sound eventually earning them a place in rock history.</p>

          <p>China is developing a new industrial manufacturing system designed to mass-produce rockets and satellites with the same efficiency and consistency as automobiles. This "pull" system contrasts with the traditional "push" model of aerospace production by having final assembly pull components from suppliers only as they are needed. The goal is to lower costs, increase flexibility, and reduce delays in response to a projected exponential growth in global space activity. By mastering scalable space production, China aims to secure a dominant position in the future of the space economy.</p>

          <p>An increase in shopping center vacancies, driven by the failure of large chain stores, is creating rare real estate opportunities for small and local businesses. With the national vacancy rate rising, landlords are becoming more flexible, allowing independent retailers, wellness practitioners, and service-based businesses to secure prime locations they were previously priced out of. While overall rents are still rising, the rate of increase has slowed, and some small business owners are successfully negotiating more favorable terms, such as flexible leases and rent-free periods, to establish a physical presence.</p>

          <p>Rudy Giuliani has reached a confidential settlement with Dominion Voting Systems in the $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit filed against him. The suit was based on numerous false statements Giuliani made about the company's voting machines in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election. As Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Giuliani was a prominent figure in promoting the baseless conspiracy theory that the election was rigged. This marks Dominion's third major settlement related to election lies, following substantial payouts from Fox News and Newsmax for their roles in amplifying the misinformation.</p>

The initiative aims to create entire new communities with affordable housing, schools, and infrastructure, emulating the post-war Labour government's successful new town developments to address the country's housing needs.</p>
