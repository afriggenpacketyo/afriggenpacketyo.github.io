        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are pointing to a significant opportunity for investors to pay a 0% long-term capital gains tax rate due to changes in President Trump's recent tax legislation. For 2025, the 0% rate applies to single filers with taxable income up to $48,350 and married couples up to $96,700. The bill's increased standard deduction and other breaks could allow more people to qualify, enabling strategies like "tax-gain harvesting" to sell profitable assets tax-free or reset their cost basis for future savings. This financial strategy is presented as a "golden opportunity" for those who fall within the new income thresholds. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Facing financial pressures that have led to widespread closures, independent rural hospitals across the United States are increasingly forming "clinically integrated networks." These collaborations allow them to remain autonomous while pooling resources to negotiate better prices for services like mobile MRI units and to qualify for value-based care contracts. The Rough Rider Network in North Dakota, for example, helps 22 hospitals share costs and improve patient outreach for preventive care. This model offers a viable alternative to being acquired by larger health systems or shutting down entirely, preserving local jobs and healthcare access.</p>

          <p>Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani has been discharged from the hospital and is reportedly "recovering well" following a car crash in New Hampshire. The incident occurred on Interstate 93 after Giuliani and an associate had stopped to assist a woman involved in a domestic violence situation. Their vehicle was then struck from behind by another car, which police have confirmed was not connected to the initial domestic incident. Giuliani was diagnosed with a fractured thoracic vertebrae and other injuries, but his spokesperson stated the crash was not a targeted attack.</p>

The event is more than a sporting competition; it's a significant celebration of the culture and legacy of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). As part of Boston Mayor Wu's "For the Culture Week," the classic aims to enhance representation and community in a city where 23% of the population identifies as Black. The game provides a major platform for the schools and highlights the unique, family-oriented experience that HBCUs offer.</p>

          <p>Australian authorities have arrested three Sydney dockworkers after discovering approximately 1,116 pounds of cocaine hidden inside a shipping container.

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has stated that he believes the company's humanoid robot project, Optimus, will eventually account for approximately 80% of Tesla's total value. This projection aims to shift investor focus beyond the company's current electric vehicle sales slump and toward its future in artificial intelligence, which also includes a robotaxi network. Despite Musk's ambitious forecast of turning Tesla into a $25 trillion company on the back of Optimus, the company faces stiff competition in both the robotaxi and humanoid robot markets. Tesla plans to begin builds of the robot on its Fremont pilot production line in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

The letter argues that this action threatens the Federal Reserve's crucial independence from political pressure, which is a cornerstone of the U.S. financial system. Trump sought to fire Cook for "cause" based on allegations of mortgage fraud, which the economists described as "unproven accusations." The signatories expressed their support for Governor Cook and the institutional safeguards that protect the central bank from day-to-day politics.</p>
