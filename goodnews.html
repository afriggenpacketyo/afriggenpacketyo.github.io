          <p>AI developer Anthropic has agreed to a landmark $1.5 billion settlement in a class-action lawsuit filed by authors who alleged the company used pirated copies of their books. The writers claimed an estimated 500,000 books were used to train the Claude AI model without permission or compensation. This agreement, which amounts to about $3,000 per book, is being hailed as the largest copyright recovery ever and a significant turning point in the legal battles between AI companies and content creators. The settlement resolves legacy claims and sets a major precedent for how AI models can be trained using copyrighted materials.</p>

          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed her pointed written exchanges with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. Barrett explained that a recent "spirited argument" from Jackson in a dissenting opinion merited an equally "spirited response" in the majority opinion. She emphasized that their professional disagreements are confined to legal arguments and do not affect their personal relationship, stating she has "great respect" for her colleague. Barrett invoked the late Justice Antonin Scalia's philosophy of attacking ideas, not people, to characterize the court's internal dynamic as collegial despite ideological divides.</p>

          <p>Legendary guitarist Slash, of Guns N’ Roses fame, is being honored as a character at Universal Studios Hollywood's Halloween Horror Nights, reflecting his deep, lifelong passion for theme parks. For years, Slash has composed music for the event's haunted houses and this year will even have a skeletal version of himself featured as a stilt-walking character. In a recent interview, he shared his love for classic rides like Disneyland's Haunted Mansion, praising their detailed craftsmanship. The collaboration highlights his dual interests in rock music and immersive, horror-themed entertainment, with his latest musical contribution being a banjo-inflected score for the "Scarecrow" maze.</p>

          <p>The eight largest U.S. technology companies saw their combined market capitalization increase by $420 billion in a single week, reaching a total of $21 trillion. The surge was driven by positive news, including a favorable court ruling for Alphabet in its antitrust case, which also benefited Apple by preserving its lucrative search engine deal with Google. Additionally, Broadcom's stock soared after announcing a new $10 billion AI chip contract, reportedly with OpenAI. This rally underscores the immense market power of these megacap companies, which now constitute approximately 36% of the S&P 500's total value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Remembering Giorgio Armani's Impact on Fashion and Business</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following his death at age 91, Giorgio Armani is being remembered not just for his revolutionary designs but also for his business acumen in building a global empire. He famously pioneered the deconstructed power suit for both men and women in the 1970s and 80s, redefining professional attire with a softer, more elegant silhouette. A key to his success was maintaining full ownership of his company, which allowed him to control his brand's vision across a wide range of products, from haute couture to affordable fashion and home goods. His strategic use of Hollywood, dressing stars on the red carpet, further cemented his brand's status as a symbol of sophisticated luxury.</p>

          <p>The large, 32-foot-tall "LAX" sign, a landmark for travelers arriving at Los Angeles International Airport for 25 years, is being temporarily removed. The dismantling is necessary to accommodate a major reconfiguration of the surrounding roadways designed to improve traffic flow and accessibility ahead of the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics. The project aims to create more direct access to parking and reduce congestion on Sepulveda Boulevard by moving airport traffic onto dedicated elevated roads. The iconic letters will be stored and reinstalled in a new location compatible with the updated road design upon the project's completion.</p>

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell significantly, dropping 16 basis points to 6.29% following the release of a weaker-than-expected August jobs report. This marks the largest one-day decrease since August 2024 and brings rates to their lowest point since October. The cooling labor market has increased expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, prompting lenders to lower their mortgage offerings in anticipation. This sharp decline provides some relief for potential homebuyers who have been facing high borrowing costs, though it remains to be seen if it will be enough to reinvigorate the housing market.

          <p>In response to a challenging political situation, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has initiated a wide-ranging government reshuffle, replacing key figures in his cabinet. The shake-up was prompted by the resignation of his deputy prime minister, but Starmer used the opportunity to make broader changes, including appointing a new home secretary and a new foreign secretary. This move is seen as an attempt to reassert authority, re-energize the government, and demonstrate a focus on delivery after a difficult first year in office. The reshuffle recasts the government's top team as it confronts a buoyant Reform UK opposition.</p>

          <p>An employment tribunal in the United Kingdom has ruled that spending less than an hour of work time on personal online browsing is not a sackable offense. The case involved an accountancy administrator who was fired after her employer used spyware to track her computer usage, finding she had spent time on sites like Amazon and Rightmove. The judge awarded her over £14,000 for unfair dismissal, noting that the time was not excessive and the company had no clear policy against such activity. The ruling suggests the dismissal was actually motivated by the business owner's desire to hire a relative.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals expecting an inheritance while married, especially in a community-property state like Arizona, it is crucial to keep the funds separate to protect them in case of a future divorce. Inheritances and gifts are typically considered separate property, but they can become marital assets if they are commingled with joint finances. To ensure the money remains solely yours, it should be deposited into a separate brokerage or bank account held only in your name. Investing these funds into shared retirement accounts like a 401(k) or IRA should be done with caution, as contributions and growth during the marriage are often considered community property.
