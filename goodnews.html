          <p>China has initiated the International Organization for Mediation in Hong Kong, aiming to establish it as a prominent dispute resolution body akin to the International Court of Justice. The convention forming the organization was signed by over 30 developing countries, signaling China's increasing influence in the Global South. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi stated that the IOMed would facilitate amicable resolution of international disputes and foster harmonious international relations. This move also aims to solidify Hong Kong's position as an international legal and dispute resolution hub in Asia, amidst the US's diminishing presence in global affairs. The establishment of this organization reflects China's growing role in international politics and its expanding influence within global bodies. </p>

          <p>Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Dallas, won the Scripps National Spelling Bee, overcoming a moment of overconfidence during the competition. Zaki, who was the runner-up in the previous year's bee, initially misspelled the word "commelina" due to rushing but recovered to correctly spell "eclaircissement" for the win. The bee celebrated its 100th anniversary, and Zaki may be remembered for a word he got wrong as much as the one he got right. He plans to donate a large portion of his $52,500 winnings to charity, adding to the $25,000 he won last year. </p>

          <p>China's power grid has implemented a quantum-powered "diamond ring" to safeguard against catastrophic collapses, using nitrogen-vacancy quantum sensors to detect grid instability in real-time. This technology was developed by the University of Science and Technology of China in collaboration with the State Grid Corporation. The need for such a system was highlighted by recent power outages in Spain, Portugal, and France, as well as instability in China's Xinjiang region due to renewable energy fluctuations. As renewable energy sources become more prevalent, this "diamond ring" acts as a high-precision sentinel for power lines. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's tough stance on tariffs is necessary to address the ballooning trade deficit with the European Union. The author, a former ambassador to the EU, suggests that Europe has been engaging in protectionism for decades and that Trump is serious about securing a fair share of their market. The author predicts that the EU will not make substantial concessions, leading Trump to impose significant tariffs, causing pain on both sides. The author argues that America deserves to be treated differently than other trading partners due to its long-standing security guarantee and trade imbalance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>AI-Enabled 'Vibe Coding' Allows Anyone to Write Software</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Advances in artificial intelligence are enabling individuals without formal training to write software through a process known as "vibe coding." This involves using AI chatbots and other tools to generate code, lowering the barrier to entry for software development. Chloe Samaha and her partner used vibe coding to create a working version of an online productivity manager in less than a day. While some experts believe AI coding could revolutionize the software industry and potentially displace coders, others see it as a tool that enhances designers' capabilities and automates simple tasks, allowing developers to focus on more complex work. The rise of AI in coding is expected to significantly change the software industry, but its impact on the role of human developers remains a topic of debate.</p>

          <p>Valerie, a mini dachshund, has returned home after surviving 529 days alone in the Australian bush, following her disappearance during a camping trip in November 2023. Despite efforts to locate her using a microchip and AirTag, Valerie remained missing for over a year, leading her owners to believe she might not survive. A photo taken by a farmer eventually led to her rescue by Kangala Wildlife Rescue, who spent nearly two months trying to capture her. Valerie has since settled back into her home, and her story has provided hope to many. </p>

          <p>The Japanese government is planning to boost rice exports in response to an expected long-term decline in domestic consumption. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries recommends exploring new overseas markets and supporting more efficient production. The report identified China, Singapore, the United States, Hong Kong, and Taiwan as target markets. The government aims to increase rice exports nearly eightfold to 353,000 tons in 2030 from 2024, and they seek to reduce production costs to compete with foreign-grown rice. </p>

          <p>The German central bank, the Bundesbank, expects inflation to remain on target at around 2%. In April, the annual inflation rate fell to 2.1%, the lowest rate since October, largely due to cheaper energy compared to the previous year. With oil prices remaining low, no major change is expected for May's annual inflation rate. The Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) is expected to publish its initial data on the May inflation rate. </p>
