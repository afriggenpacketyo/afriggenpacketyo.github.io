        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During Indira Gandhi's Emergency in the mid-1970s, India considered transitioning to a presidential system, inspired by Charles de Gaulle's France. Gandhi's government explored centralizing executive power and sidelining the judiciary, but the idea never fully materialized. The Forty-second Amendment Act in 1976 expanded Parliament's powers and limited judicial review, reflecting the imprint of a presidential system. Although the presidential system was never adopted, the idea resurfaced in 1982 when Gandhi considered stepping down as prime minister to become president.</p>
