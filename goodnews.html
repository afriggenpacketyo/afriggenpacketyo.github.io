          <p>The UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has permitted Royal Mail to cease Saturday deliveries for second-class letters, a measure intended to help the company manage costs amid declining letter volumes. Under the reformed Universal Service Obligation (USO), first-class letters will still be delivered six days a week, but delivery targets for both first and second-class mail will be slightly relaxed. Royal Mail welcomed the decision as a step toward ensuring a financially sustainable service. Ofcom stated the reform is necessary for the postal service's survival but emphasized that the company must now implement the changes effectively.</p>

          <p>A former official from China's central bank has argued that the yuan possesses the potential to become a safe-haven currency, challenging its current status. The assertion, made by Sheng Songcheng, is based on China's institutional credibility, low inflation, and large foreign reserves, which he claims are considerable advantages. The article notes that the yuan has shown resilience and stability during recent global stressors, such as US tariffs and the Russia-Ukraine war. This perspective contributes to the ongoing debate over the internationalization of the yuan as confidence in the US dollar is tested by debt and protectionism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Vienna's Extensive Social Housing System Praised as a Model for Affordability</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 02:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vienna is frequently cited as a model for successful housing policy, largely due to its extensive and stable social housing sector, which comprises 43% of the city's housing units. This system, which serves low- and middle-income households, results in significantly lower rent levels and helps suppress prices in the private market. Originating in the 1920s, the program is sustained by a levy on employee salaries and has resisted the large-scale privatization seen in other European cities. While the article notes challenges related to accessibility for newcomers, it ultimately presents Vienna's long-term political commitment to housing as a basic need as a key lesson for other cities.</p>

          <p>A research team at the Beijing Institute of Technology has successfully created what it calls the world's first cyborg bee by using the lightest-ever insect brain controller. Weighing only 74 milligrams, the device is strapped to a bee's back and uses three needles to send electronic pulses into its brain. These pulses create illusions that effectively command the bee's flight, directing it to turn, advance, or retreat. According to the researchers, the remote-controlled bee obeyed the commands with a 90% success rate, marking a significant step in micro-robotics and bio-integrated technology.</p>

          <p>A large section of the iconic Sycamore Gap tree, which was illegally felled in September 2023, has been installed as a permanent memorial at a visitor center in Northumberland, England. The trunk is now the centerpiece of an installation that allows the public to touch and interact with the wood, surrounded by benches inscribed with public messages of sorrow and hope. The felling of the beloved tree sparked global outrage, and two men were recently found guilty of the act. The new display aims to honor the tree's memory and provide a place for reflection and connection with nature.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government is introducing a one-time subsidy to encourage companies and social organizations to hire unemployed young people between the ages of 16 and 24. Employers can receive up to 1,500 yuan for each new hire who is signed to a formal contract for at least three months. This measure is part of a broader effort to stabilize the labor market and support household incomes amid persistent economic pressures, including sluggish growth and trade disputes. Additionally, China's economic planner has allocated 10 billion yuan to expand its "work-for-relief" public works program to generate more jobs.</p>

Housing prices in the capital surged over 19% in June, prompting authorities to address the rapid expansion of household debt. While the broader economy has shown signs of slowing, the central bank prioritized financial stability over stimulating growth. Analysts expect the bank may consider a rate cut in its next meeting, provided the new mortgage lending restrictions successfully stabilize the property market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of brown pelicans that survived Southern California's deadliest toxic algal bloom in nearly a decade were released back into the wild. The bloom, which began in January, poisoned hundreds of marine animals with domoic acid, causing seizures and abnormal behavior. The thirteen successfully rehabilitated pelicans were cared for at the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center in Huntington Beach. Their release marks a moment of hope after a difficult period for local wildlife, which saw an abnormally large number of seabirds and sea lions sickened by the intense and prolonged bloom.</p>
