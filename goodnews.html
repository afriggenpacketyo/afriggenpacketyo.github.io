          <p>The urban planning philosophy of King Charles, once a source of conflict with the architectural establishment, is now inspiring the design of 12 new towns in England. These developments will prioritize walkability, environmental sustainability, and "gentle density" with traditional housing styles like terraces over high-rise buildings. TV architect George Clarke notes that the King's long-held views, which favor community-focused and harmonious design, have shifted from controversial to mainstream, influencing a new generation of architects to create more humane and locally sensitive living spaces.</p>

          <p>As Beijing prepares to host a global summit on women's rights in October, China's foreign ministry is emphasizing the country's advancements in gender equality. A ministry spokesperson stated that China is an "active actor" in promoting women's development, with President Xi Jinping recently publishing books on the topic that cover gender equality alongside traditional family values. However, sources suggest that domestic grassroots NGOs may not be invited to the summit unless sponsored by international entities, raising questions about the scope of participation.</p>

          <p>The remains of two Scottish soldiers, missing since the World War One Battle of Loos, have been identified over 100 years later after being discovered at a construction site in France. A specialized Ministry of Defence unit, known as the "war detectives," used artefacts like regimental badges and unusual buttons from the Newcastle Corporation Tramways to narrow down the search. DNA testing with living relatives ultimately confirmed the identities of Lance Corporal Gordon McPherson and Lieutenant James Grant Allan, allowing them to be laid to rest with full military honors.</p>

          <p>One year after Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic flooding and landslides in Western North Carolina, volunteer pilots are reflecting on their crucial role in the immediate aftermath. With roads washed out and communications down, pilots from commercial companies and civilian networks were among the first to witness the scale of the destruction. They conducted hundreds of missions, initially performing rescues for stranded residents and later air-dropping essential supplies like medicine and food, providing a vital lifeline before ground-based aid could reach the isolated communities.</p>

          <p>Startup founders are sharing their experiences of navigating the emotional and professional challenges of business failure, a common reality in the entrepreneurial world. Founders describe the pain of disappointing investors, laying off employees, and losing their personal identity, which is often deeply intertwined with their company. After returning to corporate life or starting new ventures, they emphasize the importance of learning from mistakes, developing resilience, and reframing success around a clear sense of purpose rather than purely financial outcomes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Women's Rugby World Cup final between England and Canada showcases a significant contrast in financial backing, raising questions about the future of professionalism in the sport. England's team benefits from full-time professional contracts and a well-funded domestic league, while Canada's players are largely amateur and relied on a fundraising drive to cover their World Cup preparations. Despite the resource gap, Canada's strong performance challenges the notion that massive investment is the only path to success, though a win for England could further validate the professional model.</p>

          <p>As England prepares for the Women's Rugby World Cup final, players are reflecting on the journey from amateurism to professionalism. Hooker Amy Cokayne still serves as an RAF police officer through an elite athlete scheme, while veteran Marlie Packer was a working plumber when she won the 2014 World Cup, having taken unpaid leave for the tournament. Their stories, along with those of former teachers and painters, highlight the dramatic shift in women's rugby, where top players can now focus solely on their sport instead of balancing demanding day jobs.</p>

          <p>A new peace movement is emerging in Germany, with recent demonstrations in Berlin drawing thousands to protest the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. Organized by figures like politician Sahra Wagenknecht, the rallies call for the German government to support peace negotiations and halt all arms deliveries to conflict zones. While the movement is currently fragmented among different political groups, including the Left Party, the growing debate over reintroducing compulsory military service could serve as a powerful catalyst to unify and mobilize larger numbers of people, particularly the youth.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is championing a new, "ambitious" youth migration agreement with the European Union, hoping its positive economic impact will ease pressure on the upcoming autumn Budget. The proposed scheme would allow individuals aged 18 to 30 to work in the UK for up to two years, which Reeves argues will boost growth and business. She is urging the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to factor the potential economic benefits into its forecasts, potentially reducing the need for significant tax increases or spending cuts to address a fiscal shortfall.
