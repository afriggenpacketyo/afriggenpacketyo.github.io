          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell achieved a surprise pole position at the Singapore Grand Prix, narrowly beating Red Bull's Max Verstappen. This marks Russell's first pole since the Canadian Grand Prix and a significant result for Mercedes at a track where they haven't secured pole since 2018. The qualifying session was dramatic, with Russell brushing a wall on his fastest lap and Verstappen being impeded by Lando Norris, which may have cost him the top spot. The result sets up an intriguing race, with championship leader Oscar Piastri starting third.</p>

          <p>Olive loaf, a processed deli meat known for its embedded green olives and pimentos, has largely vanished from American delicatessens and lunchboxes after its peak popularity from the 1940s to the 1970s. Once a cheap and visually distinct option for working-class families, its decline began in the 1970s with growing health concerns about processed meats, sodium, and preservatives. Changing consumer preferences towards fresher, more natural foods, along with the rise of microwaveable meals, further diminished its appeal. While some retain a nostalgic fondness for it, experts believe a significant comeback for the divisive deli meat is unlikely.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its agreement to key parts of a Gaza ceasefire proposal outlined by U.S. President Donald Trump, including the release of all hostages. In response, Israel stated it is preparing to implement the first phase of the plan, and President Trump urged an immediate halt to the bombing of Gaza to facilitate the safe return of hostages. While Hamas's response is viewed as a positive step by the U.S., some elements of the deal, particularly concerning the future governance of Gaza, remain subject to further negotiation within a broader Palestinian framework. The plan calls for a phased Israeli withdrawal and the establishment of a technocratic Palestinian body to administer the territory.</p>

          <p>A civil rights alliance in Pakistan-administered Kashmir has called off days of violent protests after reaching an agreement with Pakistani authorities. The demonstrations, which resulted in the deaths of seven civilians and three police officers, were centered on demands for cheaper wheat, reduced electricity tariffs, and an end to lavish benefits for the political elite. Following negotiations prompted by a delegation sent by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the regional government agreed to the protesters' demands. The alliance leader, Shaukat Nawaz Mir, announced the end of the protests, expressing gratitude for the government's willingness to resolve the issues.</p>

          <p>Markeiz Ryan, a 36-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran, has found a more fulfilling and financially stable life in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, after leaving the military in 2019. He lives comfortably on approximately $4,000 a month from VA disability, the GI Bill, and teaching English, paying just $850 for a modern two-bedroom apartment in a high-rise. Ryan contrasts his current life, which allows him to focus on personal happiness and growth, with his experience in the U.S., where he felt unmotivated and trapped in a cycle of poverty. He says the lower cost of living removes monetary pressure, allowing him to live beyond mere survival mode.</p>

          <p>After a comprehensive, 20-year renovation project, the tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep III in Egypt's Valley of the Kings has reopened to the public. Amenhotep III, who ruled during the prominent 18th Dynasty, was buried in one of the largest tombs in the valley, which was discovered in 1799 but had been looted of its contents. The Japanese-led restoration focused on preserving the tomb's intricate wall paintings depicting the pharaoh with various gods and scenes from the Book of the Dead. The reopening is part of Egypt's broader effort to revitalize its tourism sector, a crucial source of foreign currency for the nation.</p>

          <p>Lyft CEO David Risher recounted his 1996 decision to leave a management role at Microsoft for a then-unknown online bookstore called Amazon, a move Bill Gates called "the stupidest decision." Risher was convinced by Jeff Bezos's powerful vision, which included an obsessive focus on the customer experience and a bold prediction that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by 2000. Risher, who became a senior vice president, was instrumental in expanding Amazon beyond books into new categories like music and movies. Amazon ultimately surpassed Bezos's goal, hitting $1.6 billion in revenue in 1999, validating Risher's risky but rewarding career change.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Irenic Capital Management has acquired an approximate 2% stake in the software company Workiva and is advocating for significant changes. Irenic is calling for improved operational efficiency, a review of strategic alternatives including a potential sale, and enhanced corporate governance, specifically the collapse of its dual-class share structure that gives founders outsized control. Despite strong revenue growth and high customer retention, Workiva has struggled with profitability, trading at a discount to its peers. Irenic has proposed adding two new members to the board and has not ruled out a proxy fight if an agreement isn't reached. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Urenco's uranium enrichment facility in New Mexico, the only one of its kind in the U.S., is rapidly expanding its capacity to meet a resurgence in demand for nuclear power. This revival is driven by the projected electricity needs of AI data centers and a push for domestic manufacturing, coupled with a looming ban on Russian uranium imports by 2028. After a decade of decline following the Fukushima disaster, the industry is now facing a supply gap, prompting Urenco to increase its capacity by 15%. However, the entire nuclear supply chain, particularly uranium conversion, faces bottlenecks that must be addressed to support ambitious national goals for nuclear energy expansion.

          <p>Michaela Del Barrio, a 37-year-old mother with a family history of breast cancer, was diagnosed with the disease after persistently advocating for early screening. Despite being told she was too young for a mammogram in her 20s, she later pushed for an assessment at a high-risk clinic, which led to a breast MRI that detected two suspicious masses. Her diagnosis of early-stage invasive ductal carcinoma, without any prior symptoms, highlights the importance of personal risk awareness and self-advocacy. Oncologists stress that while average-risk women should begin mammograms at 40, those with higher risk factors need a personalized screening plan that may start much earlier.</p>

          <p>Primatologist and conservationist Jane Goodall, who passed away at 91, fundamentally changed humanity's understanding of its place in the natural world. Her journey began as a young woman with no college experience who convinced anthropologist Louis Leakey to let her study chimpanzees in Africa. Her groundbreaking discovery in 1960 that chimps make and use tools shattered the long-held belief that this was a uniquely human trait, forcing a redefinition of humankind. Goodall's work extended beyond research into global conservation efforts, establishing animal sanctuaries and forest preservation programs, leaving a legacy of empathy and interspecies connection.</p>

          <p>Ted Koerner is on track to be one of the first residents to move into a completely rebuilt home in Altadena after the Eaton fire destroyed his property in January. His primary motivation for the rapid reconstruction is his 13-year-old golden retriever, Daisy, who he credits with saving his life multiple times. Determined to let Daisy live out her final years in their home, Koerner liquidated retirement funds to fast-track the project without waiting for insurance, persistently navigated bureaucratic hurdles, and kept his building plans simple. His story offers lessons in tenacity and focus for thousands of other fire victims facing a long and complicated rebuilding process.</p>
