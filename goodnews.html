        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chelsea's manager, Enzo Maresca, has publicly stated the club has no plans to sell 19-year-old defender Josh Acheampong, despite interest from other teams in England and Europe. Maresca emphasized his belief in Acheampong's potential to become a top player for Chelsea, outlining a clear plan for his development within the team. Sources close to the player have dismissed rumors of his frustration at the club, highlighting his recent five-year contract and breakthrough season. The manager's comments suggest that any potential loan would only be considered if it aligns with the long-term strategy for his growth at Stamford Bridge.</p>

The pandas‚Äî24-year-old Rauhin and her three offspring‚Äîwere sent to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding. Their departure leaves only two giant pandas remaining in Japan, both at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo, who are also scheduled to return to China next year. A farewell ceremony drew thousands of visitors, marking the end of a successful joint breeding program that began in 1994 and produced 17 cubs, the most outside of China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study from the Japan Institute for Health Security found a correlation between consuming a traditional Japanese-style diet and lower rates of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals. The research, which surveyed nearly 12,500 employees, analyzed diets rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables. While 30.9% of the total cohort showed depressive symptoms, those who adhered more closely to a Japanese diet were less likely to do so. Researchers suggest that nutrients like folic acid and omega-3 fatty acids, found in the diet's components, may help release mood-regulating neurotransmitters and provide anti-inflammatory benefits.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement has captured Antoine Massey, the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center six weeks ago in a major jailbreak. Massey, 33, was arrested peacefully at a New Orleans residence and will be transferred to a secure state correctional facility. The May 16 escape, which officials have criticized as a result of poor management and infrastructure, went unnoticed for hours. Only one inmate, Derrick Groves, remains at large, with a $50,000 reward offered for information leading to his capture. At least 16 other individuals have been arrested for allegedly aiding the escapees.</p>

          <p>The "furutsu sando," a Japanese fruit sandwich, is making its debut on UK high streets with Marks & Spencer launching a limited-edition strawberries and cream version. This snack, typically made with soft white bread, whipped cream, and fruit, has long been popular in Japan and recently gained global attention through social media. The M&S sandwich became the chain's top-selling sandwich shortly after its launch, indicating a strong public curiosity. The article explores the cultural origins of the fruit sando in Japan and places it in the context of other unconventional sandwiches from around the world, questioning the definition of a sandwich itself.</p>

          <p>Kat Sadler and Lizzie Davidson, the real-life sisters and creative force behind the BAFTA-winning BBC comedy "Such Brave Girls," discuss the upcoming second series. The show, which follows two sisters and their mother, uses dark humor to explore taboo subjects like mental health, abortion, and financial desperation. Sadler, the writer, says the new series will be even more depressing but funnier, influenced by their own upbringing in an all-woman household and the "bleak" modern dating scene. The comedy satirizes the pressures on young women, with one character declaring it's "better dead than single," reflecting the show's twisted and cutting perspective.</p>

The project was undertaken by a Nagoya-based company whose leaders have a personal connection to the city.

The plant is rich in minerals and dietary fiber, and research from Chubu University suggests it may enhance immune function. A farm in Kasugai, Aichi Prefecture, is successfully cultivating the cacti, which are sold online and served in high-end restaurants. This trend aligns with a 2017 UN report highlighting the plant's potential as a resilient and nutritious food source, especially in the face of climate change, as it can thrive in dry conditions with minimal resources.</p>

          <p>The article explores the growing field of phage therapy, which uses viruses that prey on bacteria (bacteriophages) to treat infections. This century-old idea was largely abandoned after the discovery of antibiotics but is now being revisited as a solution to the growing crisis of antibiotic resistance. The author participates in a project by collecting samples, one of which‚Äîfrom a toilet‚Äîis found to contain a phage capable of killing bacteria from a patient's persistent urinary tract infection. While challenges remain in bringing this therapy into mainstream medicine, experts see it as a promising future alternative for treating infections that are becoming incurable.</p>

Using a special P-band radar frequency, the satellite can penetrate clouds and foliage to measure the woody material in tree trunks, where most carbon is stored. This pioneering technology will allow scientists to create the first global 3D map of forests and more accurately estimate their role in mitigating climate change. The initial images have already revealed previously hidden features, such as wetlands and areas of concealed deforestation, providing a powerful new tool for environmental monitoring.</p>

Feeling isolated, she spent hundreds of hours in her garage painting detailed portraits of 44 of her classmates whom she had lost touch with over the years. She then gifted the paintings to each student, an act that was met with surprise and admiration. Her classmates expressed regret for not having paid more attention to her, while Schafer hoped her project would encourage others to realize that social barriers are often self-imposed and can be overcome by trying to connect.</p>

          <p>A fourth federal judge has permanently blocked one of President Trump's executive orders aimed at punishing an elite law firm, this time targeting Susman Godfrey. U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan ruled the order "unconstitutional from beginning to end," following three similar rulings against orders targeting other major law firms. The executive orders sought to penalize firms for representing clients or causes opposed by the president by suspending security clearances and ending government contracts. The judge's decision marks another significant legal defeat for the administration's campaign, which has been described by the judiciary as an assault on the American legal system.</p>

Frontman Matty Healy, known for his unpredictable stage presence, offered his signature verbose and anxious banter but steered clear of his more controversial antics like eating raw meat. While the band was musically tight, the performance was described as feeling safe and lacking the wild, punky energy of some past shows. Healy acknowledged the band's desire to focus its legacy on "love and friendship" rather than politics, a notable shift for the outspoken group in their only scheduled performance of the year.</p>

Hundreds of clergy and pilgrims from around the world traveled to the remote village of Kwethluk, Alaska, for the two-day glorification ceremony. St. Olga, who lived from 1916 to 1979, is remembered for her humility and for healing trauma, particularly sexual abuse. After her death, accounts of miracles attributed to her began to spread, leading to her veneration.

While the figure is close to the entire global GDP, making a direct influx of new capital unlikely, analysts interpret this as a prediction for the total crypto market capitalization to reach that valuation. This forecast aligns with other bullish analysts who believe a global race to accumulate assets like Bitcoin will drive mass adoption over the next decade.

          <p>Jim Cramer outlined the key events for investors to watch in the upcoming week, focusing on the labor report and an earnings release from Constellation Brands. He anticipates the alcohol maker may report disappointing results, citing challenges from the rise of weight-loss drugs, consumer preference for cannabis, and the impact of U.S. immigration policy on its Hispanic consumer base. Cramer also noted that the upcoming Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index could influence the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates. He reflected on the past quarter, observing that the market finished strong after a turbulent start, reinforcing the value of a steady investment approach. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia claimed a commanding 159-run victory over West Indies in their first Test match, largely thanks to a five-wicket haul from bowler Josh Hazlewood. The West Indies team suffered a dramatic collapse in the final session of the third day, losing all ten of their wickets and allowing Australia to win with two days to spare. Despite a promising start to their second innings, the hosts' top order was dismantled by Hazlewood's controlled bowling spell. A late, entertaining partnership provided some resistance, but it was not enough to prevent the decisive Australian win, sealed in the final over of the day.</p>
