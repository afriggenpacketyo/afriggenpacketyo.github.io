          <p>English golfer John Parry made a spectacular shot, scoring the first hole-in-one of this year's Open Championship at Royal Portrush. The ace occurred on the 192-yard 13th hole during the third round, with Parry using an 8-iron. This marks the 31st hole-in-one recorded at The Open since 1981 and what Parry estimates is the tenth of his career, though he called it "definitely the best one." The achievement was a highlight of a strong round for Parry, who shot a four-under-par 67.</p>

          <p>A.P. Deauville has issued a voluntary recall for more than 67,000 cases of its Power Stick brand roll-on antiperspirant deodorant, affecting products sold at major retailers like Walmart, Amazon, and Dollar Tree. The recall was initiated due to deviations from the FDA's Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations. Three specific scents—"power fresh," "spring fresh," and "original nourishing"—are included in the recall, with specific lot numbers identified for consumers. No injuries have been reported, and the recall is a precautionary measure.</p>

          <p>The Pennsylvania-based Christian group Generation Life recently conducted "beach outreach" on the Jersey shore, engaging young people in conversations about love and relationships to promote chastity. The activists connect with Gen Z by discussing modern anxieties like social media's negative impact on self-esteem and the transactional nature of dating. Instead of focusing on abstinence, they frame chastity as a "countercultural" way to reclaim personal dignity and build deeper connections. This article explores their mission to update a traditional message for a generation reportedly having less sex but also increasingly secular.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from a knee bone bruise much quicker than initially expected. The injury, sustained on July 2, was feared to be severe, but Muncy has already resumed running and swinging a bat. Doctors told him he was a "millisecond" away from needing major surgery. His return is crucial for the Dodgers, whose offense has struggled significantly in his absence, averaging less than three runs per game since he was sidelined. His progress suggests a return sooner than the original six-week estimate.</p>

          <p>Twenty-eight years after the event, Britain's 1997 men's 4x400m relay team was awarded their world championship gold medals at the London Diamond League meeting. The team, consisting of Roger Black, Iwan Thomas, Jamie Baulch, Mark Richardson, and Mark Hylton, was originally awarded silver. They were elevated to gold after the U.S. team was disqualified in 2008 when team member Antonio Pettigrew confessed to doping. The belated ceremony provided the athletes a long-overdue moment of recognition in front of a cheering home crowd of 60,000.</p>

          <h2>Bestselling Author Argues 'Follow Your Passion' Is the Worst Career Advice</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to bestselling author and NYU professor Scott Galloway, "follow your passion" is the worst career advice, often given by those who are already wealthy. Instead of blindly pursuing a passion, Galloway advises finding an intersection between what you are good at and what can be profitable. He emphasizes that success often comes from enduring rejection and being willing to pivot. This sentiment is echoed by other leaders, like Mastercard's CEO, who suggest focusing on your unique strengths and finding where they align with market needs.</p>
