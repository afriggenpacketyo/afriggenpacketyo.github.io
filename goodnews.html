          <p>The United States and China have agreed to a tariff truce, offering temporary relief to businesses but prolonging economic uncertainty. The U.S. will lower its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce its tariff on American goods from 125% to 10%. Experts caution that the reduced tariffs are not permanent and could rebound if a long-term trade deal is not reached within 90 days. This CBS News article highlights the potential impact on consumer confidence, spending, and the possibility of a U.S. recession, while also noting that businesses still face added costs with the reduced tariffs in place.</p>
