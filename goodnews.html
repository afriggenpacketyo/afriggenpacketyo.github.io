        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent record-breaking surge in the price of gold is prompting some market strategists to declare the decline of the traditional 60/40 stock-and-bond portfolio. An alternative 60/20/20 model is gaining traction, which allocates 20% to alternative assets like gold and bitcoin, halving the traditional bond allocation. This shift is driven by the observation that stocks and bonds are increasingly moving in tandem, diminishing bonds' effectiveness as a hedge against inflation and geopolitical risk. Gold ETFs have seen unprecedented inflows, with investors pouring billions into funds as central banks increase their holdings amid a broader de-dollarization trend and global tensions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California State Senator Scott Wiener, a prominent San Francisco Democrat, is reportedly planning to run for the congressional seat currently held by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. While Wiener had previously established an exploratory committee with the intention of running after Pelosi's retirement, the entry of a progressive candidate into the race has apparently accelerated his timeline. Pelosi, who is 85, has not yet announced if she will seek another term, and her age is a factor amid calls for new leadership within the Democratic party. Wiener is well-known for his pro-housing legislation and advocacy for LGBTQ+ rights, and his candidacy sets up a significant political contest in San Francisco.</p>

          <p>Even if you are actively making payments to a debt collector, you may not be protected from being sued for the outstanding balance unless you have a formal, written agreement stating otherwise. Many repayment plans are informal verbal arrangements, which do not legally prevent a collector from pursuing legal action to secure a judgment, enabling tools like wage garnishment. To protect yourself, it is crucial to get any payment agreement in writing, explicitly stating that legal action will not be pursued as long as you adhere to the plan. Understanding your rights under state and federal law, and keeping meticulous records of all payments and communications, is essential to avoid further escalation.</p>

          <h2>Bodybuilding Community Shifts from 'Dirty Bulking' to Healthier 'Lean Bulking' Methods</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 12:24:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The bodybuilding world is increasingly abandoning the traditional "dirty bulking" method, which involves consuming massive amounts of calories from any source to gain muscle, in favor of a more moderate "lean bulking" approach. This newer trend emphasizes a slight caloric surplus from healthy, whole foods to build muscle more slowly and sustainably, minimizing fat gain. The shift reflects both a better understanding of exercise science and a broader cultural move towards wellness and a desire to maintain a chiseled physique year-round. While healthier than consuming junk food, experts caution that extreme dieting associated with lean bulking can still pose health risks, including eating disorders and nutritional deficiencies.</p>

          <p>With gold and silver prices surging to record highs, investors are presented with a unique opportunity but also face increased risks. Financial experts advise a cautious and strategic approach to safely investing in these precious metals. Key recommendations include understanding the different risk levels of various investment types, such as physical bullion versus mining stocks or ETFs. It is also suggested to split investment funds between both metals to diversify within the asset class and to adhere to the conventional wisdom of limiting total precious metal allocation to no more than 10% of one's overall portfolio to maintain balance and mitigate volatility.

          <p>In an excerpt from his upcoming memoir, "Vagabond," acclaimed actor Tim Curry reflects on his life and career, embracing the identity of a wanderer who has professionally pretended and masqueraded for decades. He recounts a surreal experience in 1976 when he was nearly ejected from a screening of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" after being mistaken for an imposter of himself. Curry explains that the book will not be a typical Hollywood tell-all but rather a mosaic of who he is, viewed through the lens of the many characters he has played. He also touches upon the 2012 stroke that has physically limited him but left his memories and mind intact for storytelling.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has removed travel restrictions on Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and former Columbia University student, allowing him to travel across the U.S. to speak at events while he contests a deportation case initiated by the Trump administration. Khalil was arrested in March as part of a crackdown on pro-Palestinian campus activists and was detained for months. His lawyers argued that the travel limitations infringed on his First Amendment rights to speak on issues of public concern. An immigration judge previously ruled he could be deported for allegedly omitting information on his green card application, a decision his attorneys are currently appealing.</p>

          <p>The Conservative Party in the UK has given Rupert Lowe, a former Reform UK MP, a seat on the influential Public Accounts Committee, which is responsible for overseeing government spending. Lowe, who was elected in 2024 but later expelled from Reform UK after a disagreement with party leadership, stated he was "delighted" with the appointment and promised to scrutinize public spending rigorously. The Conservative Party justified the move by stating Lowe "shares our values on cutting waste," continuing a practice of offering committee seats to non-Tory MPs who align with them on specific issues. This appointment highlights the fluid political alliances forming in the current UK Parliament.</p>

          <p>In his new book, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson explores a range of scientific questions, from the effects of an exploding moon to the inaccuracies of time travel in movies like "Superman." He critiques modern AI like ChatGPT for providing answers that lack personality and soul, contrasting it with the more imaginative and playful scientific inquiries he now receives from the public. While Tyson affirms the high likelihood of life existing elsewhere in the universe, he remains deeply skeptical that aliens have ever visited Earth. He points to the modern ubiquity of high-resolution cameras, noting the conspicuous absence of any clear footage of extraterrestrial visitors as a key reason for his doubt.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is set to begin the formal process of deciding which states will hold the first presidential nominating contests in 2028, a decision that will significantly shape the upcoming election cycle. The party's rules committee will review applications from states vying for a spot in the influential "early window," which grants them outsized attention and power in selecting a nominee. This follows the DNC's recent overhaul of its calendar, which controversially demoted the Iowa caucuses and elevated South Carolina to the first-in-the-nation primary position. States like New Hampshire, Nevada, and Michigan are expected to compete fiercely for the top spots in the new lineup.</p>

          <p>U.S. electricity companies are struggling to accurately forecast how much new power generation will be needed to support the boom in artificial intelligence, as tech firms shop ambitious data center projects to multiple utilities simultaneously. This duplication of requests makes it difficult to determine the true scale of future demand, raising concerns that utilities could over-invest billions in infrastructure that may not be needed. While experts agree that a historic increase in electricity consumption is coming, the uncertainty complicates long-term planning for grid reliability. The challenge is to secure firm financial commitments from data center developers to rationalize the numerous requests and plan infrastructure more efficiently.</p>

According to NerdWallet, the optimal time to book Thanksgiving flights is this week, while Christmas travel should be secured by the first week of November.

          <p>Four years after the Taliban's return to power effectively silenced women's sports in Afghanistan, the national women's football team is set to compete again on the international stage. A newly formed refugee team, comprised of players now based in Australia, the UK, and Europe, will participate in a FIFA-hosted tournament in the United Arab Emirates. For the players, this represents more than just a game; it is an act of defiance and a chance to represent the millions of Afghan women whose rights have been stripped away. The tournament marks a significant step towards the team's official readmission into FIFA and sends a powerful message of resilience and hope.</p>
