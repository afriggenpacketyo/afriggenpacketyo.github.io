          <h2>Chinese Officials Urge Automakers to End 'Irrational' Price Competition in Electric Vehicle Market</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese government officials have called on the nation's carmakers to cease what they term "irrational competition" and a damaging price spiral within the new energy vehicle (NEV) industry. During a meeting with the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers and major companies like BYD, a central guiding group emphasized the "extreme urgency" of curbing the price war. Officials stressed that leading companies must set an example by engaging in lawful and rational market practices. A separate symposium held by multiple regulatory bodies reinforced the message, advocating for healthy industrial development through cost oversight and price monitoring to stabilize the market.</p>

          <p>WNBA players are publicly demanding better compensation, highlighted by pre-game shirts stating "Pay us what you owe us" during the All-Star Game, as they negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement. While the league has historically reported financial losses, recent data suggests significant growth, with rising attendance, ballooning broadcast rights deals, and total revenue approaching $200 million. Despite this, players currently receive less than 10% of league revenue, a stark contrast to other professional sports. The article argues that despite complex league accounting, the soaring valuation of franchises like the New York Liberty indicates the league's financial health is strong enough to support increased player salaries and roster sizes.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Lawmakers Introduce 'Safer Beauty Bill Package' to Regulate Toxic Chemicals in Cosmetics</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers has introduced four new bills, collectively known as the "Safer Beauty Bill Package," aimed at strengthening federal oversight of the personal care products industry. The legislation seeks to ban hazardous ingredients like formaldehyde and phthalates, mandate full ingredient transparency, and provide protections for women of color and salon workers, who are disproportionately exposed to toxic chemicals. This move comes as an update to the 2022 Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act, which critics argue did not sufficiently address the safety of ingredients. The U.S. currently restricts only a dozen chemicals in cosmetics, compared to over 2,400 banned by the European Union.</p>

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is set to join Barcelona on a season-long loan after arriving in Catalonia to finalize the deal. The 27-year-old player received permission from his club to complete the move, which includes an option for Barcelona to buy him at the end of the loan period. This transfer follows Rashford's public declaration that he was seeking a new challenge after being dropped by United's head coach. The move has progressed rapidly, and he is expected to undergo a medical soon, potentially joining Barcelona's pre-season tour in Asia later this week.</p>

          <p>Ecuador has extradited José Adolfo Macías Villamar, known as "Fito," the notorious leader of the violent Los Choneros drug gang, to the United States. Macías, who was recaptured in June after a prison escape, faces U.S. charges for importing thousands of pounds of cocaine. His gang is accused of smuggling weapons from the U.S. and using extreme violence against law enforcement and civilians while controlling key trafficking routes with the help of Mexican cartels. The extradition proceeded after the U.S. provided guarantees regarding the 45-year-old's rights, marking a significant step in bilateral efforts to combat transnational organized crime.</p>

          <p>A research team from China and Singapore has developed an innovative nanovaccine that has successfully suppressed cancer recurrence and metastasis in animal trials. The bio-inspired approach targets cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are known for their self-renewal properties that contribute to tumor growth and spread. Detailed in the journal Nature Nanotechnology, the findings suggest a promising new avenue for developing personalized cancer vaccines. By specifically targeting the resilient CSCs within tumors, the researchers hope to overcome a major hurdle in cancer treatment and prevent the disease from returning after initial therapies have been administered.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Venture capitalists often use the "power law" principle when deciding which startups to fund, according to Peter Specht, a general partner at Creandum. This concept dictates that a very small number of investments will generate the vast majority of a fund's returns, meaning one or two massive successes can outweigh all other losses combined. Consequently, VCs actively seek companies with "outsized-outcome potential" that could become category-defining giants like Spotify or Klarna. Founders are advised to pitch a bold vision, demonstrating how their company can achieve massive scale, rather than focusing on smaller, more certain exits, to attract this type of investment.

          <p>U.S. imports of rare-earth magnets from China surged by 660% in June compared to the previous month, as American companies rushed to secure supplies. This followed a preliminary trade deal that saw Beijing ease export restrictions on these critical components, which are vital for electric vehicles, wind turbines, and other advanced technologies. China dominates the global market, controlling about 90% of production. The scramble highlights U.S. dependency on China for these materials and the significant impact of trade policy on critical supply chains, prompting renewed efforts in the U.S. to develop domestic mining and recycling capabilities.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive review of the water industry in England and Wales has recommended the most significant reforms since privatization 30 years ago, including the abolition of the current regulator, Ofwat. Authored by Sir Jon Cunliffe, the report contains 88 recommendations to address widespread criticism over issues like sewage spills and leaks, which stem from chronic underinvestment. The proposed reforms would enforce minimum capital levels to prevent financial instability at companies like Thames Water and shift the regulatory focus towards long-term infrastructure investment. While bills are set to rise to fund over £100 billion in upgrades, the changes aim to prevent future price spikes caused by delayed maintenance.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1984-85 miners' strike. The incident involved thousands of police officers and striking miners clashing outside a coking plant in Rotherham, resulting in numerous injuries and 95 arrests. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry, a Labour manifesto promise, will address the "unanswered questions" that have persisted for 40 years. It will be chaired by the Bishop of Sheffield and will examine the events of the day and their aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of miners and allegations of falsified police evidence.</p>

In Guinea, the massive Simandou iron ore project, jointly developed by Rio Tinto and Chinese firms, is now on track to start shipments in November after the completion of essential rail and port facilities. Similarly, a new railway line will connect the vast Gara Djebilet mine in Algeria's Sahara Desert to Mediterranean ports over 1,650km away.

The advanced stealth jet was diverted on June 14 due to bad weather and subsequently developed a technical fault that local engineers could not fix. The UK's Ministry of Defence deployed a specialist team of 14 engineers and equipment to conduct repairs. The prolonged stay of the $110 million aircraft sparked considerable public curiosity and online humor.

          <p>Despite years of severe U.S. trade restrictions, Chinese tech giant Huawei has transformed itself from a telecommunications firm into a formidable competitor across the entire artificial intelligence landscape. The company has developed a full-stack AI portfolio, including advanced Ascend AI chips to rival Nvidia's, cloud computing services, data centers, and industry-specific AI models under its Pangu series. This strategic pivot, forced by external pressures, has turned Huawei into a national champion for Beijing's technological ambitions. Analysts note that no other company has demonstrated competence across so many complex, high-barrier sectors, from smart cars to advanced semiconductors. (not investment advice)</p>
