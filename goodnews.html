          <p>A federal judge in Boston temporarily halted the Trump administration's ban on Harvard University enrolling international students. This decision came hours after Harvard filed a lawsuit challenging the ban, which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) implemented after accusing the school of tolerating "anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators." Judge Allison Burroughs stated that Harvard had demonstrated that it would suffer immediate and irreparable harm if the ban were to take effect. The lawsuit calls the revocation a "blatant violation of the First Amendment" and the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution.</p>

          <p>In a New York Times guest essay, Harvard professor Steven Pinker addresses the "Harvard Derangement Syndrome," arguing that the invective aimed at the university has become unhinged. He acknowledges Harvard's serious ailments, such as the erosion of academic freedom and a lack of viewpoint diversity, but contends that the extreme criticisms and punitive actions by the Trump administration are disproportionate. Pinker calls for a more balanced approach, urging a diagnosis of specific problems rather than a wholesale assault on the institution, emphasizing the need for proportionality and intellectual freedom in dealing with educational institutions.</p>

          <p>To improve team chemistry and player comfort, the Los Angeles Dodgers are using two planes for road trips.
