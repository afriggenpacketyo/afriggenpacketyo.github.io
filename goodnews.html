          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 02:41:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem has announced that energy bills in the UK will fall by 7% in July, marking the first decrease in a year, translating to an annual saving of ¬£129 for a typical household. This drop reflects a decrease in international wholesale gas prices; however, energy prices remain high, and many households are struggling with debt. Charities have expressed that this reduction offers little comfort to those burdened with significant debt to suppliers, and there are calls for more targeted government support and energy efficiency measures. The price cap does not apply to Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market.</p>

          <p>A man in Norway was surprised to wake up and find a large container ship had run aground and crashed into his front garden, missing his house by only meters. The 135-meter ship, the NCL Salten, veered off course in the Trondheim Fjord, near Trondheim, while traveling southwest, with the neighbor alerting the man to the situation. No injuries were reported among the 16 people on board, and the cause of the incident is under investigation by Norwegian police.

          <p>The US Mint is set to discontinue the production of pennies following a decree by President Donald Trump, who deemed the coin "so wasteful." The decision comes as the penny's production cost exceeds its value, costing nearly four cents to mint each coin. The US Treasury anticipates annual savings of $56 million in reduced material costs once the penny is phased out. While advocates cite the high production cost and limited utility, others highlight its usefulness in charity drives and cheaper production compared to the nickel coin.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reinstating in-person training at the National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg, Maryland, after initially pausing it in March due to funding concerns. FEMA reversed its decision after a review found that certain courses provide effective training. This move is a relief for Emmitsburg, where the academy is a vital part of the town's identity and economy. The administration also restored in-person training at other facilities, following criticism from Maryland's congressional delegation and firefighters.</p>
