          <p>The iconic Honey Deuce cocktail at the U.S. Open now costs $23, a price that has risen faster than the general rate of inflation since 2015. While the consumer price index has increased by about 36% in that period, the cost of the popular vodka-based drink has surged by 53%. If its price had matched inflation, the cocktail would cost around $20.33 today. Despite the high price, the event sold over 550,000 Honey Deuces last year, generating nearly $13 million in revenue.

          <p>American painter Alex Katz has created over 300 portraits of his wife, Ada, who has been his primary muse for more than five decades. An exhibition at New York's Jewish Museum showcases 40 of these portraits, highlighting Katz's unique brand of realism that focuses on style, appearance, and the play of light rather than emotional depth. Katz, who came of age during the abstract expressionism movement, initially faced criticism for his figurative work. He describes his detached style as a mirror, allowing viewers to see themselves in his depictions of Ada.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece explores the ethical dilemma of experiencing personal happiness while being aware of widespread global suffering, from humanitarian disasters to political turmoil. The author draws on philosophical and religious traditions that view humanity as a single interconnected body, suggesting it is moral to feel the pain of others. However, the article argues that this empathy should extend to sharing in others' joys as well, a concept known as "sympathetic joy" or mudita. To avoid both saccharine positivity and cynical despair, we should allow ourselves to experience the full spectrum of human emotion, recognizing that feeling good can be a form of resistance against forces that seek to create pain and confusion.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Lily King's upcoming novel, "Heart the Lover," introduces a narrator reflecting on a pivotal college relationship that she is now writing about. The passage recalls a seventeenth-century literature class where her humorous essay, written on bright orange paper, catches the attention of a smart, copper-haired classmate named Sam. This encounter blossoms into a connection as they begin walking together after class. The narrator describes her initial impression of Sam as a serious scholar, prompting her to research historical topics to keep up with their conversations, leading to him asking her out.</p>

          <h2>IRS Clarifies How Consumers Can Secure EV Tax Credit After September 30 Deadline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 07:00:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has clarified that consumers can still qualify for the up to $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit even if they take possession of the car after the September 30 deadline. According to new guidance, a "written binding contract" and a payment made on or before the deadline are sufficient to lock in eligibility for the credit. This provides a crucial loophole for buyers facing vehicle delivery delays, allowing them to order a vehicle and put down a deposit to secure the tax break. The clarification applies to new, used, and leased EVs, offering continued hope for prospective buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United is contemplating a last-minute move for Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez before the transfer deadline closes. The club has been actively seeking to resolve its goalkeeping situation and has also been in negotiations for Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens. However, the potential acquisition of Martinez, a World Cup winner with extensive Premier League experience, would offer a more seasoned option. The consideration comes after United's head coach, Ruben Amorim, acknowledged the immense pressure currently faced by the team's goalkeepers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A worldwide boom in the popularity of matcha has caused supply shortages and soaring prices, even in its home country of Japan. Driven by its reputation as a superfood and a post-pandemic tourism surge, demand for the powdered green tea has skyrocketed, with exports quadrupling over the past decade. The price for tencha, the tea leaves used to make matcha, jumped 170% at a recent auction. This has forced Japanese retailers to ration supplies and has put a strain on the nation's aging farming communities, prompting the government to consider subsidies to encourage more tencha production.

          <p>In a rare commercial contract with a North American company, the Chinese launch provider CAS Space has successfully deployed two tiny satellites for ThumbSat, a startup based in Tijuana, Mexico. The femtosatellites, each weighing less than 100 grams, were launched into orbit aboard a Kinetica-1 rocket. This mission marks Mexico's first commercial venture into low Earth orbit and is seen by CAS Space as a significant milestone for China's entry into the North American commercial launch market. The launch demonstrates growing international interest in China's rocket services, which are marketed as offering a good balance of cost and reliability.</p>

          <p>This commentary revisits a 1995 speech by author Toni Morrison, arguing that her genealogical approach to fascism, rooted in the history of American racism, provides a crucial lens for understanding current political threats. Morrison described fascism's rise not as a sudden jump but as a series of steps, including inventing an enemy and criminalizing them, a process she called racism's "succubus twin." The article suggests that the history of Black resistance—characterized by belief in democratic ideals, diverse methods of protest, and profound faith—offers a powerful model for combating authoritarianism today. It calls for a multifaceted resistance that can be found in courtrooms, classrooms, and even cultural expressions like Beyoncé's music.</p>

          <p>While the Democratic Party's public approval is at a 30-year low, with many voters finding its leaders "weak," there are emerging signs of optimism for its future. Strategists note that in an era of negative partisanship, dislike for the opposing party—and an increasingly unpopular President Trump—can be a powerful motivator for voters. Potential presidential candidates like Gavin Newsom and J.B. Pritzker are adopting more aggressive anti-Trump stances, and the party is focusing on "kitchen table" economic issues. Despite internal divisions on policy and cultural issues, some analysts believe the party has a deep bench of talent and is finding its footing to compete in upcoming congressional elections.</p>
