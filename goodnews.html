          <p>Global defense company stocks saw significant gains following a statement from U.S. President Donald Trump suggesting Ukraine could win back all its territory from Russia. This marks a notable change from his previous stance, where he hinted at Ukraine ceding land for peace. Trump's comments, posted on his Truth Social platform, referred to Russia as a "paper tiger" facing economic trouble, which encouraged investor confidence in European and Asian defense firms. The article notes this rhetorical shift is seen by industry experts as an encouraging sign for Europe, reaffirming the sector's warnings about continued Russian aggression.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has significantly altered his position on the war in Ukraine, stating that Kyiv can "win all of Ukraine back in its original form" with European and NATO support. This declaration, made on his Truth Social platform after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, contrasts sharply with his previous suggestions that Ukraine might need to concede territory for peace. Trump cited Russia's economic difficulties as a key factor, calling the nation a "paper tiger." The shift was welcomed by Zelenskyy, while NATO allies also reacted to Trump's separate call to shoot down Russian jets violating their airspace.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has voiced hopes for a more stable and healthy partnership with Canada during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in New York. The discussion, held on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, focused on urging Ottawa to adopt a "correct" perception of China to improve bilateral ties. Relations between the two nations have been strained, particularly after Canada imposed tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, steel, and aluminum last year. Beijing responded with its own tariffs on Canadian canola imports, and this meeting signals a potential desire to de-escalate the trade tensions.</p>

The data center, equipped with Oracle Cloud infrastructure and Nvidia chips, is part of a global boom in AI infrastructure investment. OpenAI's finance chief, Sarah Friar, stated the project is necessary to address the current "massive compute crunch," with plans for five additional sites across the U.S. The project, which also involves SoftBank and a new equity deal with Nvidia, aims to reshape the American power grid and bolster U.S. technological influence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jimmy Kimmel's return to television is being analyzed as a significant, albeit partial, victory for celebrity-led resistance against the Trump administration's pressure. While Disney reinstated his show after a suspension, nearly a quarter of ABC affiliates, owned by Sinclair and Nexstar, continue to boycott it. The article argues that the pushback against Kimmel's suspension was driven primarily by individual actors, comedians, and influencers rather than established institutions. This grassroots effort successfully pressured a major corporation, but the ongoing affiliate boycott demonstrates the limits of such resistance, raising questions about its replicability and long-term impact on free speech.</p>

          <p>The ambition to send humans to Mars faces a major hurdle: the significant health risks posed by long-duration spaceflight, including radiation exposure, muscle loss, and psychological stress. The field of space medicine is working to address these challenges, as current astronaut selection criteria exclude the vast majority of the population. Research, such as NASA's twin study, has revealed profound physiological changes that occur in microgravity, highlighting the need for new technologies like AI-guided diagnostics and personalized countermeasures. Advances in this field not only pave the way for interplanetary travel but also yield significant medical benefits on Earth, from remote health monitoring to accelerated disease research.</p>

          <p>A delivery driver in Sweetwater, Texas, helped police intervene in a possible hostage situation after reporting a suspicious order delivered to a local motel. The driver became alarmed by the contents of the delivery, which reportedly included zip ties, a hatchet, trash bags, and bleach. When officers investigated, they found an armed man, Neil Cooper, who had allegedly taken a hostage inside the room. The hostage was able to escape, and Cooper eventually surrendered to a crisis negotiator. The driver's alertness has been widely praised on social media for preventing a potentially violent crime.</p>

          <p>A surge in the construction of soccer-specific stadiums across the United States is providing a stable foundation for the sport's growth, particularly in lower-division and women's leagues. This trend, which began in Major League Soccer two decades ago, is now integral to the NWSL and the USL, which are planning for expansion and a promotion/relegation system. By owning or controlling their venues, clubs create a physical footprint and a sustainable business model that can withstand challenges like relegation. This real estate-focused strategy is seen as a key legacy of the upcoming World Cup, ensuring teams can remain viable within their communities.</p>

A high-speed police escort got him to the Medinah Golf Club with only minutes to spare, preventing a forfeit that would have doomed Europe's chances in what became a historic comeback victory.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has indicated that the league might begin renegotiating its massive media rights deals as early as 2026, four years before the current agreement's opt-out clause. The current 11-year, $111 billion deal with partners like Disney and Amazon could be revisited to capitalize on the ever-increasing value of live NFL content. An earlier renegotiation could add billions to the league's revenue, which would in turn boost team valuations and the player salary cap. Goodell noted the rapidly changing media landscape as a reason for wanting the flexibility to potentially strike a new, more lucrative deal sooner than planned. (not investment advice)</p>

Following the major fall film festivals, the movie holds a significant lead over other top contenders, including Chloé Zhao's "Hamnet" and Ryan Coogler's "Sinners." Critics suggest that Anderson, with 11 previous nominations and no wins, may finally have his moment with this new film. Meanwhile, "Hamnet," which won the People's Choice award at the Toronto International Film Festival, is also considered a major front-runner, setting the stage for an emotionally charged awards season.</p>

The regulator noted that under UK rules, alcohol ads must not be directed at people under 18, and those featured in them must be, or appear to be, over 25.

The APPG aims to address challenges faced by creators, such as access to funding and navigating regulations.

According to the 2025 International Exchange Centres Index, Beijing rose to sixth place globally, while Shanghai climbed to eighth, driven by a sharp increase in tourist arrivals and better transport links. The policy has made it easier for international visitors to enter the country, boosting the cities' roles as global hubs. In contrast, Hong Kong's ranking fell from fourth to seventh, partly because the assessment excluded tourist data from mainland China and was affected by global trade disruptions.</p>

          <p>New York City voters are considering a proposal to move municipal elections, including the mayoral race, from odd-numbered years to even-numbered years to coincide with federal and state contests. This is part of a national trend aimed at combating chronically low voter turnout in local elections. Proponents argue that consolidating elections increases participation, particularly among younger and minority voters, and reduces costs for election administration. While some local officials worry about their races being overshadowed, data from other cities that have made the switch shows a significant increase in the number of ballots cast in local races.</p>

For centuries, spices like cinnamon, pepper, and cloves were exotic and expensive, driving global exploration and the creation of vast trading empires like the Dutch East India Company. They were not just used for flavoring food but also as markers of wealth, religious symbols, and medicinal treatments in medieval Europe. The word "spicy" itself evolved from its literal meaning to describe anything provocative or interesting around the 19th century. This history provides a rich context for the spices we now enjoy.</p>
