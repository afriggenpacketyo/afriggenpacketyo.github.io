          <p>President Trump is considering reallocating $3 billion in grant money from Harvard University to trade schools across the United States.

          <p>Financial experts suggest several strategies to escape the payday loan debt cycle, including negotiating with lenders, seeking professional help from credit counseling agencies, and stopping the use of high-interest loans. Alternatives include personal loans from banks, reduced interest rates on credit cards, and assistance from family members. Building an emergency buffer through side gigs and exploring debt consolidation options are also recommended. A debt management plan (DMP) through a nonprofit counseling agency can consolidate debts and reduce interest rates, though it may temporarily lower credit scores. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's delay of 50 percent tariffs on the European Union, officials from both sides are set to begin new trade negotiations. The goal is to reach an agreement before July 9, when the tariffs are now scheduled to take effect. However, the United States and the European Union have differing priorities, with the U.S. seeking changes to Europe's consumption tax system and digital regulations, while the EU aims to reduce existing tariffs. The discussions will involve potential tariff reductions on industrial goods and retaliatory tariffs on American imports.</p>

          <p>King Charles III is visiting Canada, a move seen as underscoring Canada‚Äôs sovereignty in the face of past suggestions by U.S. President Donald Trump about annexation. Prime Minister Mark Carney invited Charles to give the speech from the throne, outlining the government's agenda. The King's presence highlights Canada's distinct identity and its enduring constitutional bond as a member of the British Commonwealth. The visit is also intended to reinforce the differences between Canada and the United States amid strained relations.</p>

          <h2>George Lucas Takes Over Museum of Narrative Art as Opening Nears</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-26 10:26:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art in Los Angeles approaches completion, George Lucas has stepped back into a leadership role, appointing himself head of "content direction" and naming Jim Gianopulos as interim CEO. This follows the departure of the museum's former director and layoffs within the education department. The museum, slated to open next year, aims to explore how narrative art influences societies, but its mission remains somewhat amorphous, leading to questions about its purpose and direction. The museum's core collection will feature items amassed by Lucas over the years, including illustrations, comic books, and Norman Rockwell paintings.</p>

          <p>The USS Growler, the only nuclear-missile submarine in the US open to the public, is a top attraction at the Intrepid Museum in New York City. Commissioned in 1958, the USS Growler patrolled the seas off the coast of Russia during the Cold War. Armed with nuclear missiles and operated by a crew of 90 men, Growler's firepower acted as a deterrent to keep other nations from using their nuclear weapons in a strategy known as mutually assured destruction. Visitors can climb inside and walk through its narrow confines on a self-guided tour.</p>
