          <p>The UK's environment secretary has committed to reducing the number of sewage discharges from water companies by 50% by the year 2030, responding to public anger over waterway pollution. This pledge follows new data showing a 60% increase in serious pollution incidents in 2024, reaching a record high. The government plans to hold the industry accountable but has ruled out nationalization, while a landmark review could see the regulator Ofwat overhauled. The plan is part of a £104 billion investment into the water sector, which will be funded in part by increased consumer bills.</p>

          <p>US Vice President JD Vance is reportedly planning a family vacation in the Cotswolds region of England, a destination known for its gentle hills and affluent tourism. The trip is expected to take place next month, following a visit to London, a city he previously claimed was “not English any more.” The choice of vacation spot contrasts with his "hillbilly" persona and comes after he criticized European governments, including the UK and Scotland, for what he termed suppressing free speech and failing on migration. His planned visit highlights a contrast between his political rhetoric and personal travel choices.</p>

          <p>President Trump commemorated the six-month anniversary of his second term, asserting that the United States has been "totally revived" after being "DEAD" under the previous administration. He highlighted key actions, including designating the Houthis as a terrorist organization, ordering military strikes on Iran, and brokering a ceasefire in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Domestically, he pointed to the passage of a bill making his 2017 tax cuts permanent and new legislation to regulate stablecoins. The president also dismissed concerns over his handling of the Epstein files, claiming his poll numbers remain strong.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a commentary piece, former Obama speechwriter David Litt suggests that in a politically polarized era, finding "neutral ground" is more crucial than searching for elusive "common ground." He recounts his experience bonding with his politically different brother-in-law over surfing, a shared activity that allowed them to connect as people despite their disagreements. Litt argues that focusing on shared activities rather than differences can foster friendships and lead to more genuine discussions on contentious issues. He advises people to be open to unlikely friendships and to find their own neutral spaces to bridge divides.</p>

          <h2>Child Development Expert Emphasizes Self-Connection as the Most Crucial Skill for Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 10:04:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, the single most important skill to teach a child for lifelong success is self-connection—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and needs. This skill builds emotional resilience, fosters healthy boundaries, and cultivates authentic confidence, acting as a buffer against anxiety and self-doubt. Raouda suggests that parents can foster this by validating their child's feelings rather than dismissing them, welcoming their full range of emotions, and modeling their own self-connection. Small shifts in parenting can make a significant difference.</p>

          <p>Sources suggest that the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea is the most likely venue for a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping this year. The meeting could potentially happen on the sidelines of the summit or during a visit by Trump to China beforehand. This follows recent diplomatic engagements between the two nations, including a meeting between their top diplomats and a phone call where the leaders exchanged invitations.

          <p>Communities along the historic Route 66, like Newberry Springs, California, are preparing for the road's 100th anniversary in 2026, hoping it will bring a resurgence of tourism and economic activity. Once a bustling artery, many small towns along the route declined after being bypassed by modern interstates in the 1970s. Now, local residents and business owners are organizing events, creating new attractions, and preserving historical sites to capitalize on the centennial celebration. They aim to re-establish their towns as key destinations for the thousands of travelers expected to drive the iconic "Mother Road."</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that traditional metrics for the U.S. labor market, such as the monthly jobs report, are becoming obsolete and fail to capture the modern work landscape. The author points to the rise of the "over-employed" holding multiple jobs, the growth of the gig economy, and the surge in new business applications as evidence that income, not jobs, is a more relevant measure of economic health. The piece suggests that relying on unreliable government surveys is insufficient and calls for a new system to provide a more accurate picture of how many Americans are earning a living wage.

          <p>Actress and cabaret star Bridget Everett discusses her journey from a small town in Kansas to creating the Peabody Award-winning HBO series "Somebody Somewhere." The semi-autobiographical show, set in her hometown of Manhattan, Kansas, explores themes of friendship, grief, and self-discovery in middle age. Everett, who served as a writer, producer, and lead actor, explains how her raw and risqué live performances, which often touch on personal loss, became the foundation for the show's authentic tone.

          <p>The concept of personality being fixed is being challenged by new scientific research, which suggests that people can intentionally change their characteristic ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving. Writer Olga Khazan documented her own year-long journey to become less neurotic and more extroverted, using techniques like improv classes to step outside her comfort zone. According to psychologists, by consciously adopting and maintaining new behaviors, individuals can shift their personality traits over time. This approach involves simple principles, such as "faking it 'til you make it," but requires difficult and consistent execution to achieve lasting change.</p>

          <p>Jaclyn Johnson, founder of the events company Create & Cultivate, says the biggest red flag in a job interview is a candidate who is unprepared and lacks knowledge about the company or the role.

Conversely, she is most impressed by candidates who can openly discuss their past mistakes and what they learned from them. Johnson also asks problem-solving questions to gauge how applicants handle pressure, as adaptability is a key trait for success in a fast-paced startup environment.</p>

The ship, found near the island of Nosy Boraha off Madagascar, was carrying a vast treasure of gold, diamonds, and other valuables from the Portuguese colonies in India. While thousands of artifacts have been recovered, the main treasure trove remains lost. La Buse was executed in 1721, supposedly throwing a cryptogram into the crowd beforehand, fueling a centuries-long, unsuccessful hunt for his legendary hidden fortune.</p>
