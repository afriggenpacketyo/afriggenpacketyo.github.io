        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OPEC+ countries agreed to keep their oil output quotas unchanged, with attention now focused on potential production increases from a subset of eight member nations that have been voluntarily cutting output. The entire OPEC+ group is currently reducing production by approximately 2 million barrels per day until the end of 2026. There is speculation that another production increase may occur in July, potentially as much as 411,000 barrels per day, which coincides with concerns about some members not adhering to their quotas. The group has called for an assessment of each country's sustainable production capacity to determine baselines for 2027.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rolled back Biden-era guidance that cautioned employers about including cryptocurrency and related digital assets in 401(k) plans. The 2022 guidance had urged "extreme care" due to concerns about fraud, theft, and loss. This shift is seen by some as an olive branch to the pro-crypto community, signaling that employers can add digital assets to retirement plans without consequence. However, some financial planners worry that this sends the wrong message, potentially exposing investors to significant risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Abercrombie & Fitch surged despite the retailer slashing its profit outlook due to expected tariffs, which are projected to cost the company $50 million. While the company lowered its full-year earnings per share and operating margin forecasts, its fiscal first-quarter results exceeded Wall Street's expectations. The company is working with vendors to offset costs and diversifying its sourcing network, reducing its reliance on China. Despite the challenges, Abercrombie slightly raised its full-year sales guidance, anticipating revenue growth between 3% and 6%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have increased for the third consecutive week, reaching their highest level since January; however, demand from homebuyers has remained resilient. Mortgage applications for home purchases climbed 2% compared to the previous week and were 18% higher than the same week last year, indicating that increased housing inventory is supporting transaction volume. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose to 6.98%, but refinance applications fell by 7%. Despite the rate increase, the underlying bond market improved, leading some mortgage lenders to revise rates slightly lower.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor is recalling approximately 1.1 million Ford and Lincoln vehicles due to a software issue that can cause the rearview camera image to malfunction. The glitch may present a false representation of the vehicle's surroundings, potentially increasing the risk of a crash. The recall affects several Ford and Lincoln models from 2021 to 2025, and owners will be notified by mail starting June 16. The fix involves updating the vehicle's accessory protocol interface module (APIM) software, which will be available for free at dealerships or via an over-the-air update.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced a new visa policy aimed at foreign officials responsible for censoring protected expression in the United States. The policy targets those who issue or threaten arrest warrants on U.S. citizens or residents for social media posts and those who demand that American tech platforms adopt global content moderation policies. Rubio stated that free speech is essential to the American way of life and foreign governments have no authority over it. The policy is likely to affect officials from countries with a history of targeting dual nationals for criticizing their governments on social media.</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's IPO is notable for having more shares sold by existing shareholders (60%) than the company itself (40%), a rare occurrence in tech IPOs. This is reminiscent of Facebook's 2012 IPO, where 57% of shares were sold by stakeholders. Circle, the company behind USDC, didn't provide a reason for this decision, but it's speculated that venture capital firms are seeking liquidity after a period of meager returns. Private investors are eager for exits to distribute back to their investors, reflecting a multiyear drought in IPOs.</p>

The film follows Craig's intense but short-lived friendship with his neighbor Austin, a jovial weatherman, and the bizarre lengths Craig goes to in order to repair their broken bond.
