        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thrive Global CEO Arianna Huffington is speaking out against the "collective delusion" that equates overwork and burnout with success, drawing from her own personal experience of collapsing from exhaustion in 2007. She argues that scientific evidence shows people are more effective, creative, and resilient when they prioritize time to recharge and take care of themselves. Huffington acknowledges that while the culture is slowly changing, many young professionals still fear being left behind if they don't constantly work. Through her company, she advocates for adopting "micro steps"—small, incremental changes in daily habits—to build a healthier and ultimately more successful life without sacrificing well-being.</p>

          <p>Hamas and other Palestinian factions are reportedly leaning toward accepting a U.S.-proposed plan to end the war in Gaza, with a formal response expected soon. The 20-point proposal, presented by President Trump, calls for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and an increased flow of humanitarian aid. Governance of Gaza would be transferred to an interim administration of Palestinian technocrats overseen by an international board chaired by Trump and including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. The plan has received swift support from several key Arab nations and positive reactions from European leaders, signaling a significant diplomatic push to resolve the conflict.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is set to deliver a pivotal speech at the Labour Party conference, framing the nation's future as a choice between his party's vision of "renewal" and the "decline and division" he attributes to Reform UK. Facing internal criticism and challenging opinion polls, Starmer will argue that while his path is difficult, it leads to a fairer country built on decency and respect. The speech aims to rally support beyond the party's base and solidify his leadership amid a difficult political and economic climate. It comes as his government prepares for a tough budget and potential losses in upcoming local elections.</p>

Bouanga, who was already a prolific scorer, has elevated his game, netting 10 goals since Son joined the team and becoming the club's all-time leading scorer.

          <h2>Former Tenants Organize Rent Debt Strike Against Major Corporate Landlord</h2>

          <p>A group of former tenants of Equity Residential, one of the nation's largest corporate landlords, is launching a first-of-its-kind rent debt strike to protest what they describe as predatory practices. Organized with the Debt Collective, the campaign aims to have tens of thousands of dollars in accumulated rent debt canceled, arguing that it creates insurmountable barriers to securing future housing. The strike draws inspiration from successful student debt campaigns, using a new online tool that helps tenants document landlord issues and generate formal dispute letters. This strategy seeks to challenge the economics of debt collection and transform isolated tenant struggles into a collective resistance movement against corporate landlords.</p>

          <p>The 1990s Irish boyband Boyzone has announced a one-off "final farewell" concert, set to take place at London's Emirates Stadium on June 6, 2026. Titled "One For The Road," the event will be the group's first and biggest stadium performance of their career. Singer Ronan Keating clarified that this is not a reunion or a tour with new music, but rather a final celebration for fans. The announcement follows a positive public reaction to their recent documentary and will be their first performance together since 2019. The band plans to play all their hits and acknowledged it will be emotional to perform without their late bandmate, Stephen Gately.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal for Gaza represents the most serious effort yet to end the war, calling for an immediate halt to fighting and the release of all hostages within 72 hours. In exchange, Israel would release a significant number of Palestinian prisoners. The plan outlines a transitional governing body for Gaza led by Palestinian technocrats and international experts, with the potential for the Palestinian Authority to eventually assume control after reforms. While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has framed it as a security win, Hamas faces intense pressure to accept the deal, which demands its decommissioning. However, significant hurdles remain, including opposition from Israel's far-right.</p>

          <p>A Chinese national, Zhimin Qian, has pleaded guilty in a UK court to illegally acquiring cryptocurrency connected to a massive fraud scheme in China. The case led to what is believed to be the world's largest single seizure of cryptocurrency, with London's Metropolitan Police recovering 61,000 bitcoin, currently valued at over £5 billion. Between 2014 and 2017, Qian orchestrated a scam that defrauded more than 128,000 investors in China before she fled the country and attempted to launder the stolen funds in the UK. The conviction is the result of a complex, seven-year international investigation into the global money laundering operation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has launched an experimental new model, DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp, designed to be significantly more efficient and cost-effective. The model introduces a feature called DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), which allows the AI to handle large amounts of information by focusing only on the most relevant data for a given task, cutting operational costs in half compared to its predecessor. This innovation could make powerful AI more accessible for smaller companies and researchers. However, questions remain about the reliability and safety of sparse attention architecture, as the process of excluding data could potentially remove important nuances and introduce biases.</p>
