          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has declared that his country will formally recognize a Palestinian state, a decision to be finalized at the United Nations General Assembly in September. This move aligns Australia with other Western nations like France, Britain, and Canada, which have signaled similar intentions amid growing international concern over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The recognition is contingent on commitments from the Palestinian Authority, including no governmental role for Hamas and the demilitarization of Gaza. Albanese emphasized that a two-state solution is essential for breaking the cycle of violence in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Shanghai is set to launch a comprehensive urban renewal campaign, focusing on redeveloping its 'urban villages' starting in 2026. This initiative is part of a broader three-year plan to enhance existing city infrastructure rather than pursuing large-scale expansion. The city also aims to renovate older, thin-walled housing by 2027 and continue upgrading old residential neighborhoods. This large-scale project is expected to stimulate both consumer spending and investment, reflecting China's national strategy of shifting focus towards improving the quality of urban living environments and infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Everton is reportedly in advanced talks to sign Manchester City winger Jack Grealish on a season-long loan. The 29-year-old England international, who joined City for a record £100m in 2021, has seen his playing time diminish, making only seven league starts last season. Grealish was an integral part of City's 2022-23 Treble-winning season but has since struggled for form and fitness, falling out of favor with manager Pep Guardiola. A move to Everton could provide an opportunity for the playmaker to reignite his career after a difficult period at the Manchester club.</p>

          <p>In an effort to attract more mountaineers to its less-developed regions, Nepal has announced it will waive climbing permit fees for 97 peaks for the next two years. The selected peaks are located in the remote Karnali and Far Western provinces, bordering China. This initiative aims to divert some attention from popular mountains like Everest and promote tourism in economically disadvantaged areas. The move comes as Nepal increases permit fees for its more famous peaks, highlighting a strategic effort to distribute tourism benefits more widely across the country and support local economies in remote Himalayan regions.</p>

          <p>The remains of Dennis 'Tink' Bell, a British meteorologist who died in Antarctica in 1959, have been discovered within a melting glacier. Bell, 25, fell into a crevasse while working for what is now the British Antarctic Survey. His bones, along with personal items like a watch and pipe, were found by a Polish research team on King George Island. The discovery has brought a sense of astonishment and closure to his surviving 86-year-old brother, David Bell, who had long given up hope of finding him. The find underscores the impact of climate change on glaciers.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Proposes Stricter Driving Laws, Including Mandatory Eye Tests for Over-70s</h2>

          <p>The government in England and Wales is considering a major overhaul of driving laws, which could include mandatory eye tests for drivers over 70 when they renew their licenses every three years. The proposed road safety strategy also aims to lower the drink-driving limit to match Scotland's stricter standard and introduce penalty points for passengers not wearing seatbelts. These changes follow a coroner's report that labeled the UK's current driver licensing system the 'laxest in Europe' after an inquest into deaths caused by drivers with poor eyesight. The goal is to reduce the nearly 1,600 annual road fatalities.</p>

          <h2>Explainer on Sunscreen Effectiveness, SPF, and Star Ratings</h2>

          <p>With high temperatures and UV levels expected in the UK, understanding sunscreen labels is crucial for skin protection. The Sun Protection Factor (SPF) indicates how much UVB radiation, which causes sunburn, is filtered out; SPF 30 is recommended, blocking about 97% of rays. The star rating, from one to five, measures protection against UVA radiation, which is associated with skin aging and cancer. For optimal protection, experts advise choosing a sunscreen with both a high SPF and a high star rating. It should be reapplied at least every two hours, as effectiveness diminishes with sweat and water exposure.</p>

The company, which Grant started with his wife in 1981, will now be run through an employee ownership trust, giving staff a share in future profits and a say in the company's direction. Grant stated the move was to preserve the family's legacy and the business's unique values, which include donating 10% of profits to charity and not opening on Sundays. This transition ensures the company's ethos continues without being sold to a firm with different values.</p>

          <p>A small, fiery object that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been identified by scientists as a 4.56-billion-year-old meteorite, making it slightly older than Earth itself. A University of Georgia geologist confirmed its origin after examining fragments of the space rock. The meteorite is believed to have come from the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. This event is the 27th recorded meteorite recovery in Georgia's history and one of only six where the fall was witnessed, highlighting how modern technology helps in tracking and recovering such objects.</p>

          <p>Zach Cregger's new horror film, 'Weapons,' topped the domestic box office on its debut weekend, earning an impressive $42.5 million. The movie's success marks another number-one opening for distributor Warner Bros. Pictures. In second place was Disney's sequel 'Freakier Friday,' starring Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis, which brought in $29 million. Analysts attribute the strong performance of both films to effective viral marketing and positive word-of-mouth on social media. The previous box office leader, 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps,' fell to third place in its third week of release.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's company, Tesla, has formally applied for a license to supply electricity to households and businesses in the United Kingdom. The application was submitted to the British energy regulator Ofgem by Tesla Energy Ventures. If approved, this move would allow Tesla to compete with established UK energy firms, potentially starting next year, by leveraging its expertise in solar generation and battery storage. This push into the UK energy market comes as Tesla faces a significant sales slump for its electric vehicles in both the UK and Germany.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists are actively investigating the mystery of how life began on Earth, with two leading water-based hypotheses at the forefront of research. One theory suggests life originated in deep-sea hydrothermal vents, while another points to shallow tide pools as the cradle of life. The central role of water in these theories is guiding the search for extraterrestrial life, focusing exploration on 'water worlds' within our solar system. Moons of Jupiter and Saturn, which are believed to harbor vast subsurface oceans, are considered prime candidates for potentially hosting life, making them key targets for future scientific missions.</p>
