        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newcastle United has finalized a club-record signing of German international striker Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart for a fee of up to £69 million. The 23-year-old, who stands at 6ft 6in, has signed a long-term contract, surpassing the previous record set by Alexander Isak's transfer. While he was not registered in time for the upcoming match against Leeds United, the club sees him as a crucial addition, especially amid speculation about Isak's potential departure. Both Woltemade and head coach Eddie Howe expressed enthusiasm about the signing, highlighting his technical skill and potential for further development at the club.</p>

The collaboration also extends to anti-piracy efforts in the Gulf of Aden, aligning with China's strategic and economic interests in the region.

          <p>A team of climate communication experts, including many former members of the official climate.gov team, is working to resurrect the content of the widely used climate information portal. The effort comes after the Trump administration effectively shut down the original website and fired its production staff. The new initiative, climate.us, aims to not only restore public access to accessible climate science but also to expand its mission by offering direct climate-related services to local governments. Led by the former managing editor, the team is building a non-profit organization and seeking funding to ensure this critical scientific information remains available to the public.</p>

          <p>The Ndlovu Youth Choir from South Africa has released a Zulu-language cover of Queen's iconic song "Bohemian Rhapsody," marking the first time the band has ever authorized a translation of the anthem. The project received the blessing of Queen's surviving members and the Mercury Phoenix Trust, coinciding with the song's 50th anniversary and honoring Freddie Mercury's Zanzibari birth. The choir's artistic director and members undertook a meticulous, multi-year translation process to preserve the original's meaning while infusing it with African musical traditions. The new version celebrates a unique cultural interpretation of one of rock music's most celebrated works.</p>

These departures will further bolster Chelsea's finances, which have seen the club raise approximately £309 million from player sales this summer.

          <p>German football legend Thomas Müller is settling into his new role with the Vancouver Whitecaps in Major League Soccer, emphasizing his commitment to his new Canadian team and city. After a celebrated career with Bayern Munich, Müller is adjusting to the different sporting culture of North America, where playoffs hold greater importance than the regular season. He has made an immediate impact on the pitch, scoring a game-winning penalty in his first start. Off the field, Müller is focused on integrating into the community, learning about the club's history, and humorously navigating the translation of his jokes into "Canadian-English."</p>

          <p>Three brothers from Edinburgh, Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan MacLean, have set a new world record for the fastest non-stop, unsupported row across the Pacific Ocean, completing the 9,000-mile journey in just under 140 days. The trio rowed from Peru to Australia, overcoming severe tropical storms, equipment failures, and a harrowing moment when one brother was swept overboard. Their journey, which beat the previous record by over 20 days, has also raised more than £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar. After their arduous voyage, the brothers expressed their relief and looked forward to simple comforts like pizza and a proper bed.</p>

          <p>Preliminary data from the CDC shows a significant and sustained decrease in fatal drug overdoses in the U.S., reaching a five-year low in the 12-month period ending in March 2025. Despite this positive trend, President Donald Trump has continued to frame the fentanyl crisis as a growing threat to justify policies such as mandatory minimum sentences and trade tariffs. Critics argue that the administration's focus on punitive measures is misguided and that the progress in reducing deaths could be jeopardized by Republican cuts to health and addiction program funding. Experts attribute the decline to successful supply chain disruptions and improved healthcare for addiction.</p>

          <p>Several European countries are reconsidering or reinforcing military conscription in response to a changing geopolitical climate, particularly following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Germany, which ended conscription in 2011, is introducing a new model of voluntary service with the potential for mandatory drafts if needed. Meanwhile, nations like Sweden have already reinstated conscription, and others such as Poland and France are expanding their reserve forces. Countries like Finland, which never abolished the draft, maintain a high rate of military service, reflecting a deeply embedded culture of national defense that is now being re-examined across the continent.</p>

          <p>A global movement to enhance online child safety, exemplified by new legislation like the U.K.'s Online Safety Act, is driving the development of AI-powered safety technologies. These regulations compel tech companies to protect minors from harmful content, leading to the adoption of age-verification systems by platforms like Pornhub, Spotify, and X. Companies such as Yoti are providing AI-based age estimation technology, while phone maker HMD Global has launched a smartphone with built-in AI to block inappropriate content. This trend marks a significant shift, forcing tech giants to prioritize child safety, though it also raises privacy concerns among critics.</p>

          <p>After a difficult contract dispute with the Dallas Cowboys, superstar pass rusher Micah Parsons has been traded to the Green Bay Packers, where he has become the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Parsons described the last four months of negotiations as the hardest of his life but is now focused on creating a new legacy with the historic franchise. In exchange for Parsons, the Packers sent two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark to Dallas.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary block on the Trump administration's plan to expand the use of expedited removal for undocumented migrants detained within the interior of the U.S. The policy aimed to quickly deport certain migrants who have been in the country for less than two years without a court hearing. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb's ruling suggests that this expansion tramples on individuals' due process rights under the Fifth Amendment. The decision is a setback for the administration's aggressive deportation agenda but does not question the use of expedited removal at the border.</p>
