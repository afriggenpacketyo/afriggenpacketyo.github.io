          <p>President Donald Trump suggested he might reduce tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 80% as trade officials from both countries prepare to meet in Switzerland. Trump stated that the decision was "up to" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is scheduled to meet with China's Vice-Premier He Lifeng. The article indicates a potential shift in the U.S. trade strategy towards China, although the details and implications of this adjustment remain unclear.

          <p>Ofcom has launched investigations into two pornographic websites suspected of violating the UK's new child safety regulations. The regulator alleges that the sites, including one featuring "nudifying" technology, failed to provide details on how they prevent children from accessing their platforms. Under the Online Safety Act, websites with pornographic material must implement robust age-checking techniques. Firms found in violation of the Act could face significant fines, while some services have opted to block UK users entirely to comply with the rules.</p>

It highlights how the S&P 500's performance since the election has demonstrated the risks of making sweeping portfolio moves based on short-term news. The author emphasizes that the key takeaway is that timing the market requires being right twice, both when selling high and buying low, a feat that is nearly impossible to achieve consistently.</p>
