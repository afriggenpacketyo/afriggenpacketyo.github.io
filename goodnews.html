          <p>Germany and Nigeria have committed to enhancing their partnership across various sectors, including the economy, energy, and migration. German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul emphasized Nigeria's importance as a key partner in Africa, highlighting opportunities for expanding economic cooperation, particularly in rare earths. Discussions also addressed managing migration flows to Europe, with both countries agreeing to collaborate closely on addressing this issue. Nigeria seeks to export talent rather than people, focusing on job creation and structured solutions to irregular migration through partnerships with countries like Germany, and the article highlights that Nigeria is Germany's second-largest trading partner in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
