          <p>Sumo wrestler Onosato, newly promoted to the sport's highest rank of yokozuna, has declared his ambition to win the upcoming Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament. If successful, he would join a very small group of wrestlers who have won their debut tournament as a grand champion. The 25-year-old is the first Japanese-born yokozuna since 2017 and carries the hopes of his hometown, which was affected by the Noto Peninsula earthquake.

          <p>Several veteran golfers, including Ryder Cup legend Ian Poulter and former U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell, are competing in final qualifying for a chance to play at The Open at Royal Portrush. Due to their affiliation with the LIV tour, these players must go through the rigorous 36-hole qualifying events to secure one of the few remaining spots. The qualifying adds a layer of drama, with Poulter competing in the same event as his son, Luke, for a spot in golf's oldest major.

          <p>Japan's antitrust regulator is preparing to fine Harley-Davidson's Japanese subsidiary approximately 200 million yen ($1.4 million) for violating antimonopoly laws. The Japan Fair Trade Commission found that the company imposed excessive sales quotas on its dealers. It also pressured them by implying their sales contracts might not be renewed if they failed to meet the targets. This pressure reportedly led some dealers to purchase unsold motorcycles themselves to meet the quotas, an anti-competitive practice the commission is now moving to halt. (not investment advice)</p>

In a television interview, Trump suggested that the deal would likely require approval from Beijing, but expressed confidence that Chinese President Xi Jinping would agree to it. This development comes as the deadline for TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations approaches, following the passage of a law aimed at addressing national security concerns.

The team's final warm-up match, a dominant 7-0 victory over Jamaica, provided strong hints about her selections, with players like Jess Carter and Ella Toone making compelling cases for inclusion. Despite the recent retirement of key veterans and fitness concerns for others, the squad retains a strong core from its World Cup run.

          <p>China has conditionally resumed imports of Japanese seafood from certain regions, partially lifting a blanket ban that was imposed in 2023. The prohibition was enacted in response to Japan's release of treated wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant. The new measure allows for the import of aquatic products from most of Japan but maintains the ban on those originating from ten prefectures, including Fukushima. The move is seen as a potential step toward resetting diplomatic and trade relations, which were strained by the wastewater issue.</p>

          <p>A trade deal between the United Kingdom and the United States took effect Monday, reducing tariffs on British cars and prompting a surge in shipments from brands like Aston Martin and JLR. The 25% tariff imposed by the Trump administration has been lowered to 10% for a quota of 100,000 cars annually. However, the deal has drawn criticism from British farmers, who argue that agricultural concessions, such as tariff-free quotas for US beef, were used as a bargaining chip to secure the automotive benefits. The National Farmers' Union has urged the government to stop sacrificing agriculture in trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers are now studying. Studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration patterns of EVs, particularly the low-frequency deceleration caused by regenerative braking systems, are more likely to induce queasiness than conventional cars. Regenerative braking captures kinetic energy to recharge the battery when the vehicle slows down. Researchers are investigating this link to improve passenger comfort and address a potential barrier to the broader adoption of EV technology.</p>
