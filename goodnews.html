          <h2>Gallup Poll Finds American Alcohol Consumption at a Record Low</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has dropped to 54%, a record low not seen since 1958. This decline coincides with a growing belief, especially among young people, that even moderate drinking is harmful to one's health. Researchers suggest that increased public knowledge about alcohol's risks, such as cancer and depression, is a primary driver of this trend. The shift is also supported by the rising popularity of non-alcoholic alternatives and social trends like 'Dry January,' indicating a potential long-term change in societal drinking habits.</p>

          <p>The NBA's board of governors has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to an ownership group led by private equity co-founder Bill Chisholm. The deal values the franchise at a reported $6.1 billion, making it the second-largest sale price for a US sports team. Chisholm, a Massachusetts native, will acquire a controlling stake of at least 51%, with plans to buy out minority shareholders by 2028 at a higher valuation. The outgoing owner, Wyc Grousbeck, is expected to remain as CEO during the transition period.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study from Virginia Tech has demonstrated for the first time that ordinary pet dogs can be effectively trained to locate the egg masses of the invasive spotted lanternfly. This destructive pest threatens agriculture, and finding its well-camouflaged egg masses is crucial to controlling its spread. In the study, volunteer dog-and-handler teams showed high accuracy rates in sniffing out the eggs in both indoor and outdoor settings. This research suggests a promising and accessible new method for communities to engage in citizen science and help manage a significant environmental problem.</p>

          <p>Viral photos of rabbits in Colorado with black, horn-like growths have been explained by state wildlife officials as a known medical condition. The animals are suffering from Shope Papilloma Virus, which causes keratinous tumors to grow on their faces and bodies. The virus is spread by fleas and ticks and is not transmissible to humans, dogs, or cats. While the growths look alarming, they are typically harmless to the rabbits unless they interfere with eating or vision, and the phenomenon is believed to have inspired the myth of the 'jackalope.'</p>

One firefighter was treated for apparent heat exhaustion while battling the fire in the summer heat, but the situation was quickly brought under control, with crews remaining to handle any remaining hotspots.</p>

          <p>Juneau, Alaska, experienced record-breaking flooding after an 'outburst flood' from a basin dammed by the Mendenhall Glacier, but a potential catastrophe was largely averted. Water levels in the Mendenhall River surpassed the previous record, threatening nearly 1,000 structures. However, newly installed temporary 'Hesco' barriers held, resulting in minimal flooding and damage to property. The annual event, a consequence of a retreating glacier due to climate change, has prompted officials to seek a more permanent solution to protect the capital city.</p>

          <p>A new survey by travel tech company TravelPerk found that over half of all business travelers have had loved ones join them on work-related trips. This trend, often called 'bleisure,' allows professionals to blend business with personal vacation time, reclaim family time, and save money on travel. The practice is even more common among C-suite executives, with 73% reporting they have brought partners, children, or friends along. While many companies quietly accept this, employees often navigate a policy 'grey zone' regarding expenses and transparency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large study published in the British Medical Journal suggests that drug treatment for ADHD provides significant benefits beyond managing core symptoms. Based on data from over 148,000 people in Sweden, researchers found that taking ADHD medication was associated with notable reductions in the risk of substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminal behavior. These findings provide strong evidence that medication, by helping to reduce impulsivity and inattention, can have a positive, long-term impact on major life outcomes for individuals with the disorder.</p>
