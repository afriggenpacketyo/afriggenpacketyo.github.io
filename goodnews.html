          <p>Stocks of several nuclear energy companies, including NuScale, Oklo, and Nano Nuclear, experienced significant gains after the U.S. Army announced a new program to deploy small nuclear reactors. The "Janus Program," launched in partnership with the Defense Innovation Unit, aims to use commercially owned and operated microreactors to help developers scale their businesses. This initiative is a direct response to President Trump's executive orders aimed at accelerating the deployment of advanced reactors for domestic military installations. The market rally occurred despite the fact that most of these companies have yet to deploy a reactor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard announced the seizure of more than 100,000 pounds of cocaine in the Eastern Pacific Ocean over the past two months as part of Operation Pacific Viper. The operation, which involves international partners, has led to the interception of 34 vessels and the arrest of 86 individuals. The agency has been accelerating its counter-drug efforts by deploying additional ships and aircraft to disrupt narcotics trafficking from Central and South America. Officials described the massive seizures as a remarkable achievement in dismantling narco-terrorist networks.</p>

          <p>Pakistan and Afghanistan's Taliban government have agreed to a 48-hour ceasefire following days of intense fighting along their shared border that resulted in dozens of casualties on both sides. Both governments issued conflicting statements about which party initiated the request for the truce, highlighting the deep mistrust between them. The violence escalated after Pakistan accused the Taliban of harboring militants responsible for attacks within its territory, a charge Kabul consistently denies. The recent clashes involved heavy weaponry, displacing families and closing key border crossings, further destabilizing the volatile region.</p>

The battery-free sensors will track approximately 90 million pallets of inventory nationwide, providing real-time data on location, temperature, and humidity. This continuous stream of information will feed into Walmart's advanced AI systems to enhance inventory management, improve replenishment decisions, and increase overall supply chain efficiency. The rollout is expected to cover all U.S. stores and distribution centers by 2026.</p>

          <p>Ireland's head coach Andy Farrell has named captain Caelan Doris in the squad for the upcoming autumn internationals, despite his recent recovery from shoulder surgery. However, key lock Joe McCarthy has been excluded as he has not recovered from a foot injury sustained during the British and Irish Lions tour. The 34-man squad includes only one uncapped player, prop Paddy McCarthy, as Ireland prepares for matches against New Zealand, Japan, Australia, and South Africa. Several other players, including Hugo Keenan, were also ruled out due to injuries, creating opportunities for others.</p>

          <p>China's national broadcaster, CCTV, has aired a confession from Wei Huairen, the alleged head of a major crime family operating in northern Myanmar's Kokang region. Wei was captured and handed over to Chinese law enforcement in January as part of a crackdown on cross-border criminal syndicates. According to Chinese police, the Wei family's criminal activities, which included commanding a local army unit, were "state-authorized" under a 2009 deal between Myanmar authorities and ethnic Chinese militias. This broadcast is part of Beijing's broader effort to dismantle crime networks along its southern border.</p>

          <p>An unseasonably early atmospheric river storm has brought significant rainfall to Southern California, potentially pushing back the peak of the region's dangerous wildfire season. October is typically the most hazardous month due to dry conditions and powerful Santa Ana winds, but the recent storm has drenched the landscape, making vegetation less flammable. Experts believe this moisture could delay the fire season by weeks or even months, providing temporary relief after a year of intense drought and major fires. However, they caution that the risk could quickly return if the rest of the fall remains dry.</p>
