        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>SpaceX has once again postponed the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket, first due to an oxygen leak and then because of an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad. This milestone mission is crucial for demonstrating fixes and upgrades following three catastrophic failures earlier this year, aiming to enable a faster launch cadence. A successful flight would advance the development of autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers, a key requirement for NASA's planned moon landing as early as 2027 and eventual Mars missions. While some NASA officials express optimism, other experts remain skeptical about the ambitious timeline, citing the system's inherent complexity and the unprecedented nature of large-scale cryogenic propellant transfer in orbit.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand is currently traversing the central Atlantic Ocean and is projected to continue weakening, posing no direct threat to land. The National Hurricane Center reported Fernand approximately 550 miles east-northeast of Bermuda, with sustained winds of 50 mph and moving northeast. Forecasters expect the storm to transition into a post-tropical cyclone before fully dissipating by Wednesday. Fernand is the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, occurring after Hurricane Erin, which reached Category 5 intensity but also stayed over open waters. The NOAA had previously predicted an above-normal season, with 13 to 18 named storms anticipated.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung skillfully navigated a high-stakes meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, employing a charm offensive to diffuse potential tensions. Despite Trump's pre-meeting social media post hinting at a "Purge or Revolution" in South Korea, Lee lauded Trump's relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, suggesting he could be a "peacemaker." While the meeting successfully averted a diplomatic dressing-down, it concluded without concrete agreements on contentious issues like trade tariffs or the cost-sharing for U.S. troops stationed in South Korea. Trump reiterated his desire to meet Kim Jong Un again, and also floated the idea of the U.S. owning the land for Osan Air Base.</p>

          <p>Chinese surgeons have reported a successful pig-to-human lung transplant, indicating a significant step forward in xenotransplantation research. The genetically modified pig lung, implanted into a brain-dead human recipient, remained viable and functional for 216 hours without signs of hyperacute rejection or uncontrolled infection. This breakthrough, conducted by scientists at the National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease in Guangzhou, highlights advancements in genetic modifications and immunosuppressive strategies. While promising for alleviating the global organ shortage, especially for organs like lungs that face distinct anatomical and physiological complexities and higher infection risks, researchers emphasize that substantial further testing and challenges must be addressed for clinical application.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Singapore have significantly advanced the production of remote-controlled cyborg cockroaches, envisioning their future deployment in disaster search and rescue missions. A recent publication in Nature Communications detailed the team's progress in their "insect robot factory" concept, specifically enhancing the robotic cockroach's turning capability from 70 to over 80 degrees with verified precision. This breakthrough is expected to reduce mass production time and cost, making practical applications more feasible. Experts laud the meaningful work on these insect-computer hybrid robots, recognizing their potential to provide crucial assistance in navigating challenging disaster environments, thereby saving lives and improving recovery efforts.</p>

          <p>A Utah district court judge has ordered the state legislature to promptly redraw its congressional boundaries for the 2026 elections, ruling that the current map violates voters' rights. Judge Dianna Gibson found that the Republican-controlled legislature bypassed a voter-approved independent commission when creating the 2021 map, which controversially split the Democratic stronghold of Salt Lake County among all four congressional districts, leading to wide Republican victories. This decision introduces uncertainty for the GOP's efforts to defend its narrow U.S. House majority. However, Republican lawmakers have indicated they will appeal the ruling, potentially delaying the implementation of new maps until the 2028 election cycle.</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Browns executed a surprising trade, sending quarterback Kenny Pickett to the Las Vegas Raiders in exchange for a 2026 fifth-round NFL Draft pick. This move addresses the Raiders' immediate need for a backup quarterback after Aidan O’Connell sustained a wrist injury, sidelining him for 6-8 weeks. Pickett, a fourth-year player with 25 NFL starts from his time with the Pittsburgh Steelers and Philadelphia Eagles, will now back up Geno Smith. His departure from Cleveland, where he was competing with rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders behind starter Joe Flacco, was influenced by a hamstring injury that limited his preseason participation, leaving the Browns' backup role still undecided.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has clarified restrictions on cordless hairstyling tools, mandating that those powered by lithium-ion batteries or gas/butane fuel are only permitted in carry-on luggage. This rule stems from the combustible nature of these power sources, which pose a fire risk if they overheat in the cargo hold where they cannot be easily addressed. Plug-in tools remain unrestricted for both carry-on and checked bags. As an added safety measure, cordless tools must have a securely fitted safety cover over their heating element. This policy aims to prevent incidents like the 644 verified lithium battery-related events reported by the FAA since 2006.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to restore over $6.8 billion in education funding, reversing an earlier decision to withhold the congressionally-allocated money after a multi-state lawsuit. The funds, intended for programs like after-school care, teacher training, and English-learner support, were frozen weeks before the school year, causing widespread uncertainty. California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who led the lawsuit with 22 other states, accused the administration of illegally impounding funds. While a White House spokesperson had previously cited concerns about "misused" funds for a "radical left-wing agenda," the agreement ensures critical programs, many benefiting low-income families, will now receive their allocated resources.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Fire Department crews have successfully contained a brush fire that burned approximately nine acres in Sherman Oaks, near Haskell Creek, with no injuries reported.

Officials are cautioning motorists about potential traffic delays on the 405 Freeway, which is already experiencing overnight closures due to an ongoing 10.2-mile repavement project.

New World Screwworm myiasis is a parasitic condition caused by fly larvae that feed on living tissue, commonly found in South America and the Caribbean, and currently lacks a specific medication for treatment. Authorities are enhancing monitoring efforts, especially along the southern Texas border, and are planning a new insect dispersal facility to prevent further spread.</p>

          <p>Conventional wisdom about maintaining a perfectly straight posture is being challenged, with experts like Dr. Xand van Tulleken suggesting it might do more harm than good. Instead, three key rules are proposed for better back health: prioritize movement, build strength, and address mindset. The article emphasizes that posture is dynamic, not static, advocating for regular breaks and shifts in position rather than rigid adherence to one stance. It also highlights that strong core and back muscles, achievable through simple exercises like pilates or yoga, are crucial. Finally, it notes that stress and emotional factors significantly influence posture and pain, suggesting a holistic approach to well-being.</p>
