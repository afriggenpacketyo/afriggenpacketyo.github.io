        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Director of National Intelligence has announced that the UK has withdrawn its controversial demand for a 'back door' into global Apple users' encrypted data. This controversial instruction, which Apple had resisted by withdrawing its Advanced Data Protection from the UK market and initiating legal action, was widely seen as a significant threat to civil liberties. While privacy campaigners cautiously welcome this development, they remain deeply concerned that the power to compel such access still exists within the UK's Investigatory Powers Act. The BBC understands Apple has not yet received formal communication on the matter, adding to the ongoing uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Canada's Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, is projected to win a crucial by-election in Alberta, securing his return to the House of Commons after losing his Ottawa-area seat in the last general election. Leading with over 80% of the vote in the rural riding of Battle River-Crowfoot, this victory in a Conservative stronghold allows the 46-year-old to re-enter Parliament for the autumn sitting. Poilievre's win comes despite facing a record 214 candidates, many from a protest group seeking electoral reform. He now faces a mandatory leadership review in January.</p>

          <p>The revamped US Open mixed doubles event, featuring superstar players like Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu and offering lucrative prize money, is generating significant debate within the tennis community. While proponents believe it will attract more viewers and promote the sport, critics argue it devalues a Grand Slam title, functions as a "glorified exhibition," and disadvantages doubles specialists who miss out on prize money. Concerns also persist regarding the lack of consultation with players and the challenging scheduling for top singles stars, despite the excitement for fans.</p>

          <p>Helsinki, Finland, achieved the remarkable feat of zero traffic fatalities in the last year, a significant accomplishment for a city of nearly 690,000 people. This success is attributed to a combination of smart planning and proactive measures, primarily the reduction of speed limits to 30 kmph on over half of its streets and increased public transport use. The city's "Vision Zero" program aims to maintain this safety record by 2050 through continuous infrastructure improvements and data-driven planning, serving as a global model for urban traffic safety.</p>
