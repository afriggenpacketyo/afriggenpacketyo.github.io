          <p>U.S. Steel shares were delisted from the New York Stock Exchange after Japan's Nippon Steel completed its acquisition.  President Trump's earlier opposition to the deal shifted after he took office, leading to confusion regarding the final structure.  The delisting is effective June 30.  Despite the takeover, U.S. Steel will continue to operate under its current name.</p>
