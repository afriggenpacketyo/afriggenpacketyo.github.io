          <p>Hall of Fame jockey Ron Turcotte, celebrated for his legendary ride aboard Secretariat to the 1973 Triple Crown, has passed away peacefully at the age of 84 from natural causes. Turcotte's illustrious career included multiple victories in the Kentucky Derby, Preakness, and Belmont Stakes, with Secretariat's astounding 31-length win in the Belmont Stakes still holding a record 52 years later. Despite a career-ending injury in 1978 that left him paraplegic, he remained an enduring inspiration and a dedicated advocate for fellow fallen riders. His family and peers universally remember him as a great horseman, a humble individual, and a true Canadian icon whose profound impact on horse racing is immeasurable.</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Serena Williams has openly discussed her use of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, stating her intention to help lift the societal stigma associated with such medications. After struggling with post-pregnancy weight despite intense training, Williams, who now serves as a spokesperson for a company selling these drugs, successfully lost 31 pounds over eight months. While her transparency is hailed by some as a "breakthrough" for challenging stereotypes about weight loss and laziness, critics question the timing due to her endorsement deal. This public disclosure highlights the complex societal pressures surrounding body image and the evolving public perception of medical weight-loss interventions.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's autonomous vehicle subsidiary, Waymo, has been granted its first permit by the New York Department of Transportation to commence testing in New York City, a significant milestone announced by Mayor Eric Adams. This marks the city's inaugural autonomous vehicle testing launch, with Waymo planning to deploy up to eight vehicles in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn through late September. Under current state law, a safety driver will be required behind the wheel during operations. This expansion follows Waymo's increased operations nationwide and signifies a crucial step for integrating self-driving technology into the complex and dynamic urban environment of New York City, potentially reshaping future transportation.</p>

The Hypernova glasses, expected to cost around $800 and sold with EssilorLuxottica, will feature a small color display for basic information like text messages. The wristband, using CTRL Labs technology, will interpret electrical signals from hand movements for control, serving as a key input for future full AR glasses. While Meta is setting low sales expectations due to the device's weight and thickness, this marks a significant step in its augmented reality hardware push.</p>

          <p>Netflix's animated hit "KPop Demon Hunters" is projected to dominate the weekend box office with unprecedented sing-along screenings across more than 1,750 theaters in the U.S. and Canada, an unusual move for the streaming giant. Despite industry estimates suggesting the film could haul in $16 million to $22 million, potentially outperforming other films, Netflix maintains its long-standing policy of not releasing box office figures, frustrating industry professionals. This limited theatrical release is primarily viewed as a strategic marketing effort to capitalize on the film's viral streaming success and popular soundtrack, highlighting the complex and evolving relationship between streaming services and traditional cinemas. Theater owners, however, welcome the unexpected boost during a typically slow summer period.</p>

          <h2>Ether Nears Record High as Powell's Dovish Remarks Hint at Potential Rate Cuts</h2>

          <p>Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, surged nearly 14% to $4,817.61, approaching its 2021 all-time high, following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech hinting at upcoming interest rate cuts. Powell's remarks from Jackson Hole suggested that "the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance," surprising traders who had positioned for risk-off moves. This dovish outlook led to significant short liquidations in the ETH market, further fueling the price rally as traders scrambled to cover positions. Shares of companies focused on accumulating ether also saw a bounce, reflecting renewed investor confidence and a shift back into risk-on assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Welsh Fire secured a comprehensive eight-wicket victory over Birmingham Phoenix in The Hundred men's competition, crucially keeping their fading hopes of reaching the knockout stages alive. After effectively restricting Phoenix to 138-9, Fire efficiently chased the target with 11 balls to spare, propelled by strong batting performances from opener Stephen Eskinazi (42), Jonny Bairstow (35 off 21 balls), and an unbeaten 47 off 36 from Steve Smith. Despite this vital win, both teams remain on eight points, eight back of Northern Superchargers in third, meaning qualification for the eliminator remains unlikely unless other results dramatically favor them. The win, however, provides a much-needed boost for team morale.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Intel will grant the U.S. government a 10% non-voting equity stake, a highly unusual deal facilitated by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. This unprecedented move converts CHIPS Act grants into equity, marking a significant shift in U.S. industrial policy aimed at boosting domestic chip manufacturing. Intel, which has faced recent challenges and delayed its Ohio factory plans, now enters this "historic agreement." The arrangement aims to support Intel's efforts to regain leadership in advanced chip production, although questions remain among analysts about future demand for the chips and the long-term impact on the company's operational independence.

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada will lift some of its billions of dollars in retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, effective September 1st, to match U.S. tariffs on goods compliant with the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement (USMCA). This move, welcomed by the White House, aims to restore free trade for the vast majority of goods, though Canada will maintain 25% levies on American autos, steel, and aluminum. The decision follows a phone call between Carney and President Trump, reflecting ongoing efforts to navigate complex trade relations. Critics, however, view this as a "capitulation" by Canada, despite the country maintaining a better overall tariff deal than many others. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated potential interest rate cuts in his Jackson Hole speech, citing "sweeping changes" in policy and a shifting balance of risks. While acknowledging a resilient labor market, he noted rising downside dangers and inflation risks from tariffs. Powell stated that current conditions, with policy in "restrictive territory," allow the Fed to "proceed carefully" in adjusting its stance, hinting at a possible September rate cut. This dovish signal sent stocks soaring and Treasury yields tumbling, despite President Trump's demands for more aggressive cuts and Powell's reaffirmation of Fed independence.
