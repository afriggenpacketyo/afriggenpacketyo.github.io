        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom and India are preparing to sign a landmark free trade agreement aimed at substantially reducing tariffs and enhancing market access between the two countries. Under the terms of the deal, India will lower import duties on key British goods, including cars and spirits like whisky, while the UK will facilitate greater imports of Indian products such as textiles and gemstones. This agreement, championed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer as a major economic boon for Britain, is projected to boost the UK economy by £4.8 billion annually and create thousands of jobs. However, the pact must first be ratified by the UK parliament before its provisions can be fully implemented.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's pharmaceutical sector is experiencing a significant surge, with a record 43 innovative drugs approved in the first half of 2025, a 59% increase year-over-year. According to the National Medical Products Administration, many of these new treatments target serious conditions like cancer and metabolic disorders. This rapid approval process is attributed to regulatory reforms that have encouraged greater investment in research and development from pharmaceutical companies. The trend highlights China's growing role as a global force in drug discovery, with the country also setting records for licensing its innovative drugs to overseas markets, signaling a shift in the global pharmaceutical landscape.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 05:00:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Professional chef and single father David Nayfeld is advocating for parents to cook with their children, despite the inevitable mess, to build stronger relationships and develop their kids' confidence. In his new cookbook, "Dad, What's for Dinner?", Nayfeld provides family-friendly recipes with 'mess ratings' and tips for involving children of all ages in the kitchen. He emphasizes that cooking together creates valuable memories and helps raise more adventurous eaters by introducing them to a variety of foods beyond typical 'kid food'. The book aims to make the experience less stressful and more about connection, turning potential kitchen chaos into a cherished family activity.</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank reported a second-quarter net profit of €1.485 billion, significantly surpassing analyst expectations and marking a strong recovery from a loss in the same period last year. The positive results were achieved despite mixed performance in its investment banking unit and the impact of a stronger euro. The bank's leadership expressed confidence in meeting full-year targets, citing strong business momentum and cost discipline. While fixed income and currencies trading saw robust growth, the origination and advisory division experienced a revenue decline due to market uncertainty, reflecting a broader slowdown in corporate activity.

          <p>Marcus Rashford's transfer from Manchester United to Barcelona has generated significant interest, with Spanish sports journalists expressing a mix of curiosity and cautious optimism. While recognizing his potential, they note he was not the club's first choice and must compete for a spot in a well-stocked forward line. The move is seen as a 'win-win' opportunity for Rashford to reignite his career after a period of poor form and for Barcelona to gain a versatile, relatively low-cost player. Pundits believe that if Rashford can rediscover the world-class level he showed earlier in his career, he could make a meaningful impact for his new team.</p>

          <p>As NFL training camps begin, several star players are sitting out of practice as they seek new, more lucrative contracts before the season starts. Notable holdouts include Dallas Cowboys' edge rusher Micah Parsons, who has been a top defensive player since entering the league, and Cincinnati Bengals' defensive end Trey Hendrickson, who led the NFL in sacks last season. Washington Commanders' receiver Terry McLaurin and Detroit Lions' linebacker Alex Anzalone are also absent from the field, hoping to secure new deals that reflect their on-field performance. This strategy carries risks, as players aim to avoid injury while leveraging their value against their teams.</p>

          <p>Sean Green, a 36-year-old mountain biker from Angus, Scotland, has completed an extraordinary eight-and-a-half-year challenge to cycle down all 282 of Scotland's Munros. Munros are mountains over 3,000 feet, and Green is believed to be only the second person ever to accomplish this feat, which involves carrying a bike to each summit before riding down. The semi-professional cyclist and scaffolder described the quest as a combination of his love for the outdoors and mountain biking. He cited the logistics and time away from his family as the most difficult aspects of the epic undertaking, which concluded in Glencoe.</p>

          <p>China is launching a new program to provide monthly subsidy coupons to its senior citizens to help cover the costs of elderly care and stimulate consumption in the sector. The electronic coupons, valued between 500 and 800 yuan per month, will be available to seniors assessed with moderate to complete physical disabilities. This rare use of direct fiscal support aims to alleviate the financial strain on families in a rapidly aging society and incentivize the use of professional services like meal assistance and day care.

          <p>After a decade-long legal battle, former City traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo have had their convictions for manipulating the Libor interest rate quashed by the UK's Court of Appeal. The ruling raises significant questions about the prosecutions that followed the 2008 financial crisis and may open the door for at least seven other convicted traders to appeal their sentences. The decision has prompted calls from senior politicians for a public inquiry into the scandal, including the role of senior bank managers and the Serious Fraud Office's investigation methods. The traders, who were jailed for the offense, had long maintained their innocence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship is unconstitutional, affirming a lower court's nationwide block on its enforcement. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the order's interpretation, which would deny citizenship to many children born in the United States, violates the 14th Amendment. The administration had argued that the amendment's jurisdiction clause does not automatically confer citizenship based on birth location alone. This ruling marks the first time an appeals court has weighed in on the issue, moving it one step closer to a potential review by the Supreme Court.</p>
