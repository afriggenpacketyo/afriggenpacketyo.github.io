          <p>Pfizer has increased its full-year adjusted profit guidance, citing effective cost-cutting strategies and strong business performance. The pharmaceutical company's second-quarter earnings and revenue surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by robust sales of its Covid products and other key drugs. The updated forecast now projects an adjusted profit between $2.90 and $3.10 per share. This positive outlook comes as the company navigates potential impacts from President Trump's demands for lower drug prices and proposed tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals.

          <p>Fox Corp. has announced the launch of its direct-to-consumer streaming service, Fox One, which will debut on August 21 for $19.99 per month. The service will offer the company's full portfolio, including live sports from the Fox broadcast network and news programming from Fox News and Fox Business, without any exclusive original content. CEO Lachlan Murdoch stated that subscriber expectations are modest and the pricing is designed to avoid further disruption to the traditional pay-TV bundle. The move marks Fox's entry into the comprehensive streaming market, following a different strategy than competitors who invest heavily in streaming-exclusive content.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are advising savers on how to navigate the current certificate of deposit (CD) market, where short-term rates are unusually higher than long-term ones. This inverted yield curve is driven by market expectations that the Federal Reserve may soon cut interest rates, making banks hesitant to lock in high yields for extended periods. Advisors suggest that the choice between a short-term and long-term CD should depend on an individual's financial timeline and goals, rather than attempts to time the market. For those uncertain, a CD laddering strategy is recommended to balance flexibility with the ability to secure favorable rates. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society indicates a significant rise in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among people aged 45 to 49. This increase is directly linked to a 62% jump in screenings for this age group from 2019 to 2023, following updated recommendations to lower the screening age from 50 to 45. Health experts view this as positive news, as early detection makes the cancer highly curable, with a survival rate of over 90% in its earliest stages. While the trend is promising, researchers emphasize that screening rates remain suboptimal and continued efforts are needed to ensure equitable access.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the restaurant industry reveals that Yum Brands, the parent company of KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, has become a significant incubator for future chief executives. Many leaders at rival chains, including the CEOs of Starbucks, Brinker International, and Cracker Barrel, have roots at Yum, benefiting from its focus on leadership development and global operational experience. Executive search experts attribute this trend to a 'people first' culture cultivated by past Yum CEOs, which provided executives with opportunities to grow. The company's large scale and competitive internal environment often lead high-performing talent to seek top roles elsewhere.</p>

          <p>A practicing neurologist outlines four specific foods to avoid in order to protect brain health and prevent serious neurological conditions. The list includes damaged canned goods due to the risk of botulism, a potent neurotoxin, and certain large tropical reef fish that can carry ciguatoxin. The author also advises against consuming uncooked or undercooked pork, which can lead to a parasitic brain infection called neurocysticercosis, a leading cause of acquired epilepsy. Finally, the article warns against unpasteurized milk, a source of dangerous pathogens that can cause irreversible brain damage, meningitis, and other severe outcomes.</p>

The software analytics firm raised its full-year revenue forecast, signaling confidence in continued momentum. Despite the impressive results, some analysts remain cautious, pointing to the stock's high valuation as a potential risk for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup report reveals that Gen Z employees are the least likely generation to favor fully remote work, with only 23% preferring it compared to 35% of older generations. Instead, 71% of Gen Z workers favor a hybrid model, expressing a desire for more in-person connection and mentorship opportunities that they feel are compromised in a fully remote setting. The study suggests that loneliness and a need to understand their role within the broader organization are key drivers for this preference. The findings challenge assumptions about the youngest generation's work preferences and highlight the importance of structured in-person interaction for career development.</p>

          <p>A perinatal psychiatrist expresses deep concern over misinformation about the use of SSRI antidepressants during pregnancy, particularly following a recent FDA advisory panel discussion.
