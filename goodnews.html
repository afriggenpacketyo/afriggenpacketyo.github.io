          <h2>Cognac Producers in France Adapt to Climate Change and Trade Challenges</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cognac producers in France are facing multiple challenges, including climate change, tariffs, and the loss of the Russian market. Climate change is causing grapes to ripen earlier and become sweeter, affecting the acidity needed for good cognac, while tariffs from the U.S. and China are impacting exports, with exports to China decreasing by half. Despite these challenges, many family-run businesses are adapting by diversifying into new markets and experimenting with organic cognac, cocktails, and aperitifs, while remaining optimistic about the future of cognac due to interest from younger generations in quality spirits. The industry is also focusing on sustainable practices to mitigate the effects of climate change.</p>

          <p>A California family is suing Harrison-Ross Mortuary in Compton after discovering the wrong man dressed in their uncle's suit inside the casket during preparations for the burial service. Amentha Hunt, the niece of the deceased, noticed the discrepancy and alerted a mortuary worker, who initially dismissed her concerns. The family endured a three-hour delay while the mortuary rectified the mix-up, and Hunt reports ongoing trauma from viewing the incorrect body. The funeral home denies the allegations and plans to file a cease-and-desist letter against Hunt, but the family's attorney emphasizes the need for improved standards of care to prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>

At 27, Cook is finally getting the opportunity to showcase his prolific wicket-taking ability on the highest stage, having taken the most County Championship wickets by any seamer in the past five years.</p>

          <p>Smartex, a sustainable fashion startup, has attracted investment from H&M Group and Amazon for its technology that uses cameras, vision software, and AI to detect defects in textiles during production, reducing fabric waste. Founded by Gilberto Loureiro, the company claims to have prevented 1 million kilograms of fabric from going to waste in the past three years. The technology addresses the fashion industry's significant waste problem and its slow adoption of digitalization. The investment from Amazon via its AWS Compute for Climate Fellowship will help Smartex train its machine learning models to identify flaws in fabric, contributing to a more efficient and sustainable apparel production process.</p>

          <p>Conservationists in Wales are employing a novel method to track endangered water voles by feeding them edible glitter. With water vole populations declining by 90% in the past 30 years, Nature Conservation Cymru hopes the glitter will appear in the animals' droppings, allowing them to monitor their movements and habitat use. The team consulted with vets to ensure the glitter is safe for the voles and plans to use different colors to track various families. By understanding the voles' territory and range, conservationists can implement measures to protect their environment and aid their dispersal.</p>

The site, known as the "River of Death," is believed to be one of the largest bone beds in North America, offering a unique opportunity to study a single community of a single species from a specific moment in time. Researchers believe the dinosaurs were part of a migrating herd that was wiped out by a catastrophic flash flood.
