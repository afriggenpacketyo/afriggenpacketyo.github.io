          <p>China is spearheading a renewed effort to establish a development bank for the 10-nation Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), which includes Russia and India. The initiative aims to insulate member countries from risks associated with the U.S. dollar-dominated global trade system and to finance key infrastructure projects. Analysts suggest the bank would be a logical step forward for the bloc, strengthening economic ties and providing an alternative to Western-led financial institutions. The move reflects a broader strategy to de-dollarize and increase regional economic autonomy. (not investment advice)</p>

The couple wore custom-designed Louis Vuitton gowns for the occasion, with Moretz opting for a non-traditional baby blue dress. Moretz, who has been dating Harrison since 2018, told Vogue magazine that the wedding celebrations were designed to share their personal interests, such as fishing and poker, with their guests. The event marks a significant personal milestone for the couple, who announced their engagement earlier this year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a significant human fossil discovered in a Greek cave, to be at least 286,000 years old. Using advanced uranium-series dating techniques, researchers placed the skull firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era, resolving decades of debate over its age. The fossil, often attributed to the species Homo heidelbergensis, possesses features distinct from both Neanderthals and modern humans. This new dating suggests that more primitive human populations coexisted alongside the emerging Neanderthal lineage, adding complexity to Europe's evolutionary history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Met Office has announced a significant possibility of the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, being visible across large parts of the United Kingdom. This rare viewing opportunity is due to a fast-moving coronal mass ejection from the sun, which is causing heightened solar activity. While northern regions of Scotland and Northern Ireland typically have the best chances, the lights may be seen as far south as the Midlands. Officials advise that visibility will depend on clear, dark skies away from city light pollution, with Monday and Tuesday nights offering the best potential for a memorable display.</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic has become the oldest man in the Open Era to reach the quarterfinals of all four Grand Slams in a single year, continuing his record-breaking season at the US Open. Despite his success, concerns remain about his physical durability, as he has dealt with various minor injuries throughout the tournament. His late-career achievements are unprecedented, but his ability to withstand the strain of best-of-five-set matches against top-tier opponents remains a critical question. His next challenge is against No. 4 seed Taylor Fritz, against whom he holds an undefeated record.</p>
