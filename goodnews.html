          <p>Max Homa, without his caddie, carried his own bag for 38 holes at the U.S. Open qualifier in Ohio, but missed qualifying after a five-man playoff. Homa stated he didn't mind carrying his own bag and felt it was a peaceful walk. He ended up in a five-man playoff with Rickie Fowler, Cameron Young, Eric Cole, and Chase Johnson, where Young secured the final spot with a birdie on hole 38. Homa is still not entirely out of the U.S. Open, as he is playing the Canadian Open this week, though he would likely have to win to get into the top 60 and qualify.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that his government will fast-track ambitious national projects to boost Canada's economy in response to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Following a meeting with provincial and territorial leaders, Carney outlined plans to narrow down a list of "nation building" projects, such as pipelines, nuclear reactors, and trade corridors, and approve them within two years. The goal is to strengthen Canada's economy and autonomy in the face of "unjustified and unlawful" tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum, and the auto sector. Trade talks between Canada and the U.S. are ongoing.</p>

          <p>South Korea's opposition party leader, Lee Jae-myung, is projected to win the country's snap presidential election, according to opinion polls. A victory for Lee would position him as the successor to ousted president Yoon Suk Yeol and influence South Korea's trade negotiations with the U.S. and policies on China and North Korea. Lee's eligibility for the presidency was previously questioned due to charges of breaching election laws, but the High Court postponed a final ruling until after the election. Both Lee and his rival, Kim Moon Soo, share similar goals for economic growth and financial stability, but differ on their economic policy platforms (not investment advice).</p>
