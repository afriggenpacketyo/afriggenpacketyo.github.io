          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 19:35:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canadensys Aerospace is developing Canada's first lunar rover, slated for launch in 2029 as part of NASA's Artemis program, with the goal of finding water and measuring radiation levels on the Moon. The rover will land in the Moon's south polar region, which presents significant engineering challenges due to extreme temperatures and the presence of lunar regolith. The mission builds on Canada's history in space exploration and aims to demonstrate Canadian technology. The rover's findings could have huge implications for more sustainable exploration and potentially turning the Moon into a sort of petrol station for spacecrafts. The rover is a starting point to designing something that can survive on the lunar surface long-term, and it's pretty bulletproof anywhere else in the solar system. </p>

          <p>The final phase of England's largest-ever childcare funding expansion has begun, offering eligible working parents 30 hours of government-funded childcare per week. While Prime Minister Starmer hailed it as a "landmark moment," parents are encountering long waiting lists and nurseries cite staff shortages. Some parents are strategically timing births to meet funding eligibility, and research suggests workforce issues could hinder the scheme's delivery. The government is offering incentives for new recruits, but retention remains a concern, and confusion persists about what is truly "free" due to additional charges. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global demand for matcha has surged, leading to shortages and price increases in Japan, where it has been consumed for centuries. The trend, fueled by matcha's reputation as a superfood and a post-pandemic tourism boom, has put a strain on Japan's aging farming communities. The government is considering subsidizing farmers to increase tencha production, but labor-intensive harvesting remains a challenge. Retailers are rationing supplies, and companies are struggling to secure enough matcha to meet the growing demand, as some worry that this summer's record heatwave could lower next year's tea harvest and push prices even higher. </p>

          <p>A Chinese mountain snake, rarely seen in over a century, has been rediscovered in China's Wuyishan Mountains. The snake, known for its secretive habits, was first discovered in 1899 but has been rarely documented since. Researchers identified the snake during a reptile biodiversity survey, and it serves multiple vital ecosystem roles, especially controlling rodent populations. The discovery and study of elusive animal species can help build a wider appreciation for the ecosystem services they provide. </p>

With talk of a new auction system to replace the draft and teams only being able to retain a certain number of players, this could be the end for this Invincibles side. </p>

          <p>China has significantly expanded its navy in recent decades, becoming the world's largest in terms of warships, fueled by its economic growth and global ambitions. The country's shipbuilding capacity far exceeds that of the United States, raising concerns about the shifting balance of power at sea. While the US Navy still maintains advantages in overall tonnage and aircraft carriers, China is rapidly catching up, modernizing its fleet and expanding its naval bases. The buildup is driven by a desire to safeguard national security and project power in the South China Sea and beyond, challenging the US's maritime dominance. </p>
