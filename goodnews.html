          <p>The Syrian government has agreed to assist the United States in locating and returning missing Americans in Syria, according to the U.S. special envoy to Syria, Thomas Barrack. Barrack described this agreement as a "power step forward" between the two nations, following a meeting with Syria's president and foreign minister in Turkey. The announcement comes after the Trump administration granted Syria exemptions from sanctions, signaling improved relations between the two countries. Barrack stated that President Trump has made it clear that bringing home USA citizens or honoring, with dignity, their remains is a major priority everywhere.</p>

          <p>The story of Julie Moore, an Army spouse who revolutionized the military's casualty notification system, is highlighted, contrasting the impersonal telegrams of the past with the current practice of in-person notification and support. Moore, whose husband served in Vietnam, was instrumental in lobbying for a more dignified and compassionate approach after experiencing the fear of receiving a telegram herself. Her efforts led to a fundamental change in Army protocol, where service members now personally notify families and offer ongoing support, and Moore's legacy is honored at Ft. Moore, formerly Ft. Benning.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent warming toward the new Syrian leader has complicated Israel's military strategy in the region, leading to a decrease in Israeli airstrikes on Syria. Israel has historically conducted numerous attacks to prevent weapons from falling into hostile hands and to deter anti-Israel groups. However, Trump's meeting with Syrian President Ahmed al-Shara and the lifting of sanctions have altered the dynamic, potentially undermining Israeli efforts to maintain security and influence in the area.</p>

The visit will be the King's first to Canada as reigning monarch and is intended to send a political message about Canada's identity and alliances.</p>
