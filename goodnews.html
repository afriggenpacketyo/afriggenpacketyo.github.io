        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Todd S. Purdum of the New York Times reflects on Desi Arnaz's pivotal role in breaking racial barriers in early television and his broader impact on Hollywood. Facing initial resistance from CBS executives who doubted the appeal of a Latino actor as Lucille Ball's husband, Arnaz orchestrated a vaudeville tour to showcase their chemistry, ultimately paving the way for "I Love Lucy." Arnaz's success not only challenged racial stereotypes but also revolutionized television production by filming the show, enabling reruns and syndication. The article emphasizes the importance of diversity and inclusion, drawing parallels to contemporary challenges in the entertainment industry. </p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Times reports on Brian Orozco, a 23-year-old goalkeeper with Guatemalan heritage who has become a key player for the Empire Strykers in the Major Arena Soccer League (MASL). After a disappointing debut season, the Strykers improved significantly, making the playoffs with Orozco as the starting goalkeeper. Orozco credits his teammate Marco Fabi√°n for helping him develop professionally and on the field. His unconventional path includes playing as a forward for Guatemala's U-17 team before transitioning to goalkeeper. Orozco aspires to represent Guatemala in a World Cup in any category of soccer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tressie McMillan Cottom of The New York Times explores the complex racial dynamics within country music, noting the genre's recent surge in popularity and the simultaneous rise of Black, Hispanic, Indigenous, and queer artists. Cottom argues that country music faces an identity crisis, divided between Nashville's mainstream, white-dominated sound and the growing diversification of the genre. The article examines how the industry often anoints white artists as the "saviors" of country music, while marginalizing non-white artists who challenge the genre's racial codes. Cottom concludes that the battle for control of country music is intensely political, reflecting broader cultural power struggles.</p>
