          <h2>Judge Blocks Trump Administration's NSF Research Funding Cuts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing significant cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The ruling prevents a policy change that would have stripped universities of tens of millions of dollars allocated for research in critical technology fields such as artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Judge Talwani deemed the NSF's announced changes in May as arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, particularly regarding indirect costs like building maintenance. The University of California estimated that the change would have cost them nearly $100 million annually, but this ruling protects their funding for now. The stability of research funding is positive news for academic institutions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated assisted departure flights from Israel, with two flights already transporting approximately 70 U.S. citizens and their families to Athens. This evacuation effort began shortly before President Trump announced U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee urged other U.S. citizens needing assistance to register with the State Department's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP). The move follows earlier confusion regarding U.S. government assistance for Americans evacuating Israel, as tensions between Israel and Iran have escalated. The successful evacuation of citizens is a positive step amidst regional conflict.</p>

          <p>Belarus released opposition leader Sergei Tikhanovsky and more than a dozen other political prisoners following an appeal from the White House. The release occurred shortly after a visit from President Trump's special envoy, Keith Kellogg, to Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Tikhanovsky's wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, thanked President Trump for brokering the deal. The Belarusian leader reportedly ordered the release at Mr. Trump's request. This development signals a potential warming of ties between Washington and Moscow-ally Belarus, although the country still holds over 1,000 political prisoners. The release of political prisoners is a positive development for human rights.</p>

          <p>NPR's Frank Langfitt reflects on covering both a military parade and "No Kings" rallies on the same day, observing the stark political and cultural divisions within America. The military parade featured tanks and armored personnel carriers rolling through the nation's capital, while the "No Kings" protests involved people in dozens of cities rallying against the politicization of the armed forces. Langfitt notes that these events serve as a Rorschach test, highlighting America's differing perspectives. By attending both events, Langfitt gained a unique perspective on the country's contrasting viewpoints. The juxtaposition of these events reveals deep societal fractures.</p>

          <p>The pop-punk band South Arcade is riding the wave of Y2K core, drawing inspiration from 90s and early 2000s culture. The band's upbeat, rocky guitar music evokes a nostalgic feel reminiscent of MTV and 90s slasher movies. Despite being born at the start of the millennium, the band members were introduced to Y2K culture by older siblings and friends. South Arcade gained traction via TikTok, where the Y2K hashtag has been used in millions of posts. Their music appeals to both those who experienced the Y2K era and younger fans seeking escapism.

          <p>The article examines the trend of social media posts offering quick fixes to lower cortisol levels, a stress hormone. Experts warn that these simplistic solutions often fail to address the underlying causes of stress and may prevent individuals from seeking necessary medical treatment. Jasleen Kaur Carroll, who experienced burnout, tried various social media hacks without success. High cortisol levels can cause weight gain and other health problems, potentially indicating a rare condition like Cushing's Syndrome. Instead of relying on quick fixes, experts recommend addressing the root causes of stress through therapy, mindfulness, and lifestyle changes. Addressing stress requires a holistic approach.</p>

The plan aims to increase the number of trained soldiers from just under 71,000 to more than 73,000. The Lib Dems also suggest distributing pamphlets to every British home to ensure preparedness for conflict or cyber-attacks. New recruits would receive the bonus after completing training and serving for two years, while former armed services personnel would be offered a ¬£20,000 payment for re-enlisting. The proposal is designed to address an increasingly unpredictable world situation. The plan is contingent on increased defense spending.</p>
