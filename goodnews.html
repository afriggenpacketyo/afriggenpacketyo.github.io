        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wage growth in the United Kingdom showed a slight cooling in the three months to August, with the annual rate dropping to 4.7% from 4.8%. This moderation coincided with a marginal increase in the national unemployment rate to 4.8%, an increase primarily driven by younger individuals. The Office for National Statistics noted that hiring activity appears to be stabilizing after a prolonged weak period, with public sector earnings growing faster than those in the private sector. This data suggests a gradual easing of cost pressures within the labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the signing of a historic peace agreement to end two years of conflict in Gaza, former President Donald Trump declined to commit to a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians. Speaking to reporters, he stated, "We’ll have to see," emphasizing that his current focus is on rebuilding the war-torn territory. The U.S.-brokered deal, signed with regional partners, secured the release of 20 hostages, though critical issues like postwar governance and Hamas's disarmament remain unresolved.</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old from Inverclyde, Scotland, is advocating for CPR to be taught in all Scottish schools after tragically losing both of his parents to heart conditions. Cameron McGerr believes he might have been able to save his father, who died of a cardiac arrest, if he had been trained in the life-saving skill. After successfully persuading his own school to introduce the training, he has taken his "Pulse of Life" campaign to the Scottish Parliament. His efforts have garnered a positive response, and he is now scheduled to meet with the Education Secretary to discuss a nationwide rollout.</p>

          <p>The England men's national football team is confronting a scarcity of in-form, out-and-out strikers to serve as backup for captain Harry Kane. With Kane's usual deputy, Ollie Watkins, sidelined by injury, the lack of depth in the number nine position has become a prominent concern ahead of the World Cup. Only seven English players classified as pure strikers have appeared in the Premier League this season, prompting calls from within the sport for developing more traditional goalscorers. The article explores the potential candidates to support Kane as England aims to qualify for the upcoming tournament.</p>

          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is intensifying his call for a targeted national screening program for prostate cancer. Acting as an ambassador for Prostate Cancer Research, Sunak argues that a program focused on high-risk groups, such as men with a family history of the disease and Black men, would be both affordable and effective in saving many lives. His push comes as the UK National Screening Committee reconsiders its current stance against routine screening. The proposed program would utilize MRI scans and PSA tests, reflecting recent advancements that make testing more reliable.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Peking University have successfully used artificial intelligence to restore a 1,600-year-old masterpiece of Chinese calligraphy, "Rhapsody on the Luo River Goddess." The original work by 4th-century calligrapher Wang Xianzhi was incomplete, with only about a quarter of its verses surviving. By analyzing the distinct style of the 250 remaining characters, the AI system was able to replicate and generate the missing text, resulting in a complete scroll of 919 characters. This project showcases the significant potential for AI to preserve and reconstruct ancient cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>A new campaign in the United Kingdom aims to increase the number of blood donors by targeting people who are applying for a driving licence. The initiative, a partnership between the DVLA and NHS Blood and Transplant, will include a direct link to the blood donor registration page in emails sent to millions of applicants annually. The primary goal is to appeal directly to younger people, as over half of current regular donors are over the age of 45. The program hopes to replicate the success of a similar organ donor registration prompt on the same application process.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' 2-1 win over the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Championship Series opener showcased the distinct advantage of their record-breaking $415 million payroll. Despite stranding multiple runners and committing a costly base-running error, the Dodgers secured the win through key plays from their highly-paid stars. Contributions from Freddie Freeman, who hit the go-ahead home run, and starting pitcher Blake Snell, who delivered eight scoreless innings, underscored how financial might can overcome in-game adversity. The article contrasts the Dodgers' star-powered roster with the Brewers' more modest, small-market team construction.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 2-1 in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series, led by a masterful performance from pitcher Blake Snell. Snell pitched eight scoreless innings, allowing only one hit while striking out ten batters. The victory came despite a chaotic fourth-inning double-play where a potential grand slam was nullified by a base-running mistake on what was initially thought to be a home run. Freddie Freeman's sixth-inning solo home run provided the decisive run, and the bullpen held on in a tense ninth inning to secure the series lead.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 2.9% year-on-year in the third quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts of a 1.9% increase. Despite the strong performance, which was a slowdown from the previous quarter, the country's central bank warned that growth is likely to moderate in 2026. The manufacturing sector's growth flattened, weighing on the overall result, while the services sector also saw slower expansion. The Monetary Authority of Singapore kept its policy settings unchanged, projecting that GDP growth will slow to a near-trend pace as global economic conditions evolve. (not investment advice)</p>
