          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is defending the company's ambitious $850 billion plan for a global network of AI data centers, a project with an energy demand equivalent to powering over 13 million homes. Acknowledging concerns about a potential market bubble and a circular financing model with partners like Nvidia and Oracle, Altman insists the massive buildout is necessary to meet the soaring, near-infinite demand for AI compute power. He frames the enormous investment and its associated risks as a natural part of a historic technological revolution, confident that the long-term value of AI will be gigantic for society.

          <p>In response to a noticeable decline in tourist numbers, Las Vegas is actively courting local residents with significant discounts on hotels, dining, and attractions. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority has launched a campaign framing a Nevada ID as a key to special offers, with major resorts like Caesars and Virgin Hotels offering substantial rate reductions and perks. While some locals observe that weekends remain busy, the city-wide effort aims to fill the midweek gap by encouraging "staycations" and boosting local spending to support the community's primary industry.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has adopted a noticeably softer diplomatic tone towards China, calling for engagement in a "spirit of mutual understanding." This shift comes as the EU seeks Beijing's assistance on critical global issues, including the war in Ukraine and climate change. While acknowledging Europe's ongoing concerns about China's export controls and market access, the more conciliatory language marks a departure from previous, more assertive stances. Chinese Premier Li Qiang reciprocated by calling for the two powers to maintain strategic independence and demonstrate responsibility amid growing global instability.</p>

          <p>Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt, the 106-year-old chaplain for the Loyola University Ramblers men's basketball team, has retired from her duties due to growing health concerns. She became an international celebrity during the team's surprising run to the Final Four in 2018, known for her pregame prayers and unwavering support. Having joined Loyola in 1991 after its merger with Mundelein College, she began her role with the basketball team in 1994 to help student-athletes with their grades. In a final message, she encouraged students to let their dreams become reality and to become future leaders.</p>

          <p>Labubu dolls, rabbit-like monster plushes from collectible blind boxes, have become a viral fashion accessory, prompting luxury brands to tap into the craze. Originally priced at $27, the dolls' high demand has led to collaborations with high-end brands like Moynat, which is releasing a collection of handbags and accessories featuring the character. This trend follows a broader strategy where brands like Omega and Loewe use popular characters to attract younger, digitally-savvy consumers. Analysts suggest these collaborations leverage emotional value and cultural relevance, which are increasingly important to Gen Z customers.</p>

          <p>Betty Reid Soskin, the oldest park ranger in U.S. history, celebrated her 104th birthday at a Bay Area middle school named in her honor. Soskin gained national recognition in her 80s as a ranger at the Rosie the Riveter National Historical Park, where she shared stories of African Americans during World War II, particularly the Port Chicago explosion. An active opponent of Jim Crow laws in her youth, she became a celebrated figure for her service and storytelling, retiring from her post at age 100. Her legacy continues to inspire many, including author Meena Harris, who describes her as an American hero.</p>

This direct feedback proved invaluable, helping them pivot from targeting existing businesses to focusing on first-time owners, a more precise and receptive market.

          <p>The New York City Police Department is using drones to detect and prevent subway surfing, a dangerous activity that has led to 16 deaths in the past three years. The drone program canvasses moving trains from above, and if a person is spotted on top, a team is dispatched to intercept the train at the next station and safely remove them. Since its launch, the NYPD claims to have saved over 200 people, many of whom are teenagers influenced by viral social media videos. The mother of a 15-year-old who died while subway surfing is now suing social media companies for their role in popularizing the trend.</p>

          <p>The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has approved a proposal to remove the long-standing $25,000 minimum equity rule for pattern day trading, a change that would make active trading more accessible to retail investors with smaller accounts. Established in 2001 during the dot-com bubble, the rule required traders making four or more day trades in five days to maintain a $25,000 balance. The new proposal, which awaits SEC approval, would instead base intraday buying power on margin requirements for specific positions, reflecting modern market technology and access.

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut, average 30-year mortgage rates have fallen to a three-year low of 6.13%, providing significant savings for homebuyers. For a $250,000 mortgage, the monthly principal and interest payment is now approximately $1,520, which is about $150 less per month compared to the rates seen at the beginning of the year. This reduction in borrowing costs has spurred a jump in mortgage applications from both new buyers and existing homeowners looking to refinance. Over the life of the loan, this lower rate could save a borrower around $54,000 in total interest payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An inexpensive, generic drug called leucovorin, derived from folic acid and typically used to treat chemotherapy side effects, is being studied as a potential treatment for autism. Some researchers theorize that certain children with autism have a blockage that prevents folate from reaching the brain, and leucovorin can bypass this issue. One family reported their nonverbal son began speaking just days after starting the off-label treatment. While preliminary studies have shown positive effects on speech, more research is needed for FDA approval, a process hampered by the drug's low profitability for pharmaceutical companies.</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates near a three-year low following a Federal Reserve rate cut, prospective homebuyers are advised to carefully consider their financial situation before entering the market. Experts suggest buyers first determine the actual interest rate they are eligible for based on their credit score, as it may differ from the national average. They should also explore alternatives like buying mortgage points or using an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) to secure an even lower initial rate. Finally, buyers must weigh the risk of waiting for rates to fall further against the possibility that they could rise again, as has happened in the recent past. (not investment advice)</p>
