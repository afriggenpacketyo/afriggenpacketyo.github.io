          <p>The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in southern France has recognized over 70 medical miracles in 163 years, drawing millions of pilgrims annually who seek miraculous recoveries. The Lourdes Office of Medical Observations, led by Dr. Alessandro de Franciscis, rigorously investigates claimed cures, requiring sudden, complete, and lasting recoveries with no current medical explanation. Since 2022, two additional miracles have been acknowledged, bringing the total to 72, including documented cases like Vittorio Micheli's osteosarcoma recovery and Sister Bernadette Moriau's Cauda Equina cure. Despite historical skepticism regarding scientific rigor, independent analysis has found the office's conclusions credible, underscoring the meticulous documentation and patient scrutiny involved in such extraordinary recognitions.</p>

          <p>Jerry Adler, a prolific figure who spent decades backstage on Broadway as a stage manager, producer, and director for 53 productions, has died at 96, leaving behind a remarkable legacy. He later pivoted to a successful acting career in his 60s, notably playing the iconic Hesh Rabkin in "The Sopranos" and Howard Lyman in "The Good Wife." Adler, who hailed from a family deeply rooted in Jewish and Yiddish theater, initially doubted his acting potential. His career resurgence, sparked by a casting director's hunch, saw him work consistently for over 30 years in film and television, proving his belief that "retirement is a road to nowhere" and securing his place as an enduring performer.</p>

Fleetwood's popularity was evident as crowds chanted his name, and fellow European Ryder Cup teammate Justin Rose filmed his winning putt.

The switch-hitter surpassed Salvador Perez's 2021 record and also achieved his ninth multi-home run game of the season, breaking Mickey Mantle's record for switch-hitters. Raleigh, a first-time All-Star, has now hit 40 homers while primarily playing catcher, joining a prestigious group of Hall of Famers. His impressive performance follows a six-year, $105 million contract extension and a Home Run Derby win, solidifying his status as a prominent power hitter.</p>

          <p>SpaceX is preparing for the 10th test launch of its massive Starship rocket from Boca Chica Beach, Texas, following a series of three catastrophic in-flight failures earlier this year. The planned flight aims to test significant upgrades, including intentionally disabling an engine during the booster's landing burn and stressing the upper stage's structural limits during reentry. This program is crucial for NASA's Artemis mission to land astronauts on the moon by 2027 and Elon Musk's long-term goal of Mars colonization. Despite the expensive setbacks, Musk maintains a sanguine public stance, emphasizing the entertainment value of the ambitious development process.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer analyzes the stock market's rally, driven by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's signal for upcoming interest rate cuts, which caught many "bear-side" hedge funds by surprise. Powell's decision was influenced by a dramatic deceleration in hiring and initial post-severance federal firings, outweighing concerns about tariffs and inflation. Cramer highlights key sectors for investment, including housing, mergers and acquisitions, and IPOs, viewing them as beneficiaries of the "don't fight the Fed" mentality. He also discusses the non-monolithic nature of "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks, upcoming earnings reports from Nvidia and CrowdStrike, and the political influence surrounding the Intel saga.

          <p>Joe Root's exceptional unbeaten 64 led Trent Rockets to a thrilling three-wicket victory over Welsh Fire, securing their place in the knockout stages of The Hundred men's cricket competition. Chasing 151, the Rockets faced a late collapse, losing five wickets for 20 runs, but Root held his nerve, hitting a six and a four to regain control. Sam Hain ultimately struck the winning runs with one ball to spare. This win, which also confirmed the top three sides and eliminated others, was particularly notable as Root was dropped on zero due to a no-ball, a reprieve he capitalized on to deliver a chanceless and crucial performance.</p>

She expressed relief at breaking the four-year winless streak at the tournament, feeling she can now continue "without that in her head."</p>

          <p>Levi Kelly, a tiny homes expert from Ohio, built a remarkably small 19-square-foot livable house for $5,000, demonstrating extreme efficiency and creative use of space. Inspired by others living in compact homes, Kelly transformed an old utility trailer into a functional dwelling with essentials like an AC/heating unit, a tilting bed, portable toilet, and an outdoor shower, all powered by solar panels. The project, completed in a month with his wife's help, prioritized functionality over minimalism, proving that a livable space can be created with minimal square footage. Kelly, who has tested the house in various conditions, encourages others to attempt building even smaller, functional homes.</p>
