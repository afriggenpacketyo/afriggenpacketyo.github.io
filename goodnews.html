          <h2>Japan Small Shops to Sell Reserve Rice Amid Price Surge</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 02:04:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's farm minister announced that consumers can purchase government-released reserve rice at smaller supermarkets for around $12 per 5 kilograms starting in early June. This initiative aims to counteract a surge in rice prices, which the state is actively trying to reverse. The ministry plans to resume accepting purchase requests specifically from small supermarkets and rice shops to ensure widespread distribution. This decision follows a halt in orders from major retailers due to high demand, reflecting the government's strategy to stabilize rice prices for consumers. Optimism score of 70.</p>

          <p>Marc Marquez, the eight-time world champion, is now a 2025 MotoGP title contender, a remarkable turnaround from the "nightmare" he faced two seasons ago after suffering severe injuries. Following broken bones and multiple operations, Marquez left Honda, his team of 11 years, to join Gresini Racing, a satellite Ducati team, to prove his speed. Now racing for the factory Ducati team and leading the championship standings, Marquez has demonstrated his ability to compete at the highest level once again. His journey marks a significant comeback, positioning him within reach of a ninth world title. Optimism score of 90.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, dealing a significant blow to his economic policies. The Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court emphasized that the U.S. Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations. While the Trump administration has lodged an appeal, global financial markets reacted positively, with stock markets rising and the U.S. dollar gaining against safe-haven currencies.

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10 percent year-on-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by growing demand ahead of potential U.S. tariff increases on imported cars. The company's global production also rose, marking an all-time high for April. Despite U.S. President Donald Trump's imposition of a 25 percent tariff on cars produced outside the United States, Toyota plans to absorb the costs without passing them on to consumers, though analysts anticipate long-term pressure to do so. Toyota expects a significant drop in net profit for the business year due to these tariff measures and a stronger yen. (not investment advice) Optimism score of 70.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Court of International Trade blocked steep reciprocal tariffs unilaterally imposed by President Donald Trump on scores of countries in April. The ruling deals a potentially serious blow to the Republican president's economic agenda and ongoing efforts to negotiate trade deals with various nations. The court said that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which Trump invoked to impose the tariffs, does not authorize a president to levy universal duties on imports. The Trump administration has appealed the decision. (not investment advice) Optimism score of 60.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite facing challenges like high labor costs and water restrictions, California avocado growers report that Mexican imports have actually helped their sales. The lifting of the U.S. ban on Mexican avocados in 1997 has allowed for a year-round supply, fostering demand and transforming avocados from specialty items to regular offerings. Increased consumption has been buoyed by growing interest in healthy fats and marketing efforts by the Hass Avocado Board. California growers want Mexican avocados to keep flowing into the country, though they also want robust U.S. inspections of the imports to keep out pests. Optimism score of 80.</p>

The dispute arose after Sony terminated its distribution deal with CBS, alleging unauthorized licensing deals and budget cuts that hobbled the network‚Äôs efforts to support the two shows.
