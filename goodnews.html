          <p>NATO leaders agreed to increase defense spending to 5% of each country's economic output by 2035, more than doubling the previous target of 2%. President Trump praised the agreement as a "monumental win for the United States," highlighting his demands for allies to boost spending. In 2024, NATO members spent an average of 2.61% of their GDP on defense, with 22 of 32 members meeting or exceeding the 2% benchmark. Spain's Prime Minister stated that his country will not meet the 5% defense spending goal, calling the 2% target "sufficient" and "realistic."</p>

          <p>Twenty-two families in southwest Fresno became first-time homeowners after constructing their own houses through the Mutual Self-Help Housing (MSHH) program. The program, run by Self-Help Enterprises, empowers low-income families to build homes collectively, providing training and supervision. The completion of the project, located in the Annadale neighborhood, represents a $1.46 million investment by the city of Fresno to address the housing crisis. The project provides an opportunity for families to achieve the American dream and participate in the wealth of the United States.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its AI assistant Claude was "exceedingly transformative and was a fair use." The decision marks a major victory for Anthropic, allowing the use of copyrighted books for AI training without author consent. However, the judge ruled that Anthropic may have broken the law by using pirated books and ordered a trial to determine damages. The judge emphasized that the AI's purpose was to create something different, not to replicate the original works.</p>

          <p>Industry insiders at the Annual Meeting of the New Champions in Tianjin suggest that Chinese companies should relocate their entire manufacturing ecosystems overseas to strengthen their expansions. With increasing uncertainty over global trade, particularly during the second term of US President Donald Trump, building factories in new markets will enhance supply chain resilience. This shift would allow companies to avoid tariffs and cater to both export and local sales. China's manufacturers began relocating their supply chains overseas during Trump's first term, initially focusing on Southeast Asia before expanding to countries like Mexico and Morocco.</p>

          <p>The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to consider cryptocurrency as an asset in single-family mortgage loan risk assessments. This move signals a significant shift in integrating crypto into traditional financial infrastructure. The order instructs the housing finance giants to develop proposals that include digital assets without requiring borrowers to liquidate them into U.S. dollars before loan closing. FHFA Director William J. Pulte stated that this aligns with President Trump's vision of making the United States the crypto capital of the world. (not investment advice)</p>
