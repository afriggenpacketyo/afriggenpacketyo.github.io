          <p>Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has announced he will obstruct all Trump administration justice department nominations until the White House provides answers about plans to accept a luxury aircraft from Qatar for presidential use. Schumer called the proposed arrangement ‚Äúnot just naked corruption‚Äù, likening it to something so corrupt ‚Äúthat even [Russian president Vladimir] Putin would give a double take‚Äù. There are three nominations to the justice department awaiting confirmation, the New York Times reports, with dozens more likely to come down the pipeline.</p>
