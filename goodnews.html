          <p>A private lunar lander from Japan, named Resilience, is approaching the moon, aiming for a touchdown in the unexplored far north. The mission, led by Tokyo-based company ispace, follows a previous crash landing and carries a rover to gather lunar dirt, as well as a Swedish artist's toy-size red house. This mission follows successful landings by Firefly Aerospace and Intuitive Machines, though the latter faced challenges upon arrival. Ispace aims to establish lunar infrastructure and a permanent human presence on the moon, with plans for future missions involving NASA. </p>

          <p>British money transfer firm Wise announced plans to move its primary listing to the U.S., a move that presents a blow to the London stock exchange. Wise will shift to a dual listing, making the U.S. its main listing hub while maintaining a secondary listing in London. The company stated this would allow its shares to trade on both a U.S. stock exchange and the LSE. Following the announcement, shares of Wise traded almost 11% higher Thursday morning.</p>

          <h2>California Lawmakers Consider Policy Changes After L.A. Wildfires</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California lawmakers are considering policy changes to protect the state insurance program for high-risk homes from financial collapse following devastating wildfires in Los Angeles. A bill, AB 226, would make the FAIR Plan eligible for state-backed loans and bonds to avoid running out of money after a disaster. Other wildfire-related bills aim to protect homeowners from price gouging, streamline the claims process, and offer financial protections for disaster victims. The measures are intended to prevent and prepare for future fires, offering a show of goodwill to communities still suffering from past disasters.</p>

          <p>Brian Colbert has made history as the first Black supervisor in Marin County, California, since its founding 175 years ago. Colbert focused on local concerns such as wildfire prevention, disaster preparedness, and flood control during his campaign. He brings a unique perspective to office, different from most in the wealthy and predominantly white county, at a time when President Trump is turning his back on civil rights. Colbert hopes to inspire future generations and address challenges facing his community.</p>

          <p>The article recounts a modern-day trip to Paris, following in the footsteps of Mark Twain's "The Innocents Abroad."

The article explores Twain's complex relationship with French culture and his role in shaping the American perspective on France, ultimately finding a way to stay in Paris forever through cultural influence.</p>

          <h2>Weight-Loss Jabs May Affect Contraception</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 05:42:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's medicines regulator has warned women using weight-loss jabs, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, to use effective contraception, as the drugs may harm an unborn baby. The regulator also warns that weight-loss jabs may make the contraceptive pill less likely to work in those who are overweight or obese. This is because common side-effects of the jabs, such as vomiting and diarrhea, and the fact that they slow the emptying of the stomach, may cause the contraceptive pill not to be absorbed properly. The MHRA has issued its own guidance on contraception and weight-loss injections.</p>
