          <p>Japan's economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing economists' expectations and demonstrating resilience against U.S. trade tariffs. The growth was primarily driven by strong exports, which offset some of the headwinds from the uncertain trade environment. However, on a year-over-year basis, GDP growth slowed compared to the first quarter, and analysts remain cautious about the future. Economists warn that softening investment and the potential for tariffs to impact corporate profits and wages could lead to a renewed slowdown or even a recession in the coming quarters.

The company's strong performance comes as it pursues a long-delayed initial public offering, having recently shifted its focus from London to Hong Kong. Despite its growth, the Singapore-headquartered firm acknowledged several risks, including potential supply chain disruptions, currency fluctuations, and the impact of weaker consumer confidence.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The series finale of "And Just Like That" concludes with protagonist Carrie Bradshaw single once again, an ending the article argues is more true to the character and the show's core themes than a traditional fairytale romance. After exploring widowhood and a rekindled relationship, the show returns Carrie to a state of self-reliance, bolstered by her friendships. The article suggests this outcome corrects the original "Sex and the City" finale, which paired all main characters with men, by reaffirming the original series' message that female friendships can be the most powerful and enduring soulmate relationships.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have unveiled a new high-speed uncrewed aerial vehicle that features vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities. The jet-powered drone is designed to operate from the decks of standard warships without a runway, even in rough seas, before transitioning to fast, long-range flight. According to the project team, this technology could effectively transform vessels like destroyers and frigates into small aircraft carriers, significantly expanding their operational range and capabilities. The developers claim the drone's performance, particularly its speed, is far superior to other existing VTOL drones.</p>

          <p>Youngstown, Ohio, a city once devastated by the collapse of the American steel industry, is showing signs of a steady revival. Entrepreneurs are repurposing abandoned industrial buildings into new businesses, such as a brewery and a flea market, bringing new life and economic activity to the downtown area. While the city's comeback is not dramatic, its population has stabilized, and the unemployment rate has fallen significantly from its historic highs. This gradual revitalization is driven by local business owners who are forging a new identity for the city beyond its industrial past.</p>

          <p>The British government is collaborating with medical influencers on TikTok to raise awareness about the dangers of traveling abroad for cosmetic surgery. The campaign aims to address the growing trend of "medical tourism," where individuals seek cheaper procedures overseas, sometimes with life-altering negative consequences. The influencers will advise their followers to consult with a UK doctor first, purchase proper travel insurance, and be wary of package deals. This initiative is part of a broader effort to protect patients and reduce the burden on the NHS, which often has to correct botched overseas procedures.</p>

          <p>Four years after famously pivoting to an entirely plant-based menu, the three-Michelin-star restaurant Eleven Madison Park is reintroducing animal products. Chef Daniel Humm, who had previously championed the vegan menu as an ethical and creative necessity, cited a desire for inclusion and flagging business as reasons for the change. The restaurant experienced a decline in wine sales and private event bookings, as clients were reportedly hesitant about a fully plant-based experience. The article frames the reversal as a reflection of the challenges facing high-end vegan dining and persistent consumer preference for meat.</p>

          <p>At 45 years old, tennis icon Venus Williams is set to make history as the oldest player to compete in the U.S. Open singles tournament since 1981. Williams, a two-time U.S. Open champion, received a wild card invitation to participate in her 25th singles championship at the event. Her participation highlights the longevity possible in professional tennis, where many athletes have achieved major victories well into their 30s and 40s. After a period of underwhelming results and injuries, Williams recently became the oldest player to win a WTA singles match since 2004.</p>

          <p>Three of Dame Vera Lynn's first audition records, made 90 years ago, are being released to the public for the first time. The rare silver aluminium discs were discovered after the late singer's daughter donated her mother's record collection to the British Library's Sound Archive. The tracks, along with other rare recordings, will be featured on a new album titled "Hidden Treasures," with a single released to commemorate the 80th anniversary of VJ Day. Dame Vera Lynn, known as the "Forces' Sweetheart," became a symbol of hope in the UK during World War II.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new AI-driven tool called DeepEditor is changing how foreign language films are dubbed by digitally manipulating actors' lip movements to match the new dialogue. This technology aims to create a more seamless viewing experience, potentially opening up markets like the U.S. that have traditionally been resistant to subtitled or poorly dubbed films. Independent studio XYZ Films successfully used the tool for a Swedish sci-fi movie, securing a theatrical release it otherwise would not have received. The developer emphasizes that the system is designed as a tool for creative professionals, using real voice actors rather than synthetic voices.</p>
