          <p>U.S. employers added 139,000 jobs in May, exceeding economists' forecasts and signaling resilience in the labor market despite concerns over tariffs and economic uncertainty. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2% for the third consecutive month, matching economists' expectations. While job growth was slightly weaker compared to previous months, the report suggests the labor market is holding up, with the health care and leisure and hospitality industries experiencing the largest gains. Experts caution that the economy could slow in the coming months, but the latest jobs report alleviates immediate concerns about an imminent recession. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Swiss government has proposed new capital regulations for UBS, requiring the bank to hold an additional $26 billion in core capital following its acquisition of Credit Suisse in 2023. These measures aim to stabilize UBS and may lead to fewer share buybacks and the full capitalization of its foreign units. While UBS supports most of the regulatory proposals in principle, it disagrees with the "extreme" increase in capital requirements, estimating that it would need to hold around $42 billion in additional CET1 capital in total. The bank intends to engage in consultations and evaluate measures to address the potential negative effects on its shareholders. (not investment advice)</p>
