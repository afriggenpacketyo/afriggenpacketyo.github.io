          <p>A New York Times article explores the science behind mRNA vaccines, their safety, and their potential in medicine, noting that these vaccines, crucial for combating COVID-19 and RSV, face political backlash and funding cuts despite their promise for treating cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and autoimmune disorders. Scientists discovered mRNA in 1961 and have been studying its potential ever since. The article highlights the vaccines' ability to quickly adapt to new virus strains, but also addresses concerns about long-term effects and potential impacts on DNA, clarifying that mRNA cannot alter a person's DNA. The article conveys cautious optimism, acknowledging the technology's potential while recognizing the challenges ahead.</p>

          <p>Amazon is expanding its online pharmacy to include prescription pet medications, adding hundreds of commonly prescribed medications to its U.S. site. Customers can purchase prescriptions through Amazon's storefront after veterinarian approval, with delivery typically within two to six days. Vetsource will oversee the dispensing and delivery of the medications. This move places Amazon in direct competition with online pet pharmacies like Chewy and Walmart.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses different types of bankruptcy and alternatives for managing debt, noting that no type of bankruptcy eliminates every debt. Chapter 7 bankruptcy offers the most comprehensive debt relief by eliminating many unsecured debts like credit cards and medical bills, but requires passing an income-based means test. Chapter 13 bankruptcy involves a structured repayment plan over three to five years, suitable for those with higher incomes or wanting to protect assets. Alternatives like debt consolidation, debt management, and debt settlement are also discussed as options to ease debt burdens without court filings.</p>
