Singh Johal previously worked under Kolo Toure and Cesc Fabregas, and recently completed his Uefa Pro Licence qualification. This move signals a new era for the club.</p>

          <p>The U.S. director of national intelligence claims the UK has withdrawn its controversial demand for Apple to provide a "back door" to global users' encrypted data, a move that had raised significant privacy concerns. Apple had previously refused, withdrawing its Advanced Data Protection from the UK market and initiating legal action. While the BBC understands Apple has not received formal communication, privacy campaigners cautiously welcome the news, emphasizing the ongoing risk posed by existing powers in the Investigatory Powers Act. This development is a partial victory for digital privacy advocates.</p>

          <p>The US Open's revamped mixed doubles event, featuring superstar pairings like Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu with significant prize money and a shorter format, has sparked considerable debate within the tennis community. While some praise it for attracting more fan attention and promoting the sport, others criticize it as a "glorified exhibition" that devalues a Grand Slam title and reduces opportunities for doubles specialists. Despite the divided opinions, top singles players express excitement, viewing it as competitive preparation. This innovative format is challenging traditional tennis norms.</p>

          <p>Sweden has commenced the monumental task of relocating the 113-year-old Kiruna Church, often voted the country's most beautiful building, approximately 5 kilometers to a new city center.
