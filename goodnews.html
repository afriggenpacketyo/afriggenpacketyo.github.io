          <p>Italians are voting in a referendum on loosening citizenship laws for immigrants, offering a chance to integrate long-term residents. The referendum aims to reduce the required residency period for citizenship applications, aligning Italy with other European countries. However, voter turnout is uncertain, and the outcome could significantly impact the rights and status of immigrants in Italy. The debate reflects broader European discussions on immigration and national identity. </p>

The REAL ID Act, passed in 2005, requires travelers to present REAL ID-compliant driver's licenses or state IDs.
