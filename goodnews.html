          <p>Walmart executives warned that despite reduced tariffs on China, the company may have to raise prices on certain items later in May or June of 2025. CEO Doug McMillon stated that higher tariffs will result in higher prices, despite efforts to control costs. The retailer also pulled its quarterly profit outlook amid global economic uncertainty, although it maintained its annual sales and profit forecast for fiscal 2026. Rising cost pressures from tariffs are impacting various markets, particularly China, which represents a significant volume in categories like electronics and toys.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher due to changes in the economy and policy. He noted that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon, citing the possibility of more volatile inflation and frequent supply shocks. Powell cautioned that policy changes could create a difficult balancing act between supporting employment and controlling inflation. He has also acknowledged the likelihood that tariffs will slow growth and boost inflation, although the extent of the impact is difficult to gauge.</p>

          <p>The UK economy is "beginning to turn a corner" after growing by more than expected in the first three months of the year, according to Chancellor Rachel Reeves. The 0.7% growth in the January-to-March period was "very encouraging," driven by increases in consumer spending and business investment. However, analysts warn that the strong rate of growth is unlikely to continue due to US import tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. The Labour government aims to boost the economy, but its policies face criticism from businesses and economists.</p>
