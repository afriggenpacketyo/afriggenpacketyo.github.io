          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order reinstating the presidential fitness test for schoolchildren, a program that was suspended 12 years ago. The test, which includes activities like a one-mile run and push-ups, aims to promote physical wellness and a culture of strength as part of the administration's health-focused initiatives. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will oversee the program, which historically granted awards to the top 15% of performers. The move aligns with the administration's goal to encourage active lifestyles among young Americans.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) reported second-quarter revenue of $30.87 billion, marking an 18% year-over-year increase and slightly beating analyst forecasts. While the cloud division remains a significant profit center for Amazon, its growth rate is currently slower than that of its main competitors, Microsoft and Google. The article notes that AWS continues to lead the cloud infrastructure market but faces intensifying pressure as all three tech giants heavily invest in artificial intelligence to capture booming demand. AWS now accounts for 18% of Amazon's total revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A study published in the journal Cell has revealed that the modern potato's ancestor is the tomato, with the potato evolving from it around 9 million years ago. Scientists solved this long-standing puzzle by discovering that a hybridization event between an ancient tomato and a wild, non-tuber-producing potato species led to the modern vegetable. The ancient tomato provided a crucial gene for tuber formation, while the wild potato species contributed a gene that controls stem growth. This research was based on the analysis of hundreds of potato genomes.</p>

While the market responded positively, some analysts expressed caution regarding the aggressive scale of Meta's spending on its new superintelligence labs, even as its core business remains strong enough to fund these ventures.

The administration is pushing for these companies to adopt a "most favored nation" pricing model, aligning U.S. costs with the lowest prices paid in other developed countries. Trump threatened to use every available tool to combat "abusive drug pricing practices" if the companies fail to comply, a move that caused pharmaceutical stocks to fall. This action represents the administration's latest effort to address high drug costs.</p>
