        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's National Health Service has launched a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a diagnosis if a patient's symptoms persist or worsen after three visits. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from advanced cancer in 2020 after her symptoms were repeatedly misdiagnosed as long Covid. This guidance aims to improve patient safety by encouraging doctors to order more tests, seek second opinions, or refer patients to specialists to prevent avoidable deaths from delayed diagnoses.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials have started drafting the country's 15th five-year plan, which will guide economic and social development from 2026 to 2030. This long-term planning is considered a key strategic tool for achieving ambitious goals, such as reaching the per capita GDP of a "moderately developed country" by 2035. As China navigates domestic challenges and global turbulence, experts suggest the new plan may need to prioritize flexible, qualitative goals over rigid quantitative targets to ensure stability and continued growth.

          <p>Disney, ABC's parent company, announced the return of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" nearly a week after suspending the show indefinitely. The suspension followed Kimmel's comments about the political response to the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which the network deemed "ill-timed and thus insensitive." The decision to reinstate the host came after conversations with Kimmel and significant public debate, including criticism of the suspension from free speech advocates and fellow late-night hosts.</p>

          <p>Deion Sanders confirmed that his son, quarterback Shedeur Sanders, turned down interest from the Baltimore Ravens and Philadelphia Eagles during the NFL draft before being selected by the Cleveland Browns. The decision was reportedly based on not wanting to be a long-term backup to established star quarterbacks Lamar Jackson and Jalen Hurts. Coach Prime supported his son's desire for a clearer path to playing time, stating that players are expected to be ready to perform immediately in the NFL rather than develop on the bench.</p>

          <p>A new study conducted in Rajasthan, India, has revealed that expanding forests can surprisingly lead to increased agricultural productivity. Researchers found that reforestation efforts resulted in a 24% rise in crop production over several years, particularly for rainfed crops. This challenges the traditional view that farmland must compete with forests for space, suggesting that the environmental benefits of reforestation, such as improved rainfall and pollinator activity, can create a synergistic relationship that boosts food security and aids conservation efforts.</p>
