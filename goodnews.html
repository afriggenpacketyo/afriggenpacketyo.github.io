While Labour faces scrutiny over child poverty plans, the Education Secretary stated that ministers are working quickly on next year's plans to further extend free school meals.

          <p>The UK's medicines regulator has warned women using weight-loss injections to use effective contraception, as it's unknown if the medicines could harm an unborn baby. Weight-loss jabs may reduce the effectiveness of the contraceptive pill, especially in overweight or obese women, due to side effects like vomiting and diarrhea. The MHRA advises women to use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward, and those using Mounjaro with oral contraceptives should use condoms for four weeks after starting the drug. The safety body emphasizes that these injections must not be taken during pregnancy, while trying to conceive, or during breastfeeding.</p>

The writers discuss what each team needs to do to win, with the Thunder needing to maintain their defensive intensity and the Pacers needing to protect the ball and get strong performances from their stars. They also debate whether having two small-market teams in the finals is a problem, with most arguing that it is not. Ultimately, the writers are split on who will win, with some predicting the Thunder in five games and others predicting the Pacers in seven.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the generational divide in views on sex and gender in Britain, noting that younger people are more likely to support transgender rights activism and disagree with the legal definition of "woman" being based on biological sex. The author suggests that this divide may be due to a cohort effect, where younger generations are more relaxed about sex and sexuality and committed to personal freedoms. However, the author argues that valuing inclusion over bodily privacy or fairness is sexist, as it disadvantages women, and sees the emphasis on individual self-definition as congruent with consumer capitalism.</p>
