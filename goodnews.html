          <h2>Chinese Scientists Identify Genetic Pathway That Could Enable Tissue Regeneration in Mammals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 09:00:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team in China has discovered a "genetic switch" that could potentially allow mammals to regenerate damaged tissue, a capability currently limited to animals like salamanders. Their study, published in the journal Science, found that mice fail to regenerate because they cannot produce enough retinoic acid, a key compound for tissue repair. By reactivating a dormant gene responsible for this process, the scientists successfully induced ear tissue regeneration in mice. This breakthrough identifies an evolutionarily disabled pathway and could have significant implications for advancing regenerative medicine in humans.</p>

          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell has stated that his team is in ongoing conversations with four-time world champion Max Verstappen regarding a potential move for the 2026 season. Verstappen is contracted with Red Bull until 2028, but break clauses in his contract could facilitate an early exit. The speculation arises as Red Bull has lost its dominant performance edge and key personnel, while Mercedes is believed to be ahead in developing its 2026 engine for the new regulations. Russell, whose own contract is up for renewal, expressed confidence in his position but acknowledged the team needs to decide on its two drivers for the future.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams officially launched his reelection bid, positioning himself as a blue-collar leader with a record of reducing crime and creating jobs. He framed the election as a choice between his practical achievements and the "empty promises" of his chief rival, Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani. Adams, who is now running as an independent after a tumultuous first term, criticized Mamdani's progressive platform, arguing against what he termed socialist policies. The announcement sets the stage for a competitive general election, with Adams emphasizing his experience against Mamdani's focus on the city's cost-of-living crisis.</p>

Under the agreement, China will review and approve export applications for controlled items, while the U.S. will lift a range of corresponding restrictive measures. This development follows high-level talks in London and aims to stabilize the tense economic relationship. While the announcement signals progress, analysts advise caution, noting a lack of specific details on which export curbs will be relaxed and viewing rare earths as a continuing bargaining chip.

The author suggests that Mamdani's success, achieved with a disciplined, progressive message focused on affordability and a motivated volunteer base, proves that the party's left flank is an asset, not a liability. While acknowledging the unique factors of the NYC race, the article frames the win as a rebuke to established leaders like Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries.

Unlike traditional computers using bits (ones and zeros), quantum computers use qubits, which leverage quantum mechanics to perform complex calculations at speeds unattainable by classical machines. While a useful, large-scale quantum computer may be years away, the technology holds immense promise for fields like materials science, drug discovery, and AI.

By the early 2000s, major chains began phasing them out. In their place, hotels are now focusing on more modern and profitable alternatives like 24/7 lobby marketplaces and strategic partnerships with food delivery apps such as DoorDash and Grubhub.

This formation in Quebec has long been a site of debate, with previous estimates of its age varying widely. In a new study published in Science, scientists used two different dating techniques on a new sample, and both methods yielded the same ancient age.

          <p>Karen Russell's new novel, "The Antidote," uses a fantastical premise in a Dust Bowl-era Nebraska town to explore the dangers of erasing collective and personal memory. The story centers on a "prairie witch" who stores painful memories for her neighbors, allowing them to live without guilt, particularly the guilt of having stolen land from Native Americans. The novel argues against the fantasy of shedding the past, suggesting that memories, both good and bad, must be kept in circulation for a society's health. Through its narrators, the book complicates traditional Dust Bowl narratives by focusing on the history of loss and injustice that preceded the environmental disaster.</p>
