          <p>Tesla has appointed Jack Hartung, a long-time Chipotle executive, to its board of directors, effective June 1, as the company faces sinking EV sales, eroding profits, and concerns about CEO Elon Musk's focus on other ventures like the Department of Government Efficiency. Hartung, known for his disciplined approach to Chipotle's finances, will join Tesla's audit committee, expanding the board to nine members. Musk has stated his time spent running DOGE will decrease significantly by the end of May, but he will still dedicate some time to his government work. </p>

          <h2>Strategies for Limiting Arsenic Exposure from Rice</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report indicates that rice brands sold across the United States contain high levels of toxic heavy metals like arsenic, but experts suggest ways to reduce exposure. Diversifying the diet with grains like quinoa and barley, which contain lower levels of heavy metals, is recommended. Consumers should also check labels for the rice's growing region, as rice grown in California has lower arsenic levels than rice grown in the Southeast U.S. Cooking rice like pasta, using more water and draining the excess, can also reduce arsenic content by 40% to 60%.</p>
