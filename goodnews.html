          <p>Best Buy reported revenue and earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations for its latest quarter, driven by strong customer response to sales events and growth in computing and gaming categories. Despite this recovery, CEO Corie Barry maintained the full-year forecast due to uncertainty surrounding potential tariff impacts on consumers and the business. The retailer is focusing on innovation, expanding its third-party marketplace, and enhancing in-store experiences to stimulate growth. Shares of Best Buy experienced a slight decline in early trading following the announcement.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's stock saw fluctuations following its latest earnings report, which highlighted robust demand for AI technologies but offered little clarity on its future in the Chinese market. The company reported a 56% surge in quarterly sales to $46.74 billion, slightly above analyst estimates, with adjusted earnings per share also topping expectations. CEO Jensen Huang emphasized the early stages of AI infrastructure build-out, projecting trillions in spending by the end of the decade, despite ongoing concerns about U.S. restrictions on chip sales to China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NBC plans to air special episodes of 'The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon' after 'Sunday Night Football' games this fall, aiming to attract new viewers from TV's top-rated program. This strategy follows a successful airing last season that garnered the show's best ratings of the year. The move comes as late-night television faces declining ratings and revenues in the streaming era, presenting an opportunity for 'Tonight' to capture audiences, especially with the departure of 'The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.' NBC remains committed to its late-night lineup, recognizing its value beyond ratings for promoting network properties.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a faster annual pace of 3.3% in the second quarter, an upward revision from the initial 3% estimate, following a contraction in the first three months of 2025. This growth was primarily driven by increased business investment and consumer spending, alongside a significant drop in imports after a first-quarter surge. While investment in AI is noted as a masking factor for underlying weaknesses, the overall economic picture for the first half of the year still shows a modest average growth rate. Concerns about a hiring slowdown persist, with investors anticipating potential interest rate cuts.</p>

Despite the injury and wholesale changes, the Red Roses, currently on a 28-game winning streak, are expected to perform strongly against the amateur Samoan team.

          <p>New York City is conducting its decennial Trees Count, a comprehensive census of its urban forest, with volunteers meticulously surveying and grading park trees. This year, the focus is on 150,000 landscaped park trees, complementing street tree data collected by Lidar scanners. The labor-intensive process, which involves identifying species, measuring trunks, and assessing health, helps inform the parks department's initiatives, including increasing canopy cover and mitigating heat burdens in underserved neighborhoods. The census also tracks the city's progress in expanding tree diversity, with 541 species logged on the current map compared to 70 in 1995.</p>

          <p>Jay Roach's 'The Roses' is a sharp, R-rated adult comedy that revisits the 1989 classic, starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman as Theo and Ivy Rose, a couple whose marriage dissolves into a hilarious battle over their California mansion. Scripted by Tony McNamara, the film uses brutal humor and relatable details of dissolution, like career pressures and childcare clashes, to explore their destructive dynamic. While the original satirized materialistic baby boomers, this version focuses on the characters' individual quests for success and their pitiful certainty of being in the moral right. Despite a hasty ending, the article praises the film for its wit and the performances, particularly Cumberbatch's comedic turn.</p>

          <h2>New Theory Places Parenting at the Core of Human Evolution and Language Origin</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 09:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book, 'The Origin of Language' by Madeleine Beekman, proposes that the intense prehistoric need for assistance in child-rearing was a primary catalyst for the development of human language. This theory shifts focus from male-dominated evolutionary narratives to emphasize familial care, arguing that vulnerable early human offspring necessitated new modes of cooperation and communication. Beekman traces biological changes in vocal cords and brain growth that made language possible, suggesting that the drive to express needs and coordinate care for infants gradually led to the complex structures of words, syntax, and grammar. The article highlights how this perspective underscores the collective nature of raising children throughout human history.</p>
