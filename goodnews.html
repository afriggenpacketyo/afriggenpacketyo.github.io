          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 15:08:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick clarified that the Trump administration's decision to allow Nvidia to resume selling AI chips to China involves only the company's "fourth best" technology. This strategic move aims to keep China reliant on the American technology ecosystem without providing access to top-tier chips used by U.S. companies. The resumed sale of the H20 chip, which is less powerful than Nvidia's premier models, is seen as a way to maintain a competitive edge while still profiting from the Chinese market. The policy reversal followed a meeting between President Trump and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple has entered into a $500 million agreement with MP Materials to procure rare earth magnets for its products, a move aimed at strengthening its U.S. supply chain. The deal, which caused MP Materials' stock to jump 22%, involves magnets produced at a new facility in Texas and collaboration on a recycling plant in California. This partnership aligns with broader U.S. efforts to reduce dependency on China for critical rare earth elements, which are vital for consumer electronics and other advanced technologies. MP Materials, which operates the only rare earth mine in the U.S., is expected to begin shipments in 2027. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An ancient Roman mosaic depicting an erotic scene, stolen from Pompeii by a Nazi captain during World War II, has been repatriated to the archaeological park. The artwork, dating to the first century, was returned by the heirs of a German citizen who had received it as a gift from the Wehrmacht officer. Italian and German authorities coordinated the return after the family contacted them to arrange its restitution. The mosaic, which likely decorated a bedroom, is considered a work of extraordinary cultural interest and its return is celebrated as the healing of a historical wound.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is taking urgent steps to bolster the U.S. supply chain for critical minerals and rare earth magnets to reduce dependence on China. Following a direct equity investment in MP Materials, the only U.S.-based rare earth miner, a defense official stated the department is actively seeking further opportunities to strengthen domestic production. These minerals are essential for advanced military technology, including F-35 fighter jets and drones. The move is part of a broader government strategy to onshore the production of materials vital for national security and compete with China's market dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Charles Collins and Brian Boles, who were convicted of a 1994 murder in Harlem as teenagers, have been exonerated after spending decades in prison. The Manhattan District Attorney's office reinvestigated the case and found that their confessions were coerced and contradicted by exculpatory evidence, including DNA that proved their innocence. Both men were questioned without an adult present and were lied to by police. Since its creation in 2022, the DA's Post-Conviction Justice Unit has vacated 13 cases, all involving minority men, prompting promises of reform to prevent future wrongful convictions.</p>
