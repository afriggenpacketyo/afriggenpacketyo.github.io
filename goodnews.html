        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns over an approaching tariff deadline, market analyst Jim Cramer argues that numerous positive factors are supporting the stock market. He points to strong corporate earnings, potential economic boosts from proposed tax cuts, and increased business spending on R&D as key drivers. Cramer also highlights major infrastructure needs for data centers and the electric grid, looser bank lending regulations, and a resurgence in the US energy sector as reasons for optimism, suggesting these elements could create a significant economic boom.

          <p>Shenzhen-based company SpinQ, founded in 2018, anticipates that quantum computing will cross a significant "usefulness" threshold within the next five years. The company currently produces small-scale educational quantum computers and more powerful industrial-grade superconducting models, which it sells to over 50 countries. SpinQ's founder, Xiang Jingen, compares the current state of quantum technology to the semiconductor industry in the 1950s, acknowledging that substantial development is still required before the technology achieves widespread, practical application. This indicates a key transitional phase for the emerging field.</p>

          <p>American golfer Scottie Scheffler won his first British Open at Royal Portrush, finishing with a dominant four-stroke lead over Harris English. This victory marks his fourth major championship, placing him in an elite group with Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, and Tiger Woods as the only players to win The Open, the Masters, and the PGA Championship before turning 30. The win is his eleventh on the PGA tour since 2024, further cementing his status as the world's number one golfer. He now needs only a U.S. Open victory to complete the coveted career Grand Slam.</p>

          <p>Officials in Texas have significantly reduced the number of people reported missing after the catastrophic Hill Country floods, from over 100 down to just three. The floods, which killed at least 135 people, prompted a massive search and rescue operation involving local, state, and federal authorities. Investigators diligently verified the status of many individuals who were initially unaccounted for, confirming they were safe. Recovery efforts are still ongoing along the Guadalupe River watershed, as the state legislature prepares a special session to address flood-related issues and improve warning systems.</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed a national inquiry will be held into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1984-85 miners' strike. The incident involved thousands of police officers and striking miners clashing outside a coking plant in Rotherham. The inquiry, chaired by the Bishop of Sheffield, will examine the events of the day and their aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of 95 miners based on what Home Secretary Yvette Cooper called "discredited evidence." Campaigners, who have sought an inquiry for years, expressed cautious elation at the long-awaited decision.</p>

          <p>The artisanal Mexican spirit mezcal is experiencing a surge in global popularity, emerging from the shadow of its cousin, tequila. This boom has transformed the fortunes of many family-owned distilleries in Oaxaca, the heart of mezcal production. The report highlights the story of the Hernandez brothers, fourth-generation mezcaleros who, after migrating to the U.S. for work, returned to expand their traditional, handcrafted production. Their partnership with the brand Ilegal, now acquired by Bacardi, illustrates how the spirit's rise from a local drink to a premium global product is benefiting local communities.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler's recent victory at The Open has solidified his status as the most dominant force in men's golf since Tiger Woods' prime. This article analyzes his rapid ascent, noting he has won four majors and 13 PGA Tour titles in the last four seasons. Peers and commentators draw parallels to Woods, citing Scheffler's machine-like consistency and ability to close out tournaments from a leading position. His success is attributed to a combination of his calm demeanor, unorthodox but effective technique, and a significant improvement in his putting after working with English coach Phil Kenyon.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Argues 'Self-Connection' is the Most Crucial Skill for Children's Success</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 18:05:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection—the ability to understand their own emotions and needs. The article argues that this skill builds emotional resilience, fosters healthy boundaries, and protects mental health by grounding a child's confidence in their own sense of self-worth. Parents are advised to foster this by validating their child's feelings, avoiding micromanagement, and modeling their own emotional awareness. These small shifts help children trust their inner voice, leading to more authentic confidence in adulthood.</p>

          <p>Tech entrepreneur Adam Miller has launched Better Angels, a nonprofit aiming to prove that affordable housing for the homeless can be built profitably without taxpayer money. The initiative uses a $300 million investment fund to provide upfront capital, bypassing the slow and costly process of securing government tax credits and grants. Better Angels is bidding on several large projects in the Los Angeles area, proposing to build hundreds of units faster and at a fraction of the typical cost. While the rents will be higher than in subsidized projects, the model aims to attract private capital to address the housing crisis.</p>
