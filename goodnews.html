          <p>China has initiated the construction of the world's largest hydropower project on the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet, a massive undertaking with an estimated investment of $167 billion. The project, which will have five times the investment of the Three Gorges Dam, is expected to generate 300,000 gigawatt-hours of electricity annually. The announcement triggered a significant surge in the stock prices of related Chinese infrastructure and hydropower companies, such as Power Construction Corporation of China.

          <p>Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is scheduled to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House to strengthen security and economic relations amid rising tensions with China. The talks are expected to address China's assertiveness in the South China Sea and a potential bilateral trade deal to avert Trump's threatened 20% tariffs on Filipino goods. Marcos has expressed readiness to negotiate, with Manila even considering zero tariffs on some U.S. products to secure an agreement. The meeting underscores the strategic importance of the U.S.-Philippines alliance in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>The push to develop solid-state batteries for electric vehicles is gaining new momentum, with major automakers like Volkswagen, Nissan, and Toyota targeting commercial production by 2027-2028. These batteries promise higher energy density and improved safety over conventional lithium-ion cells, potentially revolutionizing the EV market. However, some experts express skepticism, citing persistent technological hurdles, high costs, and significant advancements in existing battery technologies that are narrowing the performance gap. The industry remains divided on whether this "holy grail" technology will overcome its challenges to achieve mass adoption.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Minnesota Twins 5-2, relying on power hitting to overcome a generally sluggish offensive performance. Shohei Ohtani hit a two-run homer in the first inning, and Will Smith added two solo home runs, providing the bulk of the team's runs. Despite the win, concerns remain about the team's recent offensive struggles, though the four total home runs marked a positive development. The victory was somewhat marred by an injury to closer Tanner Scott, who left the game with a forearm issue.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to name the first individuals and companies targeted by new sanctions aimed at disrupting people-smuggling operations across the English Channel. This financial action, a key part of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's immigration policy, will freeze assets and impose travel bans on those involved in the illegal crossings. The move targets gang leaders, suppliers of equipment like small boats, and financial middlemen. The announcement comes amid growing pressure on the government to address the rising number of migrants arriving in the UK via small boats.</p>

          <h2>Balkan Author Laments Western Publishers' Preference for Stories of Regional Trauma</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 00:00:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a personal essay, writer Ana Schnabl from the Balkans critiques the Western publishing industry for its narrow expectations of authors from her region. She recounts being advised by a US publisher to focus on themes of cultural or historical trauma, suggesting that stories from the Balkans are primarily valued for their ability to explain the region's tragic past to foreign audiences. Schnabl argues this creates a restrictive environment where writers are expected to self-exoticize and produce narratives of victimhood. She calls for publishers to embrace a wider diversity of stories that challenge these stereotypes and reflect the region's full complexity.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced significant modifications to the compensation scheme for victims of the infected blood scandal, aiming to restore trust after widespread criticism. Following a damning report by the inquiry chair, the Cabinet Office confirmed changes, including allowing payments to be passed on to the estates of family members who die before their claim is settled. The government will also consult on better recognizing the impacts of certain treatments and severe psychological harm. While victims' groups cautiously welcomed the news, they expressed disappointment that some key issues remain under consultation.</p>

          <p>The UK government has signed a deal with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, to explore the use of artificial intelligence in public services like education, defense, and the justice system. The memorandum of understanding aims to improve productivity and economic growth, but also involves developing safeguards to manage security risks and uphold democratic values. While the government touts the potential for innovation, the deal has drawn criticism from campaigners concerned about issues like the unlicensed use of creative works to train AI models.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that while widely criticized, Donald Trump's universal tariffs have a potential silver lining by exposing the self-defeating internal trade barriers within other countries and trading blocs. Nations like Canada, China, and those in the European Union are being forced to confront their own protectionist policies and regulatory hurdles that hinder economic growth. The pressure from U.S. tariffs has reportedly spurred significant movement toward creating more unified domestic markets in Canada and China. The piece suggests this external shock could be a catalyst for long-overdue internal economic reforms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Officials in Texas have successfully accounted for most of the more than 160 people reported missing after the deadly Fourth of July floods along the Guadalupe River. The majority of those reported missing were tourists who had safely returned home without checking in, leading to a sharp revision in the numbers. After an exhaustive effort, only three individuals remain unaccounted for in the hardest-hit Kerr County. The flash floods killed at least 135 people in the state, with the rapid and destructive rise of the river catching many campers and residents off guard.</p>
