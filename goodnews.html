          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is gaining traction among wealthy investors, allowing them to convert appreciated assets into shares of new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to defer capital gains taxes. This method, which requires the contributed portfolio to meet specific diversification rules, seeds an ETF before its launch. While it offers significant tax advantages by rebalancing assets without incurring immediate gains, financial advisors caution that it can also limit an investor's future options, as their capital becomes tied to the specific ETF. Minimum investment thresholds for such conversions are typically high, often starting at $1 million. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Super Bowl champion Chris Canty has publicly expressed skepticism about quarterback Aaron Rodgers' ability to succeed with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Canty described the notion of Rodgers returning to his MVP form as a "hoax," citing the quarterback's age and recent injury history as significant concerns. He pointed to the Steelers' issues with their offensive line and the recent loss of a key running back as further challenges that will hinder Rodgers' performance. Canty also questioned Rodgers' commitment to the team, suggesting his recent comments about his future were self-serving rather than focused on winning a championship.</p>

          <p>Bad Bunny's sold-out concert residency in Puerto Rico has created a surge in business for local tattoo artists, as both residents and tourists seek permanent souvenirs inspired by his new album. Artists are using the increased demand as an opportunity to educate clients, particularly non-Puerto Ricans, about the cultural significance of popular designs like the maga flower and the coquí frog. This boom provides a vital economic boost during a typically slow season and allows artists to share the island's heritage. For many local business owners, it's a chance to foster a deeper respect for Puerto Rican culture amid challenging economic times.</p>

          <p>Actress Kirsten Dunst has stated her desire to appear in a sequel to the blockbuster film "A Minecraft Movie," joking that she would like to make a movie where she doesn't lose money and can earn a "pile of cash." Dunst, a veteran actress since childhood, recently starred in the critically and commercially successful film "Civil War," which became A24's second-highest-grossing movie. However, its earnings are dwarfed by the massive global success of "A Minecraft Movie," which grossed over $955 million worldwide. Dunst has several other projects lined up, including films with directors Ruben Östlund and Sofia Coppola.</p>

          <h2>Protests at Los Angeles Hotels Prompted U.S. Military to Create 'Avoid' List for ICE Agents</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 16:52:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newly released public records reveal that protests targeting hotels housing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Los Angeles successfully disrupted federal immigration operations. In response to activists staging "No sleep for Ice" rallies, U.S. military officials compiled a list of "LA Hotels to Avoid" to prevent personnel from being "harassed." The documents, obtained by a government transparency group, show that the U.S. Marines sought similar information for the San Diego area. Activists involved in the demonstrations view the records as confirmation that their strategy of pressuring hotels was effective in making operations more difficult for federal agents.</p>

          <h2>DEA Considers Easing Federal Restrictions on Psilocybin</h2>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is considering a petition from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to potentially ease federal restrictions on psilocybin, the active compound in psychedelic mushrooms. The DEA is reviewing whether to move psilocybin from a highly restrictive Schedule I narcotic to a less restrictive Schedule II classification, which acknowledges medical value despite potential for abuse. This move follows a long legal battle by a Seattle doctor seeking to use the substance for end-of-life care. While a growing body of research suggests psilocybin's benefits for mental health, some experts urge caution pending more rigorous studies.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 15:43:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As U.S. credit card debt surpasses $1.2 trillion and delinquency rates rise, some consumers are exploring debt forgiveness programs. Typically, candidates who qualify for this form of relief have substantial unsecured debts, often over $7,500, and are facing verifiable financial hardship, such as job loss or a medical emergency. Borrowers who are already behind on their payments are also more likely to be considered, as creditors become more willing to negotiate a settlement to avoid a total loss. While debt forgiveness can provide a path out of overwhelming debt, it can also negatively impact a person's credit score. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York state appeals court has overturned the massive monetary fine, which had grown to over $500 million, previously imposed on President Donald Trump and his company for civil business fraud. The court ruled that the penalty violated the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment prohibition against "excessive fines." However, the ruling upheld the original finding that Trump and other defendants committed fraud by overstating asset values to secure favorable financial terms. The nonmonetary sanctions imposed by the lower court, designed to curb the company's business practices, will also remain in place.</p>

          <p>New research indicates a growing trend of adults ordering from children's menus at restaurants, with 44% of those surveyed citing cost savings and smaller portions as their main motivations. This shift in consumer behavior comes as some diners cut back on eating out due to economic pressures, as reflected in recent sluggish sales reports from major fast-food chains. The simpler options and lower price points of kids' meals are proving to be an attractive alternative for budget-conscious adults. This trend highlights how consumers are adapting their spending habits in response to the current economic climate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The rapid growth of data centers, driven by artificial intelligence and other technologies, is creating a soaring demand for skilled trade workers like electricians and HVAC technicians. However, the supply of these workers is shrinking as older generations retire and fewer young people enter the trades, leading to hundreds of thousands of unfilled jobs. This labor shortage poses a significant challenge for industries competing for this talent, from data centers to manufacturing plants. To address the gap, some companies are turning to new technologies for efficiency, while trade unions are increasing recruitment efforts for apprenticeship programs.</p>

The facility, which took five years to build, is opening as the Trump administration threatens tariffs to encourage domestic manufacturing. While many pharmaceutical companies are expanding their U.S. footprint, the complex and lengthy process of building and getting regulatory approval for such facilities makes it difficult to quickly shift supply chains. This reality complicates the goal of rapidly outrunning potential tariffs on imported medicines and their components.</p>
