          <p>Brentford Football Club has turned down an improved offer from Manchester United for forward Bryan Mbeumo, valued at ¬£55 million plus ¬£7.5 million in add-ons. This is the second rejected bid from United, who are actively seeking to enhance their offensive capabilities after signing Matheus Cunha. Brentford is reportedly seeking a fee comparable to the ¬£62.5 million Wolves received for Cunha. Mbeumo, who scored 20 goals last season, has also attracted interest from other top clubs, including Tottenham. The 25-year-old Cameroonian international still has a year remaining on his contract with the west London club.</p>

          <p>The J.M. Smucker Co. has announced its commitment to remove artificial colors from all its products, including jams and ice cream toppings, by the end of 2027. This policy will also apply to foods sold to K-12 schools, with a target date of the 2026-2027 school year. The move includes products from its recently acquired Hostess brand, such as Twinkies and Snoballs, which currently use synthetic dyes like Red 40 and Yellow 5. Smucker's decision aligns with a growing industry trend, as other major food companies like Nestle, Conagra, Kraft Heinz, and General Mills have made similar pledges amid increased federal scrutiny of artificial food additives.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California legislators have approved a significant expansion of the state's film and television tax credit program, more than doubling its annual allocation from $330 million to $750 million. The move is a major victory for Hollywood studios, unions, and workers who have been lobbying for state support to remain competitive against other locations offering generous incentives. Governor Gavin Newsom and industry leaders argued the increase is crucial to bring productions back to California and revitalize the local industry, which has faced challenges from strikes and productions moving elsewhere. A related bill aims to broaden eligibility and increase credit percentages to further bolster the state's competitiveness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The S&P 500 index reached a new all-time closing high of 6,173, continuing a strong upward trend despite ongoing concerns about new tariffs and conflict in the Middle East. Investor optimism appears to be fueled by a rollback of some steep levies and signs of continued economic health, such as sturdy hiring and manageable inflation. Although the market briefly dipped following President Trump's announcement to end trade talks with Canada, it quickly recovered. This surge marks a significant rebound, with the S&P 500 climbing over 20% since a low point in April, demonstrating resilience in the face of policy uncertainty and global events.</p>

          <p>Two decades after its debut, the cult-classic comedy series "The Comeback" is set to return for a third and final season on HBO, expected in 2026. The show, created by and starring Lisa Kudrow, follows the journey of washed-up sitcom actress Valerie Cherish as she navigates a return to the entertainment industry. After being canceled following its first season in 2005, it was revived for a second season in 2014 and has since garnered critical acclaim. Kudrow and co-creator Michael Patrick King stated that Valerie Cherish has "found her way back to the current television landscape," with most of the original cast expected to return for the final chapter.</p>

          <p>The UK government has softened its travel advice for Israel, shifting from a warning against all travel to advising against all but essential travel for most of the country. This change follows a ceasefire that ended a 12-day conflict with Iran and the subsequent reopening of Israeli airspace to commercial flights. The Foreign Office announced that a final evacuation flight for British nationals is scheduled for the weekend, as commercial travel options have become more available. The advisory still cautions against all travel to specific high-risk areas, including Gaza and parts of the West Bank, acknowledging the situation remains fragile despite the current ceasefire.</p>

          <p>The new independent film "Ponyboi," written by and starring River Gallo, offers a narrative centered on an intersex, Latine sex worker in New Jersey seeking to escape a life of crime. The film, which evolved from Gallo's short film of the same name, is the first to be produced under Fox Entertainment Studios' indie label, Tideline. Gallo, who is intersex and of Salvadoran descent, uses the story to explore themes of identity, acceptance, and freedom from a deeply personal perspective. The film aims to bring visibility to the intersex community, whose stories are often invisible in mainstream culture and who are affected by anti-trans legislation that enables nonconsensual medical procedures.</p>

          <p>Coinbase has become the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for the month of June, with its value increasing by 43%. The surge is attributed to its recent inclusion in the benchmark index, positive regulatory developments like the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, and new product launches. Analysts suggest the stock may have further growth potential, citing its strong revenue-sharing relationship with Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin. The crypto exchange's expansion into services beyond trading, such as custody and stablecoin payments, is seen as a key factor in its success, positioning it as a primary investment vehicle for the evolving crypto industry.

At a recent shareholder meeting, CEO Jensen Huang identified robotics as the next major opportunity for the company after artificial intelligence.

The man, who was also in possession of an unlicensed handgun, claimed to have previously worked for CBP, though his status could not be confirmed. The arrest occurs amid heightened community concern over the tactics of federal agents, including the use of unmarked clothing and face coverings, which has prompted local and state lawmakers to propose new identification requirements for law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has curtailed the use of universal injunctions, a legal tool that allows a single federal judge to block a government policy nationwide. The 6-3 decision, which arose from challenges to President Trump's birthright citizenship order, stated that such broad injunctions likely exceed the authority granted to federal courts by Congress. This article explains that while the ruling is a victory for the Trump administration, it does not end legal challenges to executive actions. Instead, it is expected to shift the legal battleground towards other mechanisms like class-action lawsuits and state-led suits to achieve widespread relief against federal policies.</p>

China had previously restricted exports of these critical minerals, which are essential for numerous industries including automotive, aerospace, and defense, causing significant supply chain disruptions.
