          <p>AI company Anthropic has agreed to a $1.5 billion settlement in a class-action lawsuit brought by authors who alleged their books were used without permission to train the AI model Claude. The settlement, which awaits judicial approval, could provide around $3,000 for each of the estimated 500,000 books involved. This case is considered a significant precedent in the ongoing legal battles between creative industries and AI firms over the use of copyrighted material for training large language models. The ruling distinguished between legally obtained works and those from pirated sources.</p>

Now the oldest member of the band by over four decades, he passed the same standards as his much younger peers without any special consideration.

          <p>Tesla's board has proposed a new compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could be worth approximately $900 billion, potentially making him the world's first trillionaire. The package is contingent on the company achieving ambitious goals over the next decade, including increasing its market value to $8.5 trillion and meeting production targets for Robotaxis and humanoid robots. This proposal, which requires shareholder approval, aims to ensure Musk's long-term focus on Tesla and follows a previous $50 billion pay package that was voided by a Delaware court.

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's attempt to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan and Haitian migrants is unlawful. District Judge Edward Chen's decision sets aside the Department of Homeland Security's move, allowing approximately 1.1 million migrants to continue living and working legally in the U.S. The judge stated the revocation of their status was unprecedented and violated the law, given the dangerous conditions in their home countries. The DHS has indicated it will likely appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>California has joined the Northwest Wildland Fire Fighting Compact, a collaborative agreement with 12 other U.S. states and Canadian provinces to share resources and technology for wildfire prevention and suppression. This move comes as California faces increasingly severe fire seasons due to climate change and perceived cuts to federal firefighting entities like the U.S. Forest Service. Governor Gavin Newsom stated that joining forces will make the collective more effective in protecting communities, allowing for faster and more efficient responses to major incidents that exceed a single jurisdiction's capacity.</p>

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot grows to $1.8 billion, a new analysis reveals significant state-by-state differences in lottery spending. Massachusetts residents spend the most, averaging $915 per year, followed by Rhode Island at $573. In contrast, North Dakotans spend the least, at just $50 annually, a difference partly attributed to accessibility in urban versus rural areas. Lottery sales constitute a notable portion of state revenue, averaging about 1% but reaching as high as 3% in some states, highlighting the financial significance of these games for government budgets.</p>

          <p>A new draft of a major Senate crypto bill includes a provision to ensure that tokenized stocks and other traditional securities are not regulated as commodities. This update to the Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025 aims to clarify the regulatory jurisdictions of the SEC and the CFTC for digital assets. Senator Cynthia Lummis expressed hope that the bill will reach the president's desk by the end of the year, following the passage of a separate stablecoin bill. The legislation is seen as crucial for providing regulatory clarity to crypto companies like Coinbase and Ripple. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot at an estimated $1.8 billion, winners face a critical choice between a lump sum payment or a 30-year annuity. A certified public accountant advises that while the lump sum offers investment control, it can be 'dangerous' for those unaccustomed to managing vast wealth, as many past winners have gone broke. The annuity option is presented as a safer bet that makes it more difficult to overspend quickly. The first recommended steps for a winner are to remain anonymous, sign the ticket, and assemble a team of legal, financial, and accounting professionals before making any decisions.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made a last-minute change to their pitching rotation, scratching scheduled starter Tyler Glasnow due to back tightness. Two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani offered to take the mound on short notice, just two days after his own planned start was postponed because of an illness. Manager Dave Roberts praised Ohtani's willingness to step up for the team, which is hoping to rebound from a recent series sweep. The team is optimistic that Glasnow's back issue is not serious and hopes he can return to pitch early next week.</p>
