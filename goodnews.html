        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney has responded to comments from his ex-teammate Steven Gerrard, who described their "golden generation" of players as "egotistical losers." Speaking on his podcast, Rooney disagreed with the characterization, stating that while the team had big personalities, they worked hard and simply "didn't quite manage to get over the line." He suggested that current England squads benefit from a different media environment and closer relationships between players from rival clubs, rather than a superior attitude.</p>

          <p>Rhun ap Iorwerth, the leader of Plaid Cymru, is set to declare at his party's annual conference that they are prepared to replace the long-governing Welsh Labour party. He will argue that his party can offer a "new government, with new energy and new ideas," positioning Plaid Cymru as the primary vehicle for change and the main alternative to the rising influence of Reform UK. This move signals a strategic shift to present the party not just as a partner or critic of Labour, but as a credible government-in-waiting ahead of the next Senedd election.</p>

The Prince's Royal Foundation is contributing £1 million to launch a new National Suicide Prevention Network across the UK, aimed at better understanding the root causes of suicide and supporting those affected. The initiative will bring together 20 organizations to foster a more unified and collaborative national response to what he described as a "preventable tragedy."</p>

          <p>A woman whose body was discovered on a beach in the Netherlands 21 years ago has been identified as Eva Maria Pommer, a 35-year-old German citizen. Her identification is the fourth success for "Operation Identify Me," an international police campaign launched in 2023 to name deceased women in unsolved cases across Europe. The breakthrough came after a crucial tip was received following a television appeal in Germany, leading investigators to confirm her identity through DNA testing, though the cause of her death remains under investigation.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Discover Method to Generate Electricity by Bending Salt-Doped Ice</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 00:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of scientists from China and Spain has found that adding salt to ice allows it to generate a significant electrical charge when bent or subjected to non-uniform strain. This phenomenon, known as flexoelectricity, produced an electrical response in the saline ice comparable to that of specialized ceramic materials. The researchers have already fabricated devices using this principle, demonstrating its potential as a low-cost, clean energy source for applications in extremely cold environments where traditional power generation is challenging.</p>

          <p>A judge has dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG) over Kendrick Lamar's diss track, "Not Like Us." The judge ruled that the song's lyrics, which accused Drake of serious misconduct, constituted "nonactionable opinion" within the context of a highly publicized rap battle and would not be taken as verifiable facts by a reasonable listener. Drake had sued UMG, the label for both artists, for allowing the song's publication, but the court's decision protects the track as a form of creative expression, with Drake's spokesperson indicating plans to appeal.</p>

          <p>China's top economic planning agency and market regulator have jointly issued new guidelines to address destructive price wars in key industries. The policy aims to limit "disorderly competition," which officials state is detrimental to innovation, product quality, and the overall health of the economy. Under the new rules, authorities will guide industry associations in establishing reasonable prices based on average production costs and will intervene with cost investigations and price inspections when necessary to maintain market order.</p>

Mills, who is term-limited as governor, is considered a top recruit for Democrats, who see the Maine contest as a rare opportunity to flip a Republican-held seat and contest the GOP's Senate majority.</p>

Despite the huge financial gamble and recent news of EA's sale to a Saudi-led group, the development team is focused on delivering a high-quality experience to avoid disappointing its community.</p>
