          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of a medium-security state prison in Norco by fall 2026. This decision is driven by a significant decline in the state's inmate population and is expected to save California approximately $150 million annually. The facility, which houses nearly 3,000 inmates and employs 1,200 staff, will see inmates transferred and employees offered positions elsewhere. The site, which was originally a luxury resort in the 1920s, may be repurposed, with local officials hoping to restore the historic property to its former glory.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion in FEMA funds intended for disaster mitigation projects. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The judge found that redirecting the funds could cause "irreparable harm" to communities vulnerable to natural disasters like floods. The injunction prevents the government from repurposing the money while the court fully considers the case, protecting critical funding for infrastructure projects designed to save lives.</p>

          <p>After a 17-year delay, work on the Mes Aynak copper mine in Afghanistan, backed by a state-owned Chinese company, is reportedly gaining momentum. The China Metallurgical Group Corporation announced significant progress and readiness to begin extraction this year from one of the world's largest untapped copper deposits. The project, awarded in 2008, was stalled by security issues, the presence of ancient archaeological sites, and landmines. The Taliban-led government has since approved a switch to underground mining, a more expensive method intended to better protect the historical relics at the site.</p>

          <p>Ten years after their debut appearance, K-pop group Monsta X returned to the KCON festival in Los Angeles as headliners, marking a significant milestone in their career. The group's members reflected on their journey, the challenges of maintaining health, and their reunion after a two-year break for mandatory military service. Their return is notable in an industry where many groups disband, proving their endurance and strong connection with their dedicated fanbase. With a new album on the horizon, Monsta X's continued success highlights a shift in K-pop, where veteran groups are finding long-term global relevance.</p>

The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, shows a significant 4.5% drop in violent crime, including a 14.9% decrease in murder. Property crimes also fell by 8.1%, with a notable 18.6% reduction in motor vehicle thefts. This continues a downward trend from the spike seen after the COVID-19 pandemic, with rates for many serious crimes now falling below pre-pandemic levels, though aggravated assaults remain somewhat elevated.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has passed a new ordinance requiring landlords in unincorporated areas to maintain indoor temperatures at or below 82 degrees in their rental units. The law, which aims to protect vulnerable tenants from the increasing danger of extreme heat waves, will take effect next month but won't be enforced until 2027. Officials are encouraging landlords to use "passive" cooling methods like reflective roofing and blackout curtains in addition to air conditioning. The measure reflects a growing trend in local governments to address the public health impacts of climate change through housing regulations.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers are bringing back one of their franchise's most productive players, signing veteran wide receiver Keenan Allen to a one-year contract. Allen, who spent 11 seasons with the team before being traded to Chicago last year in a salary-cap move, returns to bolster a receiving corps in need of experience. The 33-year-old, a six-time Pro Bowl selection, is second on the Chargers' all-time receiving yards list. His return aims to provide a reliable target for quarterback Justin Herbert and add veteran leadership to a young group of receivers.</p>

          <p>In a surprising move, the Cleveland Browns have announced that rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders will start their first preseason game against the Carolina Panthers. Sanders, the son of Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, was listed as fourth on the depth chart just a day earlier. The decision comes as the team's other quarterbacks are dealing with injuries, and veteran Joe Flacco is not expected to play much in the preseason. This gives the fifth-round draft pick a significant opportunity to prove himself and compete for a roster spot after a prolific college career.</p>

          <p>New Jersey has reached a landmark $2 billion settlement with DuPont and its affiliates to resolve claims related to "forever chemicals" (PFAS) and other pollutants. State officials called it the largest single-state environmental settlement in U.S. history. The agreement requires the companies to pay for natural resource damages and fund the cleanup of contamination at four major industrial sites. The deal stems from a 2019 lawsuit and holds the chemical manufacturers accountable for decades of pollution, ensuring taxpayers are not left with the cleanup costs.</p>
