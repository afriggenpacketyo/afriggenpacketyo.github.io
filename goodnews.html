          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has fully sold its highly profitable stake in the Chinese electric vehicle company BYD, which it first purchased in 2008. The investment, originally championed by the late Charlie Munger, saw its value increase by approximately 3,890% over the years Berkshire held the stock. While Buffett praised BYD as an "extraordinary company," the divestment follows a pattern of reducing exposure to geopolitical risks associated with China, similar to the firm's earlier sale of its Taiwan Semiconductor stake.

          <p>In response to a fracturing national public health landscape, seven northeastern states and New York City have formed the Northeast Public Health Collaborative. This alliance, similar to one on the West Coast, aims to create unified health guidance on issues like vaccinations as federal recommendations become increasingly variable and politically contentious. The move reflects a growing trend of states taking the lead to ensure consistent, evidence-based health policies for their residents, creating a potential patchwork of regulations across the country.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that genuine strength and resilience are not defined by the absence of emotion, but by the ability to understand and control one's feelings. The author contends that suppressing emotions like anger and fear makes individuals brittle, whereas acknowledging and processing them leads to greater self-control and perseverance. Using psychological research and a tool called the "Change Triangle," the article advocates for emotional education as a means to fortify the human spirit and achieve personal and collective goals.</p>

          <p>The United States recently conducted a significant trilateral military exercise, named Freedom Edge, with allies Japan and South Korea, notably without the presence of a U.S. aircraft carrier. This departure from previous drills has prompted analysis, with some experts suggesting it could be a move to de-escalate tensions and improve diplomatic dealings with China and North Korea. Others interpret it as a signal of the Trump administration's strategy to encourage greater defense contributions from its Asian allies in the region.</p>

          <p>A growing number of LGBTQ+ individuals are running for political office across the United States, motivated by what they see as increasing attacks on their rights and threats to democracy. Organizations that train queer candidates, like the LGBTQ+ Victory Institute, report a significant surge in interest from people wanting to run for local, state, and federal positions. These candidates, from both Democratic and Republican parties, are stepping up not only to counter anti-LGBTQ+ policies but also to advocate for broader issues important to their communities.</p>

          <h2>Experts Advocate for Including Fertility and Reproduction Education in Sex Ed Curriculums</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 08:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health experts and reproductive endocrinologists are calling for sex education to include comprehensive information about fertility, not just pregnancy prevention. Many patients are reportedly ill-informed about their own reproductive biology, including the impact of age on fertility, ovulation cycles, and the effectiveness of treatments like IVF. Proponents argue that teaching these topics in school could empower individuals to make more informed decisions about family planning later in life, potentially reducing misconceptions and helping more people achieve their desired family size.</p>

          <p>Kenyan athletes dominated the 51st Berlin Marathon, with Sabastian Sawe winning the men's race and Rosemary Wanjiru taking first place in the women's event. Sawe finished with a time of 2:02:15, while Wanjiru completed the course in 2:21:05. Despite Berlin's reputation as a fast course, the winning times were off world-record pace, likely due to unusually warm and humid late-summer conditions in the German capital, which challenged the more than 55,000 participants.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean and is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British scientists are employing a high-tech strategy to fight the spread of invasive Asian hornets, which prey on vital pollinators like honeybees. By attaching tiny tracking devices to captured hornets, response teams can follow them directly back to their nests, allowing for rapid location and destruction within an hour. This method is crucial for controlling the population of the invasive species, as public sightings reported through the "Asian Hornet Watch" app continue to rise, helping to prevent the hornets from becoming permanently established in the UK.</p>
