          <h2>UBS Reports Strong Second-Quarter Profit Driven by Trading Volatility</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 02:32:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Swiss banking giant UBS significantly surpassed profit expectations in the second quarter, reporting $2.395 billion in net profit, primarily driven by robust performance in its investment bank and global wealth management divisions. The bank's revenues reached $12.112 billion, slightly below analyst forecasts, but were boosted by exceptional market volatility. CEO Sergio Ermotti noted a continued cautious "wait-and-see" attitude among clients, tempering overall activity despite recent equity market gains. UBS is also managing the ongoing integration of Credit Suisse, with one-third of Swiss client accounts migrated, and is actively lobbying against proposed stricter capital rules in Switzerland, which it estimates would require an additional $42 billion in core capital.

This highly anticipated plenum, involving over 370 Central Committee members, will set the national blueprint following a public online consultation initiated by President Xi Jinping in May. The plan's formulation occurs amidst continued trade and tech rivalry with the United States, highlighting persistent external uncertainties for China's economic outlook.

          <h2>California Coastal Residents React with Mix of Concern and Calm to Tsunami Advisory</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 01:36:39 EDT</div>

          <p>Following a massive earthquake off Russia, California's coastal residents reacted with a mix of concern, curiosity, and calm to tsunami alerts. While Southern California anticipated modest waves, far-northern California, particularly Crescent City, expected larger impacts, prompting local authorities to urge caution. The article highlights varied responses, from unaware tourists to blasé locals in historically vulnerable areas, many of whom have experienced previous alerts. Despite official warnings to stay off beaches, some beachgoers remained undisturbed, reflecting a sense of routine or confidence in minimal impact. The situation prompted reflection on preparedness, even as many expressed optimism that the worst would not materialize in their immediate vicinity.</p>

          <p>Maro Itoje has cemented his place as a British and Irish Lions legend by captaining the team to a series win, joining an elite group of just five victorious captains. Willie John McBride, the oldest surviving captain from the 1974 tour, praised Itoje's achievement, acknowledging the immense difficulty of winning a series in the southern hemisphere. Itoje, a thoughtful and durable player known for his philanthropic work and advocacy, expressed deep gratitude for the honor, emphasizing the unique bond forged within the diverse Lions squad. With one more match to potentially achieve an unbeaten tour, Itoje aims to deliver a performance that lives long in the memory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FTSE-100 has shown strong performance this year, hitting record highs and outperforming major global indices like the S&P 500, driven by factors such as relief over U.S. tariff deals and investor money moving outside the U.S. However, this article argues that the Footsie's strength does not necessarily reflect the UK economy's health. The index is now heavily weighted towards international companies that derive most of their earnings overseas, often in U.S. dollars and euros. This globalized nature means the index's performance is more indicative of global economic trends and currency fluctuations than the true state of domestic corporate Britain.

This result complicates both teams' chances of advancing in the tournament, as Mazatlán gained two points for the shootout win, while LAFC secured one.

          <p>Shenzhen, China's tech hub, plans to introduce stricter supervisory mechanisms for its pilot personal bankruptcy scheme, aiming to curb "debt evasion." Starting in October, debtors' bankruptcy information will be publicly disclosed for up to eight years once debts are discharged. Since its launch in March 2021, over 500 cases have been processed, totaling 193 million yuan in debt restructuring, liquidation, and reconciliation. However, no individual has yet had their debts fully discharged. Legal experts note the slow pace and advocate for bolder reforms to offer genuine second chances, especially for small business owners, amidst rising personal and household debts during an ongoing economic downturn.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese paleontologists have discovered that ancient "lamp shells" (brachiopods), bottom-dwelling invertebrates, likely used hundreds of bristle-like structures to "social distance" to enhance their survival. This fascinating finding is based on fossilized Nucleospira calypta species unearthed in China's Guizhou province, which were arranged in a "checkerboard-like" pattern on the ancient sea floor. Researchers, utilizing advanced imaging, determined that these 436-million-year-old organisms maintained a "highly regular" spacing, approximately 1.5 to 2 times the length of their bristles. This behavior is believed to have facilitated efficient filter feeding by ensuring adequate space and resource access between individuals.</p>

          <p>Australia has expanded its landmark social media ban for children under 16 to include YouTube, reversing a previous exemption for the popular platform. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced the decision after a survey revealed 37% of minors reported encountering harmful content on YouTube. The government aims to protect teenagers from predatory algorithms, with Communications Minister Anika Wells stating there's "not a place for predatory algorithms targeting children." YouTube, which maintains it is a video-sharing platform, not social media, expressed disappointment and plans to engage with the government. The law, slated for December 2025, imposes significant fines for non-compliance.</p>

This deal's value significantly surpasses the company's second-quarter revenue, highlighting its scale and strategic importance. LG Energy Solution cautioned investors about potential changes or termination of the contract. The filing did not specify whether the lithium iron phosphate batteries are for vehicles or energy storage systems, though Tesla and General Motors are among its major battery customers.</p>
