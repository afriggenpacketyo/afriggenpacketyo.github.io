          <h2>California Regulators Clarify Rules for Tesla's Planned Ride-Hailing Service</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 21:18:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California's Public Utilities Commission has stated that Tesla is not authorized to operate a public robotaxi service using autonomous vehicles in the state. While Tesla notified regulators of its plan to offer a 'friends and family' car service in the Bay Area, it must use human drivers, as its current permit is for a charter-party carrier service, not an autonomous one. This clarification comes amid Tesla's ongoing testing of a more automated robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, and a separate legal dispute with the California DMV over the marketing of its 'Full Self-Driving' technology. Local officials also expressed concerns about a lack of communication from the company regarding its plans.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Illinois has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration that challenged Chicago's sanctuary city laws. The lawsuit alleged that the city's policies, which limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents, illegally obstruct federal immigration enforcement efforts. Judge Lindsay Jenkins granted the city's motion for dismissal, a decision praised by Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who stated the ruling affirms the legality of the ordinance and enhances public safety. The administration has filed similar lawsuits against other cities with sanctuary policies as part of a broader push against such local laws.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society explores the infamous Hollywood blacklist era of the 1940s and 1950s. The display focuses on the House Un-American Activities Committee's investigation into alleged Communist influence in the film industry, which led to the blacklisting of the "Hollywood Ten" and many others. The exhibit showcases how individuals like screenwriter Dalton Trumbo were imprisoned for refusing to testify, while others, including Walt Disney and Ronald Reagan, cooperated with the committee. It highlights the devastating professional and personal consequences for those accused and raises enduring questions about free speech, political persecution, and democracy.</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are undertaking a significant conservation effort to save the state's bighorn sheep, whose population has been halved in the last five years due to disease. The disease, spread from non-native animals, has decimated the native species. In a rescue mission, biologists captured dozens of healthy sheep from the last disease-free herd and airlifted them over 200 miles to an isolated, safe mountain range. A recent follow-up revealed the relocated herd is not only surviving but also growing, with newborn lambs spotted, offering a hopeful sign for the species' future in the region.</p>

          <h2>Scientific Research on Female Athletes Gains Momentum, Focusing on Unique Health Needs</h2>

          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, focusing on health topics historically overlooked, such as the impact of breasts, the menstrual cycle, and injury risks. Research shows that inadequate breast support can shorten a runner's stride, making a proper sports bra a crucial piece of performance equipment. Scientists are also studying how hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle affect performance and how to mitigate a higher risk of certain injuries, like ACL tears, which are more common in female athletes. This shift marks a significant change from a time when female athletes were often treated simply as "mini-men" in sports science.</p>

          <p>An asteroid named 2024 YR4, once considered the riskiest ever observed for a potential Earth impact, has now been ruled out as a direct threat to our planet. However, new calculations from NASA indicate a 4.3% chance it could collide with the moon in late 2032. Such an event, likely visible from Earth, could create a kilometer-wide crater and send a shower of lunar debris toward our planet. While this debris would pose no danger to people on the ground, it could present a significant hazard to satellites in orbit, potentially disrupting global communications and navigation systems.</p>

          <p>Pitcher Walker Buehler, now with the Boston Red Sox, is preparing to face his former team, the Los Angeles Dodgers, for the first time since his departure. Buehler's seven-year tenure with the Dodgers was marked by two All-Star selections and a key role in their 2020 and 2024 World Series victories. Reflecting on his free agency, Buehler acknowledged the Dodgers' decision to pursue other pitchers while he found a new home in Boston. Before Friday's game, he received his 2024 World Series ring from his former manager and teammates, a moment he described as a reminder of his successful and memorable time in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>Twenty-five years after 'Big Brother' debuted in the UK, psychologists and social experts are suggesting that reality television may have positive societal impacts. Despite long-standing criticism, some argue the genre has improved social understanding by exposing viewers to diverse demographics and lifestyles not typically seen in other media. Shows have sparked national conversations on topics like disability, mental health, and coercive control, potentially making viewers feel less isolated and more aware of different perspectives. While concerns about contestant welfare and the ethics of "constructed reality" remain, the article posits that reality TV can be a powerful tool for social reflection.</p>

          <p>Following two days of deadly cross-border fighting, Cambodia has called for an unconditional and immediate ceasefire with neighboring Thailand. The clashes, which have involved heavy weapons, have killed at least 16 people and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the border. Thailand, which has declared martial law in the border region, has not yet publicly responded to the ceasefire proposal and accuses Cambodia of firing first. The conflict stems from a century-old border dispute, and international leaders, including the U.S. and the chair of ASEAN, are urging a peaceful resolution.</p>

          <p>For the first time, multiple Christian Contemporary Music (CCM) artists are simultaneously charting on the Billboard Hot 100, signaling a significant cultural moment. This article explores the multi-million dollar industry behind CCM, which mirrors mainstream styles but avoids traditionally objectionable content. Experts note the rise of a "barstool conversion rock" subgenre, blending masculinity, country music, and conservative politics. The economic engine of megachurches like Hillsong and Bethel, which provide plug-and-play resources for smaller churches to replicate their worship experience, is identified as a key driver of this trend and its growing influence on popular music.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will release $5.5 billion in education funds to states after abruptly freezing the congressionally approved money earlier this month. The funds support programs for educator training, arts education, and English language support. The White House had initially withheld the funds, claiming it discovered money being used for a "radical left-wing agenda." The decision to freeze the funding triggered widespread outrage from educators and drew bipartisan pushback from lawmakers, including 10 Republican senators who urged the administration to release the critical funding for schools.</p>
