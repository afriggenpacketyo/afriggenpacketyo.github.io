          <p>Intel's stock experienced its best day since 1987, surging nearly 23% after Nvidia announced a $5 billion investment in the company. The strategic collaboration will focus on co-developing data center and PC chips, combining Nvidia's AI and computing expertise with Intel's central processing units (CPUs). This investment follows recent support for Intel's turnaround from the U.S. government and SoftBank, significantly boosting the chipmaker's market position. The White House praised the partnership as a major milestone for American high-tech manufacturing, though the deal does not currently include Nvidia manufacturing chips at Intel's foundries.

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's UK Visit Showcases Warm Personal Relations But Limited British Influence</h2>

          <p>President Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom was marked by elaborate royal pageantry, which the president visibly enjoyed, and a warm personal rapport with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. However, despite the positive atmosphere, the visit underscored the limits of British influence on U.S. policy. A White House official stated frankly that the trip would not alter the president's positions on key issues like trade and tariffs. While the two leaders publicly downplayed disagreements, such as the UK's plan to recognize Palestinian statehood, the analysis concludes that Starmer's primary achievement was maintaining a respectful relationship without changing Trump's fundamental stances.</p>

These glasses will enable users to record video and send messages, building on the success of the company's previous audio-only models. Meta is betting heavily on this technology as it faces growing competition from Google, Snap, and Apple, all of whom are developing their own smart eyewear.</p>

          <p>Paul Thomas Anderson's new film, "One Battle After Another," is praised as a bleak but captivating vision of modern times, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a former revolutionary vigilante living in hiding. The movie, inspired by Thomas Pynchon's novel "Vineland," is set in the present day and touches on urgent themes of political violence and government overreach. The review highlights the film's departure from Anderson's typically slower pace, delivering a kinetic action thriller with beautifully shot car chases and shoot-outs. The performances of DiCaprio, Sean Penn, and newcomer Chase Infiniti are lauded in what is described as an emotional and visceral triumph.</p>

          <p>A jury has acquitted Brayan Ramos-Brito, a Los Angeles protester, of charges that he assaulted a border patrol agent during a demonstration in June. The verdict is a significant setback for federal prosecutors, as the defense successfully cast doubt on the credibility of the agents who testified, including a senior border patrol chief. Witness footage of the incident showed an agent forcefully shoving the defendant but did not capture the alleged assault. Discrepancies in official reports and the cross-examination of a key witness about past misconduct for derogatory comments appear to have influenced the jury's swift decision.</p>

          <p>Following the recent Federal Reserve interest rate cut, the monthly cost of a home equity loan has decreased slightly, making it a more affordable option for homeowners looking to tap into record-high equity levels. A new $50,000 home equity loan with a 10-year term now has an average monthly payment of about $618, while a 15-year term costs around $487 per month. These costs are marginally lower than they were before the rate cut. While a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) may offer a lower initial rate, its variable nature makes budgeting less predictable compared to the fixed rate of a home equity loan.
