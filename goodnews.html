        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The iconic Rose Garden at the White House is undergoing a significant renovation, with its central lawn being replaced by a stone patio at a cost of $1.9 million, funded by private donations. President Trump initiated the project, stating the change was necessary because the grass would become soggy, causing issues for visitors' footwear. The new design features paving stones similar in color to the White House and bears a resemblance to the patio at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. While the lawn is gone, the surrounding flower beds, which were restored during Melania Trump's tenure, will remain as part of the historic garden's evolving design.</p>

          <p>Japan has announced a major infrastructure initiative to develop a logistics network across Africa and the Indian Ocean, potentially creating competition with China's established Belt and Road Initiative. This move signals a renewed focus on infrastructure as a tool for economic and geopolitical influence in the region, a domain where China has been a dominant player. The article suggests that rather than competing, which could lead to wasted resources and incompatible standards, cooperation between Japan and China would be more beneficial. Such collaboration could leverage the expertise of multilateral development banks to fund and execute large-scale international projects more effectively.</p>

          <p>As the US Open begins, Iga Swiatek is positioned as the women's favorite, having built significant momentum with a surprising victory at Wimbledon and a recent title in Cincinnati. Her main rivals include world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, who is seeking a major title to cap a year of near misses, and Coco Gauff, who has struggled with her serve since winning the French Open. In the men's draw, the dominance of Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz continues, with the two having contested the last two Grand Slam finals. The primary question remains whether any other player, such as an aging Novak Djokovic or rising American Ben Shelton, can challenge their hold on the top of the sport.</p>

          <p>Advisors to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are exploring new regulations to curb food waste, specifically targeting the large all-you-can-eat buffets popular in tourist hotels and the traditional, multi-dish Turkish breakfast. With an estimated 8.7 million tons of food discarded annually in the country, the proposal aims to reduce waste by moving towards à la carte dining and allowing guests to customize their breakfast orders. Ramazan Bingol, a member of the presidential council, argues that these measures are a matter of 'national security' due to the waste of resources. However, the proposal faces potential opposition from tour operators and hotel owners.</p>

          <p>Lucy Guo, the 30-year-old co-founder of Scale AI and the youngest self-made woman billionaire, maintains a rigorous daily routine that includes 5:30 a.m. wake-ups, back-to-back gym sessions, and working through lunch. Despite her $1.3 billion net worth, Guo advocates for an intense work ethic, suggesting that new startup founders may need to work 90-hour weeks to succeed. She argues that what many consider a lack of work-life balance, such as China's "996" culture, still allows ample time for personal activities. Guo, who now runs the content platform Passes, believes most people could achieve better balance by eliminating time wasted on passive activities like watching TV.</p>

          <p>Paige Louise Williams, a 32-year-old from Greater Manchester, has built a beauty empire, P.Louise, that generated £71 million in the last financial year, starting from a £20,000 loan from her grandmother. After leaving school with no qualifications, Williams opened a small salon in 2014 that initially struggled. She pivoted to offering online makeup classes and then developed her own product, an eyeshadow base, which gained viral popularity after a positive review on YouTube. The brand's growth was further accelerated by TikTok Shop, where she broke a UK sales record, demonstrating a remarkable journey from a council estate to entrepreneurial success.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has ruled that the Trump administration cannot withhold federal funding from dozens of cities and counties over their so-called "sanctuary" policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. U.S. District Judge William Orrick extended a preliminary injunction, stating that the administration's executive orders threatening to cut off funds were an unconstitutional "coercive threat." The ruling protects over 30 jurisdictions, including major cities like Boston, Chicago, and Los Angeles, which had argued that billions of dollars were at risk. The administration has appealed the judge's initial order on the matter.</p>
