Organizations and individuals, including a 12-year-old "successor" in Hiroshima, are working to convey the horrors to new generations and foreign visitors.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of the Norco state prison in Riverside County by fall 2026. This decision is attributed to a significant decline in the state's inmate population and is expected to save the state $150 million annually. The facility, which houses nearly 2,800 inmates and employs 1,200 staff, will not release inmates early but will transfer them to other prisons. The closure raises questions about the future of the site, which was originally a luxury resort in the 1920s before being converted into a prison.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki, who had an underwhelming start to the season before being sidelined with a shoulder injury, is now showing promising signs of recovery. After a difficult period, he has progressed in his throwing program, with improved velocity and a new two-seam fastball added to his arsenal. The team is hopeful that the 23-year-old Japanese phenom can overcome his early-season struggles and potentially contribute to their World Series push later this year. His return would provide valuable pitching depth, either as a starter or a reliever.</p>

          <p>Meta, the parent company of WhatsApp, announced it has taken down 6.8 million accounts associated with scams in the first six months of this year. Many of these accounts were linked to criminal organizations in Southeast Asia that often use forced labor to conduct fraudulent activities, such as fake investment schemes. The announcement coincided with WhatsApp rolling out new anti-scam features to better protect users. In one instance, WhatsApp collaborated with OpenAI to disrupt a Cambodian group that was using ChatGPT to create instructions for a pyramid scheme.</p>

          <h2>AMD Revenue Surpasses Estimates but Earnings Fall Short, Impacted by China Export Controls</h2>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported mixed quarterly results, with revenue of $7.69 billion beating expectations, but adjusted earnings per share of 48 cents falling just shy of estimates. The company's AI business revenue declined year-over-year, significantly impacted by U.S. export restrictions that eliminated sales of its MI308 chip to China. Despite this setback, AMD saw strong growth in its Client and Gaming segment, driven by demand for its Ryzen CPUs and custom chips for game consoles. The company provided a positive sales forecast for the current quarter, anticipating growth in its AI chip sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion in FEMA disaster relief funds. The ruling follows a lawsuit from 20 states arguing that the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program and redirected its funds without congressional approval. The judge stated that the transfer could cause "irreparable harm" to communities relying on the funds for projects like flood mitigation. The BRIC program was designed to fund local infrastructure projects to protect against natural disasters and save lives.</p>

          <p>A new COVID-19 variant, known as XFG or "Stratus," has become the third-most common strain in the United States, accounting for an estimated 14% of cases by late June. First detected in Southeast Asia, the variant is a combination of two other strains and has seen its prevalence grow globally. The World Health Organization has classified the public health risk from XFG as "low," noting that existing vaccines are expected to remain effective against severe disease. While there is no evidence of distinct or more severe symptoms, hoarseness has been anecdotally linked to the strain.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024. The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, shows a 4.5% drop in violent crime and an 8.1% drop in property crime compared to the previous year. Notably, the murder rate fell by 14.9%, and motor vehicle thefts saw a record 18.6% decline. While experts note the positive trend follows a spike after the COVID-19 pandemic, they also caution that aggravated assault rates remain high and much crime goes unreported.</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles County Enacts Law Requiring Landlords to Maintain Cool Temperatures in Rental Units</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 20:41:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has passed a new law requiring landlords in unincorporated areas to ensure their rental units do not exceed 82 degrees Fahrenheit. The ordinance, aimed at protecting tenants from the health risks of extreme heat, will take effect next month but will not be enforced until 2027 to allow for compliance. The law encourages landlords to use "passive" cooling methods like reflective roofing and blackout curtains, in addition to air conditioning. The measure reflects growing concern over the public health impact of more frequent and intense heat waves due to climate change.</p>
