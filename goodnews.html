        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A series of music festivals scheduled for Brockwell Park in south London are in jeopardy after a High Court challenge by a resident, Rebekah Shaman, who argued that Lambeth Council lacked proper planning permission for the events. The Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) has warned that cancelling the festivals would be a "devastating blow" to the local economy and London's cultural identity. The judge found that Lambeth Council granted use of the park for nine days more than it was able to without seeking additional planning consent. Ms. Shaman expressed hope for an agreement that allows events to continue at a lower level and more connected to the community.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has signaled that a youth mobility scheme could be included in a new agreement with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years on a reciprocal basis. While details are scarce, the scheme aims to facilitate travel and work opportunities for young people without reinstating full freedom of movement. The UK already has similar agreements with countries like Australia, and the government is considering the proposal, provided its red lines are respected. London Mayor Sadiq Khan supports the scheme, citing potential benefits for businesses in sectors such as hospitality and creative industries.</p>

This technology has the potential to extend the endurance of high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) drones, allowing them to fly much longer than before.

Despite his past, Alite is focused on improving Englishtown, drawing on his experience and claiming he's no longer a criminal. He supports charging fentanyl dealers involved in fatal overdoses with murder, driven by the loss of his daughter to a fentanyl-laced pill.</p>

          <p>Sierra Prindle, a military veteran and runner, endured years of unexplained calf pain before being diagnosed with popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES), a rare condition where the popliteal artery is compressed. After an initial bypass surgery failed, Prindle found Dr. Sean Lyden at the Cleveland Clinic, who specializes in PAES treatment. Lyden performed a surgery to remove portions of Prindle's gastrocnemius and popliteus muscles, relieving the compression. The surgeries corrected Prindle's legs and have allowed her to return to a semblance of a normal life, and she hopes to run again and inspires others to push for answers when they know something is wrong.</p>

          <p>An "unofficial" copy of the Magna Carta, acquired by Harvard Law School for $27.50 in 1946, has been authenticated as an original. Professors David Carpenter and Nicholas Vincent used spectral imaging and ultraviolet light to confirm the document's authenticity, dating it to the final iteration of the Magna Carta in 1300. The Magna Carta, first issued in 1215, declared that all people had personal rights, including royalty, and that even kings had to abide by laws. Only 24 of the original 200 documents survive today, highlighting the significance of this rediscovery.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's suggestion of imposing a 100% tariff on foreign-produced movies sparked a debate about the state of the American film industry, and he was reportedly prompted by Jon Voight. While Trump later walked back the statement, it highlighted concerns about the shift of film production overseas due to tax incentives and cheaper labor. Industry unions expressed support for efforts to increase domestic production, and California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed a $7.5 billion federal tax credit to incentivize local filmmaking. The lack of consensus on the best course of action leaves room for Trump's emissaries to propose solutions, including tax incentives and cultural tests for subsidized projects.</p>

While a transcript was previously released, the audio provides additional context on Biden's demeanor. The release of the audio has reignited concerns about Biden's age and cognitive fitness, which were previously raised during his rocky debate against Mr. Trump, leading to Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race.</p>

Toyota and Honda project significant profit declines due to the tariffs and are hesitant to raise prices immediately, fearing customer attrition. Moving production to the United States is a long-term strategy, but automakers are reluctant without knowing the tariffs' duration. Nissan plans to boost sales of U.S.-manufactured models to cushion the tariff's effect. Despite challenges, Japanese automakers remain committed to the U.S. market due to strong demand for high-end vehicles.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board advocates for supporting Germany's new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, to counter the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). The AfD's popularity stems from voter frustration with immigration and the economy, and Merz's coalition government faces the challenge of addressing these issues. The editorial emphasizes the need for stricter immigration policies and economic revitalization to prevent voters from turning to extremism. Success for Merz and his government is seen as crucial for Germany and for the preservation of liberal democracy.</p>
