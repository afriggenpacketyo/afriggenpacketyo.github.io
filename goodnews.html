          <p>Lina Magull, a former star player for the German national team and Inter Milan midfielder, has publicly shared her struggles with depression. Magull revealed that she sought treatment at a private clinic after experiencing panic attacks and losing her passion for football and life. She credits the therapy she received during her six-week stay with helping her rediscover her love for the sport and find meaning in life again. Magull, who retired from the national team in March 2025, is now focused on her club career and is proud of her decision to prioritize her mental health, viewing it as a greater achievement than any titles she has won.

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has presented the UK's spending review, detailing budgets for government departments over the next three years. The review covers day-to-day budgets for staffing and public services, along with investment budgets for infrastructure projects like hospitals and schools until the end of the decade. This is the first multi-year spending review since 2021, outlining key financial allocations and priorities for the UK government. It is important to note that spending reviews are not budgets which contain changes to taxes or new policies, but rather it is a detailing of existing spending.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) has implemented a new rule that allows players to protect their rankings while undergoing fertility treatments. This policy enables players to take time away from professional tennis for procedures like egg or embryo freezing and return with a protected ranking. Players must be out for at least 10 consecutive weeks to qualify and will receive a "Special Entry Ranking" based on their recent performance, which can be used for three tournaments upon their return. The rule expands the WTA's support programs for female athletes, addressing fertility challenges and balancing career and family choices.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-11 10:04:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that AI-generated art lacks the depth and sensory richness of human creativity because AI models cannot represent human senses like smell and touch. Researchers found that Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to understand concepts like flowers in the same way humans do, as they lack the sensory and motor experiences needed to fully grasp such concepts. The study, published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour, indicates that AI's creativity is often "hollow and shallow" due to its inability to connect words and concepts to sensory experiences. The authors suggest that future LLMs augmented with sensor data and robotics might improve, but independent experts remain uncertain about the future of sensory AI.</p>

Additionally, the ¬£3 bus fare cap will continue until at least March 2027, and there will be more help for pensioners in winter, with the winter fuel payment extended to all pensioners in England and Wales with an annual taxable income of ¬£35,000 or less.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has stated that he regrets some of the posts he made about President Trump during a previous social media feud. Musk acknowledged that his comments "went too far" on his platform X. This comes after Trump expressed openness to reconciliation in an interview, stating he felt "a little disappointed" about the fallout but harbored "no hard feelings." The two had a public disagreement after Musk stepped back from his White House role and criticized Trump's tax bill, which Musk believed would cause a recession. Musk's initial comments included unsubstantiated claims about Trump's involvement with Jeffrey Epstein, leading to Trump threatening to cancel government contracts with Musk's SpaceX.</p>

          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that consumer prices in the U.S. rose by 0.1% in May, less than economists had anticipated, with the annual inflation rate at 2.4%. The core CPI, excluding food and energy, also came in lower than expected at 0.1% and 2.8%, respectively. Federal Reserve officials have been concerned about the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on inflation, but the May data showed limited immediate effects. Vice President JD Vance echoed Trump's call for the Fed to cut interest rates, arguing that the refusal to do so is "monetary malpractice." (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>WTA to Protect Tennis Players' Rankings After Egg Freezing</h2>

          <p>The WTA has introduced a rule that will protect the rankings of female tennis players who undergo egg or embryo freezing. The offer is open to any player ranked in the world's top 750 who spends more than 10 weeks out of competition. Sloane Stephens stated that the rule will reduce the pressure on players to return to the court too quickly. She also said that she has used the off-season twice to freeze her eggs and having the protected ranking will ensure players don't feel forced to come back early and risk their health.</p>
