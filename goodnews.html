          <p>President Trump and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping have reportedly discussed and approved a deal concerning the future of TikTok's U.S. operations, though statements from both sides present slightly different interpretations. Trump indicated an agreement was reached that would see a group of U.S. investors, including Oracle, take over the app's American business, while Chinese state media described the talks as welcoming negotiations. The core of the deal is to allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. under American control while licensing algorithm technology from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The arrangement still faces scrutiny from some U.S. lawmakers over national security concerns.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that the storm will strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday but is expected to remain over open water, tracking north of the Caribbean. While the current path keeps it away from major landmasses, the system could pass east of Bermuda next week as it continues to intensify. So far, the hurricane season has been quieter than initially predicted by NOAA, with Gabrielle being the first named storm to form since the historical peak of the season in early September.</p>

After her own grandfather was targeted, she developed a website and an AI-powered app called Shield Seniors to educate older adults on how to identify and report fraudulent messages. Manoj now spends her time visiting senior centers to teach cybersecurity awareness, addressing a growing problem that saw adults over 60 lose $4.8 billion to scams in 2024.

          <p>Facing saturated markets and slowing economic growth in Europe and the U.S., many Chinese companies are now focusing on Southeast Asia as a key region for expansion. At a major trade fair in Nanning, Chinese exporters are actively courting buyers from the region, attracted by its rapidly growing economies and large, young consumer base. This strategic shift reflects a broader trend of diversifying trade relationships and seeking new growth opportunities. Companies, such as electric scooter manufacturers who previously relied on Western markets, now see the populous Southeast Asian nations as offering immense untapped potential for their products.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has dismissed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Donald Trump against The New York Times, citing procedural flaws and improper language. The judge ruled that the 85-page complaint was excessively long and read more like a political rally speech than a serious legal document. The lawsuit alleged that several articles and a book by two reporters were intended to damage his 2024 presidential campaign. While the judge did not rule on the legal merits of the case, Trump's lawyers were given 28 days to refile an amended, more concise complaint that adheres to court standards.</p>

          <p>British sculptor Martin Jennings has been chosen to create the statue of Queen Elizabeth II that will be the centerpiece of her national memorial in London's St James's Park. Jennings, known for his depictions of King Charles III and the Queen Mother, expressed his aim to capture the late monarch's "grandeur and dignity." He plans to consult with the Royal Family and gauge public sentiment before finalizing the design, which will be revealed in 2026. The memorial project will also include a re-landscaped park area, a statue of Prince Philip, and a bridge inspired by the late queen's wedding tiara.</p>

          <p>During President Trump's state visit, major U.S. tech companies, including Nvidia and Microsoft, signaled strong confidence in the UK's technology sector with significant investment announcements. Microsoft revealed a £22 billion investment to expand its AI infrastructure in the country, while Google is opening a new data center. The enthusiasm from Silicon Valley leaders like Nvidia's Jensen Huang, who declared the UK will be an "AI superpower," contrasts with some domestic pessimism. This influx of capital is seen as a plan to leverage the UK's scientific research prowess, though it also raises questions about the country's economic dependence on American tech giants.

          <p>Actor Cillian Murphy has confirmed that a 'Peaky Blinders' film is coming to Netflix, though he remains tight-lipped about the plot details to maintain surprise for the fans. Reflecting on his role as the gang leader Tommy Shelby, which he played for six seasons, Murphy described the experience as a defining privilege that allowed him to grow with a character over a long period. While promoting his new film "Steve," the Oscar-winning actor emphasized that he is personally nothing like the "psychopathic gangster" he portrayed, highlighting the magic of the show's writing and its cultural impact.</p>

          <p>The "Pupusas and Punchlines" comedy show, held in a Salvadoran restaurant in Los Angeles, has become a vital space for Latinx comedians to perform and connect with an appreciative audience.

The show has grown from a monthly gathering to a sold-out weekly event, highlighting a demand for comedy that reflects the city's diverse population. It serves as an important platform for underrepresented voices in a competitive stand-up scene, fostering a strong sense of community.</p>
