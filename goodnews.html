          <p>Former US President Donald Trump stated on social media that Apple will face a 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured outside the United States, specifically targeting production in countries like India and China. Apple has been gradually shifting some production to India to mitigate trade tensions. Some analysts estimate that relocating iPhone production to the U.S. could increase the device's price significantly, potentially adding thousands of dollars to the retail cost. This announcement follows increased pressure from Trump on Apple and CEO Tim Cook to boost domestic manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis expressed skepticism about NATO members reaching U.S. President Donald Trump's defense spending target of 5% of GDP. Mitsotakis suggested that 3.5% is a more realistic ceiling for hard defense spending, but noted the 5% target could be achievable in the long term if broader security-related expenses are included. NATO chief Mark Rutte has suggested a 3.5% target for defense spending with an additional 1.5% for wider security matters. Many NATO countries have struggled to meet the current 2% target, a frequent point of contention for Trump.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A protracted slump in crude prices has ramped up the pressure on Big Oil's commitment to allocate cash to shareholders. Western energy supermajors have long sought to return cash to investors through buyback programs and dividends to keep their shareholders happy. However, analysts are questioning the durability of these strategies, citing stretched balance sheets and falling crude prices. Share buybacks, being more flexible than dividends, are likely to be the first lever pulled if oil prices remain depressed. Weaker crude prices mean energy majors will have less cash to return to shareholders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields eased on Friday but remained elevated as investors assessed the potential impact of President Donald Trump's tax bill on the economy. Concerns about the bill adding nearly $4 trillion to the fiscal deficit have pressured Treasurys. Moody's downgraded the U.S.' credit rating, citing the growing budget deficit and the cost of funding existing debt. The Supreme Court ruling suggested greater protection for Federal Reserve board members from presidential interference, easing fears of Jerome Powell's potential ousting.

          <p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Qamzova, the first China-invented painkiller designed as a non-opioid alternative. Developed by Delova, Qamzova is a long-acting injectable analgesic offering 24-hour pain relief. Clinical trials have shown it to be effective in reducing post-surgical reliance on opioids. By providing a safer alternative for moderate-to-severe pain, Qamzova addresses the US overdose epidemic fueled by addictive opioids like fentanyl. This approval highlights China's growing role in innovative medicines development.</p>

While Coinbase represents a more regulated way for investors to gain exposure to crypto, some industry watchdogs warn that the mainstream adoption of crypto could lead to financial instability. The inclusion of Coinbase signifies a changing landscape in the financial sector.</p>

          <p>The UK's energy regulator, Ofgem, has confirmed that the energy price cap will fall in July, reducing typical gas and electricity bills by ¬£11 a month. Despite this decrease, consumers are urged to shop around for cheaper fixed deals, potentially saving up to ¬£200 annually. While the price cap offers some relief, prices remain high, and many households are struggling with energy debt. The announcement comes amidst debates over winter fuel payments and standing charges, with calls for targeted support for those hardest hit.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of workers are safe underground at the Kloof gold mine near Johannesburg following a "shaft incident," according to Sibanye Stillwater. All 260 employees have been accounted for, are safe, and have been provided with food. The workers are not trapped, but are remaining at the sub-shaft station until it is safe to proceed to the surface. Initial investigations indicate that a rock winder skip door opened at the loading point, impacting levels below. The company expects all affected employees to be brought to the surface later today.</p>
