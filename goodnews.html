          <p>Brown University has reached a deal with the Trump administration to restore millions in frozen federal research grants. In exchange, the university agreed to donate $50 million to local workforce programs and make commitments regarding women's sports, antisemitism, and admissions. The agreement specifies that female student-athletes will have sex-segregated locker rooms and that the school will not offer racial preferences in admissions, a practice already barred by the Supreme Court. Brown's president stated the deal was necessary to end a financially painful grant freeze and preserves the university's academic integrity.</p>

          <p>Microsoft's market capitalization exceeded $4 trillion in after-hours trading, making it the second company to reach this milestone, following Nvidia. The surge was driven by a strong earnings report, which revealed the company's fastest revenue growth in over three years, largely fueled by its Azure cloud computing business. The company disclosed that Azure and other cloud services generated over $75 billion in revenue for the fiscal year, a 34% increase. This achievement highlights Microsoft's significant gains from the artificial intelligence boom, placing it ahead of Apple in market valuation. (not investment advice)</p>

Taylor Rogers was sent from the Cincinnati Reds to the Pittsburgh Pirates, while his brother Tyler was traded by the San Francisco Giants to the New York Mets just hours later. The brothers, who were teammates in San Francisco in 2023 and 2024, are now on separate paths again. This unusual coincidence highlights the unpredictable nature of professional sports trading, affecting one of only ten sets of twins in MLB history.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, continuing its cautious approach in light of ongoing economic uncertainties and elevated inflation. The rate-setting committee's statement noted that while economic growth moderated in the first half of the year, the labor market remains solid. The decision was not unanimous, with two Fed governors dissenting in favor of a rate cut, a rare occurrence. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the economy is in good shape but faces risks, justifying the decision to hold rates steady for now. (not investment advice)</p>

His passing has prompted an outpouring of affection from patrons and fellow restaurateurs who admired his work ethic and dedication.

          <p>A cultural analysis examines the growing popularity of intensely stressful television series like "The Bear" and "The Pitt," questioning why viewers are drawn to such anxiety-inducing content. The article suggests that these shows provide a form of "vicarious stress," allowing audiences to experience a fight-or-flight response without any real-world risk, which can be psychologically satisfying. By focusing on realistic, high-stakes workplace challenges rather than escapist fantasy, these programs resonate with viewers' own daily pressures. This trend may reflect a desire for more grounded, relatable storytelling that acknowledges and processes modern anxieties.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has articulated a vision for the future of artificial intelligence centered on "personal superintelligence," which he believes will empower individuals to achieve their goals. This advanced AI would act as a personalized companion, capable of learning and surpassing human cognition to help with complex problems and personal tasks. Zuckerberg also emphasized the role of AI-integrated glasses as a primary future computing device, noting a significant increase in sales of Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses. This AI-focused strategy follows a pivot from the metaverse and coincides with Meta reporting strong second-quarter financial results.</p>

          <p>Figma, the collaborative design software company, has priced its initial public offering at $33 per share, exceeding its initial target range of $30 to $32. The offering, which values the company at $19.3 billion, raised $1.2 billion, with the stock set to debut on the New York Stock Exchange. This move comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated in 2023 due to regulatory opposition. Figma's successful IPO reflects a gradually reopening market for technology listings and demonstrates strong investor confidence in the company's growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta's shares climbed significantly after the company reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street expectations for both revenue and earnings. The social media giant's sales grew 22% year-over-year, driven by strong advertising revenue, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg attributed to efficiency gains from AI technology. The company also issued a third-quarter sales forecast that was higher than analysts' predictions. This strong performance comes as Meta continues its major investment in AI, including a multi-billion dollar investment in Scale AI and a strategic pivot toward developing "personal superintelligence."

          <p>Kamala Harris has officially announced she will not run for governor of California in 2026, ending months of speculation and opening up the race to lead the nation's most populous state. In a statement, the former vice-president and 2024 presidential nominee said her public service would not be in elected office "for now," but that she plans to remain politically active. Her decision had effectively frozen the field of potential candidates, who were waiting for her to declare her intentions. The now wide-open contest will feature prominent Democrats like Xavier Becerra, Antonio Villaraigosa, and Eleni Kounalakis.</p>

          <p>This opinion article champions several independent Latin artists who, despite producing some of the most creative and progressive music of the year, are likely to be overlooked by the Latin Grammy Awards. The piece highlights six artists, including Argentina's Juana Aguirre and Chile's Gepe, arguing their innovative work deserves consideration in major categories like Album of the Year, not just niche alternative fields. It makes a case for celebrating musicians who are advancing the genre without the support of major record labels. The author suggests that their forward-facing, self-produced albums represent the cutting edge of Latin music.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of Kamala Harris's decision to not run for California governor suggests the move strategically preserves her option for a 2028 presidential campaign. Running for and serving as governor would have made a simultaneous presidential bid practically and politically difficult, as she would have needed to assure California voters of her full commitment to the state. While she would enter a 2028 Democratic primary with high name recognition, she would also face a potentially large field and carry the political baggage of the 2024 election loss. The decision avoids a potential gubernatorial primary against fellow Californian Gavin Newsom.</p>

          <p>USC football has opened its preseason camp with a new strength and conditioning coach, Trumain Carroll, who has been tasked with instilling a higher level of discipline. His hiring comes after the team struggled to close out games last season, losing five fourth-quarter leads.

Coach Lincoln Riley hopes that Carroll's firm approach will provide the new voice and accountability needed to transform the team into a championship contender.</p>
