          <p>Luxury carmaker Ferrari reported a 17% increase in first-quarter profit, driven by strong demand for personalized vehicles, according to the article. CEO Benedetto Vigna hailed the start of another great year, noting double-digit growth in key metrics due to product mix and personalization demand. However, the company cautioned that potential U.S. tariffs on EU car imports could negatively impact profitability this year, potentially reducing EBIT and EBITDA margins by 50 basis points. In response to existing tariffs, Ferrari had previously announced a 10% price increase on certain models.</p>

          <p>The Taiwan dollar experienced a pullback after a significant surge against the U.S. dollar, which had seen it reach multi-decade gains, according to the article. This volatility occurred amid speculation that Washington was pressuring Taiwan to strengthen its currency. Despite the recent weakening, the Taiwan dollar is still up over 8% this year against the greenback. Taiwan's central bank governor refuted claims that exchange rates were part of U.S. trade negotiations, though analysts remain skeptical, suggesting currency realignment might be underway to secure trade concessions from the U.S.</p>
