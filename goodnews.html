          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index surpassed 44,000 for the first time, driven by investor optimism following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation announcement. Market analysts suggest that investors are anticipating a new wave of fiscal stimulus from the next leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to boost the nation's economy. The rally was led by the technology sector, with companies like Advantest seeing significant gains, while the Japanese yen also strengthened slightly against the US dollar.

          <p>A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine reveals that cannabis use among Americans aged 65 and older increased by 46% between 2021 and 2023. With marijuana now legal for medical or recreational use in most states, many seniors are turning to it for medicinal purposes, such as pain relief and relaxation. However, some medical professionals express concern, citing research that links cannabis use to increased cardiovascular risks, including a higher chance of stroke and acute coronary syndrome, regardless of the method of consumption.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy was activated from the injured list on Monday and immediately placed back in the lineup as the team faces an offensive slump. Muncy had been sidelined for 23 games due to an oblique injury, his second stint on the injured list this season. His return is seen as a significant boost for the Dodgers, who have struggled in his absence. The team anticipates further reinforcements soon, with several other key players expected to return from injury for the playoff stretch drive.</p>

          <p>A port operator in Dalian, China, is establishing a new transit center and a shipping service dubbed the "durian express" to accelerate the delivery of fresh durians from Southeast Asia to the country's northeast region. This initiative aims to reduce shipping times from nearly two weeks to as few as six days, addressing logistical challenges that have previously limited the fruit's availability and freshness in the area. The project targets the growing demand for durians among the roughly 100 million consumers in northeastern China.</p>

          <h2>California Lawmakers Pass Bill Targeting Online Puppy Mill Sales</h2>

          <p>The California legislature has passed a bill aimed at closing a loophole that allows online brokers to sell dogs from out-of-state commercial breeders, often known as puppy mills. The legislation, AB 519, specifically bans online marketplaces and middlemen who misrepresent themselves as small, local breeders from selling dogs, cats, and rabbits to California consumers. This move expands upon a 2019 law that prohibited pet stores from selling commercially bred animals, addressing the subsequent rise in deceptive online sales that grew during the pandemic.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved this year's updated COVID-19 vaccines for specific high-risk groups, including adults 65 and older and individuals with certain underlying medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and heart conditions. While federal officials state that anyone can receive a vaccine after consulting a doctor, the narrower approval may create access challenges, particularly as some pharmacies require prescriptions in certain states. The new framework has caused some confusion, especially regarding vaccination for children and pregnant people, who now fall under a "shared decision-making" model with their healthcare providers.</p>

          <p>England's Test cricket coach, Brendon McCullum, has expressed frustration with what he calls "disrespectful" misconceptions about his team's aggressive style of play, often labeled "Bazball." He clarified that the team's approach is not about recklessly swinging the bat but about creating an environment where players can perform without being restricted by the pressures of international cricket. McCullum emphasized that the focus is on fostering a positive mindset to allow talent to flourish, rather than adhering to a rigid, high-risk playing style.</p>

          <p>Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere has won a second term in office after his Labour Party emerged as the top vote-getter in the country's parliamentary election. With around 28% of the vote, Labour, along with four other left-leaning parties, secured a narrow majority of 87 seats in the 169-seat parliament. The election campaign focused on domestic issues such as inflation and public services, as well as the stability of the incumbent government amid international turmoil. Stoere hailed the victory as a positive signal for social democracy in Europe.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that several recent pessimistic narratives surrounding major tech companies on Wall Street have proven to be overblown. He pointed to concerns about a potential breakup of Alphabet's search business, Amazon's cloud services falling behind, and Apple's AI strategy, noting that the stocks of these companies have since recovered from their lows. Cramer also mentioned the recent price target cut for Nvidia, suggesting that this too might be a mistake in hindsight, and emphasized that it is easy to focus on negativity in the market.

Under the terms, the three siblings will relinquish their shares in the family trust, ensuring the conservative-leaning direction of outlets like Fox News remains secure under Lachlan's leadership for the foreseeable future.</p>

          <p>China is experiencing a unique environmental transformation characterized by industrial growth coupled with a significant reduction in pollution. This shift is driven by massive investments in green technology, real-time environmental monitoring, and cutting-edge industrial processes rather than deindustrialization. Between 2015 and 2022, the country achieved a remarkable 35.6% reduction in average PM2.5 air pollution levels, a feat comparable to what the United States accomplished over three decades under the Clean Air Act, demonstrating a new model of industrial decarbonization.</p>
