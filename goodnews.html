          <p>Former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz was photographed using the Signal app during a Cabinet meeting, a day before President Trump announced his replacement with Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The photo revealed conversations with figures like Vice President JD Vance, Rubio, and others. While the White House defended Waltz's use of the app, citing it as approved, this incident follows previous scrutiny over Waltz's use of Signal, including a group chat where sensitive military plans were discussed. Trump has nominated Waltz to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.</p>

          <p>Billionaire industrialist Charles Koch made a rare public appearance at the Cato Institute, advocating for libertarians to uphold their principles, seemingly directing his message at the Republican Party influenced by President Trump. Koch, once a major force in Republican politics, has seen his influence wane since Trump's election, with disagreements over policies like tariffs. Despite these differences, Koch's political group plans a $20 million campaign to encourage the renewal of Trump's 2017 tax cuts, even after his network's endorsement of Nikki Haley in the 2024 primaries proved unsuccessful.</p>

          <p>Japan's average unemployment rate in fiscal year 2024 decreased to 2.5 percent, marking the first improvement in two years due to a labor shortage, according to government data. The number of employed individuals reached a record high since 1953, while dismissals by employers decreased, indicating that job seekers were able to find new positions. Despite a slight rise in the unemployment rate in March, economists suggest that the labor market remains tight, with job availability still exceeding the number of job seekers.</p>

          <p>President Trump has removed Mike Waltz from his position as national security adviser and nominated him as ambassador to the United Nations, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio temporarily replacing him. Waltz faced criticism for a Signal chat controversy and perceived failures in vetting National Security Council staff.
