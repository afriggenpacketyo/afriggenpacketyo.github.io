          <p>London's Heathrow Airport has fully reopened after a partial evacuation of Terminal 4 due to a "hazardous materials" scare. Emergency services, including specialist police officers and the London Fire Brigade, conducted a thorough search but found no trace of any adverse substance. Twenty-one people were assessed by paramedics, with one taken to the hospital as a precaution, though none were in life-threatening condition. The airport apologized for the disruption and stated it was working to ensure flights departed as scheduled.</p>

          <p>Despite anticipated interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, high-yield savings accounts may still be a worthwhile option for savers. While returns are no longer at their peak, they remain significantly higher than those offered by traditional savings accounts, providing substantial earning potential. Experts suggest that rate cuts will likely be gradual, minimizing the immediate impact on account yields, and the liquidity of these accounts offers flexibility in an unpredictable economy.

          <p>The long-running succession battle for control of Rupert Murdoch's media empire has concluded with an agreement that solidifies his eldest son, Lachlan Murdoch's, leadership. Under the deal, Lachlan will control the trust containing shares in Fox and News Corp, ensuring the conservative direction of outlets like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal. His siblings, Prudence, Elisabeth, and James, will receive $1.1 billion each for their shares and will no longer be beneficiaries of the media trust. The settlement resolves years of family tension over the future of the influential global media company.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate nearing a one-year low, prospective homebuyers have opportunities to secure even better terms. Financial experts advise that improving one's credit score is the most effective way to qualify for a lower rate, as lenders offer the best terms to borrowers with higher FICO scores. Other key strategies include making a larger down payment of 20% to reduce risk for lenders and considering alternatives to a 30-year fixed loan, such as an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), which offers a lower initial rate.

          <p>Shares of the online brokerage Robinhood experienced a significant surge, climbing more than 15% after S&P Global announced its addition to the prestigious S&P 500 index. The inclusion, which will take effect on September 22, is a major milestone for the company and is expected to drive substantial stock purchases from passive index funds. The move ends months of speculation on Wall Street about Robinhood's eligibility for the benchmark index. The company's stock has performed exceptionally well this year, with its value increasing by over 210% year-to-date. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While most seniors cannot completely avoid paying for Medicare Part B, there are specific circumstances where enrollment can be delayed or costs can be subsidized. Seniors who continue to work past age 65 and have creditable health insurance through their employer can typically delay Part B enrollment without penalty. For those with limited income, state-run Medicare Savings Programs or Medicaid can help cover or eliminate the monthly premiums. However, forgoing Part B can affect eligibility for supplemental coverage like Medigap, making it a risky long-term strategy for most retirees.</p>

          <p>Tennis icon Serena Williams, through her firm Serena Ventures, has invested in the women's 3-on-3 basketball league, Unrivaled. The investment was part of a funding round that also included soccer star Alex Morgan and was led by Bessemer Venture Partners, valuing the league at $340 million. Unrivaled was created to provide WNBA players a high-paying domestic option during their offseason and claims to offer the highest average salary in women's professional sports. Williams, a 23-time Grand Slam champion, has been actively investing in early-stage companies since establishing her venture fund in 2017.</p>

          <p>Projections from Norway's parliamentary election indicate that Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere's center-left Labour Party is on track to secure a narrow victory. The left-leaning coalition is expected to win a slim majority of 87 seats in the 169-seat parliament, allowing the minority government to remain in power. The election campaign focused on domestic issues such as inflation and public services, but was also influenced by international instability, including the war in Ukraine. Observers suggest that global uncertainty may have led voters to favor the stability offered by the incumbent government.</p>

          <p>England manager Thomas Tuchel has announced plans to utilize the long throw-in as an attacking tactic for the upcoming World Cup. This strategy, famously employed by Stoke City's Rory Delap over a decade ago, is seeing a resurgence in the Premier League for its effectiveness in creating scoring opportunities. Throw-in specialists and data analysis suggest that while often underestimated, a well-executed long throw can be a significant offensive weapon. With limited preparation time before the tournament, Tuchel believes focusing on set-piece advantages like throw-ins could provide a critical edge for the team.</p>

          <p>An "early season cold front" is moving into California, promising a significant drop in temperatures and a reprieve from recent heatwaves and thunderstorms. The low-pressure system is expected to bring widespread cooling across the state, with inland temperatures falling by 10 to 20 degrees below average. Northern California and the Bay Area may receive light rain, which could help dampen wildfire risk in the region. While Southern California is not expected to get significant rainfall, a deep marine layer could bring some drizzle, though not enough to end the high fire season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage rates falling to an 11-month low, many homeowners are considering refinancing their loans. Financial experts advise evaluating several key questions before proceeding, such as whether the current rate drop is significant enough to justify the action, typically at least a one-percentage-point reduction. Homeowners should also calculate the closing costs, which range from 2% to 6% of the loan amount, to ensure the savings outweigh the expense within a reasonable timeframe. Finally, one's long-term plans for the home are crucial, as selling before breaking even on costs would negate the financial benefits. (not investment advice)</p>
