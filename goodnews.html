          <p>Swiss banking giant UBS announced a second-quarter net profit of $2.395 billion, significantly beating analyst forecasts and doubling its profit year-over-year. The strong performance was fueled by a 25% revenue increase in its investment bank's global markets unit amid high market volatility. Despite this, the bank faces challenges, including new Swiss regulatory proposals for higher capital requirements and concerns over net interest income due to Switzerland's 0% interest rates.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the FTSE 100 index reaching record highs and outperforming global benchmarks like the S&P 500, this article argues its success is disconnected from the UK's domestic economy. The index's strength is attributed to its heavy weighting of defensive stocks and internationally focused companies that earn most of their revenue overseas, a structure vastly different from its more UK-centric composition at its 1984 launch. The analysis concludes that while the Footsie's performance is notable, it should not be misinterpreted as a sign of robust UK corporate or economic health. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pro-life activist and former Planned Parenthood clinic director Abby Johnson has commented on the announced closure of two of the organization's Houston facilities, including what was once its largest abortion clinic. Johnson described the closures as a "symbolic victory" for the pro-life movement, suggesting the facilities are no longer financially viable without revenue from abortion procedures, which are now banned in Texas. Planned Parenthood cited rising costs and staffing shortages as reasons for the shutdown, which is part of a broader trend of clinic closures and mergers.</p>

          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles has reached a $6 million settlement with Jewish students and a professor who sued the university over its response to 2024 pro-Palestinian protests. The lawsuit argued that UCLA violated their civil rights by allowing demonstrators to block access to campus facilities. This settlement follows a Justice Department finding that UCLA created a hostile environment for Jewish students and comes after a judge ordered the university to better protect them, prompting systemwide changes to protest guidelines.</p>
