          <p>A major Republican spending package, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill," narrowly cleared a key procedural vote in the Senate following prolonged negotiations. Several conservative senators, who initially withheld support over concerns about deficit reduction and Medicaid, eventually voted to advance the bill after securing promises for amendment votes. The late-night session was marked by high drama, with Vice President JD Vance present for a potential tie-breaking vote that was ultimately not needed. The bill now faces a lengthy reading on the Senate floor before a final vote. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major cities across the United States, including New York and San Francisco, are holding large-scale parades to mark the culmination of LGBTQ+ Pride Month. The events blend jubilant celebration with a more defiant tone of protest this year, responding to recent political efforts to roll back LGBTQ+ rights. Organizers have adopted themes like ‚ÄúRise Up: Pride in Protest‚Äù to reflect the current climate, ten years after the landmark Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage. The marches also face challenges like reduced corporate sponsorship, reflecting a broader shift in corporate diversity initiatives.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new partnership with supermarkets and food manufacturers to encourage customers to make healthier food choices and tackle rising obesity rates. Under the voluntary plan, retailers will decide on methods such as offering promotions on healthy items, adjusting loyalty point systems, or reformulating products. The initiative, part of a broader 10-year NHS plan, aims to make healthy eating more accessible and relieve pressure on the health service. While some health advocates welcome the focus on corporate responsibility, critics note the voluntary nature of past programs has yielded mixed results.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 21:23:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave impacts the UK, this article explains the phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect, which causes cities to be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. The primary cause is the prevalence of dark, hard surfaces like asphalt and concrete, which absorb and retain the sun's heat more than natural landscapes. This stored heat is released slowly, keeping urban temperatures elevated, especially at night. The effect is compounded by waste heat from vehicles and buildings, and a lack of cooling vegetation and water, making city dwellers more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.</p>

          <p>A new pilot program in Kent, UK, is teaching primary school children as young as five about sun safety to reduce future cases of skin cancer. The initiative, led by the Melanoma Fund charity, educates pupils on reading UV indexes and applying sunscreen, with plans for a nationwide rollout in 2026. Experts emphasize that sunburn in childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma, the most serious skin cancer, later in life. With melanoma diagnoses projected to rise, the program aims to instill lifelong healthy habits and give children a sense of control over their own skin protection.</p>

          <p>An estimated crowd of over 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a major demonstration for human rights in defiance of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The government had attempted to ban the march, citing a controversial "child protection" law that equates homosexuality with pedophilia. However, Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, used a legal loophole to allow the event to proceed, calling it a peaceful show of force against a "puffed-up and hateful power." The large turnout transformed the annual Pride event into a broader protest against Orban's increasingly authoritarian rule.</p>
