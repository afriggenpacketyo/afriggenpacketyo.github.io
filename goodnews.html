          <p>A relationship expert suggests that couples can improve their relationships by creating a "relationship bank account," where they make "deposits" through actions that prioritize their partner's happiness. The goal is to build a positive balance, which reflects how safe and secure couples feel in their relationship, enabling them to handle conflicts more effectively. This process involves identifying what makes each partner feel loved and appreciated and consistently performing those actions. Common ways to bolster the account include acts of service, physical touch, words of affirmation, and quality time, leading to less intense and less frequent arguments.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer denied that his government's decision to extend winter fuel payments was a result of political pressure, attributing it instead to an improved economy. The revised policy will provide payments to nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of ¬£35,000 or less. The government initially withdrew the payments from most pensioners to address the UK's "broken" finances, but reversed the decision after pressure from charities, unions, and MPs. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the government's efforts to address economic challenges and support pensioners, but also the ongoing debate over fiscal policy.</p>
