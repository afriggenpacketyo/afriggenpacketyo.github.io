          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch reported a slowdown in its namesake brand's sales growth during the fiscal second quarter, with comparable sales dropping 11%. However, the company's overall performance was bolstered significantly by its teen-focused Hollister brand, which achieved a best-ever 19% sales growth for the quarter, exceeding Wall Street expectations. Despite facing an increased tariff cost projection of $90 million for the year, Abercrombie raised its full-year revenue outlook to 5% to 7% growth. The retailer is strategically reintroducing popular sections, expanding into new categories like athleisure and bridal, and forging partnerships, such as becoming the NFL's first "official fashion partner," to stimulate growth and attract new customers.

          <p>Claiming Social Security benefits at age 62, the earliest possible age, carries substantial financial risks that can significantly impact long-term retirement security. This choice results in a permanent reduction of monthly benefits, often to about 70% of the full retirement age amount, and also limits the growth of future cost-of-living adjustments. Furthermore, individuals forgo valuable delayed retirement credits, which offer an 8% annual increase for each year benefits are postponed until age 70, potentially accumulating to a quarter-million dollars in additional lifetime benefits. The decision also has lasting consequences for a surviving spouse, as reduced benefits for the primary earner can diminish their potential survivor payments, highlighting the importance of careful planning.

          <p>Pop superstar Taylor Swift and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce have announced their engagement, generating significant public interest and breaking Instagram records with their joint post. Kelce proposed at his $6 million Missouri home, transforming the grounds into an "enchanted garden" with thousands of flowers, a display estimated to cost nearly $40,000. Swift's custom engagement ring features an old mine brilliant cut diamond in a yellow gold bezel setting, designed by New York goldsmith Kindred Lubeck. The couple's romance famously began after Kelce's attempt to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his number at a concert, a gesture she later described as reminiscent of a 1980s John Hughes movie.</p>

          <p>An analysis of U.S. container data reveals that major retailers like Abercrombie & Fitch, Best Buy, and Five Below are implementing diverse and distinct strategies to mitigate the impact of new tariffs. Abercrombie & Fitch, despite a diversified supply chain, is facing increased tariff costs and is responding by shifting global production and optimizing supplier contracts. Best Buy strategically front-loaded its freight in June, though on a smaller scale than previous peak seasons, and maintains a lower reliance on Chinese imports. In contrast, discount retailer Five Below, which is highly exposed to Chinese tariffs, leverages its flexible inventory assortment to opportunistically source products and adjust origins, showcasing how different business models adapt to complex trade policies.

Humain, launched in May, seeks to deliver comprehensive AI capabilities across data centers, infrastructure, cloud platforms, and advanced AI models, positioning the kingdom as a regional AI hub. The company has announced $23 billion for strategic technology partnerships and a $10 billion venture fund, including collaborations with chipmaking giants AMD and Nvidia. With plans to construct two large campuses comprising 11 data centers and target 6 gigawatts of capacity by 2034, Saudi Arabia views data as its new "oil" to diversify its economy.

          <p>USA Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley has announced his six wildcard selections for the upcoming tournament at Bethpage, making the significant decision not to include himself as a playing captain. Despite his world ranking of 11, Bradley opted for Justin Thomas, Collin Morikawa, Ben Griffin, Cameron Young, Patrick Cantlay, and Sam Burns to complete the American team. These players will join automatic qualifiers Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele, JJ Spaun, Harris English, Russell Henley, and Bryson DeChambeau. Bradley's choice allows him to focus entirely on leading the team as the U.S. seeks to reclaim the Ryder Cup trophy from Europe in the highly anticipated September event.</p>

The department store narrowed its full-year sales guidance to reflect the higher end of its previous range and revised its adjusted earnings per share outlook. Interim CEO Michael Bender noted that lower- and middle-income customers are trading down, but emphasized ongoing efforts to revitalize the business, including reintroducing the petite section, expanding jewelry offerings, and overhauling its discount strategy.

          <p>David Frum and renowned classicist Mary Beard delve into the prevalent misuse of Roman history in contemporary political discourse, especially within American contexts. Beard cautions against cherry-picking historical parallels, stressing the fundamental differences in governance, economic understanding, and societal structures between ancient Rome and modern democracies. The discussion differentiates the fall of the Roman Republic from the more diffuse decline of the Empire, noting Rome's "knowledge deficit" regarding its vast territories and economy. They also explore the complex, non-modern concept of "barbarians" in Roman society, underscoring that while history offers lessons, direct analogies to current events like Donald Trump's politics are often misleading due to vastly different realities.</p>

Without her phone and realizing the door could not be opened from the inside due to a malfunctioning lock, Zhou, in a desperate act of survival, bit her finger and used her own blood to scrawl "110 625" (China's emergency number and her room number) on a pillow. She then flung the pillow from the sixth-floor window. A vigilant food delivery driver, Zhang Kun, spotted the distress message and promptly alerted the police, leading to her successful rescue.

          <p>Scientists have announced the discovery of a bizarre armored dinosaur, named Spicomellus afer, found in Morocco, which uniquely featured meter-long spikes protruding directly from its neck. Dating back 165 million years, this species represents the oldest known example of ankylosaurs and has profoundly surprised experts, prompting a re-evaluation of armored dinosaur evolution. Researchers, including Professor Richard Butler, have dubbed it the "punk rocker" of its era due to its unprecedented and elaborate spikiness, which is unlike any other animal, living or extinct. The discovery suggests that early ankylosaurs may have initially used these striking structures for display, only later adapting them for defensive body armor against larger predators.</p>

While this decision could alter Google's search traffic and market dynamics, some analysts suggest it might paradoxically fuel the company's AI growth by liberating substantial capital from what they consider "unnecessary insurance" payments. The Justice Department is also advocating for restrictions on exclusive AI distribution deals and proposing data-sharing mandates to enhance competition. Despite these potential regulatory challenges, Google's search dominance is expected to remain robust, and the company is strategically positioning its Gemini AI platform as a major catalyst for future growth.

During this period, approximately half of Greenland's 9,000 Inuit women, many of whom were teenagers, were compelled to have intrauterine devices (IUDs) inserted without their consent, resulting in sterility and significant physical or psychological issues. Frederiksen acknowledged this as one of "other dark chapters" of systematic discrimination, emphasizing that while the past is unchangeable, taking responsibility is crucial. This apology precedes an anticipated report on the mistreatment and comes as about 150 affected women are pursuing legal compensation for rights violations.</p>

This initiative responds to the growing threat from Russia and new NATO commitments. While military service remains voluntary, the law mandates an obligatory questionnaire for all 18-year-old men, with medical examinations becoming compulsory for men from July 2027. The package includes increased salaries, free medical care, accommodation, and rail travel for recruits, with the goal of attracting volunteers for six to 23 months of service.

Bain Capital, advised by Goldman Sachs, is currently holding off on a decision as it awaits additional offers. This potential take-private deal signifies a substantial return for Bain Capital, which acquired control in 2013, and underscores strong investor confidence and market interest in the brand, despite its current valuation being below its 2018 peak.
