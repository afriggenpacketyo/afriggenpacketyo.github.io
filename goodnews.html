          <p>Shares for the financial services platform Robinhood surged over 160% this year, hitting a new all-time high despite several emerging challenges. The company is facing a regulatory investigation in Florida over allegations of deceptive marketing regarding its crypto trading costs. Additionally, Robinhood is receiving pushback for a new 25% fee on crypto staking rewards and is in a dispute with OpenAI over its tokenized stock offerings. These obstacles, along with potential industry-wide cost increases, present significant hurdles for the online broker's future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. military is intensifying its development of AI-driven air combat capabilities, recently conducting an advanced test integrating crewed fighter jets with uncrewed "loyal wingman" drones. In the exercise, pilots in an F-16 and an F-15 each controlled two XQ-58A Valkyrie drones, testing real-time coordination in a simulated combat environment. This push is part of a broader technological race with China to achieve the next generation of air dominance. The concept involves uncrewed aircraft being directed by pilots in traditional fighters to augment their capabilities and overwhelm adversaries.</p>

          <p>Texas-based space transportation company Firefly Aerospace has filed for an initial public offering, planning to trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "FLY." The company, known for its Alpha rockets and the successful landing of its Blue Ghost lunar lander, is going public amid a recovering IPO market. Firefly reported a significant revenue increase to nearly $56 million as of March, up from $8.3 million the previous year, though its net loss also grew. The move signals growing investor confidence in the space sector and a potential revitalization of the public offering landscape.</p>

          <p>The grounds of the South Carolina State Capitol will soon feature a statue of Robert Smalls, making it the first monument dedicated to a Black man at the site. Smalls was a Civil War hero who was born into slavery, commandeered a Confederate ship to freedom, and later served as a U.S. Congressman. His statue will join those of several white historical figures, many of whom have connections to the Confederacy and the Jim Crow era. The addition marks a significant step in diversifying the historical narratives represented in the state's most prominent public space.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova has reached her first Grand Slam final at Wimbledon, a remarkable comeback for an athlete who stepped away from the sport two years ago. Once a teenage prodigy, Anisimova took an indefinite break in 2023 to address burnout and mental health struggles, a decision she was warned could end her career at the top level. Her journey back has been challenging, but her run at Wimbledon, including a semifinal win over the world's top-ranked player, marks a triumphant return. Anisimova's success highlights a growing conversation around mental well-being in professional sports.</p>

          <p>The price of bitcoin surged to a new all-time high, briefly topping $118,000, driven by a massive influx of institutional investment into bitcoin ETFs. On Thursday, these funds recorded their largest single day of inflows for the year, totaling $1.18 billion. The rally was also fueled by a wave of short liquidations and broader market expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve policy in the future. This powerful move has pushed bitcoin to a nearly 10% gain for the week, signaling strong momentum and continued institutional adoption of the cryptocurrency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pace bowler Jofra Archer made a spectacular return to Test cricket for England after an absence of more than four years due to injury, making an immediate impact against India at Lord's. In his first over, he dismissed star batsman Yashasvi Jaiswal, showcasing the extreme pace and hostility that England has been missing. His opening spell was one of the fastest on record by an England bowler, reinvigorating the team's attack. While questions remain about his ability to sustain this intensity, his return is a hugely positive and exhilarating development for English cricket.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the Los Angeles Police Department from using rubber bullets and other less-lethal munitions on journalists covering protests. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from press rights organizations following incidents where reporters were targeted and injured by police during demonstrations against the Trump administration's immigration policies. The judge's order, which cited specific instances of officers aiming at clearly identifiable press members, bars police from using such force against journalists who do not pose an imminent threat, protecting their First Amendment rights.</p>
