          <p>President Trump delivered a commencement address at West Point, congratulating cadets and asserting his role in rebuilding the U.S. military, claiming it is now the most powerful in the world. He criticized past leaders for involving the military in "nation-building crusades" and highlighted his administration's focus on crushing adversaries and defending the American flag. Trump also touted a new peacetime recruiting record, attributing it to his administration's policies, though records indicate improvements began prior to his term. The article also mentions the removal of critical race theory from military academies and the disbanding of DEI programs.</p>

          <p>A power cut in southern France, suspected to be caused by sabotage, disrupted screenings on the final day of the Cannes Film Festival.
