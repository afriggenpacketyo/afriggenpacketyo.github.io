          <p>With the Hamilton, Larkhall, and Stonehouse by-election approaching, political parties are intensely campaigning to fill the seat left vacant after Christina McKelvie's death. The election is seen as a crucial test of voter sentiment since the UK general election, and Reform UK aims to demonstrate its growing influence in Scotland. Labour hopes to regain power after nearly two decades, focusing on the SNP's governmental record, while the SNP acknowledges Reform UK's potential impact. Many locals express frustration with politicians, citing concerns about the cost of living, healthcare access, and small business taxes, creating an opportunity for Reform UK to capitalize on public discontent.</p>

          <p>A recent YouGov survey indicates that 45% of 18 to 24-year-olds in the UK believe in God or Gods. A BBC News documentary series explores how religion impacts relationships and sex, featuring diverse individuals including an interfaith couple, a gay Muslim, and a former Jehovah's Witness. The interfaith couple, Adarsh and Nav, navigate disapproval from their communities due to Adarsh being Hindu and Nav being Sikh, while Junaid, a gay Muslim, was disowned by his family for his sexual orientation. Martin Riley, formerly a Jehovah's Witness, was expelled from his religion and ostracized by his family, ultimately leading him to reconsider his faith and become an atheist.</p>

          <p>Some European companies are expressing apprehension about sending employees to the U.S. due to stringent immigration checks and reports of detentions and deportations. While some businesses continue travel unabated, others, particularly in politically sensitive fields, are issuing new guidance such as advising employees to use wiped electronic devices or enter via Canada. Rising anxiety stems from increased visa scrutiny, social media monitoring, and the 'Catch and Revoke' policy, which revokes visas for any violation of U.S. law. Business travel is a significant revenue source for the U.S. economy, but a recent survey indicates that some companies anticipate a decline in travel volume due to U.S. policies.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's Kuomintang (KMT) is preparing for a leadership election in September, aiming to regain power after years on the political sidelines. However, the party faces an immediate challenge with a mass-recall campaign orchestrated by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which could undermine its legislative majority. Analysts warn that failing to address the recall challenge could disrupt the KMT's leadership transition. KMT chairman Eric Chu Li-luan has indicated his intention to step down after completing his term, suggesting Taichung mayor Lu Shiow-yen as a potential successor.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece discusses how Donald Trump's willingness to swerve, backpedal, and contradict himself contributes to his political resilience. The acronym 'TACO' (Trump Always Chickens Out) reflects Trump's strategy of testing limits but also being willing to pull back, reassuring swing voters. By recalibrating his positions on issues like China tariffs and relationships with figures like Elon Musk and Vladimir Putin, Trump has managed to maintain a normal level of approval in a polarized country. This ability to check himself and be checked by others is what a significant group of voters expect from his presidency.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the fallout from Donald Trump's actions against Harvard University, including threats to redirect research funding and review federal contracts.

          <p>The ban on the sale of single-use disposable vapes has come into force across the UK, aiming to protect children's health and the environment. Shops and supermarkets can no longer stock disposable vapes but can still sell rechargeable or refillable devices. Disposable vapes have been cited as a key driver in the rise in youth vaping, and millions are thrown away annually. Health experts say further regulation is needed to tackle youth vaping.</p>

          <p>Patti LuPone issued an apology after an open letter signed by hundreds of Broadway performers criticized her for 'inappropriate and unacceptable public comments,' particularly against Kecia Lewis. The apology followed an interview where LuPone used disrespectful language towards Lewis and made dismissive remarks about Audra McDonald. LuPone expressed regret for her behavior and stated her commitment to making amends. McDonald responded that she was unaware of any rift between them, and that they had not seen each other in 11 years.</p>
