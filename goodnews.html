          <p>Wells Fargo plans to pursue growth and expansion in investment banking, credit cards, and wealth management after regulators lifted a major growth restriction imposed due to a fake accounts scandal. CEO Charlie Scharf aims to make Wells Fargo a major Wall Street investment banking player and improve its consumer bank. Analysts expect the bank to show improvement in spending on risk and compliance costs, potentially boosting growth. The lifting of the $1.95 trillion asset cap allows Wells Fargo to compete more effectively with larger rivals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the most common reasons for conflict in relationships, including tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. Contempt, often disguised in non-verbal cues, is a significant predictor of divorce, while arguments about family often reflect unmet needs. Uneven distribution of labor and ineffective communication styles can also lead to conflict. The article offers strategies for moving past these issues, such as naming the effect, reassuring one another, and using the "five-second rule" to prevent escalation.</p>
