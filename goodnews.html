          <p>A mother's intuition about her toddler's persistent infections led to a devastating diagnosis of a rare and aggressive cancer. After Jonny Terrell experienced a continuous stream of ailments, his mother, Emily Robichau, pushed for answers, which ultimately revealed a grapefruit-sized malignant rhabdoid tumor in his liver. Following an intensive treatment plan involving complex chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation, two-year-old Jonny is now in remission. The family remains cautiously hopeful, navigating their new normal while undergoing careful surveillance to monitor for any recurrence of the disease.</p>

          <p>A landmark test flight in China suggests that a new AI-powered radar system cannot be effectively jammed, representing a potential paradigm shift in radar technology. During the test, the AI-enhanced system maintained target tracking continuity over 99% of the time, whereas conventional radar systems lost contact with the target for roughly a quarter of the engagement. The research, led by scientists at China's premier radar development hub, indicates that artificial intelligence can significantly boost detection rates and overcome traditional electronic countermeasures. This development could have significant implications for both military and civilian applications.</p>

          <p>Susan Stamberg, one of NPR's "founding mothers" and the first woman to anchor a daily national evening news broadcast in the U.S., is retiring after a distinguished career spanning over five decades. Known for her curious, sharp, and delightful interviewing style, she helped define the network's unique voice and personality when she began co-hosting "All Things Considered" in 1972. Her pioneering work broke barriers for women in broadcasting and was instrumental in transforming NPR from a fledgling network into a major media institution. Colleagues credit her with inspiring generations of journalists who followed her path.</p>

A student representative has highlighted a growing mental health crisis among young people, calling for a €100 billion investment in schools to provide better psychological support. Separately, Bavarian leader Markus Söder has questioned the feasibility of deploying German troops to Ukraine as part of NATO security guarantees, citing military readiness concerns. Meanwhile, a senior CDU politician has argued that the coalition government should shift further to the center-right to align with voter sentiment and implement social spending cuts.</p>

          <p>The BBC has confirmed that chef and presenter Matt Tebbutt will join Marcus Wareing and Monica Galetti as a judge on the next series of "MasterChef: The Professionals." Tebbutt's appointment follows the dismissal of former judge Gregg Wallace in July. Wallace was sacked after an independent inquiry upheld 45 allegations of misconduct against him, including unwelcome physical contact and inappropriate comments. Tebbutt, a longtime host of "Saturday Kitchen," expressed his honor in joining the program alongside two "titans of the food world." The BBC has not yet announced replacements for the main amateur series.</p>

          <p>China is designing a mission to test its ability to defend Earth from potential asteroid threats, according to a top researcher from the country's space program. The planned "kinetic impact demonstration mission" aims to target a small asteroid millions of kilometers away and alter its orbit by a few centimeters. This test would make China the second nation, after the United States, to successfully demonstrate this planetary defense capability. The mission will involve two spacecraft: one to observe and another to impact the asteroid, with the goal of launching it within the year.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-06 07:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As gold prices reach new records, driven by economic uncertainty and bets on a Federal Reserve rate cut, experts are advising on how investors can gain exposure to the precious metal. Gold is widely regarded as a safe-haven asset that performs well during periods of financial instability. Financial advisors generally recommend using exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of physical gold, as this is a more liquid, low-cost, and tax-efficient method than owning physical bullion. Despite its current popularity, it is typically suggested that gold should constitute less than 3% of a diversified investment portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ten years after its Broadway debut, the cultural phenomenon "Hamilton" is being re-evaluated as its filmed version arrives in theaters for the first time. The hip-hop musical about an American founding father was once celebrated as a progressive and hopeful narrative, closely aligned with the optimism of the Obama era. However, in the current political landscape, some of its themes and its portrayal of historical figures are viewed through a more critical lens. This article explores how the show's legacy has evolved, from a symbol of a diverse and aspirational America to a work whose celebratory tone can feel dated to some.</p>

His story appeals to both those who see him as a relatable, tech-savvy teen in Nike sneakers and those drawn to his deep, almost mystical devotion to the faith.

          <p>Following a strong first half of the year for cryptocurrencies, some analysts are highlighting specific digital assets that could see significant growth. Ethereum is positioned to benefit from its dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi) and the increasing institutional interest in staking. Chainlink, which provides crucial real-world data to blockchain networks, could soar with the expansion of stablecoins and tokenized assets. Meanwhile, Solana's low fees and fast transaction speeds make it a strong contender for increased DeFi activity and a potential spot ETF approval. (not investment advice)</p>

This highest civilian honor recognizes their legendary service in World War I, where they fought for 191 days despite facing intense racism and segregation within the U.S. military. The award ceremony was hailed as a long-overdue corrective, acknowledging the soldiers' bravery and sacrifice.

          <p>The increasing use of GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy is having a measurable impact on the snack food industry and consumer grocery habits. Recent data indicates that new users of these weight-loss medications reduce their overall grocery spending by 6% within six months, particularly cutting back on ultra-processed snacks and sugary drinks. In response, retailers are beginning to adapt their strategies, reformulating ready-made meals and adjusting product placements. While the high cost of the drugs currently limits a mass market shift, the trend suggests a potential long-term battlefield between pharmaceutical-driven health changes and traditional food companies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a rare move, the U.S. government has taken a roughly 10% equity stake in chipmaker Intel, becoming its largest single shareholder. The decision is not a response to an economic crisis but a strategic effort to boost domestic production of cutting-edge microchips amid intense competition with China and the race for artificial intelligence dominance. The government converted billions of dollars in grants from the CHIPS and Science Act into equity, aiming to reduce reliance on foreign manufacturers like Taiwan's TSMC. While such backing can be effective, experts note it also carries risks, including potential political pressure on the company's business decisions.</p>
