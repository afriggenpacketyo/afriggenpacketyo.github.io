          <h2>Analysis Shows Artificial Intelligence Impacting Entry-Level Job Market</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 09:15:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Artificial intelligence is significantly disrupting the labor market, with overall job postings declining and entry-level positions being particularly affected. According to experts, while some tech job declines predate the widespread use of AI, there is a causal link, though perhaps not as dramatic as some headlines suggest. Economists note that while roles like coding and accounting are at higher risk, jobs requiring empathy or physicality, such as healthcare and trades, are more secure. The long-term outlook suggests that while some jobs will be displaced, AI will also create new, currently unpredictable, job categories and could lead to major societal improvements.</p>

          <p>Ireland's women's rugby team has advanced to the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time since 2014 after a high-scoring 43-27 victory over Spain. Despite a spirited performance from the Spanish side, which scored five tries, Ireland secured a bonus-point win with seven tries of their own. Key performances from Anna McGann and Grace Moore helped seal the victory, though the team suffered a setback with an injury to co-captain Sam Monaghan. Ireland will now face New Zealand to determine the top team in their pool as they move into the knockout stage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a detailed personal essay, the author recounts her journey from a liberal, urban background to becoming an avid hunter in Montana, challenging the reflexive disdain for hunting often found on the political left. She argues that hunting can be a more honest, sustainable, and ethical way to consume meat compared to factory farming, fostering a deep connection to nature and conservation. The article explores the emotional complexity of taking an animal's life, the role of hunters in wildlife management funded by firearm taxes, and the ambivalence of participating in gun culture. The author suggests that hunters and vegetarians share more common ground in their thoughtful approach to food ethics than is commonly acknowledged.</p>

          <p>Actor Jeremy Allen White shares insights into his experience playing Bruce Springsteen in the upcoming film "Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere," which focuses on the creation of the 1982 album "Nebraska." In an interview, White discusses the daunting task of embodying the iconic musician, his process for connecting with Springsteen's feelings of fraudulence and trauma, and the challenges of learning to sing and play guitar for the role. He reveals that Springsteen himself was significantly involved in the film, which the musician called an "antibiopic." White also reflects on how the role gave him a new perspective on his own life and relationships.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $1.1 billion after no ticket matched all six numbers in the latest drawing. This makes the current prize the fifth-largest in the game's history, attracting widespread attention from players across the country. A potential winner would have the choice between receiving the full amount spread over 30 years or a lump-sum payment of approximately $498.4 million before taxes. Despite the extremely long odds of winning, at 1 in 292.2 million, the massive prize ensures continued high ticket sales for the next drawing.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," neurosurgeon Dr. Sanjay Gupta details advancements in understanding and treating chronic pain. The article highlights the concept of "reverse translational research," which prioritizes patients' real-world experiences to guide laboratory studies, a reversal of the traditional bench-to-bedside model. This approach has led to breakthroughs, such as mapping the unique neural signatures of chronic pain in the brain for the first time. This innovation allows for the objective measurement of a subjective experience and has paved the way for treatments like deep brain stimulation to predict and interrupt pain signals.</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz highlights the little-known story of how surfing was introduced to the U.S. mainland in 1885 by three teenage Hawaiian princes. The royal siblings, David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui, were attending a military school nearby when they fashioned surfboards from local redwood trees. Their demonstration of what was then called "surfboard swimming" at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River captivated locals and planted the seeds for the sport's popularity. This act of "surf diplomacy" is now being recognized for its crucial role in bringing a royal Hawaiian tradition to American shores.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trend in state and local taxation is targeting the real estate of the wealthy, with several states proposing or enacting new levies on expensive second homes. Rhode Island's new surcharge, nicknamed the "Taylor Swift Tax" after the pop star's Watch Hill property, imposes an extra fee on non-primary residences valued over $1 million. Similar measures are being implemented in states like Montana, driven by tight budgets and populist sentiment over rising housing costs. Real estate brokers argue these taxes unfairly penalize wealthy part-time residents who contribute significantly to local economies without heavily using municipal services like schools.</p>

          <p>As part of its ongoing efforts to combat single-use plastics, the state of South Australia will ban the sale and distribution of fish-shaped soy sauce containers. These iconic packets, common in sushi takeaways, are made of recyclable plastic but are often too small to be processed correctly by recycling machinery, leading them to end up as waste. The ban is an extension of previous legislation that targeted items like plastic straws and carrier bags. The government's policy aims to reduce pollution and protect marine life, as officials warn the flow of plastic into the ocean is on track to triple by 2040 without action.</p>

Their artistic romance began shortly after they met at a party, with Katz being captivated by what he describes as her classic American beauty. An exhibition at New York's Jewish Museum showcases 40 of these portraits, which span their long marriage. Curators note that Katz is less interested in capturing his wife's soul and more focused on style, appearance, and the way light creates shapes on her face, resulting in detached, almost abstract portraits that allow viewers to see themselves reflected.</p>

          <p>According to Federal Reserve data, the median retirement savings for American households aged 55 to 64 is approximately $185,000, a sum that is likely insufficient for a comfortable retirement. A recent AARP survey also found that one in five Americans over 50 have no retirement savings at all. To address this shortfall, the article suggests several strategies for those looking to secure their nest egg later in life. These include consulting with a financial advisor, considering a Gold IRA to hedge against inflation, using micro-investing apps, and finding additional sources of passive income like real estate.

          <p>This philosophical essay addresses the common feeling of guilt or misery when experiencing personal success while the world is facing numerous humanitarian and political crises. The author draws on ancient religious and philosophical concepts that view humanity as a single body, suggesting it is moral to feel the pain of others. However, the piece argues that this shared experience should also include the joys of others, a concept known as "sympathetic joy" or "freudenfreude." The author concludes that embracing both horror and delight is part of being a connected human, and allowing oneself to feel good at times can be a form of resistance.</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has issued a clarification that provides a crucial opportunity for consumers hoping to claim the federal electric vehicle tax credit, which is set to expire after September 30. According to the new guidance, a taxpayer can still qualify for the credit, worth up to $7,500, if they enter into a "written binding contract" and make a payment for the vehicle on or before the deadline. This means consumers do not need to take physical possession of the car by September 30, allowing those who have ordered an EV to still receive the tax break when their vehicle is delivered later.</p>
