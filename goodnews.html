          <h2>German Cabinet to Discuss Military Service Law Amid Anti-War Protests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 03:49:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's cabinet is set to discuss a new draft law on military service, initially focusing on voluntary recruitment to address a significant shortfall in the Bundeswehr, which needs 80,000 additional professional soldiers and 140,000 reservists under NATO plans. This discussion occurs amidst an anti-war alliance, "Rheinmetall Entwaffen," blocking access to a regional armed forces careers center in Cologne, protesting against involvement in perceived "wars of the ruling class." Defense Minister Boris Pistorius aims to send a clear signal about focusing on voluntary service, though the reintroduction of compulsory military service, suspended in 2011, remains a parliamentary option if expansion plans prove too slow to meet NATO commitments.</p>

          <p>Mitch Brown, a former Australian Rules Football (AFL) player for the West Coast Eagles, has made history by becoming the first openly gay or bisexual man in the league's 129-year history, revealing that hiding his sexuality significantly contributed to his retirement. Brown hopes his disclosure will foster a safer, more inclusive environment for others in the sport, openly criticizing the AFL's "hyper-masculinity" and recalling numerous homophobic comments on the field. Behavioral science experts believe Brown's frankness about the league's cultural issues could drive significant change within Australian men's sports, offering a powerful message of visibility and support for closeted players at all levels.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its mammoth Starship rocket, marking a significant comeback after earlier explosive failures and completing its 10th test flight with key developmental milestones. The more-than-400-foot rocket achieved its first successful payload deployment of eight mock Starlink satellites, relit its Raptor engine in orbit, and stress-tested its reusable heat shield, a critical component for Elon Musk's reusability goals. Both the reusable Super Heavy booster and the spacecraft executed controlled splashdowns, paving the way for Starship's role in NASA's Artemis program to return astronauts to the Moon and Musk's broader aspirations for Mars colonization.</p>

Sunac saw its interim loss narrow by 14.4% to 12.8 billion yuan, benefiting from lower operating and financing costs. These improved results underscore the positive impact of government stimulus measures and recovering retail consumption, offering a glimmer of hope for an industry that faced severe debt crises just a year ago.

          <p>Denmark's National Museum has unveiled a miniature 10th-century figurine, carved from walrus tusk, which is believed to be the first "portrait" of a Viking, challenging conventional perceptions of the era. The 1.2-inch piece depicts a meticulously groomed man with an imperial mustache, braided beard, and neatly styled hair, suggesting high status, possibly even King Harald Bluetooth. Discovered in Norway in 1796 and long forgotten in museum archives, the figurine's detailed carvings and unique smiling expression stand out from other Viking Age art, which typically features animal motifs and simpler human representations. Curators describe the discovery as a rare and exciting glimpse into individual identity from that period.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton's performance struggles in his first Ferrari season have ignited a debate about his adaptability and the potential effects of age in Formula 1, particularly with the new ground-effect car regulations. While his qualifying pace against Charles Leclerc has shown improvement since the season's start, Hamilton has expressed self-doubt, reminiscent of past remarks. This article explores how the 2022 car design, requiring a different driving style, may not suit Hamilton's traditional corner-attacking technique, making adaptation challenging as he turned 40. Although rule changes next year could offer a "magic solution" if they better suit his style, the reality of biological aging and its impact on an athlete's ability to adjust remains a significant factor.</p>

          <p>China has successfully tested a new residual heat removal system, designed to enhance the meltdown-proof capabilities of its next-generation, radioactive waste-recycling nuclear power plants. The China Institute of Atomic Energy hailed this as a significant breakthrough for fourth-generation integral fast reactors, which utilize liquid metal as a coolant and operate with a closed-loop fuel cycle, reprocessing spent fuel within the same facility. Unlike conventional thermal reactors, fast reactors employ high-energy neutrons, making them considerably more fuel-efficient and capable of breeding more fissile material for reuse. This advancement represents a crucial step towards developing safer, more sustainable, and highly efficient nuclear energy technologies.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits saw a narrowed decline of 1.5% year-on-year in July, a significant improvement from previous months, as Beijing's campaign against "involution," or excessive price wars, began to ease pressure on company profitability. While profits in the mining sector plunged, manufacturing and utilities experienced improvements, and foreign and private enterprises saw their profits increase. This article highlights that government policies aimed at recovering consumer price levels are showing early effects, particularly in raw-material manufacturing. However, factory-gate deflation persists, and analysts expect continued challenges until market pressures force industry consolidation and the exit of uncompetitive firms, despite the political and economic efforts to stabilize the sector.
