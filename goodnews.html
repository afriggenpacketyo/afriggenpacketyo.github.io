          <p>Following a series of interviews, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has reduced the list of potential candidates for the next Federal Reserve chair from eleven to five. The finalists include current Fed officials Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, as well as Kevin Hassett, Kevin Warsh, and Rick Rieder. Bessent is reportedly seeking a candidate with fresh perspectives on monetary policy and a willingness to reform the central bank's structure and mission. The final decision will be made by President Trump after another round of interviews.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has expressed his continued support for lowering interest rates but emphasized the need for a cautious and deliberate approach. He pointed to conflicting economic data, with a potentially weakening labor market on one hand and strong GDP growth on the other, as a reason for prudence. Waller, who is a finalist to become the next Fed Chair, stated that the central bank should not move aggressively in case it misjudges the direction of the economy. His comments suggest a more measured pace of cuts than some of his colleagues have advocated for. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Josh Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, the most significant error young investors make is prioritizing the preservation of wealth over its growth. He argues that due to their long time horizon, young people should be less concerned with downside risk and should be fully invested in stocks to benefit from long-term compounding. Instead of holding cash or bonds, he advises using low-cost index funds or ETFs that track the broad market. This strategy allows time to recover from market volatility while maximizing the potential for significant growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A decade ago, Dutch football legend Edgar Davids embarked on a surreal journey as the player-head coach for Barnet, a team at the bottom of England's Football League. The iconic midfielder, known for his tenacious play and signature goggles, brought a top-tier mentality to the club, demanding to be called 'Sir' and celebrating training goals intensely. Despite nearly saving the team from relegation and not taking a salary, his tenure was marked by bizarre incidents, including wearing the number one shirt and skipping some away games, before his eventual departure.</p>

          <p>Costco has successfully developed into one of the world's largest clothing retailers, with its annual apparel sales growing nearly 40% to $9.7 billion between 2019 and 2024.

The company's success is driven by offering a limited but appealing selection of popular brands alongside its own Kirkland Signature private label.

This spending, which added an estimated $145 billion to the U.S. economy in 2024, is primarily directed toward restaurants, entertainment, and real estate rather than stereotypical luxury items like high-end cars.

          <p>Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has officially designated Google's search and search advertising services with "strategic market status," activating new regulatory powers. The move follows an investigation that concluded Google has substantial and entrenched market power, with over 90% of UK searches on its platform. While not a finding of wrongdoing, this designation means the CMA can now impose legally binding conduct requirements on Google, potentially forcing changes to ensure fairer search rankings and greater control for content publishers.</p>

          <p>A significant change to 401(k) plans is set to affect a popular tax break for higher-earning workers. Starting in 2026, a provision from the Secure 2.0 Act will mandate that individuals who earned more than $145,000 in the previous year must make all their age-based catch-up contributions to an after-tax Roth account. This change eliminates the option for these earners to make traditional pretax catch-up contributions, thereby removing the upfront tax deduction. Financial advisors suggest that affected workers should begin planning now for this shift in retirement savings strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Knight First Amendment Institute, a group affiliated with Columbia University, has achieved a landmark legal victory against the Trump administration. A federal judge ruled that the detention and attempted deportation of pro-Palestinian students was an unconstitutional effort designed to chill free speech. The institute's defiant legal stance contrasts sharply with Columbia University's own more conciliatory approach to the administration, which recently involved a settlement over antisemitism claims. The ruling is being hailed as a crucial defense of fundamental constitutional principles.</p>
