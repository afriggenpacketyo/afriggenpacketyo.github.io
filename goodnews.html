          <p>A recent Zillow analysis indicates that while the median price for a mansion in the U.S. has risen to $1.4 million, several cities still offer large homes for under $1 million. Metro areas such as Buffalo, New York; Indianapolis, Indiana; Cleveland, Ohio; and Memphis, Tennessee, have median mansion prices below this threshold. This affordability contrasts sharply with coastal markets like San Jose, where the median mansion costs $6.5 million. The report notes that in 2021, nearly half of U.S. mansions were valued below $1 million, a figure that has now dropped to just three in ten.</p>

          <p>Shares of UnitedHealth Group experienced their largest single-day jump in five years after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a new $1.6 billion stake in the company. The health insurer's stock had been down nearly 50% for the year amid a Justice Department investigation and a lowered earnings outlook. The investment from Berkshire, along with new positions from other notable investors like Michael Burry and David Tepper, is being interpreted as a significant vote of confidence in the company's future. Analysts suggest this could stabilize the stock and attract further investment in the managed care sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing a record $1.21 trillion, many households are struggling to manage their balances amid high interest rates and inflation. For a typical $3,000 balance, the minimum monthly payment can range from $60 to $85, depending on the issuer's calculation method. Paying only the minimum can trap consumers in a long-term debt cycle, costing thousands in interest. To escape this, financial experts recommend strategies such as paying more than the minimum, utilizing balance transfer cards with 0% introductory APRs, or considering debt consolidation loans to secure a lower, fixed interest rate.

          <p>A technology analyst has described a potential U.S. government intervention in Intel as "essential" for national security, following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in the struggling chipmaker. The move is seen as a way to revive Intel and reduce U.S. reliance on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor. While details are unconfirmed, funds from the CHIPS Act could be used for the investment. The news caused Intel's stock to climb, as some analysts argue that government intervention is necessary after the company has failed to correct its course independently. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two years after a catastrophic wildfire killed over 100 people and destroyed much of the historic town of Lahaina, Maui, the community is still on a long road to recovery. While debris has been cleared, only about 50 homes have been rebuilt, and large areas remain empty. Mayor Richard Bissen, who faced criticism for the initial disaster response, is now focused on expediting permits and supporting residents. Despite the slow progress, community members and local businesses like the reopened Old Lahaina Luau express a commitment to rebuilding and moving forward, acknowledging the long-term effort required.</p>

          <p>A loud sonic boom was heard across parts of eastern and southeastern England after the Royal Air Force scrambled three Typhoon fighter jets to intercept a civilian aircraft. The plane had lost contact with air traffic control while traveling from Nice.

A sonic boom occurs when an aircraft exceeds the speed of sound, creating shockwaves that produce an explosive noise, which in this case startled residents and shook houses across several counties.</p>

Financial experts advise shopping around for the best available rates, as some online banks may still offer competitive yields. It is also a good time to re-evaluate one's budget to determine if a larger amount can be locked into a new long-term CD to maximize earnings in a declining rate environment. Communicating plans with the current bank is crucial to avoid automatic rollover into a new account with a lower rate. (not investment advice)</p>
