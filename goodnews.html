          <p>President Trump attended a NATO summit in the Netherlands, focusing on securing commitments from allies to increase defense spending to at least 5% of GDP. Prior to the summit, NATO had already agreed to boost defense spending, with Secretary General Mark Rutte praising Trump's actions in Iran and securing the 5% commitment. Russia's war in Ukraine also remains a key concern, with discussions ongoing about explicitly naming Russia as the main threat to NATO in the summit's communique. The United States carried out strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, leading to retaliatory missile fire on a U.S. base in Qatar, before a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel was announced by Trump.</p>
