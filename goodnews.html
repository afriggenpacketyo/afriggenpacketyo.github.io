          <h2>Japan Negotiates Tariff Removal with U.S. Amidst Inflation Concerns</h2>

          <p>Japan is steadfast in its demand for the complete elimination of tariffs imposed by the U.S., specifically a 25% levy on cars and steel/aluminum, as a precondition for any trade agreement with Washington. The government dismisses cutting consumption tax to relieve inflation, citing it as a vital revenue source. Meanwhile, household spending in Japan has declined for the second consecutive year due to rising food prices, impacting private consumption, which constitutes over half of Japan's GDP. The government aims to hold a third round of talks in mid-May to discuss tariff removal with the United States.</p>

          <p>Country music legend Randy Travis, who suffered a stroke in 2013 leaving him with aphasia, has made a comeback with the help of artificial intelligence. Travis collaborated with musician James Dupr√© and producer Kyle Lehning to create new music, including the single "Horses in Heaven." AI was used to model Travis's voice using raw vocals from his previous songs and Dupr√©'s vocal line, with the final product being tweaked by Travis and Lehning in the studio. Travis has also been on his "More Life Tour" since last spring and recently extended dates through fall 2025. Travis's wife, Mary, emphasizes the creativity involved in the AI process and hopes it sets a precedent for its use in music.</p>

          <p>Nvidia intends to release a modified version of its H20 AI chip for the Chinese market in July, in an attempt to navigate U.S. export controls. The downgraded H20 chip will feature reduced memory capacity, addressing concerns raised by U.S. officials regarding its export license. This move represents Nvidia's ongoing efforts to maintain its presence in the crucial Chinese market, as Washington increases restrictions on China's access to advanced semiconductor technology. The company declined to comment on the specifics of the modified chip's design.</p>

          <p>Shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China's largest contract chip maker, experienced a nearly 7% decline following a first-quarter earnings miss. While revenue increased by approximately 28% year-on-year to $2.24 billion, and profit attributable to shareholders surged by 162% to $188 million, these figures fell short of expectations due to production fluctuations affecting average selling prices. SMIC anticipates revenue to decline sequentially in the current quarter, with a reduced gross margin. However, the company's wafer shipments increased significantly, driven by geopolitical changes and government policies, with capacity utilization reaching 89.6%.</p>

          <p>China's exports experienced an 8.1% surge in April, driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which compensated for a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. due to tariffs. Imports, however, only slightly decreased by 0.2%. Exports to the U.S. plummeted by over 21%, while imports dropped nearly 14%. The surge in overall exports may be attributed to transshipment through third countries and pre-tariff contracts. China's exports to ASEAN countries saw a significant increase, particularly to Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. Meanwhile, exports to the EU rose while imports from the EU fell.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested that tariffs on goods from China may be reduced as top trade officials from both countries prepare for talks. Trump noted that tariffs are currently at their peak of 145%, implying a decrease is anticipated. The meeting, scheduled to take place in Switzerland, signals a potential de-escalation in the trade war between the two economic powers. China's Vice Foreign Minister Hua Chunying expressed confidence in Beijing's ability to manage trade issues with the U.S. However, analysts caution that systemic frictions remain, and any tariff cuts are likely to be minor.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade deal framework with Britain, aiming to lower the burden of his tariffs and potentially deliver a political win for Prime Minister Starmer. The deal, the first of Trump's second term, affirms reciprocity and fairness in international trade. While details are being finalized, it includes increased access for the U.S. to the U.K. market for agricultural products. A 10% tariff on U.K. imports remains, but the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. will be subject to that rate. Commerce Secretary Lutnick estimates the deal will generate $6 billion in revenue for the U.S.</p>

Analysts suggest that the full impact of US tariffs may not yet be visible, and exporters are finding ways around the tariffs. Upcoming US-China talks could lead to a partial rollback of US duties, but a full reversal is unlikely.</p>

          <p>Producers of tungsten products in developed nations are being urged to diversify their raw material supply sources after China imposed export restrictions on critical industrial metals. Beijing added tungsten to its export restriction list in February, leading to concerns among industries reliant on the metal. US defense contractors face a deadline to stop using Chinese tungsten by January 1, 2027. Tungsten, known for its hardness and high melting point, is used in various applications, including cutting tools, ammunition, and clean energy technologies. China accounted for the majority of global raw tungsten ore mined last year.</p>
