          <p>Four partners, including Democratic attorney Karen Dunn, have left Paul Weiss after the firm made a controversial agreement with President Trump to avoid federal targeting. The agreement involved auditing hiring practices and dedicating $40 million to pro bono services. The executive order from Trump criticized Paul Weiss for employing Mark Pomerantz and for taking on a pro bono case involving the January 6 Capitol riot. Other law firms chose to sue the administration, arguing the orders were unconstitutional, after Trump's apparent deals with Paul Weiss and other firms proved controversial in the legal community. </p>

          <p>China has greenlit the construction of a 767-kilometer canal connecting Jiangxi province, a rare earth hub, to Zhejiang, a wealthy coastal province. This mega-project aims to lower logistical costs and integrate inland regions with coastal hubs. The Jiangxi-Zhejiang Canal is expected to be the most expensive artificial canal ever built in China, with an estimated investment of $44.4 billion. The canal, designed as a Class III waterway, will accommodate 1,000-tonne vessels and handle around 25 million tonnes of cargo annually, connecting Jiangxi's manufacturing sector with Zhejiang's seaports.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers to lower prices to 2,000 yen per 5 kg. This move aims to address rising rice prices that have hurt households amid inflation. The government intends to begin negotiated contracts and explore online sales to ensure broad distribution. The average rice price in Japanese supermarkets reached a record high, doubling last year's level due to a poor harvest and increased demand. The government plans to initially release 300,000 tons of rice. </p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that the United States increasingly recognizes Japan's economic importance after talks with U.S. officials. Akazawa urged the removal of additional tariffs imposed on Japan. Prime Minister Ishiba and Trump spoke by phone and agreed that upcoming talks should be productive. Japan's position remains that the tariffs are regrettable, but Japan is exploring potential compromises to secure an early deal. Trump's reciprocal tariff regime imposes a 14 percent country-specific tariff on Japan, resulting in a total rate of 24 percent. </p>

The iconic singer was advised to refrain from performing and will undergo physical therapy. Fans who purchased tickets will receive automatic refunds. NPH is a condition where fluid builds up in the brain, causing pressure on brain tissue. The condition is relatively uncommon and more likely to occur in older people, but is usually treatable with a surgical procedure to implant a shunt.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that Anna's Hummingbirds have adapted to human influence by altering the size and shape of their beaks due to the prevalence of hummingbird feeders. The beaks have become longer and more slender to better extract nectar from feeders. Male hummingbirds' beaks have also grown pointier for fighting off competitors. The hummingbird's range has expanded northward due to the increasing popularity of feeders and the abundance of eucalyptus forests. The study highlights how quickly evolution can occur in response to human actions.</p>
