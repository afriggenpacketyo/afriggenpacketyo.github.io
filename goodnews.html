          <p>A former fortune cookie factory in Denver has been transformed into an art gallery called the Cookie Factory, founded by Amanda Precourt. The space, which opened in May and is free to the public, aims to promote mental wellness through art and community engagement. The inaugural exhibition features work by artist Sam Falls, created in Colorado's Yampa River Valley, and is titled "Nothing without nature." Precourt hopes the Cookie Factory will be seen as a gift to the city, fostering discussion and connection through art. The current exhibit will run through September before switching to a new artist.</p>

Voters are considering both national and local issues, particularly affordability, as they head to the polls. Meanwhile, high temperatures in New York City could impact voter turnout, with the city's election board preparing for potential heat-related issues at polling places.</p>

          <p>Dr. Ida Jones, the Morgan State University archivist, explains the historical significance of Juneteenth, the day enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, learned of their freedom. Juneteenth marks a celebration of freedom and identity for African Americans, connecting their African heritage with their American experience. Baltimore, with its large free Black population before the Civil War, held early Juneteenth parades. Dr. Jones encourages celebrating with a purpose, such as visiting a museum to understand the lived experience of freedom and the sacrifices made for it. Learning about the history behind Juneteenth helps us understand collective ancestry and sacrifice, as well as appreciate the opportunities we have today.</p>

          <p>Many taxpayers make avoidable mistakes when dealing with tax debt, leading to costly penalties and legal trouble. Common errors include assuming small debts don't matter, ignoring IRS letters, and thinking debts must be paid all at once. The IRS offers various payment options, such as installment agreements and Offers in Compromise, for those facing financial hardship. It is crucial to file returns on time, even without payment, to avoid steeper penalties and cooperate with the IRS. Hiring qualified professionals and understanding the limitations of bankruptcy are also important for managing tax debt effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

The ad, which likened using the word "gay" negatively to offensive stereotypes, has been credited with making inroads on curbing the term's use. It is considered both humorous and over-the-top, while also spotlighting a pervasive issue in a memorable fashion, and the ad can act as a success story for advancing social issues through media messaging.</p>

          <p>Protesters in Venice are claiming an "enormous victory" after Jeff Bezos and his wedding guests were forced to move their main celebration to the Arsenale, away from the city center. The wedding, a star-studded event, has attracted protest from locals fighting over-tourism, climate change activists, and those who oppose Bezos' support for Donald Trump. Activists argue that the lavish event represents an unsustainable lifestyle, while city officials defend the economic benefits of such high-profile visitors. Despite the controversy, the wedding is expected to bring significant economic benefits to Venice.</p>

          <p>Caitlin Morgan, a Swansea University graduate, applied for 646 jobs before finally securing a position as a trainee accountant. After 18 months of job hunting, she questioned whether her degree was worth the effort, given the high competition for graduate roles. Morgan believes that the use of artificial intelligence (AI) by companies in their filtering process may have contributed to her initial rejections. She adjusted her CV to be more compatible with resume screening programs that use AI. Despite the challenges, she persevered and will begin her new role in London in September.</p>
