          <p>Hundreds of workers were temporarily unable to exit the Kloof gold mine near Johannesburg following a 'shaft incident' involving a rock winder skip door that opened at a loading point, impacting multiple levels below. Sibanye-Stillwater, the mining company, reported that all 260 employees were accounted for and safe, provided with food while safety procedures were implemented. A detailed risk assessment led to the decision to keep employees at the sub-shaft station to avoid long-distance walking until it was safe to proceed to the surface. The company expected to bring all affected employees to the surface later in the day after completing safety and shaft examinations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's energy regulator, Ofgem, announced a decrease in the energy price cap effective July, leading to an average monthly saving of ¬£11 for typical gas and electricity bills. This is the first price drop in a year, potentially saving households around ¬£129 annually; however, prices remain significantly higher than historical levels. Ofgem encourages consumers to shop for fixed-rate deals, which could yield annual savings of up to ¬£200, though this excludes those already on fixed tariffs. The regulator is also considering changes to standing charges, as many households face significant debt to energy suppliers.</p>

Japan's chief negotiator is expected to continue ministerial talks in Washington, urging the U.S. to reconsider its tariff policy. Ishiba also addressed domestic concerns about rising rice prices, indicating a review of the policy controlling rice output to achieve prices satisfactory for both producers and consumers.</p>

          <p>President Trump has repeatedly claimed that military recruitment is at a 30-year high due to his leadership, but military records indicate that enlistments began rebounding before his reelection. While recruitment numbers have increased, experts attribute this to Biden-era programs like the Army's Future Soldier Prep Course and the Navy's Future Sailor Prep Course. These programs help candidates meet enlistment requirements, as over 70% of American youths don't meet the qualifications for military service. Trump also falsely claimed that enlistments fell to record lows during President Biden's last year in office.</p>

          <p>Bielefeld, Germany, once the subject of jokes for its perceived blandness, now embodies the stability that many Germans long for. The city's economy is diverse, and its soccer team, Arminia, is having a successful season. While not immune to social issues, Bielefeld prides itself on being welcoming and inclusive, with initiatives to support people with disabilities. The article contrasts Bielefeld's stability with the challenges facing Germany, such as economic competition and social divisions, suggesting that the city represents an ideal that many Germans feel may no longer be attainable.</p>
