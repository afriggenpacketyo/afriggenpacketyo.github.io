          <p>Oil prices experienced a decrease of 2% due to the announcement of an Iran-Israel ceasefire, which alleviated concerns regarding supply disruptions and the potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz. The Ice Brent contract for August expiry was trading at $69.76 per barrel, while the front-month August Nymex WTI contract was at $66.85 per barrel. Despite these declines, oil prices had previously increased by roughly 10% due to hostilities between Iran and Israel. The International Energy Agency has reassured markets that it possesses 1.2 billion barrels of emergency stockpiles, and some OPEC+ alliance members have been increasing output.

          <p>A Swansea University graduate, Caitlin Morgan, secured a job as a trainee accountant after submitting 647 applications over 18 months. Morgan's persistence was rewarded after facing numerous rejections and a lack of feedback. Research indicates a record high competition for graduate roles, with an average of 140 applications per job. Morgan adjusted her CV to better suit AI resume screening programs, which improved her chances of reaching assessment stages.

          <p>Natalie Fleet, the Bolsover MP who was sexually assaulted, is campaigning to change the law to remove parental rights from rapists. Fleet is aiming to amend the Victims and Courts Bill with the support of ministers. The proposed change would suspend a child rapist's ability to make decisions about their children's lives. She said that the prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, was not aware that such a law did not exist.</p>
