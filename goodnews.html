          <p>Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid publicly supported Travis Kelce's "passion" after the pair had their second sideline confrontation in consecutive weeks during the Chiefs' 22-9 victory over the New York Giants. Reid downplayed the incident, stating he was "OK with that" and that Kelce's emotional outbursts stemmed from his intense commitment to the game. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes also reinforced the strong relationship between the coach and tight end, emphasizing that such displays are characteristic of great players. The article highlights the ongoing dynamic between the two, which has been observed in previous high-stakes games.</p>

          <p>London Gatwick Airport's £2.2bn second runway project has been approved by the Transport Secretary, aiming to boost economic growth and create thousands of jobs. The plan involves relocating the existing Northern Runway by 12 meters for regular use, projected to increase annual flights to 389,000 and passenger capacity to 80 million by the late 2030s. While hailed by the Chancellor as a key step to "get Britain building again," the project faces strong opposition from environmental groups, who label it a "disaster" for climate efforts. Gatwick has agreed to stricter noise controls and public transport targets to mitigate concerns.</p>

The visit aims to re-establish military communication channels, which Beijing severed in 2022 following former House speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. The delegation emphasized the need to "recalibrate the bilateral relationship on diplomatic, economic and security issues," indicating efforts to foster dialogue on peace and security.

          <h2>New Research Challenges Myths on Black Two-Parent Families and Inequality</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 07:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sociologist Christina Cross's book, "Inherited Inequality," challenges the prevalent idea that increasing two-parent Black families would largely resolve racial inequality. Her research demonstrates that Black children in two-parent households still face significantly greater struggles than white children in similar family structures, performing only as well as white children from single-parent homes. Cross argues that the singular focus on marriage promotion diverts attention and resources from more effective interventions, such as direct cash assistance or childcare subsidies. The article highlights persistent resource gaps, like income and wealth, that contribute to ongoing inequality even within two-parent Black families.</p>

          <p>Build-A-Bear Workshop reported record-breaking revenue in the first half of fiscal 2025, with its stock up approximately 60% year-to-date, defying broader retail headwinds like tariffs and declining mall traffic. CEO Sharon Price John attributes this success to strategic diversification beyond traditional malls into cruise ships and amusement parks, and effectively targeting adults with the brand's nostalgic appeal. The company's ability to subtly adjust pricing on new products and its strong emotional connection with consumers of all ages have also been key factors in its sustained growth.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Longevity experts are cautioning that several foods often perceived as healthy can actually detract from long-term health due to hidden sugars, excessive sodium, or a lack of crucial nutrients. These include overly processed meat alternatives, instant oatmeal, fruit juice, acai bowls, and many protein powders and bars, which frequently contain high levels of added sugar or sodium, or lack the fiber found in whole foods. The article also advises consuming whole eggs rather than just egg whites, emphasizing the vital nutrients like choline and Vitamin D present in the yolk. Adhering to whole, unprocessed foods remains the primary recommendation for promoting longevity.</p>

          <p>Progressive mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is maintaining a commanding lead in the New York City mayoral race despite millions of dollars spent by the billionaire class and wealthy real estate lobby to oppose him. Mamdani's platform, which includes freezing rent prices and slightly raising taxes on the wealthiest 1%, has triggered a concerted effort from traditional big-money Democratic donors, who are rallying behind independent candidate Andrew Cuomo. Polls indicate Mamdani holds a significant lead over Cuomo, suggesting that voters prioritize his proposed solutions for affordable housing over the concerns of the city's financial elite.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and mutual funds, while both offering diversified asset baskets, present distinct characteristics crucial for investors. ETFs trade like stocks on an exchange, providing real-time pricing, whereas mutual funds transact once daily at the market close. ETFs generally offer greater tax efficiency due to their "in-kind" transaction mechanism, which often avoids capital gains distributions, and typically feature lower expense ratios. However, mutual funds provide a broader selection of investment strategies and are more commonly integrated into 401(k) plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Citi Private Bank survey reveals that family offices are optimistic about their 2025 returns, with most anticipating 5-10% or more, and continue to favor direct investments in private companies. However, there's a noticeable shift away from startup and early-stage investing towards growth-stage opportunities, driven by a perception of reduced risk. Family offices are also leveraging their stable cash flow from operating businesses to make opportunistic acquisitions of illiquid assets from institutional investors.

          <p>A new FDA-approved nerve stimulator is offering significant hope for individuals with severe rheumatoid arthritis, as demonstrated by Lynn Milam's dramatic recovery after years of debilitating pain. The device, implanted in the neck, delivers electrical pulses to the vagus nerve, signaling the brain to reduce inflammation-regulating proteins in the spleen. The pivotal clinical trial showed meaningful improvement in 35% of patients who had not responded to other powerful drugs. This medical breakthrough represents a new approach to treating autoimmune diseases by leveraging the body's own mechanisms, despite minor potential side effects like temporary voice changes.</p>
