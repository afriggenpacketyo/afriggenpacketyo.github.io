          <p>The U.S. has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, establishing a 15% tariff rate on Japanese exports, which includes a reduction for automobiles from the previous 25%. President Trump stated the deal involves a $550 billion investment from Japan into the United States and will open Japanese markets to American goods like cars and agricultural products. The announcement spurred a major rally in Japanese markets, with stocks for automakers like Toyota and Honda surging in response to the more favorable tariff terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's women's football team has reached its third consecutive major final after a tumultuous and dramatic journey at Euro 2025. The Lionesses overcame an opening game loss, off-field distractions including retirements, and multiple near-eliminations, including a quarter-final comeback from 2-0 down against Sweden. Their semi-final victory over Italy was sealed with a last-minute winner in extra time, capping a run defined by resilience, late goals, and what their manager described as being "like a movie."</p>

          <p>Forwards Chloe Kelly and Michelle Agyemang have become England's decisive "super subs" at Euro 2025, drawing comparisons to the impactful duo of Russo and Toone from the 2022 tournament. The two Arsenal teammates have consistently changed games after coming off the bench, with both being instrumental in the quarter-final comeback against Sweden. In the semi-final against Italy, 19-year-old Agyemang scored the stoppage-time equalizer before Kelly secured the win with a dramatic extra-time goal.</p>

          <p>A shipwreck discovered on the Scottish island of Sanday has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, a vessel with a storied history from the 18th century.

A combination of high-tech dendrochronology and local community research uncovered its identity after its timbers were exposed by a storm, revealing the final chapter of a ship that was wrecked in 1788.</p>
