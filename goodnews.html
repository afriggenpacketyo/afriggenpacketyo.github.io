          <p>Barron Trump has reportedly transitioned from New York University's main campus to its program in Washington, D.C., a move that places him closer to his parents. The NYU D.C. program, which accepts a limited number of students, focuses on integrating coursework with professional opportunities related to government and public policy. While Barron Trump was previously enrolled in the Stern School of Business, his move has sparked speculation about a potential shift in his academic focus toward politics. This decision keeps him in close proximity to his family as his father, Donald Trump, serves his second presidential term.</p>

          <p>A Delta Air Lines flight bound for Boston made a safe emergency landing at Miami International Airport shortly after takeoff due to a bird strike. The incident reportedly involved one of the aircraft's engines, prompting the crew to immediately return to the airport as a precautionary measure. No injuries were reported among the passengers or crew on board flight DL1300. After a delay, the flight was able to depart again and successfully reached its destination in Boston approximately two hours behind its original schedule. Delta has since apologized to passengers for the inconvenience caused by the event.</p>

          <p>Oblique Seville has become the first Jamaican man to win a global 100m title since Usain Bolt, securing the gold medal at the World Athletics Championship in Tokyo. The 24-year-old sprinter, who is coached by Bolt's former mentor Glen Mills, ran a personal best of 9.77 seconds to lead a Jamaican one-two finish. This victory marks a significant moment for Jamaican sprinting, which has been searching for a successor to Bolt's dominance on the world stage. Seville's triumph fulfills long-held expectations and signals a potential shift in the balance of power in men's sprinting, which has recently been dominated by the United States.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Expected to Cut Interest Rates Amid Economic Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 11:32:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce an interest rate cut this week, with markets pricing in a 25-basis-point reduction. The focus for investors, however, will be on Chairman Jerome Powell's subsequent press conference for signals about the central bank's future policy path. This move comes after Powell expressed growing concern over slowing job growth, shifting the Fed's focus slightly from its singular battle with inflation. Recent economic data, including weak nonfarm payrolls figures, has strengthened the case for monetary easing to support the economy, despite consumer inflation remaining elevated.
