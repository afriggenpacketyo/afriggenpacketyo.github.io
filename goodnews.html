The competition celebrates the unique perspectives offered by drone technology, revealing patterns and landscapes invisible from the ground. Other winning images capture a wide range of global scenes, from the urban chaos of Dhaka, Bangladesh, to traditional wrestling in Chittagong. The collection showcases both the beauty of the planet and the environmental challenges it faces, such as the drought at Iran's Lake Urmia.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army's new Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) successfully completed a series of crucial tests, hitting targets 124 miles away at White Sands Missile Range. Developed by Lockheed Martin, the PrSM is set to replace the older ATACMS tactical missile system and can be fired from HIMARS launchers. This next-generation missile offers double the firepower per launch pod and a significantly increased range, potentially up to 250 miles, enhancing soldier safety by allowing them to operate farther from enemy lines. The system is also being adapted to launch drones and other advanced munitions, boosting its strategic capabilities.</p>

          <p>A family in West Virginia experienced a medical odyssey after four of their six children were diagnosed with Chiari malformation, a rare condition where brain tissue extends into the spinal canal. The journey began when their youngest daughter, Austyn, underwent successful brain surgery that dramatically improved her constant pain and developmental delays. Subsequently, three of her older sisters—Amelia, Aubrey, and Adalee—were also diagnosed after exhibiting various symptoms. While a genetic link is known in about 10% of cases, four siblings being affected is highly unusual, highlighting the family's resilience and the doctors' surprise.</p>

          <p>Authorities have uncovered and dismantled the first known illegal factory producing weight-loss drugs in the United Kingdom, located in Northampton. The operation resulted in the largest-ever single seizure of trafficked weight-loss medications by a law enforcement agency globally. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) confiscated thousands of unlicensed pens of Retatrutide and Tirzepatide, raw ingredients, and manufacturing equipment. Officials warned that these untested and unauthorized products pose a potentially deadly risk to public health and urged consumers to only purchase medicines from registered pharmacies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread panic and excitement about artificial intelligence, its actual integration into Hollywood's production pipeline has been slow and has not yet led to significant cost savings or job losses. Major studios like Disney and Lionsgate have made substantial investments in AI but have encountered challenges, including clashes between legal and technical departments over copyright issues and the difficulty of integrating third-party AI tools into established workflows. While AI is being used for tasks like dubbing and pre-visualization, the technology is not yet advanced enough to meet Hollywood's high quality standards for generating entire films or performances.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has taken a nearly 5% stake in engineering and construction company Fluor, aiming to unlock value from its large holding in NuScale Power. Fluor's 39% stake in the nuclear technology firm is valued at approximately $4.3 billion, representing over 60% of Fluor's market capitalization. Starboard argues that without this holding, Fluor's core business trades at a significant discount to its peers. The activist firm is pushing for a separation, such as a sale or tax-free spinoff of the NuScale shares, to re-rate Fluor's stock and deliver substantial returns to shareholders.

          <p>Georgia's State Security Service announced the arrest of three Chinese citizens in the capital city of Tbilisi for attempting to illegally acquire two kilograms of uranium. The suspects allegedly planned to pay $400,000 for the nuclear material with the intent of transporting it to China via Russia. According to the security agency, the operation was coordinated by other members of a criminal group based in China. The arrests were made while the individuals were negotiating the final details of the illicit transaction, and authorities released video footage of the detention.</p>

          <h2>Survey Shows Growing Investor Interest in Alternative Assets like Private Equity and Real Estate</h2>

          <p>A recent Charles Schwab survey found that 45% of investors are interested in alternative investments, such as private equity and real estate, to supplement traditional stock and bond portfolios. Financial advisors suggest that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can provide an accessible and liquid way to gain exposure to these typically complex and illiquid asset classes. This trend is particularly notable among younger investors, some of whom are expressing disillusionment with conventional investing. The interest in alternatives coincides with regulatory shifts that could make such products more available in workplace retirement plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lucy Powell, Member of Parliament for Manchester Central, has been elected as the new deputy leader of the UK's governing Labour Party. She defeated Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson in a race prompted by the resignation of Angela Rayner. Powell, who was dismissed from the cabinet in September, ran on a platform of giving grassroots members a stronger voice and advocating for a "bolder" government agenda. In her victory speech, she promised to be an ally to Prime Minister Keir Starmer but also emphasized the need for the party to change its approach to better connect with its values.</p>

          <p>Trail cameras in Indonesia's Tanjung Puting National Park have captured the first-ever documented footage of a Bornean clouded leopard mother with two cubs in that area. This rare sighting is a positive sign for the threatened species, which suffers from a low reproductive rate and shrinking rainforest habitat. The Bornean clouded leopard is one of the world's rarest cats, and documenting a breeding female successfully raising two offspring suggests that conservation efforts within the park are providing a safe environment. The discovery highlights the value of camera traps as a non-invasive tool for monitoring elusive wildlife.</p>

          <p>Autumn marks the annual tarantula mating season in California, when male spiders emerge from their burrows in a desperate search for a mate. This journey is fraught with danger, as female tarantulas are known to cannibalize their suitors, sometimes even after mating is complete. The migration, typically triggered by the first fall rains, provides the best opportunity for wildlife enthusiasts to spot the large, hairy arachnids in areas like the Santa Monica Mountains. While their fangs and venom are not dangerous to humans, urbanization poses a significant threat as the wandering males can fall victim to roads and swimming pools.</p>
