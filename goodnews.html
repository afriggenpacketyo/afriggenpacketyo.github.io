          <p>According to a recent Gallup poll, Lee Jae-myung, the opposition party leader, is projected to win South Korea's snap presidential election, positioning him to potentially succeed ousted president Yoon Suk Yeol. Lee previously lost to Yoon by a small margin in 2022 but now holds a significant lead, with 49% of respondents favoring him compared to 35% for his rival, Kim Moon Soo. Eurasia Group analysts also consider Lee the clear favorite, estimating his odds of victory at 80%, and Goldman Sachs noted similarities in the economic goals of both candidates, including economic growth and housing affordability. The Bank of Korea recently cut rates to their lowest level since August 2022, anticipating a considerable decline in economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following technical and logistical issues with the February California bar exam, over 200 test-takers will have their scores changed from "fail" to "pass" after a committee approved new scoring adjustments. The grading change increased the overall pass rate from 56% to 63%, and applicants who nearly passed will be given the higher of two scores for each written question. The State Bar of California has already implemented a lower raw passing score and "imputed" scores for test takers who failed to complete significant portions of the exam. Some state Bar trustees have expressed concerns about the proposed remedies and higher pass rate, citing the bar's duty to protect the public from unqualified lawyers.</p>
