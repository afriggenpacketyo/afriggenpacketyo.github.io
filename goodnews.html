          <p>Icelandic singer-songwriter and cellist Laufey has garnered a significant following by merging the sounds of classical music and jazz with contemporary pop sensibilities. In a recent interview, she reflected on her musical upbringing, influenced by her classical violinist mother and jazz-loving father, which shaped her distinct style. Initially feeling like an outsider, Laufey found her audience during the pandemic by posting her music on social media, leading to viral success, sold-out concerts, and a Grammy Award. Her journey includes a recent collaboration with Barbra Streisand on her new album, fulfilling a dream that connects her present success with her childhood aspirations.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm after briefly reaching Category 5 intensity. While it is not expected to make landfall on the U.S. mainland, its outer bands are bringing heavy rain and gusty winds to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, prompting flood watches and warnings. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that Erin will turn north, away from the U.S., but its growing size will generate dangerous surf and rip currents along much of the East Coast. Tropical storm warnings are in effect for the Turks and Caicos Islands, with the storm expected to cause hazardous conditions in the Bahamas and Bermuda as well.</p>

          <p>Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund is expected to be omitted from the squad for the upcoming Premier League match against Arsenal. The decision by coach Ruben Amorim comes amidst intense speculation about the 22-year-old's future with the club. Following the high-profile signing of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig, Hojlund's playing opportunities at United are likely to be significantly reduced. AC Milan is reportedly among the clubs interested in signing the Danish forward, though no formal agreement has been reached. This move signals a potential departure for Hojlund as the club reshapes its attacking lineup.</p>

          <p>For over four decades, glaciologist Mauri Pelto has been meticulously measuring the retreat of glaciers in Washington's North Cascade Mountains. His daughter, artist-scientist Jill Pelto, has joined him, transforming the stark climate data into compelling watercolor paintings that visually represent the environmental changes. Her art, which incorporates graphs of glacier decline and temperature rise, aims to make the scientific findings more accessible and emotionally resonant for a broader audience. Their collaborative work highlights the dramatic impact of climate change, with some glaciers they have monitored having completely disappeared, underscoring the urgency of the issue.</p>

The new owner, Mike Conner, purchased the abandoned, 1850s-era fortress in 2017 and spent nearly five years and a significant investment to make it habitable, overcoming challenges like having no running water or electricity. The historic, off-grid property now features 40 beds, modern amenities, and its own nightclub. Conner hopes the next owner will utilize its unique potential, possibly as a tourist attraction or an exclusive event venue.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Sparks forward Cameron Brink has revealed that creating vision boards was a crucial part of her mental recovery from a torn ACL. The practice, suggested by teammate Dearica Hamby, helped Brink maintain a positive outlook and visualize her goals during the arduous 13-month rehabilitation process. By focusing on personal aspirations, relationships, and on-court achievements, she was able to combat the doubts and anxieties that accompany a long-term injury. Her successful return to the court, where she made an immediate impact, is seen by her coach and team psychotherapist as a testament to the power of mental rehearsal and a patient, intentional approach to recovery.</p>

          <h2>German Coalition Government Divided on Reinstating Compulsory Military Service</h2>

          <p>Germany's ruling coalition is at odds over how to expand the country's armed forces, the Bundeswehr, to meet NATO targets. The center-left Social Democrats (SPD), led by Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, favor an enhanced voluntary service model, while their center-right CDU/CSU partners argue that relying on volunteers is insufficient given the current security climate and advocate for a return to conscription. A proposed law would make military service more attractive and require all 18-year-old men to complete a questionnaire about their willingness to serve. However, critics from the CDU/CSU argue the plan lacks urgency and clear deadlines for increasing troop numbers.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued by a helicopter crew after spending two days trapped in a cave behind a powerful waterfall in California's Tulare County. The man, an experienced rappeller, was descending the 'Seven Teacups' waterfalls when extreme water hydraulics pushed him off his lines and into the hidden space. After he was reported missing, search teams used a drone to locate him behind the cascade of water. He was found conscious and suffering only from dehydration and minor injuries, marking what the local sheriff's office called a "stunning survival story."</p>

          <p>As the cost of higher education approaches $100,000 per year at some elite institutions, a small number of U.S. colleges offer a completely tuition-free experience for all admitted students. These nine schools, which include Berea College, College of the Ozarks, and all five U.S. military service academies, typically have rigorous academic standards and unique requirements. In exchange for free tuition, students may participate in mandatory work programs or commit to several years of military service after graduation. While highly selective, these institutions provide a viable path to a debt-free degree for students willing to meet their demanding criteria.</p>
