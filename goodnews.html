          <h2>Orioles Rookie Pitcher Loses Perfect Game Bid With Four Outs Remaining</h2>

          <p>Baltimore Orioles rookie pitcher Brandon Young came agonizingly close to a perfect game, losing his bid with just four outs left in a 7-0 victory over the Houston Astros. The 26-year-old's historic effort was broken up by a softly hit groundball that he fielded himself but followed with an errant throw to first base. Despite the heartbreaking end to the perfect game and no-hitter, Young completed eight dominant innings, allowing only that single hit and tying his career-high with six strikeouts. The near-miss was especially poignant as it occurred in his home region of Texas, with family in attendance.</p>

Captain Harry Wilson was a standout performer, scoring two tries in a pivotal display. The win marked Australia's first victory at the historic Ellis Park stadium since 1963, representing one of the most significant comeback wins in the team's history.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that President Trump's diplomatic efforts have brought the world "closer than ever before" to ending the war in Ukraine, despite the lack of a ceasefire agreement at the Alaska summit. Starmer commended Trump's leadership and welcomed the U.S. commitment to providing robust security guarantees for Ukraine as part of a potential peace deal. He reiterated that the path to peace must involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and that the UK's support for Ukraine remains unwavering. This positive framing from a key European ally contrasts with the more cautious or critical reactions from other international observers following the summit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Topshop, the once-dominant British fashion brand, is planning a major comeback with the confirmed return of standalone physical stores on the High Street. After its parent company collapsed in 2020, the brand was acquired by online retailer Asos, but its physical presence vanished. To mark its revival, Topshop hosted its first catwalk show in seven years during London Fashion Week, signaling a renewed focus on its trend-setting, London-centric aesthetic. Industry experts note that while nostalgia for the brand is strong, its success will depend on attracting a new generation of shoppers while competing in a vastly different and more challenging retail landscape.</p>

          <p>During the Alaska summit, President Trump is reported to have personally delivered a letter from First Lady Melania Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin concerning the plight of abducted Ukrainian children. The letter addresses the thousands of children who have been forcibly transferred from occupied Ukrainian territories to Russia, an act for which Putin has been indicted by the International Criminal Court. This diplomatic gesture highlights the ongoing humanitarian crisis and aligns with U.S. lawmakers' demands for the children's return as a condition of any peace agreement. Ukrainian officials publicly expressed their gratitude to the First Lady for her attention to this critical issue.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes both closed the week at record highs, fueled by investor optimism regarding potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. A cooler-than-expected Consumer Price Index report for July initially boosted market sentiment, although a subsequent report showing a rise in wholesale inflation tempered some of the gains. Despite the mixed economic data, market odds for a September rate cut remained high. Several major companies, including Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and Nvidia, also hit all-time highs during the week, reflecting broad strength in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales are reportedly moving to Forest Lodge, an eight-bedroom home in Windsor Great Park, seeking a "fresh start" for their family. The couple and their three children have been living at Adelaide Cottage since 2022, a period that has included Princess Catherine's cancer diagnosis and treatment. A royal source indicated the move offers an opportunity to leave behind difficult memories and establish a long-term family home. The relocation is being funded privately by the couple, who will pay market rent on the property and will continue their focus on privacy by not having live-in staff.</p>

          <p>An architecture-led startup in Phoenix, Arizona, is repurposing old shipping containers to create modular housing shelters for the city's unhoused population. The "X-WING" units are constructed from four containers arranged in an 'X' shape, creating five private, air-conditioned rooms and shared courtyard spaces. This sustainable approach provides a cost-effective and rapid solution to the growing homelessness crisis, with each unit taking only about a week to build. The project aims to offer dignity and stability to residents, with plans to expand the concept into a larger, 105-unit apartment complex for low-income seniors.</p>

Faulkner has famously adhered to a unique set of principles, including never going public, never making acquisitions, and maintaining a quirky, sprawling corporate campus. Epic's software for electronic health records is used by a majority of top U.S. hospitals. Despite her immense wealth, Faulkner has signed The Giving Pledge, committing to donate 99% of her assets to charity, and has established a detailed succession plan to ensure the company remains private after she steps down.</p>

          <p>Data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) shows that immigration arrests nationwide fell by 13% in July compared to the previous month, slowing the pace of the Trump administration's enforcement actions. While ICE officials cite the need for more resources, activists and immigrant rights groups believe their efforts may be contributing to the slowdown. In places like Oregon, a combination of nightly protests outside ICE facilities and a "rapid-response" legal aid system for arrestees creates significant logistical challenges for federal agents. The state's "sanctuary" law, which limits cooperation between local and federal authorities, further complicates large-scale enforcement operations.</p>

          <p>In their first head-to-head 100-meter race since the Paris Olympics, Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson defeated American Olympic champion Noah Lyles at the Silesia Diamond League meet. Thompson clocked a swift 9.87 seconds for the victory, matching the meet record, with Lyles finishing second in 9.90 seconds. The race was a measure of revenge for Thompson, who lost the Olympic gold to Lyles by a mere five-thousandths of a second a year ago. Despite the loss, Lyles remained positive, viewing the sub-10-second performance as a crucial stepping stone and confidence builder ahead of the upcoming world championships in Tokyo.</p>

After he was reported missing, a search and rescue team used a drone to locate him.

          <p>A leading academic from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has called for China to accelerate its development of space-based solar power to compete with the United States in both the new energy and space sectors. The technology involves large facilities in orbit that collect intense solar radiation, convert it into electricity, and transmit it to Earth. This method offers a continuous power source unaffected by weather or nighttime. The article argues for a top-down national strategy to overcome the current fragmented research efforts and close the technological gap with the U.S., which has been experimenting with the concept for decades.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the concept of "Lighthouse Parenting" as a healthier alternative to the prevalent and exhausting trend of intensive parenting. Coined by pediatrician Kenneth Ginsburg, the approach encourages parents to act as a steady, guiding presence for their children rather than controlling every aspect of their lives. This method involves standing back to allow children to navigate their own challenges and build confidence, while remaining a reliable source of safety and clarity when needed. It acknowledges the biological impulse to shield children from struggle but argues that doing so can be detrimental to their long-term development and resilience.</p>
