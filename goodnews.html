          <h2>Cold Case Murder Solved Nearly 50 Years Later Through Fingerprint Technology</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-10 18:32:27 EDT</div>

          <p>In San Jose, California, a 1977 cold case has been solved with the arrest of Willie Eugene Sims for the murder of Jeannette Ralston, a young mother. Ralston was found strangled in her car after telling friends she would be back in 10 minutes, with the case remaining unsolved for decades. The breakthrough came after the F.B.I. upgraded its fingerprint search algorithm, leading to a match with Sims' thumbprint found on a cigarette carton at the crime scene. Sims, who had a prior conviction for assault, was linked to the crime through DNA evidence found on Ralston's fingernails and the murder weapon, bringing closure to the victim's family after nearly five decades.</p>

          <p>Fulham Football Club has opened its new Riverside Stand, featuring high-end hospitality experiences such as Michelin-star menus and a rooftop pool, though the pool does not have a view of the pitch. The stand is designed to resemble a five-star hotel or cruise ship, rather than a traditional football stadium, with a focus on the river view. The facility will also operate as a private members' club on non-matchdays, catering to local residents in the wealthy area of West London. The club aims to provide the best stand in the world, balancing modern amenities with the heritage of Craven Cottage.</p>
