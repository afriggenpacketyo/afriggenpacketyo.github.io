          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its planned Digital Services Tax on U.S. technology firms, a move that has prompted the resumption of trade talks with the United States. The decision came after President Trump suspended negotiations, calling the proposed 3% levy on revenue from Canadian users a "blatant attack." Prime Minister Mark Carney's office confirmed that he and President Trump spoke and agreed to restart the talks, aiming for a resolution by a July 21 deadline. The reversal is seen as a key concession to ease trade tensions between the two neighboring countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sergei Tikhanovsky, a prominent Belarusian opposition figure and blogger, has been released from prison after being held for five years, much of it in solitary confinement. His 2020 arrest for challenging authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko sparked mass protests led by his wife, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya. Tikhanovsky was one of 14 political prisoners freed following a rare visit to Minsk by a senior U.S. delegation. Now in exile, he described the harsh conditions of his imprisonment but affirmed his spirit was not broken and that the fight for a democratic Belarus must continue.</p>

The announcement comes as the social media platform's Chinese owner, ByteDance, faces a September deadline to divest under a 2024 U.S. law citing national security concerns. In a Fox News interview, Trump said he could reveal the identities of the potential buyers within two weeks and expressed optimism that Chinese President Xi Jinping would approve the deal.

          <p>China has announced a conditional resumption of seafood imports from certain regions of Japan, partially lifting a blanket ban imposed in August 2023. The ban was enacted before Japan began releasing treated wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant. According to the new customs notice, imports of aquatic products will resume but will continue to exclude those from ten Japanese prefectures, including Fukushima and Tokyo. This move represents a slight thaw in trade relations, though significant restrictions remain in place, reflecting ongoing concerns from Beijing.</p>

          <p>A new trade deal between the United Kingdom and the United States has officially commenced, expected to immediately boost shipments of British cars across the Atlantic. The deal reduces a 25% U.S. tariff on UK cars to 10% for a quota of 100,000 vehicles, providing relief to manufacturers like Aston Martin and JLR. However, British farmers have criticized the agreement, arguing that agriculture was used as a bargaining chip to secure the deal for the auto industry. Concessions included tariff-free quotas for U.S. beef and the removal of a tariff on American ethanol, which UK farmers say undermines their own market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, and researchers are beginning to understand why. Studies indicate that the unique acceleration and deceleration patterns of EVs are a key factor, particularly the function of regenerative braking. This system, which recharges the battery by slowing the car, creates a low-frequency deceleration that can provoke queasiness in passengers. Researchers are now exploring solutions, including engineering adjustments and even using specific audio tones, to counteract the effect and improve the comfort of riding in an EV.</p>
