          <p>An excerpt from Dr. Sanjay Gupta's new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," details innovative approaches to understanding and treating chronic pain. The article focuses on "reverse translational research," a method that begins with a patient's lived experience to identify objective biological markers for pain within the brain. It highlights a groundbreaking clinical trial where implanted electrodes were used to predict and then interrupt pain signals through deep brain stimulation, offering a new frontier for pain management.</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, celebrates the little-known story of how surfing first arrived on the U.S. mainland in 1885. Three teenage Hawaiian princes, who were studying in the area, crafted surfboards from local redwood and demonstrated the traditional royal sport to an astonished local population. This act of "surf diplomacy" is now recognized as the seed that grew into America's vibrant surfing culture, a historical contribution that the exhibition aims to bring to wider public attention.</p>

          <p>The Australian state of South Australia is set to ban the sale and distribution of fish-shaped soy sauce containers as part of its ongoing efforts to combat single-use plastic pollution. The ban, effective September 1, targets the popular takeaway item because, despite being used for only seconds, it can linger in the environment for centuries. Due to their small size, these containers are often missed by recycling machinery, contributing to plastic waste and harming marine ecosystems.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the U.S. Open's signature cocktail, the Honey Deuce, reveals its price has risen faster than general inflation. Now costing $23, the drink's price has increased by 53% since 2015, while the broader consumer price index has only risen by about 36% over the same period. Despite the premium price, the popular vodka-based beverage, served in a souvenir glass, remains a significant source of revenue for the tennis tournament, with over half a million sold last year alone.</p>

          <p>This philosophical opinion piece addresses the common feeling of guilt associated with experiencing personal joy during times of global suffering. The author suggests that instead of choosing between happiness and misery, we should embrace both as part of a connected human experience. Drawing from concepts like Buddhist "sympathetic joy," the article argues that acknowledging the world's delights alongside its horrors is a form of resistance against cynicism and a way to maintain emotional balance in a complex world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has issued new guidance on the federal electric vehicle tax credit, which is scheduled to end after September 30. The clarification states that consumers can still qualify for the credit of up to $7,500 if they enter into a "written binding contract" and make a payment for the vehicle on or before the deadline. This provides a crucial window for buyers, allowing them to secure the tax break even if they don't take physical possession of the EV until after September 30. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A global surge in demand for matcha has created a significant supply bottleneck, causing prices for the green tea powder to soar even in Japan. The boom, driven by matcha's reputation as a health superfood and a rise in tourism, has strained Japan's aging tea-farming industry. The labor-intensive process of producing high-quality tencha leaves for matcha cannot keep up, leading retailers to ration their stock and major beverage companies to create specialized divisions to manage the challenging supply chain.</p>

          <p>At the start of the new school year, UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is warning parents about the critical importance of attendance, particularly in the first few weeks. New data reveals that students who miss school days early in the term are significantly more likely to become persistently absent later on. With attendance rates still below pre-pandemic levels, the government is emphasizing a "support-first" approach and launching attendance hubs to help schools address the issue and mitigate long-term impacts on children's futures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion essay connects Toni Morrison's 1995 writings on fascism to the current political climate, arguing that American racism has always been fascism's "succubus twin." The author suggests that the long history of Black resistance—characterized by a deep belief in democratic ideals, diverse protest strategies, and enduring faith—offers a powerful and necessary model for confronting modern authoritarian threats. This historical perspective calls for a sustained fight for justice that goes beyond a single election and draws strength from a legacy of resilience.</p>

          <p>This analysis explores the current state of the Democratic Party, which is suffering from historically low public approval ratings yet showing signs of a potential comeback. While voters perceive the party as weak, a growing generic ballot lead over Republicans and increasing dislike for President Trump provide strategic openings. The party is currently engaged in internal debates on how to reconnect with working-class voters and refine its economic message, with strategists outlining a recovery plan focused on opposing Trump and winning the 2026 midterms.</p>
