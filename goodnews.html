          <p>Frank Bisignano, the new head of the Social Security Administration (SSA), told agency staff that he had to Google the job when offered it by the Trump administration. The former Wall Street executive, who has no prior experience in government or with Social Security, aims to modernize the agency and improve service for the American public. He reassured staff that Social Security is "not going away" and that President Trump supports the program. Bisignano also emphasized the need for a "digital-first" approach and the integration of artificial intelligence into the agency's systems, while addressing concerns about potential staff reductions.</p>

          <p>Gas prices are projected to be the cheapest since 2021 for the upcoming Memorial Day weekend, averaging around $3.08 per gallon, which is 50 cents less than last year. This decline is attributed to uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's economic policies and increased oil production. While gas prices are down, other vacation-related expenses, such as entertainment and dining out, have increased. The cheapest gas can be found in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama, while the priciest gas is in California and Hawaii.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have identified hundreds of metabolites that correlate with ultraprocessed food (UPF) intake, enabling the development of blood and urine tests to detect UPF consumption. The team created a "biomarker score" to predict ultraprocessed food intake based on metabolite measurements in blood and urine. This new method could potentially be used in future research to link the consumption of processed foods with chronic diseases, according to the researchers. The study emphasized that the new method will require further validation before broader use.</p>

          <p>During a White House visit, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa joked about not having a plane to give President Trump, a remark that encapsulates the world's perspective on America's current state. This followed the U.S. government's acceptance of a free jumbo jet from Qatar, which has become a source of controversy. Trump responded in stride, but the incident underscores the president's affinity for extravagant gifts. Other avenues for gaining favor with Trump include memberships to his private clubs, investment in his cryptocurrency, or donations to the America250 committee, reflecting a shift in how foreign dignitaries interact with the U.S. President.</p>

Despite the chaos, Al Arab received his diploma and started a GoFundMe to support other student parents. The university stated that although Al Arab broke the rules, he would not be penalized.</p>

          <p>David Brooks argues that the populist narrative of America's economic decline due to globalization and neoliberalism is historically inaccurate. He contends that wages stagnated mostly in the 1970s and 1980s, not during the era of neoliberal globalism, and median wages have grown since NAFTA and the WTO. Brooks also points out that American manufacturing has declined primarily due to increased productivity, not foreign competition. He suggests that the forces driving global populism are more about immigration, cultural values, and social distrust than economic factors and that the economic policies of 1992-2017 were sensible and should be built upon.</p>

          <p>An observational study suggests that GLP-1 agonists, commonly known as weight loss drugs, may modestly reduce the risk of obesity-related cancers, particularly colorectal cancer, compared to DDP-4 inhibitors. The study, involving 170,030 adults with obesity and diabetes, found that patients taking GLP-1s had a 7% lower risk of developing an obesity-related cancer and an 8% lower risk of death from any cause. While the difference was not statistically significant for men, women treated with GLP-1s had an 8% lower risk of obesity-related cancer and a 20% lower risk of all causes of death. The authors hope to continue their research longer than four years and with those who do not have diabetes.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proposing the creation of $1,000 "Trump accounts" for babies born during President Trump's second term, aimed at kickstarting wealth creation for American children. The accounts, managed by banks or investment firms, would be automatically enrolled for eligible children, with potential for additional contributions from families and third parties. Funds could be used for prescribed costs such as education or a down payment on a home, but some experts suggest broadening the scope of approved expenditures. The proposed accounts' tax benefits are also questionable, and the lowest-income families would be the most likely to spend the funds on unapproved expenses, and face tax penalties.</p>

          <p>Kermit the Frog delivered a commencement speech at the University of Maryland, hoping to inspire graduates as they embark on their new adventures. The Muppet creator Jim Henson graduated from the University of Maryland in 1960. Kermit gave a guest lecture at the university in 2024. Miss Piggy, Kermit's longtime on-again, off-again girlfriend, is ‚Äúsummering on a beach somewhere exotic‚Äù and will skip the event.</p>

          <h2>Home Equity Loan Rates Hit 2025 Low, Presenting a Timely Opportunity</h2>

          <p>Home equity loan interest rates have declined to their lowest point in 2025, averaging 8.23%, making it a cost-effective borrowing option compared to personal loans and credit cards. Unlike HELOCs, home equity loans offer fixed rates, providing protection against potential future rate hikes. Given the volatility of interest rates and the lower cost compared to alternatives, homeowners with financing needs may benefit from locking in a home equity loan rate now, but be sure to calculate your repayment costs with precision as your home functions as collateral (not investment advice).</p>
