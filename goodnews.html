        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "7-year rule" for credit card debt primarily dictates that most negative information, such as late payments and charge-offs, must be removed from a consumer's credit report after seven years from the first delinquency. This rule, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, helps improve credit scores over time but does not erase the debt itself. Additionally, state statutes of limitations, often around seven years, can prevent creditors from suing for old debts, though collectors may still attempt to contact individuals for payment.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly cost of a $200,000 home equity loan is now slightly lower, with payments ranging from approximately $1,936 for a 15-year term to $2,463 for a 10-year term. While the reduction in cost compared to previous months is not substantial, rates are trending downward, making it a potentially attractive option for homeowners with significant equity. The article advises that such a large loan is only suitable for those who can comfortably afford the payments, as the home serves as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

The victory was particularly notable as Alcaraz had rolled his ankle early in the tournament and played with it heavily taped. Despite his opponent also facing a physical issue during the match, Alcaraz maintained his composure to close out the win. Following the tournament, he announced his withdrawal from the upcoming Shanghai Masters to focus on recovery from his physical issues.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced an agreement with Pfizer in which the pharmaceutical company will voluntarily lower U.S. prices for some of its most popular drugs and invest $70 billion in domestic manufacturing. Under the deal, Pfizer will offer certain medications to Medicaid patients at the lowest price available in other developed nations and provide significant discounts on other drugs through a new government website. In exchange, Pfizer's products will be exempt from potential pharmaceutical-specific tariffs for three years, a move that comes ahead of a deadline Trump set for drugmakers to lower prices.</p>

          <p>Seventy years ago, actor James Dean was killed in a car crash at the age of 24, cementing his status as a cultural icon. Despite having made only three films, his performances captured the rebellious spirit of a generation, and his sudden death transformed him into a legend. His final film, "Giant," was still in production when he died, and he would go on to receive two posthumous Oscar nominations. Decades later, his image remains a powerful symbol of youth and nonconformity, with the site of his crash still drawing fans.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced a new educational ambition, aiming for two-thirds of young people to be in university, further education, or a high-quality apprenticeship by the age of 25. This marks a significant policy shift from the previous Labour government's goal of 50% university attendance, placing a greater emphasis on technical qualifications and skills training. The new target aims to have at least 10% of young people pursuing higher technical courses or apprenticeships by 2040. The move was welcomed by colleges and industry groups as a step toward valuing vocational training equally with university degrees.</p>

Parker shares his own experience of losing his passion for the form after publishing a book on the topic, a concept he calls "the odeness." He advises the reader that the creative spark can return, suggesting they broaden their subject matter to more abstract concepts like moods or ideas. He concludes that creative pieces don't always need to be rapturous or jolly, but simply need to be true to the form.</p>

The documentary explores how Lilith Fair created a rare sense of community, safety, and collective power for both the artists and the audience. It reflects on what has been lost in the decades since, as that sense of shared purpose has become less common.</p>
