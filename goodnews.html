          <h2>Lending Experts Forecast Mortgage Rate Trends for August 2025</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 09:57:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates have largely remained in the high 6% range in 2025, disappointing homebuyers awaiting a drop. Experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting for potential benchmark rate cuts, which could significantly influence mortgage trends. However, other factors, including the current administration's tariff policies and inflation concerns, are also impacting rate decisions. Most analysts do not anticipate a Fed rate cut before August, with September being a more likely timeframe, suggesting prospective homebuyers might consider preparing now for potential lower rates later in the year. This article provides general financial information and should not be taken as direct financial guidance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Boeing has significantly reduced its quarterly losses, reporting a $176 million loss compared to $1.09 billion a year prior, while revenue surged 35% to $22.75 billion, marking its highest airplane deliveries since 2018. CEO Kelly Ortberg stated 2025 is expected to be a "turnaround year," emphasizing improvements in safety, quality, and production stability. Despite progress, challenges remain, including a $445 million charge from a Justice Department deal related to past 737 Max crashes and potential delays in the certification of new Max variants until 2026. The company also faces a possible factory worker strike, highlighting ongoing complexities in its recovery.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 09:51:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Four critically endangered Sumatran tiger cubs have been born at Manor House Wildlife Park in Pembrokeshire, marking the largest litter of this species ever recorded in the UK, and potentially Europe. The cubs, born on June 8th, bring the park's tiger population to seven, offering significant hope for the species, which numbers fewer than 400 in the wild due to habitat loss and poaching. Celebrity owner Anna Ryder Richardson emphasized the importance of this birth within a strict breeding program, aiming to strengthen the genetic diversity of the Sumatran tiger population. The park aims to educate the public about conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump met with Scottish First Minister John Swinney during his visit to Scotland, discussing key issues including whisky tariffs, North Sea oil and gas taxation, and the situation in Gaza. Swinney advocated for an exemption for Scotch whisky from a 10% US tariff, highlighting its unique Scottish origin and significant economic impact. Trump also raised concerns about high taxes on North Sea oil and gas, urging the UK to exploit these resources. The meeting also touched upon the conflict in Gaza, with Swinney appealing to Trump to use his influence for a ceasefire and humanitarian aid.</p>

          <p>As of July 28, 2025, average 30-year mortgage rates are around 6.79% and 15-year rates are 6.01%, presenting challenges for homebuyers and those looking to refinance. While rates are higher than a few years ago, experts suggest that a potential Federal Reserve pause or cut in rates could offer some relief. To secure the best available rates, borrowers are advised to strengthen their credit profiles, pay bills on time, and compare offers from multiple lenders, including looking beyond their current mortgage provider.

          <p>Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts offer a way to earn competitive returns, often higher than current inflation rates, by locking in interest for a fixed term while benefiting from FDIC or NCUA insurance. As of July 25, 2025, national average CD yields vary by term, but top online banks offer significantly higher rates, particularly for short-term CDs (6-month to 1-year) due to an inverted yield curve.

However, the deal faces intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators due to past industry consolidations leading to significant traffic disruptions.
