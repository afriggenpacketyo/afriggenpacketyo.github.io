          <h2>Fitness Concerns Mount for Djokovic Ahead of Wimbledon Semi-Final Clash with Sinner</h2>

          <p>Fitness concerns are casting a shadow over the highly anticipated Wimbledon semi-final between 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic and world number one Jannik Sinner. Djokovic, 38, canceled a scheduled practice session on Thursday after falling awkwardly in his quarter-final, raising doubts about his physical readiness. Sinner, 23, also sustained an elbow injury earlier in the tournament but participated in his scheduled practice and declared himself "100% fit." Both players have faced physical challenges, highlighting the demanding nature of Grand Slam tennis, while fellow semi-finalist Taylor Fritz also required medical attention during his quarter-final match, leaving only Carlos Alcaraz seemingly unbothered by injury.</p>

          <p>Veteran fly-half James O'Connor has been named in Joe Schmidt's 36-man Australia squad to face the British and Irish Lions, marking his return to the Wallabies fold after nearly three years. O'Connor, 35, was selected following an injury to Noah Lolesio, bringing crucial experience to the fly-half position alongside younger talents like Ben Donaldson and Tom Lynagh. Having previously played against the Lions in 2013, he is poised to make history as only the third Australian to feature in two Lions campaigns, highlighting the significance of his inclusion. This selection provides O'Connor a significant opportunity to secure a starting spot and contribute his extensive experience to the highly anticipated series.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has surprised fans with the release of his new album, "Swag," featuring 20 songs with titles like "Dadz Love," "Devotion," and "Therapy Session." The album's promotion prominently incorporates a widely circulated video of the singer confronting paparazzi, where he states, "I'm a dad. I'm a husband. I'm standing on business," a line also sampled in one of the tracks, "Butterflies." This release comes four years after his last album, "Justice," and follows public concern for his mental health and recent scrutiny over his marriage. The lyrics of some songs appear to allude to his personal relationship and Christian faith, offering a glimpse into his recent experiences.</p>

          <p>European allies have agreed to establish a headquarters in Paris for a rapid deployment force, to be known as the Multinational Force Ukraine, aimed at stabilizing the country post-ceasefire in Russia's ongoing war. For the first time, a U.S. delegation, including President Donald Trump's special envoy Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg and Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal, attended the meeting in Rome, signaling increased American involvement. This force is intended to provide logistical and training experts to help reconstitute Ukraine's armed forces and secure its skies and the Black Sea, though no specific troop commitments were announced. The initiative underscores a strong, unified Western commitment to Ukraine's long-term security and deterrence against future Russian aggression, emphasizing the importance of diplomacy backed by deterrence.</p>

          <p>Three Merseyside Police officers, Sgt Gregory Gillespie, PC Luke Holden, and PCSO Timothy Parry, have been honored for their exceptional bravery in confronting Southport knife attacker Axel Rudakubana. They were the first responders to the scene of a Taylor Swift-themed workshop on July 29 last year, where Rudakubana, then 17, murdered three children and injured ten others. Armed with a baton and Taser, Sgt Gillespie and PC Holden entered the building while PCSO Parry covered the exit, successfully disarming and arresting the assailant who was holding a large knife. Their courageous actions under immense pressure prevented further harm and exemplify remarkable selflessness in the face of extreme danger, earning them recognition at the Police Federation of England and Wales 2025 bravery awards.</p>

          <p>Tesla continues to experience strong sales growth in Norway, with new car registrations jumping 54% year-on-year in June, largely driven by its revamped Model Y, and a 213% increase in May. This trend defies a broader European slump and a significant backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political rhetoric, including his support for Donald Trump. Experts attribute Norway's unique enthusiasm to the Model Y's competitive price, large luggage space, and suitability for local needs, alongside the country's extensive EV incentives and charging infrastructure. While a recent survey indicates 43% of Norwegian EV drivers would avoid Tesla for political reasons, the brand's market share remains remarkably strong in the world's most EV-friendly nation, highlighting the power of product utility over political sentiment for many consumers.</p>

          <p>In a highly anticipated NBA Summer League "main event," Bronny James's Lakers narrowly lost 87-85 to Cooper Flagg's Mavericks, despite James's last-second three-point attempt to win the game. The matchup was hyped as a duel between the Lakers' second-year guard and the Mavericks' first overall draft pick, generating an electric atmosphere. While neither player had a stellar shooting performance, with James scoring eight points and Flagg ten, their direct matchups and defensive efforts captivated the crowd. James expressed respect for Flagg's talent, acknowledging his potential to be a "special" player, and focused on his own defensive improvements and conditioning for the upcoming season. The game's score came down to the final seconds.</p>

Sengupta, a former Google executive, emphasizes meditation as his primary strategy for filtering out noise and navigating the highly volatile startup journey. He highlights the stark difference between working in a large company and a fragile startup, where risk is amplified and work-life balance is often lost to the detriment of personal well-being. Sengupta advises aspiring entrepreneurs to prioritize mental and physical health, suggesting even short daily meditation or exercise like cycling can provide crucial grounding amidst the ups and downs.</p>

          <p>China has taken a significant environmental step by blowing up 300 dams and shutting down numerous hydropower stations along the Red River, a major tributary of the Yangtze. This drastic measure aims to restore the river's habitat and protect rare and endemic fish species in the Yangtze's upper reaches, which ecologists consider a last refuge. Decades of dam construction had severely restricted water flow, reduced suitable habitats, and blocked migratory routes for fish, threatening the region's unique biodiversity. This action reflects a renewed commitment to ecological preservation over unchecked industrial development in vital waterways, demonstrating a proactive approach to addressing past environmental damage.</p>

The incident occurred after a game in November 2024, and the man faces charges of using a "carriage service" to menace, harass, and/or offend.

          <p>China's electric heavy truck sales surged by an estimated 175% in the first half of the year, now accounting for about a quarter of new truck sales, significantly impacting diesel consumption. This boom, driven by government subsidies and rapid charging infrastructure rollout, is accelerating predictions for a peak in Chinese oil demand, with some analysts revising forecasts to this year instead of 2026. The transport sector, which burns about two-thirds of all diesel in China, is projected to cut its usage by 40% by 2030, contributing to an overall quarter reduction in diesel consumption compared to 2024 levels. Electric trucks are proving cheaper than diesel and LNG alternatives over their lifespan, bolstering their adoption and reshaping China's energy landscape.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a tentative ruling signaling an order to halt indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests by the Trump administration in Los Angeles. The lawsuit, brought by immigrant rights groups, seeks to block federal agents from targeting brown-skinned individuals without probable cause and detaining them in "dungeon-like" conditions without access to lawyers. Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong expressed skepticism about the government's lack of specific evidence to refute accusations of unlawful targeting, challenging their "very general" declarations. This potential injunction is a significant development in the ongoing battle against mass deportation plans, with cities like Los Angeles joining the suit, arguing the raids are politically driven and disrupt local law enforcement functions.</p>
