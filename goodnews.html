          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 00:32:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government-held rice stockpiles directly to retailers, targeting a retail price of 2,000 yen per 5 kg to alleviate the burden of soaring rice prices on consumers. The government intends to bypass auctions, which previously hindered price control, and may explore online sales to ensure widespread distribution. This initiative follows mounting criticism over the government's failure to curb rising rice prices, exacerbated by poor harvests and increased demand due to tourism, with average supermarket prices reaching a record 4,268 yen per 5 kg. The government plans to initially release 300,000 tons and consider additional supplies if necessary.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reportedly approved Nippon Steel's plan to acquire U.S. Steel, a decision welcomed by both companies despite previous concerns about national security risks. The planned partnership is expected to create at least 70,000 jobs and inject $14 billion into the U.S. economy, with Nippon Steel committing to significant investment over the next 14 months. This decision follows a review by federal agencies and discussions between Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, marking a shift from earlier opposition to foreign ownership of U.S. Steel, which had also been a point of contention during the previous presidential election.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As geopolitical tensions rise and de-dollarization discussions intensify, Hong Kong's financial system is becoming increasingly crucial for China to advance the internationalization of the yuan. According to Mary Huen Wai-yi, businesses in Qatar are eager to utilize the yuan through Hong Kong's financial tools for joint ventures and investments with China. The trend towards yuan-denominated trades highlights a shift away from the U.S. dollar in international markets, aligning with China's long-term strategy to reduce risks and assert financial independence amid escalating Sino-American decoupling. Hong Kong's role in facilitating yuan transactions is expected to grow, providing more opportunities for its financial sector.</p>

          <p>Specialist mental health crisis centers will be established throughout England over the next decade to alleviate overcrowding in accident and emergency departments. These centers will be open to walk-in patients, as well as those referred by GPs and police, providing immediate care from specialist staff for individuals in acute mental distress. While NHS England hails this as a pioneering model of care, Andy Bell, CEO of the Centre for Mental Health, expressed skepticism due to the scheme being untested, and emphasized the need for proper funding of NHS mental health services, noting that the share of health spending on mental health treatment has recently decreased.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter as it approached for landing, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The incident, which occurred on May 1, was attributed to a temporary antenna setup during control tower construction that failed to maintain contact. The Army stated that the aircraft's location was continuously broadcast, but federal air traffic controllers reported receiving inconclusive data. Following the incident, the Army temporarily suspended flights into and out of the Pentagon while working with the FAA to address safety concerns.</p>

Retailers have seen a surge in sales of disposable vapes, with some customers buying large quantities to last through the summer. While the ban aims to reduce environmental impact and curb youth vaping, some fear it will lead ex-smokers back to cigarettes, as disposable vapes have been credited with helping many quit smoking. The government hopes the ban will encourage the use of reusable vapes, but concerns remain about the availability and appeal of alternatives.</p>

          <p>Tra'Von Johnson, a Louisiana inmate, was captured after escaping from the Tangipahoa Parish Jail for the second time. Johnson, who was awaiting trial for a home invasion that resulted in a fatality and injury, escaped after inmates flooded a cell, and he and another inmate opened a backdoor to the yard. The sheriff's office suspects another inmate helped Johnson over the perimeter fence. This is the second time Johnson has escaped from the same jail, with a previous escape occurring in May 2024. At least four individuals have been placed on administrative leave pending a full review.</p>

          <p>China has greenlit the construction of a 767-kilometer canal connecting Jiangxi province, a rare earth hub, to Zhejiang, an eastern coastal powerhouse, as part of its effort to expand its inland waterway network. The Jiangxi-Zhejiang Canal is expected to be the most expensive artificial canal ever built in China, costing an estimated $44.4 billion. The canal, designed for 1,000-tonne vessels, will connect Jiangxi's manufacturing and rare earth reserves to Zhejiang's seaports, potentially handling 25 million tonnes of cargo annually.</p>

          <p>Irish-language hip-hop trio Kneecap performed their biggest festival headline gig shortly after a band member, Liam √ìg √ì hAnnaidh, was charged with a terror offense. The charge stemmed from allegedly displaying a flag in support of Hezbollah at a previous gig, which the band denies. At the Wide Awake festival, the band expressed defiance, urging fans to stand in solidarity with Palestine. The concert followed a smaller secret set and saw the band perform tracks from their album, which has seen a surge in streaming since the controversy began.</p>

          <p>Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the armorer convicted in the fatal 2021 shooting on the set of the film Rust, has been released from prison. She was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, who was killed when Alec Baldwin discharged a prop gun loaded with a live round. Gutierrez-Reed was sentenced to 18 months in prison and was also serving probation for bringing a gun into a Santa Fe bar before filming. Baldwin's case was dismissed, and Rust has since finished filming and been released in theaters.</p>
