          <p>An Emirates flight from Dubai to Hong Kong was forced to divert to Kaohsiung, Taiwan, after making at least two unsuccessful landing attempts. The Boeing 777 aircraft circled over the Hong Kong area before changing its destination, with passengers and crew staying overnight in Taiwan before returning to Hong Kong the next day. While the airline has not specified the exact cause, an aviation observer cited by media reports suggested that adverse weather conditions, including sustained winds of about 12 knots, may have contributed to the difficulties the pilots experienced during the landing approach.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry visited a landmine clearance project in Angola, following in the footsteps of his mother, Princess Diana, who brought global attention to the issue in 1997. As a patron of the Halo Trust, the Duke of Sussex met with families living near a minefield and observed lessons teaching children how to avoid the explosives. Despite the charity clearing 120,000 landmines, Angola still has an estimated thousand minefields remaining from its civil war, which continue to threaten civilian lives. Prince Harry's visit underscores the ongoing danger and the continued need for demining efforts, reinforcing the powerful legacy of his mother's humanitarian work.</p>

          <h2>Australia and China Prioritize Trade Deals During Prime Minister's Visit, Sidestepping Port Dispute</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 22:08:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's visit to China, both nations have focused on securing trade and investment agreements while setting aside major political disputes. The deals reportedly involve expanded Chinese market access for Australian agricultural products, financial sector cooperation, and potential tariff cuts. Notably, discussions have avoided the contentious issue of Darwin Port, which Australia wants to reclaim from a Chinese company due to national security concerns. Analysts suggest this approach is a strategic effort by Beijing to find common ground and strengthen economic ties amid its ongoing trade tensions with the United States.</p>

          <p>A tsunami advisory for Alaska's southern peninsula has been canceled following a powerful 7.3 magnitude earthquake that struck off the coast. The quake, located about 50 miles south of Sand Point, initially triggered a more severe tsunami warning, prompting evacuations in coastal towns like Seward. However, authorities later downgraded the alert to an advisory, as the earthquake's shallow depth meant large, widespread waves were not expected. The event caused no major damage, but it served as a reminder of the region's location along the seismically active Pacific "Ring of Fire," where North America's strongest-ever earthquake occurred in 1964.</p>

          <p>Recovery efforts are ongoing in Texas following devastating floods, with the Texas National Guard receiving international assistance from a specialized search and rescue team from the Czech Republic. The Czech team, including four cadaver dogs, arrived to help locate approximately 100 people still missing. This collaboration is part of the National Guard's State Partnership Program, which has linked Texas with the Czech Republic for military training since 1993. The aid is reciprocal, as a Texas drone unit previously assisted the Czech Republic during its own severe flooding. Governor Greg Abbott surveyed the damage, emphasizing the intensive search for the unaccounted for.</p>

          <p>A new official photograph of Queen Camilla has been released by Buckingham Palace to mark her 78th birthday. The picture, taken by photographer Chris Jackson, shows the Queen smiling in a casual setting at her private home in Wiltshire. In the photo, she is wearing a turquoise dress with a vibrant rainforest print. Unlike last year, when her birthday coincided with the State Opening of Parliament, she is expected to celebrate this year's occasion privately. The release comes after a busy period of public engagements for the Queen and King Charles, including a state visit and international travel.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the artificial intelligence boom drives a massive demand for electricity, one company is pioneering a sustainable solution by using recycled electric vehicle batteries to power data centers. Crusoe, an AI cloud platform, is utilizing used EV batteries supplied by Redwood Materials to provide reliable, clean energy for its facilities near Reno, Nevada. This innovative approach addresses the growing concern that data centers could consume up to 12% of all U.S. electricity by 2028. By repurposing batteries that have lost some capacity but are still functional, the system offers a scalable, renewable alternative to building new gas-fired power plants.</p>

          <h2>Congress Passes Bipartisan Bill to Help Veterans Avoid Home Foreclosure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 20:24:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a rare display of bipartisanship, Congress has passed legislation aimed at preventing thousands of military veterans from losing their homes to foreclosure. The bill addresses a crisis created after the Department of Veterans Affairs ended a key homeowner assistance program, leaving veterans with fewer affordable options to catch up on missed mortgage payments. The new law will allow veterans to move their delinquent payments to the end of their loan term, making their mortgages current and allowing them to resume regular payments. This solution was urgently sought by mortgage industry leaders and veterans' advocates to fix the gap in the VA's home loan program.</p>

          <p>A mother and her 9-year-old son who were lost in a remote California forest were successfully located by rescuers who followed a trail of handwritten notes she left behind. The pair became stranded after their car's GPS led them onto remote roads where they lost their signal. The woman's notes, which pleaded for help and provided contact information, guided the search-and-rescue team to their vehicle. The rescue was also aided by a ham radio operator who relayed the team's emergency broadcast from the dense forest where conventional communication failed. Authorities praised the mother for notifying someone of her travel plans beforehand.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has unveiled a new "everything app" designed to integrate trading, payments, social media, and messaging into a single platform. The new Base App, which replaces Coinbase Wallet, aims to attract consumers who are not necessarily interested in speculative trading by creating a user-friendly ecosystem for everyday transactions. A key feature is Base Pay, a one-click checkout system for the USDC stablecoin, developed with Shopify to facilitate seamless online and in-store payments. The move is seen as an effort by Coinbase to diversify its revenue and drive the utility of crypto in daily life, supported by a more favorable regulatory environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Coca-Cola has agreed to switch from high-fructose corn syrup to cane sugar in its beverages sold in the United States. The move follows advocacy from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has raised concerns about the health impacts of corn syrup. While Coca-Cola has not explicitly confirmed the change, it stated that more details on new product offerings would be shared soon. This potential shift could be a blow to American corn farmers but aligns with the administration's health initiatives. Many countries, including Mexico and the UK, already use cane sugar in their Coke products.</p>
