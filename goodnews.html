        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Republican state senator in New Jersey, Michael Testa, has introduced legislation to rename the Delaware Bay as "The Bay of New Jersey." The proposal appears inspired by former President Trump's order to rename a portion of the Gulf of Mexico, with Testa arguing that New Jersey's significant commercial and recreational fishing industries justify the name change. The move is part of a broader trend of symbolic political gestures, as the bill would require state agencies to update all materials to reflect the new name if passed.</p>

          <p>After missing the Six Nations due to injury, Scottish rugby centre Sione Tuipulotu feels he is returning to his best form during the British and Irish Lions tour in Australia. Following a strong performance against the Western Force, Tuipulotu expressed confidence in his growing influence and praised his midfield partner, Ireland's Garry Ringrose, for his impressive physicality. The Melbourne-born player also highlighted the impact of fly-half Finn Russell, noting their established combination helps execute the team's instinctive and structured style of play. The team is now preparing for a tougher match against the Reds in Brisbane.</p>

          <p>This article details NPR's internal guidelines for the use of anonymous sources in its journalism, emphasizing that on-the-record attribution is always the strong preference. Anonymity is considered only when a source provides vital information but faces credible risks, such as job loss, legal jeopardy, or personal trauma like sexual assault. Senior editors must approve any use of anonymity after vetting the source's credibility and the necessity of their information. When granted, NPR is transparent with its audience about why the source is unnamed, providing as much context as possible without revealing their identity.</p>

          <p>Influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul defeated former world champion Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. by a unanimous decision in a cruiserweight bout in California. Paul controlled the fight from the outset, as Ch√°vez Jr. appeared reluctant to engage, throwing very few punches for most of the contest. The 28-year-old American showcased an improved jab and work rate, earning scores of 99-91, 97-93, and 98-92. After the win, Paul called out current champions, though the victory raises further questions about the quality of his opponents, given Ch√°vez Jr.'s lackluster performance and history of motivation issues.</p>

          <p>France is leading a ‚Ç¨1.35 billion investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, positioning it as a potential European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. However, industry experts are skeptical about Eutelsat's ability to match Starlink's scale in the near future, as its OneWeb constellation of 650 satellites is dwarfed by Starlink's 7,600. Analysts note that Eutelsat will need significant further investment to expand its network and upgrade its technology. While it may struggle in the mass-market consumer segment, the company is well-positioned to serve European government and enterprise clients who prioritize sovereign control over raw capacity.</p>

          <p>Quemoy, an island group administered by Taipei but located less than 10km from mainland China, serves as a unique case study in the cross-strait relationship. Once a heavily militarized front line for Taiwan, it has since transformed into a quiet community caught between two political systems. The island's current state reveals the practical limits of both Beijing's and Taipei's influence. Despite its history as a symbol of Taiwanese governance, its proximity and economic ties to the mainland create a complex dynamic that challenges the narratives of both sides.</p>

The ban, which does not apply to e-cigarettes or the terraces of bars and restaurants, is part of a broader strategy to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032.

This year's events take on a heightened political significance due to efforts by the Trump administration and Republicans to roll back LGBTQ+ rights, particularly those affecting transgender people. Organizers adopted themes like "Rise Up: Pride in Protest" to reflect the current climate. The events also face headwinds from reduced corporate sponsorship, as some companies pull back from diversity and inclusion initiatives.</p>
