          <p>A new biography by Sam Tanenhaus, titled "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America," examines the profound influence of William F. Buckley Jr. on the American conservative movement. The article highlights how Buckley, through his magazine National Review and TV show "Firing Line," helped elevate figures like Ronald Reagan and shifted the Republican Party to the right. The author and other commentators, including Newt Gingrich, draw a direct line from Buckley's intellectual and cultural politics to the rise of President Donald Trump, making his legacy both foundational and complex.</p>

          <p>This article previews the key factors expected to influence the stock market in the holiday-shortened week ahead, with a primary focus on the labor market. Investors will be closely watching the JOLTS report, ADP private payrolls, and the official nonfarm payrolls report for signs of economic strength or weakness that could affect Federal Reserve policy. The second major factor is potential updates on trade policy, particularly regarding tariffs and negotiations with China and other partners. These policy developments and economic indicators will be central to market movements in a quiet week for corporate earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has significantly altered its proposed welfare reform bill after facing a substantial rebellion from over 120 of its own backbench MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the initial rollout was mishandled and that concessions, such as limiting cuts to Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants only, have put the government in a "better position." Rebel MPs, who were concerned the plans would harm disabled and vulnerable people, have indicated they are now likely to support the bill, averting a major defeat for the Prime Minister.</p>

          <p>The upcoming movie "Superman," directed by James Gunn, aims to present a more "down-to-Earth" version of the iconic hero. In a recent interview, Gunn explained that his Superman is not indestructible and that the story explores his loneliness as an alien trying to be part of humanity. Actor David Corenswet, who takes on the role, spoke about the challenge of following Christopher Reeve's definitive portrayal and embracing the character's inherent vulnerability. The film, which features a reported budget of over $225 million, is the first major feature from the newly rebooted DC Studios.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced a new plan to partner with supermarkets and food manufacturers to encourage healthier eating habits among the public. Instead of imposing strict rules, the strategy will rely on voluntary actions from retailers, such as offering promotions on healthy items or adjusting loyalty point systems. The initiative aims to make healthy options more accessible and affordable to help tackle rising obesity rates, which cost the NHS billions annually. The opposition criticized the plan as a "nanny state" approach, while retail groups welcomed the collaborative and flexible strategy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article by a psychologist suggests that people who are unhappy in their relationships often answer "no" to four specific questions. These questions probe whether partners feel they are on the same team during conflicts and if they can be their authentic selves with each other. They also assess if a partner shows genuine curiosity about one's inner world and whether they take accountability for their mistakes. The author explains that negative answers to these questions can indicate underlying issues like a lack of intimacy, trust, and mutual respect that contribute to misery.</p>

          <p>This article challenges the narrative of a "sex recession," arguing that while Gen Z may be having less penetrative sex, they are leading a new sexual revolution. It posits that this generation, shaped by the post-Roe era and online culture, views sex through a highly political lens and is actively questioning traditional definitions of virginity, gender, and relationships. The author interviews young people who are expanding the concept of sex beyond heterosexual intercourse and fighting for sexual and reproductive freedoms. The piece concludes that Gen Z's approach is reshaping societal expectations in profound ways.</p>

          <p>A new analysis of nearly 5 million retirement accounts by Vanguard reveals a strong correlation between income and 401(k) savings balances. For instance, workers earning between $100,000 and $150,000 have a median balance nearly double that of those earning between $50,000 and $75,000. The report also highlights the positive impact of automatic enrollment, which has significantly boosted savings for long-tenured employees.

She finds it concerning when candidates are only interested in high-level strategy and view hands-on implementation as outside their scope. At a startup, Jain explains, every team member must be able to identify a problem, devise a solution, and then get into the weeds to build and launch it. To assess this, she asks candidates to detail how they solved a past problem, listening for both excitement and a deep understanding of the process.</p>

While the business is not yet profitable, the income it generates helps cover the chateau's significant expenses.
