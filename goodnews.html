The 76-year-old politician had faced a potential 15-year prison sentence, and this acquittal removes a major legal obstacle for his family's influential political movement. His daughter, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, currently serves as the country's prime minister, although their party's public support has recently been declining according to polls.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of the season, has begun moving away from the North Carolina coast after causing tropical storm conditions in the Outer Banks. While the storm is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., the National Hurricane Center has issued warnings for "life-threatening surf and rip currents" along most of the East Coast. The Category 2 storm prompted evacuation orders and a state of emergency in North Carolina due to the risk of coastal flooding and dangerous waves.</p>

          <h2>Scientific Study Reveals Corn Plants Communicate Using Gas to Alter Soil and Defend Against Pests</h2>

          <p>A new study has found that corn plants can communicate with each other by releasing a gas called linalool, which signals neighboring plants to alter their soil composition. This mechanism helps the plants defend against herbivores, though it may also reduce their growth in densely planted fields. The international team of scientists believes this discovery could lead to new strategies for optimizing the use of this chemical signal to enhance pest resistance and improve crop yields in agriculture.</p>

          <p>A growing trend sees couples incorporating their pet dogs into their wedding ceremonies, treating them as integral family members. Dogs are taking on roles such as ring bearers, "flower girls," and honored guests, reflecting a cultural shift where pets are viewed as best friends and sources of emotional support. To meet this demand, specialized "dog chaperone" services have emerged to manage the pets on the big day, ensuring they are well-cared for and can participate in the celebrations without issue.</p>

          <p>According to court filings from a legal case between Elon Musk and OpenAI, Musk asked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to help finance a $97.4 billion takeover bid for the AI company in early 2025. The proposal was part of Musk's effort to prevent OpenAI, which he co-founded as a non-profit, from transitioning into a for-profit entity. The filing indicates that Zuckerberg and Meta did not sign the letter of intent, revealing a previously unknown aspect of the high-stakes rivalry in the AI industry.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, eased to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% in the previous month. While this marks a slight cooling, the figure remains above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for the 40th consecutive month, keeping pressure on the central bank to adjust its monetary policy. The moderation was partly driven by an easing in rice price inflation, which had previously surged, though the "core-core" inflation metric held steady at 3.4%. (not investment advice)</p>
