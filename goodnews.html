        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve have made home equity loans more affordable for homeowners, who currently hold an average of $300,000 in equity. For a $90,000 loan, the monthly payment on a 15-year term has decreased to approximately $871, down from around $886 at the beginning of the year. While the costs are lower than in recent history, they have not dropped dramatically enough to make it a clear choice over a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). Homeowners are advised to carefully weigh their options, as the loan uses their home as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

Concurrently, asset management firm BlackRock received a strong endorsement from Bank of America, which raised its price target and reiterated a buy rating. Analysts expect BlackRock's net flows to increase significantly in the third quarter, driven by its fixed income and equity businesses. The bank also highlighted BlackRock's strategic position to capitalize on growth in alternative assets, such as private-market infrastructure investments, which are in high demand due to the AI boom.

          <p>An expedition team from Purdue University is preparing to investigate a "visual anomaly" on a remote Pacific island that they believe is the wreckage of Amelia Earhart's lost aircraft. The object, identified in satellite imagery of a lagoon on Nikumaroro island, has been visible in photos since 1938, a year after Earhart's disappearance. Researchers cite "very strong" evidence and plan to use sonar and magnetometers before attempting to dredge and identify the object. If confirmed to be Earhart's Electra 10E plane, the university hopes to bring it back to its campus, as Earhart had planned to return it there after her historic flight.</p>

          <p>Military officials have identified the remains of U.S. Navy Fireman 1st Class Edward D. Bowden, who was killed during the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. Bowden was 29 years old and serving aboard the USS California when it was sunk by Japanese forces, resulting in the deaths of over 100 crew members. His remains were among those deemed unidentifiable for decades and were buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. Through modern DNA analysis and other scientific methods, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency successfully made the identification and notified his surviving family members.

          <p>A significant drop in mortgage rates since the beginning of 2025 has provided financial relief for homebuyers, particularly those seeking large loans. For a $700,000 mortgage, the average 30-year fixed rate has fallen from 6.93% in January to 6.34% today, reducing the monthly principal and interest payment by approximately $273. This change translates to over $3,200 in annual savings and nearly $100,000 over the entire life of the loan. The lower rates have also created refinancing opportunities for current homeowners, though they must consider closing costs when evaluating the potential benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Bay Area woman, Marissa Chase, is advocating for greater awareness of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) after her own challenging journey to motherhood. After a year of trying to conceive, she was diagnosed with PCOS, a leading but often underdiagnosed cause of infertility affecting one in ten women. A specialist explained that many women with PCOS do not ovulate regularly, making unassisted conception difficult. Following successful fertility treatment that allowed her to have two children, Chase is sharing her story to encourage others facing similar issues to seek medical help and maintain hope for building a family.</p>

          <p>Fair Isaac, the company behind the FICO credit score, saw its stock surge over 20% after announcing a new business model that allows it to license scores directly to mortgage lenders. This change could bypass credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax, whose stocks fell on the news, as it aims to eliminate unnecessary markups on the widely used credit score. The new plan offers lenders a choice between two pricing models, a move praised by the Federal Housing Finance Agency director as a creative solution to make markets more competitive. Analysts believe the shift will improve Fair Isaac's economics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla announced it delivered 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter of 2025, a 7% increase from the same period last year, though its stock dipped following the report. The sales figures were likely boosted by U.S. buyers rushing to purchase vehicles before a key federal tax credit for EVs expired at the end of the quarter. While deliveries were up, vehicle production declined slightly compared to the previous year. The company's performance was hampered by a sales slump in Europe but offset by stronger demand in the U.S. ahead of the policy change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to purchase OxyChem, the petrochemical division of Occidental Petroleum, in a cash deal valued at $9.7 billion. This acquisition represents Berkshire's largest since 2022 and utilizes a portion of its massive cash reserve. Occidental Petroleum plans to use a significant portion of the proceeds, approximately $6.5 billion, to reduce its corporate debt. The move is expected to strengthen Occidental's balance sheet and allow the company to resume its stock buyback program, marking a key step in its long-term financial transformation.
