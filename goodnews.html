          <p>China's economy grew by 5.2% in the second quarter, exceeding economists' predictions and keeping the nation on course to meet its annual 5% growth target. Despite this, signs of weakness persist, with retail sales growth slowing and the real estate market continuing to struggle. The stronger-than-expected GDP figure may reduce immediate pressure on policymakers to implement large-scale stimulus measures. Officials acknowledged the need to boost domestic consumption and support the property sector to ensure sustainable growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia has announced it expects to soon resume sales of its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China, after receiving assurances from the U.S. government that export licenses will be granted. The sales were previously halted in April due to U.S. export controls designed to limit Beijing's access to advanced technology. The potential reversal follows lobbying efforts by CEO Jensen Huang, who argued the restrictions were harming American tech leadership. This development is seen as a significant positive for Nvidia, potentially boosting its market share in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese aerospace company Space Pioneer announced its Tianlong-3 rocket has passed a critical ground-based stress test, a significant milestone following an explosive failure during a similar test last year. The test simulated key mission phases, confirming the structural integrity of the rocket's nine-engine first stage. This success is crucial for the development of the reusable rocket, which is vital for China's ambitions in commercial spaceflight, including satellite deployment. The previous incident involved the rocket unexpectedly lifting off and crashing, creating a large fireball.</p>

          <p>Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg has declared the company will spend hundreds of billions of dollars to construct enormous artificial intelligence data centers in the United States. This massive investment is part of Meta's push to develop "superintelligence," technology that could surpass human intellect. The first facility, named Prometheus, is set to be operational in Ohio in 2026, with another multi-gigawatt cluster, Hyperion, planned for Louisiana. This move signals Meta's intent to become a dominant force in the AI sector by building some of the world's most powerful AI hardware infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary stay, blocking the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of people from Afghanistan. The administration had planned to revoke the protections, arguing the security situation in Afghanistan had improved, but opponents contend the country remains unsafe. The ruling from the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals provides a brief reprieve, giving advocacy groups and the government time to file further briefs. This decision is part of a larger legal battle over the administration's efforts to curtail the TPS program for several nations.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh has won the 2025 All-Star Home Run Derby, defeating Tampa Bay's Junior Caminero in the final round. Raleigh, who led the major leagues with 38 home runs at the All-Star break, is the first catcher and the first switch-hitter to win the competition. He secured a dramatic victory after advancing from the first round on a tiebreaker. The event also featured a 513-foot home run by Pittsburgh's Oneil Cruz, the longest of the night, highlighting the power on display at Truist Park.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists at Tel Aviv University have discovered the first evidence of an animal responding to sounds made by plants, suggesting a previously unknown layer of ecosystem interaction. The study found that female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were emitting ultrasonic sounds associated with distress, such as dehydration. While plants are not sentient, they produce these sounds through physical processes when stressed. This groundbreaking research opens up the possibility that many animals may use these plant-based acoustic cues to make decisions about pollination, feeding, or shelter.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has revealed a new plan to supply Ukraine with "top-of-the-line weapons" through NATO allies, who will be reimbursed by the United States for sending their own Patriot air defense systems. In a significant policy shift, Trump also threatened Russia with 100% secondary tariffs on its trade partners if a peace deal is not reached within 50 days. The move marks a tougher stance against Moscow, with Trump expressing frustration over the lack of progress in ending the war and signaling that talk must now be replaced by action.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a new manufacturing technique that could significantly improve the performance of superalloy turbine discs, a critical component in aircraft engines. The method allows for faster cooling of the metal alloy, which enhances the quality and durability of the discs, directly impacting an engine's power and lifespan. This technological advancement is crucial for China's efforts to overcome its long-standing challenges in producing advanced, high-performance jet engines, particularly for its next-generation fighter aircraft.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has formally requested that the Supreme Court reject an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking crimes. Maxwell's lawyers argued that a non-prosecution agreement Epstein signed in 2007 should have protected her from federal charges. However, the DOJ countered that the agreement was limited to a specific Florida district and that Maxwell was, at best, an incidental beneficiary. This follows lower court rulings that also rejected her argument for immunity from prosecution.</p>

          <p>Bob Becker, an 80-year-old runner from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has made history by becoming the oldest person to finish the Badwater 135, often called "the world's toughest foot race." The ultramarathon covers 135 miles through California's Death Valley, where temperatures can exceed 120°F. Becker completed the grueling course with about three hours to spare before the 48-hour cutoff. His successful finish was a personal redemption after he narrowly missed the cutoff time in 2022, demonstrating remarkable endurance and determination at an age when most have long since retired from competitive sport.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles experienced its busiest June in its 117-year history, processing a record number of shipping containers. Port executives attribute the surge to a "tariff whipsaw effect," as importers raced to get goods into the country before President Trump's trade tariff deadlines, particularly those on Chinese products. While the numbers show an 8% increase over last year, officials caution this is not a sign of a booming economy but rather a temporary distortion caused by shifting trade policies. They anticipate a significant drop in cargo volume once new tariffs take effect. (not investment advice)</p>

This strong declaration comes after a recent incident where a Beijing-based envoy allegedly attempted to persuade Paraguayan opposition lawmakers to switch diplomatic recognition to China.
