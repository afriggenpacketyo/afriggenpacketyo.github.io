          <p>This article explores how numerous artists and musicians who prospered under the Nazi regime managed to revive their careers after World War II. Despite their association with Hitler and the Nazi party, figures like conductor Herbert von Karajan and sculptor Arno Breker continued to receive commissions and acclaim. The denazification process, intended to remove Nazis from positions of power, often proved lenient, allowing many artists to resume their work. The article raises questions about how society should address the legacy of artists who benefited from oppressive regimes, even when their artistic contributions are significant. Relevant context is provided by detailing the "divinely gifted" list, which protected certain artists from military service under Hitler's orders. </p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and India have entered into a bilateral trade agreement that aims to lower tariffs on key exports, including whisky and cars from the UK, against a backdrop of rising global trade tensions. The agreement will gradually reduce taxes on imports from the UK into India, with the majority of traded goods becoming tariff-free within a decade. This deal arrives as the United States, under President Donald Trump, has been increasing tariffs on imports worldwide, leading to strained relationships with both allies and adversaries. The UK government anticipates significant economic benefits from this trade partnership. </p>

          <p>This New York Times article delves into how states utilize taxes on hospitals and nursing homes to boost federal Medicaid matching funds, a practice that has become a mainstay of Medicaid financing. Congressional Republicans are now contemplating curtailing or eliminating these taxes to achieve federal spending reductions. The change could disproportionately affect Republican-led states, which tend to rely more heavily on this strategy. Critics label these payments as gimmicks and scams, while supporters argue they are a legitimate means of maximizing federal funding for healthcare. </p>

          <p>Luxury carmaker Ferrari reported a 17% increase in first-quarter profit, driven by strong demand for personalized vehicles, but cautioned that potential U.S. tariffs on EU cars could negatively affect earnings this year.

Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna noted that all key metrics recorded double-digit growth, underscoring strong profitability driven by product mix and continued demand for personalizations. The automaker warned that the introduction of U.S. tariffs on EU cars imported into the U.S. could reduce profitability percentage margins by 50 basis points. </p>
