          <p>Donald Trump is spending the second day of his visit to Scotland on his Turnberry golf course amid a significant police presence. Before scheduled talks with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, he is playing a round of golf with guests and family. The discussions are set to focus on transatlantic trade relations, with Trump suggesting a 50-50 chance of a deal while also threatening steep tariffs if talks fail. He is also scheduled to meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney in the coming days to discuss trade and other international issues.</p>

          <h2>Experts Affirm Sunscreen's Importance Amid Online Misinformation and Safety Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 06:40:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health experts are reinforcing the critical importance of using sunscreen to prevent skin cancer, which is on the rise globally. The article addresses public concerns fueled by online myths and legitimate questions about the safety of some chemical ingredients like oxybenzone, which can be absorbed into the bloodstream. Scientists emphasize that while research into safer, plant-based alternatives is ongoing, the cancer-prevention benefits of current approved sunscreens far outweigh the potential risks. They also advise against homemade sunscreens and caution that mixing different sunscreen products can reduce their effectiveness, urging consumers to prioritize sun protection.</p>

          <p>Two years after initiating a contentious divorce, former 'Real Housewives of Atlanta' star Kim Zolciak and her estranged husband Kroy Biermann are rebuilding their lives separately. Biermann, a former NFL player, has transitioned to a new career in crane and rigging sales in Atlanta. Meanwhile, Zolciak has moved into a new home, launched two new TV shows, and recently reconnected with her estranged parents. Their daughter, Ariana, has commented on the difficulty of the divorce, noting the family will have to testify in court but also that the situation has strengthened her bond with her mother and sister.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has identified a new, super-large zirconium deposit, a critical mineral for advanced technologies like hypersonic weapons. The deposit, the first of its kind found in a terrestrial basin in China, is estimated to contain two million tonnes of zirconium dioxide. This discovery effectively quintuples the nation's current zirconium reserves. Zirconium alloys are highly valued for their extreme resistance to heat and corrosion, making them essential components in manufacturing key parts of hypersonic vehicles, such as scramjet combustion chambers, nose cones, and thermal protection systems, potentially resolving a key strategic vulnerability for the country.</p>

          <p>This article explores the leadership qualities of England women's football manager Sarina Wiegman, who has led the team to the Euro 2025 final against Spain. Known for her calm demeanor, direct communication, and tactical acumen, Wiegman has instilled a resilient and winning culture in the squad. Players describe her as a protective, mother-like figure who is also ruthless in her decision-making and has a deep understanding of the human side of management. Having previously led the Netherlands to European glory, her consistent approach, reliance on 'finishers' from the bench, and ability to handle pressure have been key to her continued success with the Lionesses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the cancellation of 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert' by Paramount-owned CBS, prominent comedians have launched a wave of satirical pushback. Jon Stewart on 'The Daily Show' and the creators of 'South Park' delivered sharp critiques of the decision, which many speculate is linked to Colbert's vocal criticism of the Trump administration. 'South Park's' season premiere was a pointed satire of President Trump, Christian nationalism, and corporate self-censorship. Colbert himself has promised the 'gloves are off' for his remaining months, signaling that any attempt to stifle political commentary may have backfired by emboldening satirists to be even more critical.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread concern over President Trump's threatened tariffs, major U.S. stock indices like the S&P 500 have been hitting record highs. This seeming paradox is attributed to several factors, including a more resilient U.S. economy than anticipated, with a strong labor market and continued consumer spending. Corporate profits have also been better than feared, and there is a growing market belief that the president's ultimate tariff actions will be less severe than his initial threats. However, some analysts remain cautious, noting that stocks are expensive and vulnerable to shocks if major trade deals fail. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing changes to planning and licensing rules in England and Wales to better protect pubs and music venues from noise complaints, which have threatened the existence of many establishments. Under the reforms, developers building new properties near existing venues would be required to soundproof the new buildings. The plan also aims to fast-track permissions for new businesses in disused shops and for al fresco dining to help reverse the steady decline of the pub industry. The Labour government hopes the changes will remove red tape and bring vibrancy to struggling towns.</p>

          <p>Ghanaian President John Mahama has initiated a '24-hour economy' policy aimed at transforming the nation's economy and creating widespread employment. The plan involves key industries operating in three eight-hour shifts daily, keeping sectors like agriculture and manufacturing running around the clock. The goal is to shift Ghana from an import-based economy to a self-sufficient one, potentially creating 1.7 million new jobs. However, economists raise concerns about the feasibility of the project, pointing to the need for approximately $4 billion in funding, significant infrastructure upgrades like a stable power supply, and a fundamental shift in the national work mindset.</p>
