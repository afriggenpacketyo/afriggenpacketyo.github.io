          <p>New Orleans Saints quarterback Derek Carr has retired from professional football due to a labral tear and degenerative rotator cuff injury in his right shoulder. Carr, 34, played for 11 seasons, most notably with the Oakland Raiders, before joining the Saints in 2023. During his time with the Saints, Carr went 14-13 as a starter but struggled with injuries, causing him to miss seven games last season. The Saints recently drafted Tyler Shough as a potential future quarterback, adding uncertainty to the team's quarterback situation.</p>

          <p>Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton faced backlash on social media for not speaking to the media after a disappointing performance in Game 3 against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Haliburton scored only four points in the game, a playoff career-low, as the Pacers lost 126-104. Critics, including IndyStar sports editors, called out Haliburton for not taking responsibility for his poor performance and avoiding the media, especially as the face of the franchise. Donovan Mitchell scored 43 points for the Cavaliers, who cut the series deficit to 2-1.</p>

          <p>The Channel Islands, often called California's Galapagos, are home to a vast underwater ecosystem thriving due to marine protected areas. These MPAs cover roughly 21% of the islands' waters, preserving them as refuge for thousands of species and drawing ecotourists for diving and observation. However, the California fish and game commission is conducting a review of these MPAs, considering proposals to either expand or reduce protections. Scientists and conservationists hope the abundance that has flourished demonstrates the value of preservation, as the areas have proven able to feed and fuel nearby fisheries.</p>

The White House has not responded to the ruling, which is the broadest of its kind against the government overhaul led by Elon Musk's "department of government efficiency" (Doge).</p>
