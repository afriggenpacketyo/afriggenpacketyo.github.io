          <p>The UK government is set to invest ¬£1.5 billion in at least six new munitions and explosives factories to bolster its defense capabilities and deter adversaries. This initiative aims to support the production of 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons, creating approximately 1,800 new jobs and increasing the UK's munitions spending to ¬£6 billion during this parliament. Defence Secretary John Healey emphasized that the move is a response to lessons learned from the war in Ukraine, highlighting the importance of a strong domestic defense industry. Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that a strong economy needs a strong national defense, and this investment is proof that the two go hand-in-hand.</p>

This marks the first time since 1968 that two British men have reached the French Open last 16, with Jack Draper also advancing.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved Moderna's new COVID-19 vaccine, mNexspike, for adults 65 and older, and for individuals aged 12 to 64 with health conditions that increase their risk from the coronavirus. This vaccine, which uses a lower dose, is not intended as a replacement for Moderna's existing shot, Spikevax. The approval reflects skepticism from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other Trump administration officials regarding vaccines. This decision contrasts with the broader use of Moderna's original vaccine, which is available for anyone aged 6 months and older.</p>
