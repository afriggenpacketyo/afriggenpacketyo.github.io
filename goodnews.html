          <p>A federal judge in Boston issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from firing half of the Department of Education's workforce and transferring federal student loan management to the Small Business Administration. The judge criticized the administration's claim that the changes were to improve efficiency, asserting they would make it impossible for the department to fulfill its mandated functions. The ruling is in response to a lawsuit filed by state attorneys general, schools, and nonprofits challenging Trump's efforts to reduce the size of the Department of Education.

          <p>The U.S. Treasury has ordered its last batch of "blanks" for pennies and will cease minting the one-cent coins due to rising production costs. The move is expected to save taxpayers $85 million annually, as each penny costs 3.69 cents to produce. The last of the new pennies will enter circulation early next year, eventually leading to businesses rounding prices to the nearest nickel. The Treasury Department estimates savings of $56 million in material costs from halting production. Optimism score is 75.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department will stop minting pennies after placing its last order for blank coins, aiming to save $56 million annually due to production costs exceeding the coin's value.

The Trump administration initiated the move, following similar actions in Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.

          <p>Net migration to the UK nearly halved in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The decrease was driven by fewer people coming to work and study, coupled with the departure of many who arrived on study visas after the pandemic. The number of dependents accompanying those on work and study visas also fell significantly. The Home Office reported a decline in asylum seekers housed in hotels, although the figure remains higher than when Labour came to power. Optimism score is 60.</p>
