        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey reveals that 44% of American adults are ordering kids' meals at restaurants, a trend driven by a desire for smaller portions and lower prices amid economic pressures. This shift in consumer behavior comes as some major fast-food chains report slowing sales, particularly among low-income customers. Diners are finding that the simpler, less expensive options on children's menus offer a practical way to manage their budgets without giving up on eating out entirely. The article highlights that this choice is becoming a smart financial decision for many, not just a nostalgic one.</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. unexpectedly increased by 2% in July, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.01 million units, according to the National Association of Realtors. This uptick is attributed to a temporary dip in mortgage rates during May and June, when these purchase contracts were likely initiated. Housing inventory also grew to its highest level since May 2020, helping to moderate price growth, with the median home price seeing only a slight 0.2% year-over-year increase.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is gaining traction among wealthy investors as a way to defer capital gains taxes on highly appreciated assets. The method involves exchanging stocks from a taxable account for shares in a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) before it launches, effectively postponing the tax bill until the ETF shares are sold. While this allows for rebalancing without immediate tax consequences, the process has strict diversification requirements and high investment minimums, often starting at $1 million. Financial advisors caution that investors must be content with the new ETF, as exit options can be limited. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new $3 billion biologics manufacturing plant in North Carolina, set to be used by Regeneron and Johnson & Johnson, illustrates the immense difficulty of quickly moving pharmaceutical production to the U.S. The facility has taken five years to become operational, a timeline that underscores how challenging it would be for the industry to adapt to potential tariffs proposed by President Trump. Despite pressure to increase domestic manufacturing, the complex and lengthy process of building and getting regulatory approval for such facilities means companies cannot rapidly shift their supply chains. This reality complicates efforts to insulate the drug supply from international trade disputes.</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates showing a downward trend, financial experts are advising homeowners with high-interest loans to prepare for a potential refinancing opportunity. Key steps include reviewing credit reports for errors, protecting credit scores by avoiding new debt, and estimating home equity. Homeowners should also begin gathering necessary documents like proof of income, insurance, and existing mortgage statements. By preparing in advance, borrowers can move quickly to lock in a lower rate when the market is favorable, potentially saving a significant amount on their monthly payments.

          <p>The draw for the US Open has been revealed, setting up potentially difficult matchups for several key players. Britain's Emma Raducanu, unseeded, will start against a qualifier but could face formidable opponents like Veronika Kudermetova and Elena Rybakina in early rounds. Top seeds Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are on track for another Grand Slam final meeting, though Alcaraz faces a tough first-round match against big-serving Reilly Opelka. The women's draw is headed by Aryna Sabalenka, with Iga Swiatek entering as a heavy favorite in the other half.</p>

          <p>For the first time in decades, senior officials from Syria and Israel have held direct, US-brokered talks in Paris, signaling a potential move toward de-escalation. The discussions focused on reactivating a 1974 disengagement agreement, ensuring security along the Golan Heights border, and providing humanitarian aid to Syria's Druze minority. Tensions have been high since the fall of the Assad regime, with Israel conducting numerous strikes in Syria. Syria's interim government has condemned the attacks but expressed a desire to avoid war, creating an opening for these diplomatic efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As ESPN launched its new direct-to-consumer streaming service, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced the company will not report subscriber numbers, calling the metric "irrelevant." Instead, Disney will focus on overall revenue and profits for its Sports division, taking an "agnostic" approach to whether viewers watch via cable or the new app. This strategy mirrors moves by Netflix and Apple, aiming to prevent investor fixation on a single metric that can be volatile. The focus remains on monetizing the ESPN brand through advertising and features like sports betting, regardless of the platform used. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. and the European Union have detailed their new trade framework, under which the U.S. will impose a 15% tariff on European cars, pharmaceuticals, and other goods. In return, the EU will eliminate tariffs on all American industrial exports and offer preferential market access for certain U.S. agricultural and seafood products. The agreement also includes significant commitments for EU investments in the U.S. and purchases of American energy and AI chips. This pact aims to rebalance the trade relationship and avert the threat of higher, more disruptive tariffs previously floated by President Trump.</p>
