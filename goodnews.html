          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced a profit-sharing agreement with Japan for $550 billion in investments in US-based projects. Initially, profits will be split equally until Japan recoups its investment, after which the US will receive 90% and Japan 10%. This deal, part of a broader tariff agreement, aims to boost domestic manufacturing in the US, funding projects like nuclear power plants and antibiotic production. Lutnick stated the arrangement benefits both nations, providing Japan with lower tariffs and the US with significant capital for development, without long-term cost to Japanese taxpayers.

The items, priced between 980 yuan and 56,800 yuan, are available in Beijing and Shanghai stores. This expansion into gold, following a silver jewellery line launched in January, led to a more than 4% surge in the company's Hong Kong-listed shares.

          <p>The European Union accepted Microsoft's commitments to unbundle its Teams communication platform from its popular productivity apps, thereby exempting the company from a potentially substantial antitrust fine. This decision, binding for seven years or more, addresses concerns that Microsoft's bundling practices hindered competition. Under the agreement, Microsoft will offer Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites at reduced prices without Teams, enhance interoperability with rival tools, and allow data migration. The resolution follows an EU investigation initiated in 2023 after a complaint from Salesforce-owned Slack, marking a significant outcome in tech regulation.</p>

This vital service, highlighted in an Oscar-winning documentary, has now received a $1 million donation from music legend Herb Alpert, who began his own musical journey with a school trumpet. The donation aims to sustain the shop, which has faced financial struggles, and promote music education as a crucial part of child development, inspiring other districts to invest in similar programs.</p>

          <p>Colorado has proactively revamped its vaccine policies, allowing the state to consult non-federal scientific sources for school vaccine requirements and enabling pharmacists to administer COVID shots without individual prescriptions. This move, spearheaded by Governor Jared Polis and state legislators, is a direct response to concerns that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is undermining trust in vaccines and public health science. Other states are also considering similar alliances to preserve vaccine access and scientific integrity, marking a significant shift in public health authority from federal to state levels.</p>
