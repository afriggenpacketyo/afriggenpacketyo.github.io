          <p>Harvard University and the University of Toronto have established a joint program to allow certain international graduate students to study in Canada if they are barred from the U.S. due to visa restrictions. This contingency plan follows a move by the U.S. government to terminate Harvard's ability to enroll international students, a decision currently blocked by a federal judge. The program is designed to provide stability for students at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government amid financial pressures and funding cuts linked to the Trump administration's policies. The plan will only be activated if there is sufficient demand from students unable to enter or return to the United States.</p>

          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has successfully completed the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted without open-skull surgery. The minimally invasive procedure involved inserting a stent electrode through a neck vein into the brain's vascular network. This innovative technique was used on a 67-year-old paralyzed patient, reportedly helping him regain some limb movement. The method is presented as a lower-risk alternative to more invasive approaches, such as that used by Elon Musk's Neuralink, potentially reducing surgical trauma and shortening recovery times for patients.</p>

          <p>Despite a performance that their manager described as incomplete, the Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-4 victory over the Kansas City Royals, claiming the best record in Major League Baseball. The game was marked by defensive errors and a shaky start from pitcher Dustin May, but the Dodgers' offense did just enough to win. Shohei Ohtani hit his 29th home run and a crucial RBI triple, while Max Muncy added a two-run homer. The bullpen held on, culminating in a game-ending double play with the bases loaded in the ninth inning, showcasing the team's ability to win even when not playing at their best.</p>

The academy product, who signed a new five-year contract last year, had a breakthrough season under Maresca. Sources close to the player have also refuted suggestions that he is frustrated at the club, indicating a loan would only be considered if mutually beneficial.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that consuming a traditional Japanese-style diet is associated with a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals. The research, conducted by the Japan Institute for Health Security, assessed a diet rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables. Among nearly 12,500 employees studied, those who adhered to this diet were less likely to exhibit depressive symptoms. Researchers suggest that nutrients like folic acid and omega-3 fatty acids, prevalent in the diet, may contribute to improved mental well-being by assisting neurotransmitter release and providing anti-inflammatory effects.</p>

Antoine Massey, 33, was arrested peacefully at a residence in New Orleans and will be transferred to a secure state correctional facility. The May 16 escape, which went unnoticed for hours, has drawn criticism of the jail's management and infrastructure. One inmate, Derrick Groves, remains at large, with a $50,000 reward offered for information leading to his arrest.
