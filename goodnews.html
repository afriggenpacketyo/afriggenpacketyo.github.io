        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has revived a lawsuit from an Ohio woman who claimed she experienced reverse discrimination when her employer denied her a promotion because she is straight. The unanimous decision in Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services rejects the requirement for majority group members to meet a higher bar in discrimination cases. Marlean Ames sued after allegedly being passed over for a promotion in favor of a gay woman and then demoted and replaced by a gay man, claiming sexual orientation discrimination. This ruling comes amid broader scrutiny of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs following the Supreme Court's decision ending affirmative action in college admissions.</p>

          <p>Two major convenience store chains in Japan, Family Mart Co. and Lawson Inc., have started selling government-released stockpiled rice at select stores in Tokyo and Osaka.

The stores will sell rice from the 2021 harvest in small portions, targeting individuals and smaller households. The government is releasing a total of 610,000 tons of stockpiled rice to combat the price surge.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated a review of its rice policy in response to soaring grain prices, aiming to boost production and prevent supply shortages. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has pledged to ensure stable rice supplies, as prices have doubled over the past year, leading to the release of government stockpiles. The government held its first meeting of relevant ministers to examine the reasons behind the persistent price uptrend and explore potential solutions. This review comes as rice from government reserves begins to reach store shelves at a lower price.</p>
