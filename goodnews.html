          <p>As market expectations grow for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut, certain sectors like housing and finance could see significant benefits. Companies such as Home Depot, Capital One, and Wells Fargo are highlighted as being well-positioned to gain from a lower-interest-rate environment, which typically stimulates consumer spending and loan activity. The article notes that the actual impact will depend on whether bond yields, which influence mortgage rates, follow their historical pattern of declining alongside the Fed's benchmark rate.

Major sportsbooks like FanDuel and DraftKings are preparing for a surge in activity, but they face increasing competition from unlicensed offshore betting sites. In response, law enforcement and attorneys general are intensifying crackdowns on these illegal operations, citing billions in lost state tax revenue.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is anticipating a record-breaking Labor Day travel period, expecting to screen approximately 17.5 million people through Wednesday. This surge comes despite a communications outage that caused hundreds of delays at Newark Liberty International Airport, highlighting ongoing challenges within the air traffic control system. Meanwhile, most Americans traveling for the holiday will drive, benefiting from gasoline prices that are, on average, about 15 cents per gallon cheaper than last year.</p>

Brokers report a surge in listings for these sprawling, often historic estates in states like Wyoming, Montana, and California, driven by strong demand from wealthy buyers. While some families sell due to disinterest from the next generation, many are forced into sales for financial reasons, as maintaining these capital-intensive properties proves too challenging without unified family support.</p>
