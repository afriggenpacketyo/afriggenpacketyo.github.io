          <p>Strawberry growers in the UK are reporting a "stonking start" to the season, with warm days and cooler nights contributing to sweeter than usual fruit. The dry spring is proving beneficial, allowing strawberries to rest and concentrate energy into producing high natural sugars. Growers have irrigation systems in place to mitigate potential drought conditions, and forecasters predict continued favorable weather for strawberry growing in the coming week. This contrasts with the previous year, when wet weather delayed ripening.</p>

          <p>The ancient Hawaiian tradition of lei making is celebrated for its beauty and expression of aloha, but faces threats from suburban sprawl and climate change. Flower farms are disappearing, and rising temperatures are overheating remaining land, leading to increased reliance on imported flowers. Lei makers are adapting by using alternative materials like wood beads and unripe fruit to sustain the tradition.
