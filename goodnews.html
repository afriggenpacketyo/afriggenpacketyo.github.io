          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James' town hall was briefly disrupted by a Trump supporter who questioned her investigation into the former president. The individual accused James of wasting taxpayer money on a "witch trial" and made unfounded claims about her own legal troubles. James, known for her lawsuit against Trump and his associates alleging financial fraud, has faced accusations of a politically motivated "witch hunt" from Trump and is now subject to a Department of Justice criminal investigation regarding accusations that she misrepresented a single-family home in Virginia as her primary residence to obtain more favorable loan terms.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has granted refugee status to 54 Afrikaners, white South Africans of Dutch descent, who are expected to arrive in the U.S. following an executive order signed by President Trump in February. This order prioritizes humanitarian relief for Afrikaners facing racial discrimination in South Africa and cuts aid to the country. The group will be resettled in various states, including Colorado, Massachusetts, and New York, with some having existing family ties in the U.S. The South African government has criticized the move, stating that Afrikaners remain among the most economically privileged in their country.</p>

          <p>An Arizona court allowed the use of an AI-generated likeness of a deceased veteran, Christopher Pelkey, to deliver a victim impact statement during the sentencing of his killer, Gabriel Horcasitas. This unprecedented use of AI in legal proceedings has ignited debate about the potential for manipulation and deception in victim impact statements. The AI avatar, created using the victim's image and voice profile, delivered a message of forgiveness, which the judge praised. While victims have broad latitude in Arizona courts, legal experts are divided on whether this use of AI could constitute reversible error, raising concerns about the ethical implications of AI in the justice system.</p>

          <p>President Trump's selection of Dr. Casey Means, a wellness specialist, as Surgeon General has stirred debate due to her non-traditional medical background. Critics, including Laura Loomer, question her qualifications, citing her practice of "functional medicine" and lack of an active medical license. Supporters, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., defend her ability to inspire Americans to rethink healthcare. Dr. Means's brother, Calley Means, argues she left the medical system to better serve patients, while medical ethicists express concern over her promotion of unproven health interventions.</p>

          <p>A Southern California Edison transmission tower, being dismantled as part of an investigation into the Eaton fire, was damaged when the top portion contacted power lines during removal by helicopter. No injuries were reported, but the extent of the damage and its impact on the investigation are still being assessed. The tower was being removed to be tested for clues about the cause of the fire. Edison International's CEO has suggested that induction, a rare occurrence when idle towers are reenergized, is a leading theory into how the deadly fire was sparked.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with the UK that aims to increase market access for American farm exports while offering some relief from tariffs on UK goods. The deal maintains the 10% import tax on most UK goods but rolls back some tariffs on strategic sectors like cars and steel. In exchange, the US secured changes to expand sales of American agricultural products in the UK. While officials from both countries hailed the agreement as a breakthrough, analysts noted its limited substantive benefits and raised concerns about the impact on American carmakers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a trade agreement with Britain aimed at increasing market access for American farm exports, hailing it as a "tremendous" deal. In return, the U.S. agreed to arrangements such as allowing Britain to export 100,000 cars per year into the U.S. market with a 10 percent tariff. The agreement leaves in place a 10 percent baseline tariff imposed in April on almost all countries, but the United States will remove its additional tariffs of 25 percent on steel and aluminum. The deal provides hints for other countries on where the Trump administration stands on its tariff approach.</p>
