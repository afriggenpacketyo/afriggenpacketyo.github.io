        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool have become the first all-British pair to win the men's doubles title at Wimbledon in 89 years, defeating Rinky Hijikata and David Pel. Their victory marks a significant moment in British tennis history, being the first time two Britons have won a men's doubles Grand Slam since 1936. Following the win, Glasspool's uniquely muted celebration, a stark contrast to his partner's jubilation, drew attention, a habit he explained stemmed from a playful opposition to a former partner's exuberant reactions. The pair achieved a major career goal with this maiden Grand Slam title.</p>

          <p>Poland's Iga Świątek has won her first Wimbledon title, defeating American Amanda Anisimova in a commanding 6-0, 6-0 victory that lasted just 57 minutes. This "double bagel" win is the most one-sided women's final at the All England Club since 1911, securing Świątek's sixth Grand Slam title overall. The victory is particularly significant as it demonstrates her mastery on grass, previously considered her weakest surface, making her the youngest woman since Serena Williams to win majors on all three surfaces. Anisimova, in her first major final after returning from a mental health break, struggled with nerves and fatigue.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 15:00:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new solar-powered robot guided by artificial intelligence is being deployed in California cotton fields to combat weeds without using chemical herbicides. Developed by Aigen, the "Element" robot addresses labor shortages and the growing issue of herbicide-resistant weeds, offering a more sustainable farming alternative. The machine uses cameras to identify and mechanically remove weeds while navigating fields autonomously, collecting valuable data on crop health in the process. This innovation is already in use on farms, demonstrating a practical application of AI in reducing chemical dependency and operational costs in modern agriculture.</p>

Organizers described the day as a "great Twelfth," with large crowds and sunny weather, and noted the presence of many tourists.

          <p>An iconic Avro Lancaster bomber from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) executed an emergency return to its base at RAF Coningsby after experiencing an engine issue. The World War Two aircraft, one of only two still airworthy, was participating in a families' day event when the crew detected unusual engine behavior and saw black smoke. The crew, who were unharmed, safely landed the plane as a precautionary measure. The Royal Air Force has launched an investigation to determine the cause of the problem and its potential impact on the aircraft's future appearances.</p>

          <p>FIFA President Gianni Infantino has stated that the 2026 World Cup will make greater use of indoor, air-conditioned stadiums for daytime matches to address concerns about extreme heat. This decision follows complaints about player welfare during the current Club World Cup in the U.S., where temperatures have been dangerously high. Four of the 16 host venues for the tournament, which will be co-hosted by the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, are equipped with roofs and climate control. Infantino acknowledged heat as a significant issue and confirmed these venues will be prioritized for daytime kick-offs to ensure player safety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's recent flurry of tariff announcements, the stock market has remained relatively stable near record highs, unlike the panic seen in April. This analysis suggests that investors have become more accustomed to the president's negotiating style, treating the threats as rhetoric rather than imminent, unchangeable policy. The market's resilience is also attributed to strong underlying themes, such as the unfettered advancement of artificial intelligence and a deregulatory environment fostering M&A activity. These factors are believed to be driving corporate earnings potential, allowing the market to look past daily political headlines. (not investment advice)</p>

The campaigners have formally notified the Education Secretary of their intent to seek a judicial review. They contend that headteachers having discretion over phone use is insufficient to protect children from cyberbullying, sexual harassment, and exposure to harmful content. The Department for Education maintains that schools already have the power to ban phones and that the Online Safety Act provides additional protections.</p>

          <p>In response to rising tariff costs and trade uncertainty, businesses are increasingly utilizing U.S. Customs-sanctioned Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to delay or reduce taxes on imported goods. FTZs allow companies to import components duty-free, assemble them, and only pay duties when the final product enters U.S. commerce. However, a recent executive order has eliminated the "inverted tariff" benefit, which allowed companies to pay a lower duty rate on the finished product.
