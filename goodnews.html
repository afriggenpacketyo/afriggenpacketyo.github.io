          <p>WWE star Drew McIntyre shared the story behind his popular "Bored At Work" T-shirt, which originated from his social media posts during WrestleMania matches. He told Fox News Digital that he was persistent in getting the shirt made because he believed it would resonate with fans, despite initial hesitation from decision-makers. The shirt, which plays on the irony of people wearing it to their actual jobs, has become a top seller on the WWE Shop. McIntyre is set to face Randy Orton in his first match since May, highlighting his return to the ring after a brief hiatus.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has indicated that the likelihood of a summit between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping is "high." This assessment followed what he described as "constructive and positive" discussions with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, on the sidelines of a regional ASEAN meeting. Rubio acknowledged that there are still issues to be resolved between the two global powers but noted the meeting provided a basis for future cooperation. The discussion marked the first in-person meeting between the two top diplomats since Rubio took office.</p>

          <p>Intel is spinning out its AI robotics and biometric technology division into a new, independent company called RealSense. The move is supported by a $50 million Series A funding round, with investors including Intel Capital and MediaTek Innovation Fund. RealSense, which develops technology for robotics automation, plans to use the capital to create new product lines and meet growing global demand for automation tools. This decision comes as Intel undergoes cost-cutting measures and as major tech companies like Nvidia and Tesla increase their investments in the rapidly expanding robotics and physical AI market.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Roger Hutson, a Denver oil and gas executive who previously worked to prevent Donald Trump's presidency but has since become an impressed supporter. Hutson, who backed Marco Rubio in 2016 and was involved with the "No Labels" effort in 2024, now credits Trump with effectively securing the border, compelling allies to increase defense spending, and addressing unfair trade practices. While still critical of Trump's personality, Hutson's shift illustrates a willingness to change political viewpoints based on perceived policy accomplishments. His conversion highlights the complex dynamics of political persuasion in a deeply polarized America.</p>

          <h2>The Safety and Science of Microwave Ovens Explained</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 06:00:00 EDT</div>

          <p>This article addresses common concerns about the safety of microwave ovens, clarifying that they do not use the same harmful ionizing radiation as nuclear reactions. Instead, microwaves use non-ionizing electromagnetic waves, which are much less powerful and do not make food radioactive or damage human DNA. In fact, microwave cooking can be one of the best methods for preserving nutrients in food because of the shorter cooking times. The primary risks associated with microwaves are burns from hot containers and food, and the potential for chemicals to leach from unsafe plastic containers, not radiation exposure.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is testing Devin, an autonomous AI software engineer from the startup Cognition, marking a significant milestone in AI adoption on Wall Street. The bank's tech chief, Marco Argenti, stated that Devin will augment their human workforce, initially handling tasks like updating internal code, with plans to deploy hundreds or even thousands of these AI agents. This move signals a shift towards more powerful "agentic AI" that can execute complex, multi-step jobs independently. While this has the potential to dramatically boost productivity, it also fuels concerns about future job cuts in the financial industry due to automation.</p>

          <p>Three Merseyside Police officers have been honored for their bravery in confronting knife attacker Axel Rudakubana during the tragic incident in Southport last year. Sgt Gregory Gillespie, PC Luke Holden, and PCSO Timothy Parry were the first to arrive at the scene where Rudakubana murdered three young girls and injured ten others. Armed with a baton and a Taser, the officers entered the building and approached the armed attacker, successfully disarming and arresting him. The officers were recognized at the Police Federation's 2025 bravery awards for their decisive actions in the face of extreme danger.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has issued a nationwide injunction, blocking President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. The ruling prevents the order from taking effect anywhere in the United States. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's efforts to reinterpret the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which has long been understood to grant citizenship to nearly all individuals born on U.S. soil. The block ensures that the current interpretation of birthright citizenship remains the law of the land while further legal challenges proceed through the courts.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have identified a mysterious interstellar object, named 3I/Atlas, that could be the oldest comet ever observed. According to a team at the University of Oxford, the object may be three billion years older than our own solar system, originating from the Milky Way's "thick disk" of ancient stars. This is only the third time an object from beyond our solar system has been detected. Scientists are excited by the prospect of studying this seven-billion-year-old visitor, which is expected to become visible with amateur telescopes later this year as it approaches the Sun and develops a glowing tail.</p>

          <p>Representative Robert Garcia, a sophomore congressman from California, has been chosen as the new top Democrat on the influential House Oversight Committee. Known for his combative style, the 47-year-old says he was elected to be a "fighter" and plans to aggressively confront President Trump and House Republicans. Garcia, the first openly gay immigrant in Congress, succeeds the late Gerry Connolly and takes on the role at a time when Democrats are eager for more direct confrontation. He plans to use his position as a "bully pulpit" to challenge GOP narratives and investigate figures like Stephen Miller and Elon Musk.</p>
