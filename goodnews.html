          <p>Cameron Norrie gave Great Britain a 1-0 lead over Poland in their Davis Cup World Group 1 tennis tie. The world number 34 faced a tough challenge from Poland's Tomasz Berkieta, ranked 545th, but ultimately prevailed with a 7-6 (11-9) 6-4 victory in Gdynia. Following an injury to another player, 23-year-old Arthur Fery is set to make his Davis Cup debut in the second singles match. A win in the overall tie would secure Great Britain a spot in next February's first round.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article revisits the 1985 congressional hearing on adding warning labels to music with explicit content, a movement spearheaded by the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), co-founded by Tipper Gore. The hearing famously pitted politicians and concerned parents against musicians like Dee Snider of Twisted Sister, Frank Zappa, and John Denver, who argued against censorship. The PMRC's efforts ultimately led to a deal with the recording industry to voluntarily add the now-iconic "Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics" sticker. The labels, still in use today, became a cultural flashpoint, with some artists claiming they actually boosted sales.</p>

          <p>Ahead of their company Gemini's IPO, co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss made a bold prediction that Bitcoin's value could reach $1 million per coin within the next ten years. They argue that the cryptocurrency is still in its early stages, framing it as "gold 2.0" and a significant disruptor to traditional stores of value. This optimistic forecast suggests there is still substantial room for growth from its current price, reflecting their deep confidence in the long-term potential of the digital asset. Gemini's IPO was priced at $28 per share, valuing the company at $3.3 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A South African court has rejected an attempt by Thabo Bester, a convicted murderer and sexual predator, to block the release of a Netflix documentary about his crimes. Bester, who escaped from prison in 2022 by faking his own death in a fire, was arrested in Tanzania a year later. He and his partner argued the documentary, titled "Beauty and the Bester," would violate their rights to a fair trial. The judge dismissed the urgent application, stating the case is already in the public domain and they can pursue a defamation lawsuit after it airs.</p>

          <p>After boasting the best offense in baseball during the first half of the season, the Los Angeles Dodgers have experienced a severe slump, ranking near the bottom of the league in scoring since early July. The decline is attributed to a combination of injuries to key players and a team-wide shift away from fundamental, situational hitting. With players like Max Muncy returning to health, the team is now making a deliberate effort to refocus on "team at-bats" and competitive plate appearances. The goal is to rectify these issues before the postseason begins.</p>

          <p>The UK's House of Lords has begun a contentious two-day debate on a bill that would legalize assisted dying for terminally ill adults in England and Wales. The legislation, introduced by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, faces strong opposition from figures like former Prime Minister Theresa May, who framed it as an "assisted suicide bill" with inadequate safeguards. Proponents shared emotional personal stories, arguing the current law is cruel and denies individuals the right to choose a peaceful death. The debate highlights the deep moral, ethical, and personal divisions surrounding the issue.</p>

          <p>Nepal has appointed its first female leader, former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki, as interim prime minister. Her appointment follows days of deadly mass protests that led to the resignation of the previous government.

Karki, who is widely respected, will lead a government tasked with dissolving parliament and holding general elections within six months, aiming to restore stability to the nation.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has avoided a potentially massive antitrust fine from the European Union by agreeing to unbundle its Teams communication platform from its Office and Microsoft 365 software suites. The European Commission accepted the company's legally binding commitments, which will be in place for at least seven years. The investigation was launched in 2023 after a complaint from rival Slack, owned by Salesforce, which alleged Microsoft's bundling practices were anti-competitive. The agreement requires Microsoft to offer versions of its software without Teams at a reduced price and improve interoperability with competing products.</p>

          <p>On the 48th anniversary of his death, South African prosecutors announced they are reopening the inquest into the death of anti-apartheid leader Steve Biko. Biko died in police custody at age 30 from a brain hemorrhage, which his family has long maintained was the result of torture, despite initial police claims of a hunger strike. No one has ever been held accountable, and this landmark decision follows decades of pressure from Biko's family and a recent presidential inquiry into unprosecuted apartheid-era crimes. The move represents a significant step toward historical justice and accountability.</p>

          <p>As rising inflation strains the budgets of retirees on fixed incomes, many are looking for ways to access their substantial home equity without taking on new monthly debt. This article explores several financial solutions designed for this purpose, such as reverse mortgages, which are repaid only when the home is sold. Other options include home equity sharing agreements, where a company provides cash in exchange for a share of the home's future appreciation. These products can provide crucial liquidity for seniors, but it is important to carefully consider the long-term costs and implications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical rivals Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are preparing to compete in the next phase of the weight-loss drug market with the expected launch of daily oral medications next year. These pills could significantly expand access to GLP-1 drugs, which are currently dominated by weekly injections like Wegovy and Zepbound. While Lilly's Zepbound injection offers higher efficacy, the company is confident its pill, orforglipron, will compete well due to easier manufacturing and fewer usage restrictions. The development sets the stage for a major battle over a market estimated to reach $80 billion by 2030.</p>
