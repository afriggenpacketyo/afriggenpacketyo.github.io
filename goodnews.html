        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Travis Hunter, the Jaguars' No. 2 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, has secured a fully guaranteed four-year, $46.65 million rookie deal. The Jaguars uniquely announced the deal twice, once listing Hunter as a defensive back and again as a wide receiver, confirming their intent to utilize his talents on both sides of the ball. Hunter's contract includes a $30.57 million signing bonus paid entirely upfront, a first for a non-quarterback drafted outside the top spot. The Jaguars, led by new GM James Gladstone, are showing their confidence in Hunter as a potentially franchise-altering player, aiming to return to the playoffs after missing out for the past two seasons.</p>

          <p>A university teaching assistant grapples with the ethical implications of students using AI to generate writing, questioning the value of enforcing institutional rules that students don't take seriously. The real value of a humanities education lies in the formation of human persons, not merely the creation of products. The rise of AI challenges the utilitarian vision for the humanities, removing cognitive friction from education. The author suggests adding friction back in by prompting students to reflect on how AI changes their thinking and learning process, emphasizing the cultivation of practical wisdom in navigating emerging technologies.</p>
