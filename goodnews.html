          <p>Sir Terry Farrell, a prominent British architect celebrated for his exuberant post-modernist designs, has passed away at the age of 87. His architecture practice, Farrells, announced his death, acknowledging his significant influence on urbanism and his reputation as a "maverick." His most famous commissions include London's iconic MI6 headquarters, prominently featured in James Bond films, and the distinctive TV-am building, known for its playful giant breakfast eggcups on the roof. Farrell's career saw him intentionally diverge from minimalist trends, embracing color and witty historical references, while also championing innovation and environmental awareness in building design.</p>

Fans appreciate his stoic pessimism and constant desire for peace amidst absurd adventures, with his backstory revealing a failed mascot career and unrequited love for a baguette.

          <p>With gold prices surging to an all-time high of $3,800 per ounce, experts are now offering detailed advice on how investors can strategically sell their gold for a profit. This price uptick is largely attributed to gold's established role as a safe haven and a hedge against ongoing economic uncertainty, persistent inflation, and rising geopolitical tensions. Investors are advised to carefully evaluate the current market timing, thoroughly review their specific gold investments—whether physical bullion, ETFs, or stocks—compare various selling options, and diligently research potential tax implications. While securing profits now is appealing, some analysts suggest gold's price may still have room to run. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Chinese military journal, Ordnance Industry Science Technology, has provided extensive details on the Liaoyuan-1 (LY-1) shipborne laser weapon, which was prominently showcased at the country’s recent Victory Day parade in Beijing. The article asserts that the LY-1, specifically designed for close-range interception of incoming missiles and drones as a crucial "last line of defence," significantly surpasses American counterparts like the Helios in terms of overall robustness and advanced subsystems. It highlights the LY-1's notably larger lens aperture, nearly twice the diameter of the Helios', and its more advanced auxiliary equipment and sensors. This development signals China's substantial advancements in military laser technology, potentially enhancing its naval air-defence capabilities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has revealed a comprehensive 21-point plan aimed at achieving a resolution to the war in Gaza, which controversially includes a pathway to a Palestinian state, a concept consistently and vehemently opposed by Israel. The plan demands the release of the 20 remaining living hostages in Gaza in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, the removal and disarmament of Hamas, and significant reforms to the Palestinian Authority. It also outlines a substantial economic plan for Gaza, security guarantees enforced by the US and regional powers, and a halt to Israeli operations and occupation. The proposal comes amidst growing international recognition of a Palestinian state and ahead of Trump's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-29 09:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A stress physiologist, drawing from 20 years of research involving over 750 Americans, argues that conventional stress management advice often overlooks a crucial element: channeling stress energy outward to help others. This approach, termed "stress springboarding," leverages the body's release of oxytocin, often called the "cuddle hormone," which inherently motivates connection and seeking support, suggesting stress is fundamentally a social experience. Instead of retreating inward, the article recommends using stress as fuel for meaningful action, such as assisting colleagues, supporting friends, or volunteering for community causes. Brain imaging studies support this, showing that helping others activates reward centers and reduces activity in stress-related regions, leading to more effective long-term stress handling.</p>
