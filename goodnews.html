          <p>Germany's Foreign Minister, Johann Wadephul, made an unannounced visit to Kyiv to underscore his country's unwavering support for Ukraine in its ongoing defense against Russia's invasion. Wadephul pledged continued assistance, including modern air defense systems and other weaponry, as well as humanitarian and economic aid. The visit comes at a critical time as European allies work to compensate for a potential reduction in support from the United States. Germany currently stands as Ukraine's second-largest financial and military backer.</p>

          <p>Germany is actively strengthening its security ties with Israel, as demonstrated by a recent visit from Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt. During the visit, Dobrindt offered unqualified support for Israel's actions regarding Iran's nuclear program and announced plans to establish a joint cyber-research center. This move to deepen intelligence and security collaboration comes as Germany looks to draw upon Israel's defense expertise to bolster its own capabilities in the face of growing global threats. The cooperation underscores the close alliance between the two nations.</p>

          <p>After five years in a Belarusian prison, opposition figure and blogger Sergei Tikhanovsky has been released and has spoken out about his ordeal. He described being held in solitary confinement for most of his sentence, losing significant weight but maintaining his spirit to fight for democracy. His release was part of a deal following a rare visit by a senior U.S. delegation to authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko. Tikhanovsky's wife, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, became the face of the opposition after running for president in his place in 2020.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that he has a group of "very wealthy people" prepared to purchase the U.S. operations of the social media platform TikTok. This development comes as the deadline approaches for its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest from the app under a 2024 U.S. law aimed at addressing national security concerns. Trump suggested that any deal would likely need approval from Beijing, but expressed optimism that Chinese President Xi Jinping would agree to it. The new deadline for divestiture is September 17.</p>

          <p>Beijing has announced a partial lifting of its ban on Japanese seafood, which was imposed in 2023 following the release of treated water from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a notable side effect has emerged: they are more likely to induce motion sickness in passengers. Researchers have found that the unique characteristics of EVs, particularly their rapid acceleration and regenerative braking systems, are to blame. The low-frequency deceleration caused by regenerative braking, which recharges the battery, is a key factor in provoking feelings of queasiness. This has prompted studies into engineering solutions to create a more comfortable and less nauseating ride for EV passengers.</p>
