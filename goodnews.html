        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent interview, former President Donald Trump indicated he might consider an executive action to rename the sport of soccer to football in the United States. Speaking with DAZN TV, Trump acknowledged the global preference for the term "football" and suggested the change could be made easily. The conversation occurred as he attended the FIFA Club World Cup final, where he appeared on stage with the winning team, Chelsea. This comes as the U.S. prepares to co-host the 2026 World Cup, increasing the sport's domestic profile.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mike Waltz, President Trump's nominee for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The hearing addressed the administration's foreign policy on China and Israel, with Waltz committing to veto "one-sided anti-Israel resolutions." He also faced questions regarding his involvement in a Signal group chat where sensitive, though reportedly unclassified, details of a military operation were discussed. While some Democratic senators criticized his handling of the incident, Waltz defended the use of the app and is considered likely to be confirmed in the Republican-controlled Senate.</p>

          <p>An ocean exploration team has discovered the wreck of the Imperial Japanese Navy destroyer Teruzuki, which was sunk by U.S. torpedoes in December 1942. The warship was found over 2,600 feet below the surface in the Iron Bottom Sound near the Solomon Islands, a site of pivotal naval battles. The remotely operated vehicle found the ship's hull severed, but remarkably, it was still armed with unused depth charges, disproving theories that its own munitions caused the sinking. The discovery provides the first visual record of the Teruzuki, as no historical images of the vessel were known to exist.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced on social media that he has secured a "great deal, for everybody" with Indonesia, though he did not provide specific details. The announcement follows a threat made a week prior to impose a 32% tariff on the Southeast Asian nation's exports to the U.S. Trump stated the deal was reached after direct discussions with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and promised that more information would be released soon. This follows a similar pattern to a recent announcement of a deal with Vietnam, where details were also initially sparse.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer commented on recent strategic successes by Nvidia and Apple, highlighting their engagement with the Trump administration. He praised Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang for persuading the government to allow the resumption of some AI chip exports to China, framing it as a way to make China dependent on American technology. Cramer also lauded Apple's $500 million deal with MP Materials for rare earth magnets as a positive step in fulfilling its commitment to U.S. investment. He suggested that such actions, demonstrating tangible investment with "shovels to the ground," are crucial for companies to maintain good standing with the government. (not investment advice)</p>
