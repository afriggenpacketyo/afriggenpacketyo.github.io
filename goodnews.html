          <p>A new book explores the significant impact of sibling relationships on individual lives, examining factors such as birth order and achievements. Studies suggest that eldest children may perform better on cognitive tests due to increased parental attention early in life. Sibling influence can be powerful, with individuals often driven to pursue different paths based on their siblings' choices. While these dynamics can create a sense of competition or comparison, they also offer opportunities for self-reflection and mutual understanding.</p>

          <p>A dog that went missing for 36 days has returned home after a 100-mile trip, including a swim to Brownsea Island. Amber, a retriever cross rescued from Qatar, escaped from her foster family in the New Forest. She was spotted regularly but entered a "wild mindset" until her rescue by two men in a boat. Amber's foster family is relieved and amazed by her survival and extensive journey.</p>
