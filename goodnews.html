          <p>Bernie Sanders argues that the Democratic party lacks a compelling message for working-class Americans, criticizing their reluctance to challenge the billionaire class and advocate for policies like universal healthcare and free college tuition. He believes Trumpism appeals to working-class people because it acknowledges the system's failures, even though Trump's solutions are inadequate. Sanders emphasizes the need for Democrats to address economic inequality and offer concrete solutions to improve the lives of ordinary Americans. He suggests that the Democrats' focus on simply opposing Trump is insufficient to win over working-class voters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Tiandu-1 satellite has entered a 3:1 resonant orbit synchronized with Earth and moon motion, which China claims is a first for any spacecraft. However, U.S. and Canadian experts challenge this, citing NASA's Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) probe which entered a similar orbit in 2011. The 3:1 resonant orbit is considered a breakthrough for lunar infrastructure, potentially enabling a BeiDou-like guidance system for interplanetary missions. The debate centers on whether Tiandu-1's achievement is truly unique given IBEX's prior accomplishment.</p>

          <p>The Okhotsk Tokkari Center, Japan's only seal sanctuary, rescues and rehabilitates injured seals before releasing them back into the wild. To minimize emotional attachment and heartbreak, staff avoid naming or direct contact with the seals.

The center's work has evolved from addressing seal overpopulation to focusing on rescuing malnourished pups due to habitat loss from global warming.</p>
