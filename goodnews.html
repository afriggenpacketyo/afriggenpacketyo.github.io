Nigel Farage, Reform leader, stated that Yusuf regretted his decision and will now take on a more public role, appearing more frequently in the media. Yusuf also expressed his continued belief in Nigel Farage's leadership and the party's goals, despite previously criticizing a party member's stance on banning the burka.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has reached an agreement with City Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson to restore police officer hiring, reversing cuts made by the council last month. The agreement ensures that council leadership will identify funds for an additional 240 recruits within 90 days, costing $13.3 million for the coming year and about $60 million in 2026-27. Bass thanked the council for coming together on the deal, emphasizing that the budget invests in emergency response, homeless services, street repairs, parks, libraries, and other programs. Restoring the police recruits would bring the number of officers to more than 8,600, addressing concerns about slowing down recruitment at the LAPD.</p>

          <p>Dave Ramsey warns that nearly 50% of Americans are making a significant mistake by not saving adequately for retirement, citing his company's "Today's Retirement Crisis" study. The study reveals that 42% of Americans are not currently saving for the future, while only a small fraction save the recommended 15% or more of their income. With Social Security benefits typically replacing just 40% of pre-retirement income, Ramsey emphasizes the importance of creating a savings benchmark and increasing monthly savings. He suggests setting a savings rate significantly higher, recommending 15% of gross income, assuming an emergency fund is already in place and debts are paid off (not investment advice).</p>
