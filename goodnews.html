        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan is actively broadening its defense collaborations with nations like the United Kingdom and Australia, a move analysts attribute to perceived inconsistencies in U.S. policy and growing concerns over China's military posture. Recent multinational exercises, such as British and U.S. F-35B jets operating from the Japanese carrier JS Kaga, underscore this trend toward deeper tactical integration with a wider array of partners. These joint military activities in the Indo-Pacific are seen as a strategic effort by Japan to build a more robust and diversified security network. This enhances its defensive capabilities in a complex geopolitical environment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the wake of major fires in Los Angeles, residents are taking soil cleanup into their own hands due to concerns about contamination from burned structures. With government assistance limited and official soil testing refused by disaster agencies, community workshops on DIY soil detoxification are gaining popularity. These methods use natural tools like specific plants, biochar, and fungi to trap or break down heavy metals and other toxins like lead. This grassroots movement provides residents with a sense of empowerment and an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional topsoil removal, addressing a problem exacerbated by the area's older housing stock.</p>

He joins a Fenerbahce team managed by Jose Mourinho, which has been actively signing players from the Premier League and other European leagues.

          <p>After a prolonged legal battle, a street in central Berlin with a name considered racist will be officially renamed in honor of Anton Wilhelm Amo. The original name, Mohrenstrasse or "Moor Street," has been criticized for decades by civil society groups for its derogatory historical connotations linked to slavery. The renaming, which was initially approved in 2020 but delayed by lawsuits from residents, will now proceed. The new name honors Amo, an 18th-century scholar from Ghana who became the first Africa-born person to receive a doctorate from a European university.</p>

          <p>The 27th season of "South Park" is being praised for its effective and biting satire of the second Trump administration, a feat many other comedy shows have struggled with. The show avoids simple impersonations, instead using its unique, often crude, style to caricature figures like Donald Trump, JD Vance, and Kristi Noem in a way that feels both mean and gratifying. By using their established comedic language, such as depicting Trump with the same animation and voice as Saddam Hussein from their 1999 movie, creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have found a way to land punches that feel fresh and cathartic.</p>

          <h2>Survey Reveals American Perceptions on Ideal Ages for Financial Milestones</h2>

          <p>A recent survey by Empower reveals Americans' target ages for major financial goals, such as buying a first home at 30 and earning a six-figure income by 35. However, financial experts note that these timelines are often more aspirational than realistic in the current economic climate. For example, the average age of a first-time homebuyer is now closer to 40. The findings also highlight a sense of regret among many respondents, with nearly half wishing they had started saving for retirement earlier than the perceived ideal age of 27.</p>

          <p>Shares for United Parcel Service (UPS) have fallen approximately 60% from their pandemic-era highs, returning to pre-pandemic levels. The decline is attributed to the normalization of shipping demand and investor concerns over the costs associated with the company's ongoing operational overhaul. Despite a recent drop in revenue, the article highlights positive signs such as increased revenue per piece and stable operating margins, suggesting the company's strategy to focus on more profitable business is making progress. The analysis presents the current situation as a potential turnaround story for long-term investors (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece argues that Japan should pursue cooperation rather than competition with China on international infrastructure projects to avoid wasted resources and conflicting standards. Japan recently announced a major initiative to develop a logistics network across Africa and the Indian Ocean, which could overlap with China's Belt and Road Initiative. The article suggests that instead of nationally sponsored rivalries, both countries should leverage multilateral development banks to finance and manage these large-scale projects. This collaborative approach could lead to more efficient and compatible development across Asia and beyond.</p>

          <p>Advisors to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are considering new regulations to curb food waste, specifically targeting the large all-you-can-eat buffets popular in the country's tourist hotels. A presidential council is drafting proposals after a report found that 8.7 million tons of food are discarded annually in Turkey, with a significant portion coming from the hospitality sector. Proposed changes include moving toward à la carte dining and allowing guests more flexibility in breakfast packages to reduce the amount of uneaten food. The move has sparked debate, with some tour operators questioning the motives and feasibility of such regulations.</p>

Guo advocates for a relentless work ethic, stating that new founders must work 90-hour weeks to get their companies off the ground and that China's "996" work culture still allows for a work-life balance. Her perspective embodies a Silicon Valley mantra of constant productivity, though it contrasts with other founders who argue such an approach is outdated and leads to burnout rather than smart work.</p>

          <p>Paige Louise Williams, founder of the beauty brand P.Louise, has built a global empire with a projected revenue of £138 million this year, starting from a £20,000 loan from her grandmother. The 32-year-old entrepreneur from Greater Manchester initially struggled after opening her first salon but found success by offering online makeup classes and developing her own products. The brand's growth was significantly accelerated by its popularity on TikTok Shop, where it broke UK sales records. From a small salon, the business has expanded into a major operation with a large warehouse, store, and cafe.</p>
