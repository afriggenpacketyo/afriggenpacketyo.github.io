          <p>Oprah Winfrey has announced Wally Lamb's "The River Is Waiting" as her newest book club selection, marking the third time she has chosen one of Lamb's novels. The book tells the story of Corby Ledbetter, a stay-at-home dad who causes a tragedy and journeys through prison, where he encounters both brutality and kindness. Winfrey was surprised that the book focused on a male character, given Lamb's 20 years of work with women in prison. Lamb hopes readers will find an important message in the book, which explores themes of guilt, redemption, and forgiveness.</p>

          <h2>Op-Ed Argues Wall Street Needs Specialized AI Systems, Not Big Tech Solutions</h2>

          <p>An op-ed argues that the financial world requires specialized AI systems tailored to its unique regulations, jargon, and workflows, rather than relying on general-purpose AI from tech giants. The author contends that generalized large language models (LLMs) are insufficient for the complexities of wealth management, asset management, and insurance. The piece advocates for strategic partnerships between tech giants and finance experts, urging traditional firms to avoid a go-it-alone approach. The author suggests that financial institutions should focus on their unique strengths and allow fintechs to handle complementary tasks.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2bn to the Sizewell C nuclear power plant project, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer stating it will create 10,000 jobs and provide energy security. However, the project is expected to take at least 10 years to complete, with power generation beginning in the mid-2030s. While the government insists nuclear power can cut household energy bills, critics have raised concerns about the project's cost and environmental impact. The government hopes the investment will attract private funding, but negotiations with private investors are reportedly incomplete, leading to uncertainty about the project's final cost.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Members of Parliament are scheduled to vote on decriminalizing abortion in England and Wales, a move that would allow women to terminate pregnancies without facing prosecution. Currently, abortion is illegal under the Offences Against the Person Act of 1861, but is permitted under certain conditions outlined in the 1967 Abortion Act. The proposed amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill aims to decriminalize abortion at any stage, provided it's related to the woman's own pregnancy. The framework for accessing abortion would remain the same, requiring two doctors' approval for procedures in healthcare settings.</p>

          <h2>Comparing Debt Forgiveness and Debt Consolidation for Savings</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 11:30:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article compares debt forgiveness and debt consolidation as options for managing high credit card debt. Debt consolidation combines multiple debts into one loan, ideally at a lower interest rate, while debt forgiveness involves negotiating with creditors to accept less than the full amount owed. Debt forgiveness can lead to greater upfront savings but damages credit, while debt consolidation can improve credit over time. The best option depends on individual circumstances, with debt consolidation being preferable for those who can manage monthly payments and debt forgiveness being a last resort for those facing bankruptcy.
