          <p>Hundreds of thousands gathered in Tel Aviv for a rally ahead of an expected hostage release by Hamas, as part of a new ceasefire deal. U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff addressed the crowd, praising Donald Trump for his role in brokering the agreement, though some attendees expressed anger toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The deal stipulates Hamas must release all 48 remaining hostages, with 20 believed to be alive, by Monday, while in Gaza, displaced Palestinians have begun returning to northern regions.</p>

The fight marked a significant moment for Allen, who headlined the venue for the first time after returning from a five-year retirement, and he vowed after the match that he is "not finished" with his career.</p>

Beutner, who has a diverse background in finance, philanthropy, and city government, would be the most significant challenger to Bass, who has faced criticism over the city's budget and crisis response.</p>

The Trump administration had sought to deploy the troops to address ongoing protests at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. However, the court did grant the administration's request to keep the federalized troops under federal control for the time being, pending further legal review.</p>

          <p>As China prepares its 15th five-year plan, analysts are examining how its approach to infrastructure investment might evolve to meet new economic demands. The country's previous development was heavily fueled by massive public works projects, such as the 4-trillion-yuan stimulus package after the 2008 financial crisis. While this model spurred immense growth, it also created significant local government debt, a persistent issue that now weighs on the economy, suggesting future infrastructure spending may become more technologically driven.

The summit, led by U.S. President Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, marks a significant diplomatic effort to end the two-year conflict. Starmer is expected to pay tribute to Trump's role in brokering the deal, which includes the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and to offer the UK's support for subsequent phases of the truce.</p>

The majority of the funds, $128 million, will go to the Fusion Innovative Research Engine (FIRE) Collaboratives to create an "innovation ecosystem" for the technology. While fusion power promises a source of nearly limitless clean energy, experts note the funding is modest given the immense technical challenges, and it may still be decades before the technology becomes a practical reality.</p>
