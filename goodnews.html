          <p>A recent poll from the University of California Irvine suggests that former Vice President Kamala Harris would be the favored candidate in the 2026 California gubernatorial race, should she decide to run. The survey shows Harris with 41% support against a generic Republican opponent and leading a field of announced candidates with 24%, despite a large number of undecided voters. Her high name recognition is a significant advantage, with only 5% of Californians unfamiliar with her, a stark contrast to other contenders. Harris is expected to announce her decision by the end of the summer.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a long-term plan to "fundamentally rewire" the National Health Service in England by moving more care out of hospitals and into local communities. The strategy involves creating a network of approximately 200 new neighborhood health centers staffed by a mix of healthcare professionals. These hubs aim to handle a majority of outpatient services, such as scans and follow-up appointments, by 2035. While the government says the plan will reduce hospital waiting lists, nursing and medical unions have raised concerns about staffing and funding for the new services.</p>

          <p>The United States has finalized a new trade agreement with Vietnam that will impose a 20% tariff on goods imported from the country, President Trump announced. This rate is lower than the 46% levy that was previously threatened. The deal also includes a much steeper 40% tariff on products that are made in other countries and then routed through Vietnam in a process known as "trans-shipping." In exchange, the agreement reportedly grants the U.S. zero-tariff access to sell American products in Vietnamese markets, a key goal of the administration's trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>
