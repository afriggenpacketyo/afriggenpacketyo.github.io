          <p>HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. argues in a Fox News opinion piece that Americans are unfairly subsidizing drug prices for other wealthy nations and that President Trump's executive order aims to rectify this imbalance. He highlights the vast price differences between medications in the US and other countries, noting that American pharmaceutical companies derive a significant portion of their profits from the US market. Kennedy asserts that the administration has the authority to ensure fair pricing and is prepared to take decisive action to protect American patients and encourage innovation. He also emphasizes the importance of prevention through healthier lifestyles to reduce medication dependence.</p>

          <p>Vox reports on a unanimous Supreme Court decision in Barnes v. Felix, which rebukes the Fifth Circuit's approach to police violence cases. The Court found that the Fifth Circuit improperly limited its inquiry to the moment of the threat, rather than considering the totality of the circumstances. Justice Kagan's opinion emphasizes that a wider lens is necessary to determine whether the use of force was justified. The article explains that the problem with the Fifth Circuit's rule wasn't that it was too pro-police, it was that it simply did not make sense.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Times columnist argues that the Lakers should prioritize drafting older, more experienced players in the NBA draft, particularly those who have navigated the challenges of college life and NIL deals. The piece contends that the league's economic shifts have led to an overemphasis on "high ceiling" players, neglecting the value of maturity and resilience. The columnist suggests that the Lakers should seek a 24-year-old college graduate with a strong work ethic and financial responsibility, rather than focusing solely on raw talent.
