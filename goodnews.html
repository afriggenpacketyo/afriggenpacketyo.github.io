          <p>A Colorado mother and influencer, Kyana Miner, is offering advice on how families can save money on skiing and snowboarding trips. She recommends taking advantage of programs like the Epic SchoolKids Colorado Pack and the Colorado Ski Country USA pass, which offer free or significantly reduced access for children. Miner also suggests booking packages, skiing on weekdays, visiting smaller resorts, and renting gear for children until they are teenagers to make the winter sport more financially accessible. Planning and booking these passes and trips early in the season is crucial for securing the best prices.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to a "framework" deal concerning the ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The announcement came during trade talks in Madrid, with the details to be finalized by President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. This development comes ahead of a looming deadline for TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to sell its American division or face a nationwide ban due to national security concerns. While China confirmed the framework, it stated that no deal would be made at the expense of Chinese companies' interests.</p>

          <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has become the fourth company to achieve a market capitalization of $3 trillion, joining an exclusive club with Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. The company's stock surged over 4% on Monday, reaching a record high following a recent antitrust ruling that imposed lighter-than-feared penalties. Despite facing increased competition from AI challengers and intense regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe, Alphabet's shares have risen more than 30% this year. The milestone arrives approximately 20 years after Google's initial public offering and a decade after the formation of the Alphabet holding company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>President Trump Proposes Shifting Corporate Earnings Reports from Quarterly to Semiannual</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 12:00:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that publicly traded companies should move from reporting earnings every quarter to a semiannual schedule, pending approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In a social media post, Trump argued the change would save money and allow corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term results. The idea echoes a similar push from his first term and aligns with arguments made by figures like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, who have criticized the unhealthy focus on quarterly guidance. Current regulations mandate quarterly reports, a standard in place since 1970. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores the Most Cost-Effective Forms of Energy Production</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 11:52:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News analysis examining the cheapest forms of energy concludes that renewables are the most cost-competitive, even before accounting for government subsidies. Using the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) metric from investment bank Lazard, onshore wind and utility-scale solar are shown to be significantly cheaper to produce per megawatt-hour than coal, natural gas, or nuclear power. While renewables have high initial capital costs, their operational expenses are very low. The report also considers the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act, which further lowers renewable costs, and new Trump administration policies that expand tax breaks for fossil fuels and impose tariffs on imported components.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut its benchmark interest rate this week, financial experts are advising consumers on how to prepare their finances. Key recommendations include aggressively paying down high-interest debt like credit cards, as a small rate cut will not significantly reduce the burden of existing high APRs. Savers are encouraged to lock in high yields now with CDs or high-yield savings accounts before rates fall. The lower rate environment could also benefit the housing market by making mortgages more affordable, and improving one's credit score remains the most effective way to secure the best loan terms.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 11:49:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On Monday, U.S. banks borrowed $1.5 billion from the Federal Reserve's Standing Repo Facility (SRF), a move indicating some temporary tightness in the financial system's liquidity. The borrowing coincided with the deadline for quarterly corporate tax payments and a large settlement of Treasury securities, which increased the demand for cash. The SRF acts as a backstop to prevent disruptive funding squeezes by allowing banks to exchange eligible collateral, like Treasuries, for overnight cash. Analysts suggest the pressure is incremental and typical for such payment deadlines, rather than a sign of a broader systemic issue. (not investment advice)</p>

This purchase comes as Musk has sought greater control of the company, demanding a 25% stake to focus on its future in AI and robotics. The investment follows a period of struggling sales for Tesla amid increased competition and the end of some U.S. tax breaks for electric vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>
