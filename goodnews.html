          <p>Harvard University has discovered that a document in its archives, previously thought to be an unofficial copy, is actually an original copy of King Edward I‚Äôs reaffirmation of the Magna Carta. The discovery coincides with ongoing legal battles between Harvard and the Trump administration, which has frozen federal grants to the university. The article discusses the Magna Carta's historical significance as a symbol of limited government and the importance of checks and balances, suggesting it serves as a reminder of the need to push back against potential autocracy.</p>
