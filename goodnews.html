          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Trump expressed a new belief that Ukraine is capable of winning back all its territory from Russia. This marks a significant shift from his previous calls for Ukraine to concede land to end the conflict, a stance he had reiterated as recently as last month. In a social media post, Trump stated that the ongoing war is making Russia look like a "paper tiger" and that its economic troubles present an opportune moment for Ukraine to act with European support.</p>

          <p>Consumers are rushing to purchase electric vehicles to take advantage of federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used EVs before they expire at the end of September. The credits, part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, are being phased out by new legislation, leading to a record surge in EV sales in August. Dealerships are also offering significant incentives to clear inventory, with some lease rates dropping to as low as $40 per month, though concerns remain about a potential sales drop-off in October once the credits are gone.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's warnings against using acetaminophen during pregnancy due to a purported link to autism, many parents are seeking clarity on the actual scientific evidence. While some studies have shown a correlation, larger and more controlled research, such as a 2024 study of two million Swedish children, found no causal link when accounting for genetic and environmental factors. Medical groups emphasize that untreated fever or pain during pregnancy poses known risks to both mother and child, and acetaminophen remains one of the few safe options available.</p>

          <p>Recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve have made home equity loans a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners. For a $40,000 loan, current monthly payments are approximately $494 for a 10-year term and $389 for a 15-year term, slightly lower than costs earlier in the year. The article also compares these fixed-rate loans to Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), which currently offer slightly lower initial payments but come with variable rates that could increase over time.

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva delivered a sharp rebuke of U.S. policies at the United Nations, criticizing tariffs and promoting closer ties with China. Despite the critical tone of the speech, U.S. President Donald Trump extended an unexpected olive branch moments later, proposing a meeting with Lula for the following week. Trump told reporters that he and the Brazilian leader had "excellent chemistry" during a brief encounter, suggesting a potential opening for dialogue despite the current tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>A tribute concert at the Hollywood Bowl is set to honor the late singer Minnie Riperton, 50 years after her iconic song "Lovin' You" topped the charts. The event, featuring artists like Stevie Wonder and George Benson, highlights her enduring influence on generations of musicians, from Prince to SZA. Despite her five-octave vocal range and unique sound, Riperton's career was cut short when she died of breast cancer at age 31 in 1979. Friends and collaborators remember her for her musical mastery and ability to convey both sweetness and earthiness in her performances.</p>

          <p>A bull moose was successfully rescued after falling into a 9-foot-deep abandoned well on forested property in Pembroke, Maine. The landowner's family discovered the animal, with only its antlers visible, and alerted the state's wildlife department. In a five-hour operation, a biologist sedated the moose, and game wardens used straps and an excavator provided by the family to carefully lift it to safety. After the sedation wore off, the moose ran off into the woods, seemingly unharmed by the ordeal.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball will implement an automated ball-strike (ABS) system, often called "robot umpires," starting in the 2026 season. Human umpires will continue to call balls and strikes, but teams will now have the ability to challenge two calls per game using the ABS technology, with reviews displayed on stadium videoboards. The system, which has been tested in the minor leagues since 2019, is expected to increase accuracy and reduce on-field arguments and ejections, a majority of which currently stem from ball-strike disputes.</p>
