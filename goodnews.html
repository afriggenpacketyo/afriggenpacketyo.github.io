          <p>Meta is poised to unveil its Hypernova smart glasses, featuring a digital display in the right lens, and a companion wristband for gesture control at its upcoming Connect conference. Developed in partnership with EssilorLuxottica and expected to cost around $800, these glasses offer limited visual content like text messages and utilize sEMG sensor technology for user input. This launch marks Meta's first consumer-ready glasses with a display, signifying a deeper push into augmented reality and wearables. Despite past losses in its Reality Labs unit, the company is also seeking developers for experimental AI apps to generate excitement for the new device.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball is finalizing new media rights agreements with ESPN, NBC, and Netflix, aiming to diversify its broadcast partnerships and expand its reach. NBC is set to acquire Sunday night games and wild-card playoffs for approximately $200 million annually, while Netflix will secure the Home Run Derby rights for about $50 million. ESPN will receive a new $550 million package, including MLB TV and local team in-market games, despite previously seeking to reduce its payments. These three-year deals, expiring after the 2028 season, reflect MLB's strategy to enhance both monetary and viewership opportunities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ether (ETH) achieved its first new record high since 2021, surging after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated a potential adjustment to the restrictive policy stance, teasing September rate cuts. This dovish sentiment from Powell's Jackson Hole address triggered significant short liquidations in ETH, pushing its price higher as traders repositioned. Companies focused on accumulating ether saw their shares rebound, while the broader crypto market, led by ether, continues to attract institutional interest, particularly in stablecoins. Analysts suggest ether is becoming a major macro trade, bolstered by regulatory tailwinds and blockchain adoption. (not investment advice)</p>

The reported talks also occur amidst Google's legal challenges regarding its search monopoly, which could impact its lucrative deals with Apple.

          <p>House Democrats have introduced a new bill to establish legal thresholds for advanced chips, mandating congressional approval for their export to China, citing national security concerns. The proposed legislation specifies benchmarks for processing performance, memory speeds, and interconnect speeds that would trigger review. Representative Krishnamoorthi, a key proponent, argues the bill aims to prevent China from leveraging cutting-edge chips for surveillance, military modernization, and influence campaigns. While intended to curb China's access to critical technology, the measure faces an uphill battle to pass both the Republican-led House and Senate.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. government has acquired a 10% stake in Intel, a deal stemming from a meeting with CEO Lip Bu Tan following Trump's earlier call for Tan's resignation. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed the "historic agreement," stating it strengthens U.S. leadership in semiconductors and secures America's technological edge. The $8.9 billion investment, funded by existing CHIPS Act grants and Secure Enclave program funds, makes the government one of Intel's largest shareholders. This move reflects Trump's strategy to boost domestic chip production and reduce reliance on overseas manufacturing, leveraging government power in the tech sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to spearhead climate resilience efforts within the economically dynamic Greater Bay Area, an imperative strategy to safeguard regional prosperity against extreme weather events. As the region's integration deepens, shared climate risks necessitate a coordinated adaptation framework, potentially setting a global benchmark. Key initiatives could include establishing a cross-border early warning platform for shared forecasts and real-time alerts to critical sectors like transport and logistics. Adopting common infrastructure standards, with every dollar invested in resilience yielding up to four dollars in benefits, is also crucial for protecting vital regional assets.</p>

          <p>Emma Raducanu has expressed strong support for other Grand Slam tournaments to adopt a revamped mixed doubles format, similar to the one successfully implemented at the US Open this year. Raducanu, who enjoyed competing alongside Carlos Alcaraz, believes the innovative event, featuring a $1 million prize and a "fast four" format in the qualifying week, was a "huge success" that generated significant fan engagement and attention. This sentiment comes as Raducanu, feeling "in a much better place" after years of pressure, continues to rebuild her ranking and confidence, having performed consistently well this summer.</p>

          <p>Stocks surged after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at impending interest rate cuts, but his speech at Jackson Hole also tempered optimism by suggesting the "neutral" rate might be higher long-term. This implies that while cuts are likely, rates may not return to pre-pandemic lows, making borrowing more expensive for loans like mortgages. The Fed aims for a "Goldilocks balance" between unemployment and inflation, a balance complicated by Trump's tariffs, which Powell noted are pushing up prices. The labor market's "curious kind of balance" and slowing economic activity further contribute to the Fed's consideration of rate adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The North Carolina Supreme Court has issued favorable rulings allowing bars and their operators to continue lawsuits seeking compensation from the state for COVID-19 restrictions. These restrictions, implemented by then-Gov. Roy Cooper, shuttered bars while allowing restaurants to serve alcohol, which plaintiffs argued was unfair. The court's majority, consisting of five Republican justices, rejected state arguments for dismissal, affirming that the businesses could pursue claims that their constitutional right to earn a living was violated. This decision opens the door for trials and potential financial damages, despite the state's defense that the orders were based on public health data.</p>

          <p>Netflix has made an unusual move by releasing its viral animated film "KPop Demon Hunters" in over 1,750 U.S. and Canadian theaters for sing-along screenings this weekend. Despite industry estimates suggesting the film could top the box office with $16 million to $22 million, Netflix maintains its long-standing policy of not releasing box office figures. This theatrical run is seen as a marketing effort to capitalize on the film's streaming success, which is Netflix's most-watched original animated movie ever. The move highlights the complex, often "frenemy" relationship between the streamer and traditional exhibitors, who advocate for more collaboration.</p>
