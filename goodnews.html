          <p>SoftBank Group has announced its agreement to purchase the robotics unit of Swiss engineering firm ABB for $5.4 billion, a move aimed at strengthening its position in artificial intelligence. The acquisition aligns with founder Masayoshi Son's vision for "Physical AI," which integrates advanced robotics with super-intelligent systems. This deal cancels ABB's previous plans to spin off the robotics business, with ABB stating the sale provides immediate value to its shareholders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority has outlined a compensation scheme for millions affected by car finance mis-selling between 2007 and 2024. The plan suggests average payouts of around £700 per agreement, totaling a potential £8.2 billion from lenders over issues like undisclosed commissions and unfair contracts. While consumer advocates welcome the long-overdue redress, industry representatives argue the scale of compensation is excessive, setting the stage for further debate as the scheme aims to launch next year.

          <p>The price of gold has reached a historic high, trading at over $4,000 an ounce as investors seek safe-haven assets due to global economic and political instability. Factors fueling the rally include trade tensions, concerns over the ongoing US government shutdown, and a weakening US dollar. This surge represents gold's most significant rally since the 1970s, with record investments also flowing into gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this year. (not investment advice)</p>

The storm trapped the group in tents at an altitude over 16,000 feet, cutting off access until rescue teams could reach them. While some individuals suffered from hypothermia, all have now been brought to safety, and the scenic area has been temporarily closed to visitors.</p>

          <p>US immunologist Dr. Fred Ramsdell discovered he had won the Nobel Prize for medicine while on the final day of a three-week, off-grid hiking trip in Montana. With his phone on airplane mode, the Nobel committee was unable to reach him, and he only learned of the honor when his wife's phone began receiving hundreds of congratulatory text messages. The amusing incident adds to a history of laureates being difficult to contact, with Dr. Ramsdell finally reaching the committee 20 hours after their initial attempt.</p>

          <h2>New Technique May Allow Kidney Transplants Across Blood Types, Expanding Donor Pool</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 00:00:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have successfully demonstrated a new method that could significantly increase the availability of kidneys for transplant by converting an organ's blood type. The technique uses enzymes to change a donor kidney to the universal O-type, which could then be transplanted into any recipient, regardless of their own blood type. In an initial test, a converted kidney functioned for two days in a brain-dead recipient without signs of rejection, offering hope for reducing organ wait lists.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Jerry has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, marking the tenth named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. The system is currently far from land but is tracking west-northwest and is expected to strengthen into a hurricane within a day or two. While not forecast to make landfall, it is projected to pass near or north of the Leeward Islands, where a tropical storm watch is in effect, bringing the risk of heavy rain and life-threatening surf conditions.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla has intensified into a Category 2 storm in the Pacific Ocean, with its outer bands affecting Mexico's Baja California Sur peninsula. The storm is expected to move parallel to the coast while remaining offshore, bringing heavy rain and dangerous swells to the region. A tropical storm watch is in effect for parts of the peninsula, and moisture from the system may lead to a risk of flash flooding in the US Desert Southwest later in the week.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts has addressed the team's careful management of rookie relief pitcher Roki Sasaki's workload during the postseason. After a near-disastrous ninth inning in Game 2, Roberts confirmed Sasaki is now the primary option for save situations but noted the 23-year-old cannot be used in every game due to his inexperience in a relief role. The team is balancing the immediate need for their most dominant reliever with the long-term goal of keeping him healthy for a potential deep playoff run.</p>

          <p>Sky-watchers around the world have been enjoying the sight of a supermoon, which appears larger and brighter than a typical full moon.

Known as the Hunter's Moon, it is the first full moon of October, a name that historically relates to the period of hunting and preparation for winter in the northern hemisphere.</p>

          <p>Shares of Canadian minerals explorer Trilogy Metals surged over 200% after the White House announced it would take a 10% stake in the company through a $35.6 million investment. The partnership is part of a federal initiative to develop domestic sources of critical minerals like copper and cobalt in Alaska's Ambler mining district. This move reverses a Biden-era decision to block the controversial Ambler Road project, signaling a renewed federal focus on securing domestic supply chains for strategic resources.
