          <p>CBS News is mourning the loss of veteran White House correspondent Mark Knoller, a revered figure in Washington D.C. known for his meticulous record-keeping of presidential statistics. For over three decades at CBS, Knoller became the unofficial savant of the White House, with presidents and journalists alike relying on his detailed archives of presidential activities. Colleagues remember him not only for his unparalleled institutional knowledge but also for his generosity, warmth, and distinctive radio voice that chronicled eight presidential administrations.</p>

          <h2>Scientific Research Confirms 'Selective Hearing' as a Genuine Neurological Function</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 11:00:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent scientific findings reveal that "selective hearing" is not merely a behavioral choice but a real neurological process known as "auditory selective attention." This cognitive function allows the brain to filter and prioritize specific sounds, like a single voice in a noisy room, while ignoring competing background noise. The process involves the auditory and prefrontal cortices working together, but it can be strained by hearing loss, leading to listening fatigue and potential cognitive decline. Experts suggest that if this phenomenon significantly impacts daily life, it may be a sign of an underlying hearing issue requiring professional evaluation.</p>

          <p>Musician John Fogerty, at 80 years old, has released a new album titled "Legacy," featuring re-recordings of his iconic Creedence Clearwater Revival hits. The project comes after a long and painful legal battle where he lost control over his own song catalog following the band's breakup in 1972. Encouraged by his wife Julie and joined by his sons in his touring band, Fogerty has reclaimed his musical heritage, allowing him to perform and profit from timeless songs like "Proud Mary" once again.</p>

          <p>The UK has finalized its largest-ever warship export deal, a £10 billion agreement to supply Norway with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The Ministry of Defence states the deal will support thousands of UK jobs, particularly at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be built. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 British and Norwegian anti-submarine frigates designed to operate jointly in the North Atlantic.</p>

          <p>In a humorous commentary, comedian Jim Gaffigan confesses to his recurring summer problem: being a terrible, yet overly successful, gardener. He recounts his annual cycle of ambitious May planting, followed by an August realization that his "succession planting" strategy has resulted in a comical and overwhelming surplus of cucumbers. After exhausting all options, from fresh salads to pickling, he finds himself with a bounty he cannot manage, humorously offering his excess produce to anyone willing to take it.</p>

          <p>Neurosurgeon and author Dr. Sanjay Gupta's new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," delves into the complexities of chronic pain, highlighting recent discoveries that pinpoint the brain as a primary source. The article features the story of a musician who suffered from a debilitating pain syndrome for decades until a revolutionary clinical trial involving deep brain stimulation offered relief. This research demonstrates that pain circuitry is measurable and can be targeted, suggesting that future treatments may be able to predict and interrupt pain signals before they are consciously felt.</p>

          <p>An article by a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that fostering cooperation is more effective than demanding obedience. The key is creating emotional safety, where children feel respected and understood, which calms their nervous system and makes them more receptive. Phrases like "I believe you" and "Let's figure this out together" shift the dynamic from conflict to collaboration, validating a child's feelings while still maintaining boundaries and encouraging them to listen naturally.</p>

She contends that hunters are often deeply connected to conservation, as taxes on firearms and licenses directly fund wildlife management, and that the practice fosters a crucial understanding of ecological balance.</p>

This event, documented in a local newspaper at the time, is recognized as the seed of American surf culture, a sport that was traditionally reserved for Hawaiian royalty.</p>

The ban, which builds on previous legislation targeting items like plastic straws and bags, is aimed at reducing pollution and protecting marine life, though consumers will still have access to soy sauce in larger bottles and sachets.</p>
