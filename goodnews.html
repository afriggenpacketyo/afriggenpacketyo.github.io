          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 07:00:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from NYU Langone Health suggests that the presence of certain bacteria and fungi in the mouth could increase the risk of developing pancreatic cancer by more than threefold. The study analyzed saliva from over 122,000 adults over nine years, identifying 27 microbial species collectively associated with the deadly disease. Researchers believe that profiling the oral microbiome could serve as a non-invasive biomarker for early detection, as pancreatic cancer currently lacks effective screening methods. The findings underscore the connection between oral hygiene and overall systemic health.</p>

          <p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a Democrat who has won two elections in a state heavily favoring Donald Trump, is exploring a potential run for the presidency. In an interview, he outlined a strategy for Democrats to regain ground with rural and red-state voters by focusing on "common sense, common ground" issues and showing respect for differing viewpoints. Beshear criticized President Trump's handling of the government shutdown but emphasized his own ability to lower the political temperature and achieve bipartisan results, suggesting his success could be a model for the national party.</p>

          <h2>Recent Surge in Early-Onset Cancer Diagnoses May Be Partly an "Epidemic of Diagnosis," Study Suggests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine proposes that the alarming rise in cancer cases among adults under 50 might be partially a "diagnostic mirage." Researchers found that while diagnoses for eight common cancers have nearly doubled since 1990, the death rate has remained flat, and the incidence of metastatic cases has not increased at the same pace. This suggests that improved detection methods are identifying more cancers that may never have become life-threatening, a phenomenon known as overdiagnosis. The article cautions that the overall trend may be more complex than just an epidemic of disease.</p>

          <p>A German hospitality association, DEHOGA, has suggested extending Munich's Oktoberfest by a day to compensate for a temporary closure caused by a bomb threat. The group's managing director argued the move would be a sign of resilience and that the festival remains a symbol of Bavarian hospitality. However, festival organizers have rejected the idea as impractical, citing staffing shortages and the difficulty of arranging an extra day on such short notice. Bavarian officials confirmed that the festival reopened normally on Thursday, with the investigation now focused on the suspect's motive.</p>

          <h2>Culinary Experts and Chefs Debate the Merits and Flaws of Different Pasta Shapes</h2>

          <p>This article explores the passionate debate over "good" and "bad" pasta shapes, questioning why functionally inferior varieties like farfalle, penne, and wagon wheels persist. Good shapes, such as rigatoni and bucatini, are praised for cooking evenly and effectively holding sauce, acting as superior delivery systems for flavor. Experts suggest that unpopular shapes continue to exist due to nostalgia and their common use in dishes like pasta salads at potlucks. The piece playfully examines the culinary physics of pasta, ultimately concluding that even a shape one person despises might be treasured by another.</p>

          <p>A judge has dismissed the lawsuit brought by Spencer Elden, the man who appeared as a naked baby on the cover of Nirvana's 1991 album "Nevermind." Elden had sued the band and the photographer, alleging the image constituted child pornography and commercial sexual exploitation. However, the judge ruled that the photograph does not depict sexually explicit conduct and that nudity alone is not sufficient to meet the legal standard for child pornography. The court noted that Elden had previously embraced his connection to the famous album cover before filing the lawsuit in 2021.</p>

          <p>The Colombian government has handed over a portion of Hacienda Napoles, the infamous former ranch of drug lord Pablo Escobar, to women affected by the country's long-running armed conflict. President Gustavo Petro announced that 297 acres of the lavish estate, once a symbol of Escobar's wealth and power, have been given to local women farmers. This move is part of a broader land reform program aimed at addressing land ownership inequality, a key driver of the conflict. The estate is also famous for its population of "cocaine hippos," descendants of animals Escobar illegally imported.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, Formula 1's governing body, the FIA, has declared a race a "heat hazard" ahead of this weekend's Singapore Grand Prix. This designation was triggered by predictions of temperatures exceeding 31°C combined with high humidity. Under the new rule, teams are now required to fit their cars with a driver cooling vest system, although drivers are not mandated to use them. The rule was introduced following the 2023 Qatar Grand Prix, where extreme conditions left several drivers suffering from severe heat exhaustion, highlighting the physical demands of racing in such climates.</p>

          <p>Project Coffee Cup, a nonprofit organization that provides hot meals and resources to homeless individuals in Southern California, has been severely impacted by a recent theft. The organization's supply trailer was broken into, and essential equipment such as a grill, tables, and lights were stolen, making it difficult to continue their weekly outreach efforts. Founded by Jacob Baruch to honor his mother's legacy of helping others, the nonprofit creates a familial, cookout-style environment for those in need.

          <p>Residents and officials in Portland, Oregon, are pushing back against President Trump's characterization of the city as a "war-ravaged" nightmare requiring National Guard intervention. While acknowledging issues like homelessness, many locals are using social media to showcase a peaceful city of farmers markets, parks, and cafes, contrasting with the president's focus on a small, ongoing protest at an ICE facility. The president's rhetoric is seen by many as a political move to intimidate a Democratic stronghold, creating a narrative of chaos that residents say does not reflect their daily reality.</p>
