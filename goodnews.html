          <p>Stord, an Atlanta-based logistics startup, has acquired Ware2Go, a UPS subsidiary, to enhance its e-commerce capabilities and challenge Amazon's dominance. The acquisition aims to provide smaller businesses with the infrastructure needed to compete with Amazon's Prime service, particularly in checkout and fulfillment. Stord's founder, Sean Henry, emphasizes the importance of scale in logistics and the need for independent merchants to offer rapid delivery services, which is a critical factor for competing with larger companies. The acquisition will help Stord level the playing field by offering infrastructure for smaller businesses to checkout and fulfill orders more quickly. </p>

Trump nominated Kushner in November, praising him as a tremendous business leader and dealmaker who will strengthen America's partnership with its oldest ally.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts explain that home equity loans and HELOCs have different interest rates due to the fixed versus variable nature of the rates, the flexibility of draw periods, and secondary market requirements. Home equity loans typically have higher, fixed rates because lenders assume the risk of future rate increases, while HELOCs offer lower, variable rates that adjust with economic conditions. The flexible draw periods of HELOCs allow lenders to manage capital more dynamically, often resulting in lower initial rates. Home equity loans are frequently sold to outside investors, driving higher fixed-rate pricing, while HELOCs are kept on banks' balance sheets, resulting in lower starting rates.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Britain and the European Union have reached a significant agreement to enhance security cooperation and reduce trade barriers imposed after Brexit, signaling a potential reset in relations. The deal, politically sensitive for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, involves concessions on fishing rights and adherence to European standards for food exports. Key aspects include easier border crossings for British citizens, streamlined pet travel, and the resumption of some British meat product sales in the EU. The agreement also includes plans for a "youth experience" program to facilitate travel and work opportunities for young Europeans in Britain and vice versa, though details are still under negotiation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new agreement between the UK and the EU aims to "reset" their relationship, potentially boosting economic growth by reducing trade barriers, especially for food producers. The deal simplifies regulations on plant and animal health, which should ease the export of over 1,500 products. While the government claims this agreement could add ¬£8.9 billion to the UK economy by 2040, it would only recoup a fraction of the GDP lost due to Brexit. A key concession from the UK was extending the fisheries agreement by 12 years, disappointing some fishing communities, but the SPS agreement is likely to help reverse the loss of fish exports.</p>

He acknowledges Biden's declining health and past missteps, but underscores his unique understanding of America's global mission and the importance of its alliances. Friedman concludes by wishing Biden a speedy recovery, emphasizing the need for his voice and vision in a world facing increasing uncertainty.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire mother, Heather Strong, discovered she had a rare heart condition, Atrial Septal Defect (ASD), after suffering two strokes at a young age, and her experience led her to have her family checked, revealing that two of her three adult daughters also had the same condition. All three women underwent a quick, outpatient procedure to close the holes in their hearts, performed by the same doctor, Dr. Carey Kimmelstiel, at Tufts Medical Center. The Strong family hopes their experience will encourage others to get checked for any health concerns and to face them head on, as early detection and treatment can prevent future strokes and other complications.</p>

          <p>Petronet LNG, India's top gas importer, anticipates an increase in the country's liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports in the coming months to meet the growing demand for electricity. The increase is due to emergency measures asking companies to operate underutilized gas-based power plants at higher capacity from May 26-June 30 to meet electricity demand in the country. The narrowing price gap between spot and long-term LNG prices is also pushing some companies to step up purchases, he said, adding Indian customers prefer LNG prices at below $10 per million British thermal units.
