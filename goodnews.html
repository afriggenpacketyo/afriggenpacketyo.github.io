          <p>India's women's cricket team achieved a historic T20 series win against England, securing the victory with a comfortable six-wicket win at Old Trafford. After restricting England to a modest 126-7, India's batters, led by a strong opening partnership, chased down the target in the 17th over. This marks India's first-ever women's T20 series victory in England. England's batting performance was hampered by effective spin bowling from India, leaving them to regroup ahead of the upcoming one-day international series.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new all-time high of over $112,000, driven by a broader rally in technology stocks, particularly Nvidia's ascent toward a $4 trillion market capitalization. Despite having traded in a narrow range for weeks, the cryptocurrency demonstrated its nature as a risk asset, rising in tandem with the market's 'risk-on' sentiment. The record high comes as investors anticipate further gains in the latter half of the year, fueled by increased corporate adoption and the potential for new U.S. crypto legislation.

          <p>President Trump is hosting a three-day summit in Washington D.C. with the leaders of Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, and Senegal to focus on a "trade, not aid" policy. The meetings are seen as a commercial opportunity for the U.S. amid growing competition from China and Russia for Africa's resources, including rare earth minerals. During the summit, the African leaders praised Trump and made direct appeals for U.S. investment in their countries. The discussions also touch on key issues like migration, maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea, and the potential renewal of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa).</p>

          <p>Shares of cereal manufacturer WK Kellogg skyrocketed by more than 50% following a report that Italian confectioner Ferrero is nearing a deal to acquire the company for approximately $3 billion. The potential acquisition, which could be finalized this week, would bring iconic brands like Froot Loops and Frosted Flakes under Ferrero's ownership. This move signals further consolidation in the packaged foods industry as consumers increasingly shift away from sugary cereals toward healthier options and private-label brands. WK Kellogg was spun off from its parent company, now Kellanova, in 2023. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a recent 4% decline in the price of gold, this article explores whether now is an opportune moment for investment. It suggests the price dip is likely temporary, citing upcoming economic reports and the long-term upward trend of the precious metal, with some analysts predicting it could eventually reach $4,000 per ounce. The piece argues that waiting could risk being priced out of the market permanently, especially given unpredictable geopolitical factors that can drive prices up.

          <p>Chipmaker Nvidia became the first company ever to briefly surpass a $4 trillion market capitalization during Wednesday's trading session. The milestone highlights the company's dominant position in supplying the essential hardware, particularly graphics processing units (GPUs), for the booming generative artificial intelligence industry. Although the stock closed slightly lower, giving Nvidia a final market value of $3.97 trillion, its shares have surged dramatically over the past five years. The company has achieved this growth despite geopolitical tensions and U.S. export restrictions that have impacted sales to China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England has recommended loosening the cap on riskier mortgage lending, a move aimed at helping more first-time buyers enter the property market. The new guidance would allow individual lenders to issue more than 15% of their new mortgages at loan-to-income ratios higher than 4.5, though an industry-wide cap remains. This change could result in up to 36,000 new higher loan-to-income mortgages annually. Meanwhile, the Bank also reported that 3.6 million existing homeowners face an average monthly payment increase of £107 as their current mortgage deals expire. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides key information for individuals considering Chapter 7 bankruptcy, often called liquidation bankruptcy, as a solution for overwhelming debt. It explains that while this process can discharge unsecured debts like credit cards and medical bills, it does not eliminate all obligations, such as student loans or recent tax debts. The piece details the significant trade-offs, including the potential sale of nonexempt assets and a long-lasting negative impact on one's credit report for up to ten years.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined a request from Florida officials to lift a lower court's injunction against a state law that criminalizes the entry of undocumented immigrants into Florida. The justices allowed the block to remain in place while the law's constitutionality is challenged in lower courts. A federal judge had previously ruled that the law likely encroaches on the federal government's exclusive authority over immigration policy. The law, signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, imposes mandatory minimum sentences on undocumented individuals convicted of entering the state.</p>

          <p>A family from Kerr County, Texas, has shared their story of surviving the catastrophic flash floods that devastated the region. Taylor Bergmann, 19, described how the Guadalupe River suddenly inundated their home, forcing him, his mother figure Erin Burgess, and her boyfriend to flee the rising waters. The current swept them into a tree, where Bergmann and Burgess clung for an hour in the dark, praying for survival while her boyfriend and their dog were washed away.
