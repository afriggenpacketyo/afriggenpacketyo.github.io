          <p>Emma Raducanu's run at the Washington Open has ended after she was defeated by Anna Kalinskaya in the semi-final with a score of 6-4, 6-3. Kalinskaya broke Raducanu's serve at a crucial moment to win the first set and maintained her momentum to secure the victory. This loss prevented a highly anticipated rematch of the 2021 US Open final between Raducanu and Leylah Fernandez. Kalinskaya will now face Fernandez in the final, after Fernandez won a marathon three-set match against Elena Rybakina.</p>

          <p>A research team in China is working to recreate the Houfeng Didong Yi, a seismoscope allegedly invented nearly 2,000 years ago by the polymath Zhang Heng. Historical texts describe the ornate device as being able to detect distant earthquakes and indicate the direction of their epicenter, a claim some modern scholars have dismissed as legend. The original device has been lost to history, and its mention was removed from Chinese school curriculums in 2017. By combining modern scientific principles with historical clues, the researchers hope to restore the reputation of this ancient technological wonder.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service is celebrating its 250th anniversary with an event at the Smithsonian's National Postal Museum and the release of new commemorative stamps. Founded in 1775 with Benjamin Franklin as its first postmaster general, the agency played a crucial role in unifying the young nation. The celebration occurs as the institution faces an uncertain future, with recent discussions within the Trump administration about potential privatization or restructuring. The new Postmaster General, David Steiner, has stated his opposition to privatization, emphasizing the agency's enduring value in connecting the country.</p>

          <p>Following the passing of Ozzy Osbourne, many are remembering not only his musical legacy but also his role as a reality television icon on the early 2000s MTV show, "The Osbournes." The program, which also starred his wife Sharon and children Kelly and Jack, pioneered the "reality sitcom" format by focusing on the mundane and chaotic home life of a famous family. Before shows like "Keeping Up With the Kardashians," "The Osbournes" offered an unprecedented look into celebrity life, blending rock-star excess with relatable family dynamics. It became a massive success, setting the stage for a new genre of television.</p>

          <p>Floribert Bwana Chui Bin Kositi, a 26-year-old customs official from the Democratic Republic of Congo, is on a fast track to Catholic sainthood after being murdered in 2007 for refusing to accept bribes. A devout Catholic, Kositi was killed after he blocked the smuggling of spoiled rice that could have poisoned the public. Despite threats and increasing offers of money, he stood firm in his principles, an act the Church has declared a martyrdom. Last month, he was beatified in Rome, the final step before canonization, for choosing to uphold his Christian values of justice and love for others over corruption.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As fans anticipate the tense Euro 2025 final, experts explain the science behind the intense physical and emotional reactions experienced during major sporting events. Hormones like adrenaline and cortisol surge, especially in loyal fans, leading to increased heart rates and a "fight or flight" response that can feel overwhelming. Psychologists advise fans to manage these effects by getting adequate rest, having a clear match-day plan, and engaging in physical movement to release pent-up energy. Ultimately, they suggest reframing the anxiety as part of an enjoyable, communal experience that allows for healthy emotional expression.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in several decades, with daytime high temperatures struggling to surpass the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray weather to a misplaced high-pressure system, which is sitting farther west than normal over the Pacific. This has allowed a low-pressure system to dominate, bringing unrelenting cloud cover and increasing a process called upwelling, where cold, deep ocean water is brought to the surface. While not record-breaking, the weather pattern is the coldest the Bay Area has seen since the late 1990s, with little change expected in the immediate forecast.</p>

          <p>A new American Eagle ad campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney has generated both backlash and support online. The campaign, which promotes a line of jeans to raise money for a domestic violence charity, was criticized by some as "tone-deaf" for its suggestive humor and focus on the actress's body. However, many fans defended Sweeney, with some praising the campaign for moving away from "woke advertising." Despite the controversy, American Eagle's stock saw a temporary boost, as the company bets on Sweeney's star power to revive sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to protect pubs and music venues from noise complaints, a move aimed at revitalizing struggling town centers. Under the proposed changes, developers building new properties near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing. The reforms also aim to fast-track permissions for new businesses and promote outdoor activities like al fresco dining and live performances. While the government touts the changes as a boost for the hospitality industry, the opposition has criticized the ruling party's tax policies for harming the sector.</p>
