        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pre-orders for Apple's new iPhone 17 series have shattered previous records in China, demonstrating robust demand despite initial shipment delays for the iPhone Air model. Online platforms like JD.com reported sales surpassing last year's iPhone 16 series within the first minute, with the 256GB iPhone 17 being the most popular variant. Overwhelming customer interest led to difficulties accessing Apple's website and rapid booking of in-person pickup slots in major cities like Shanghai, with some regions facing waiting periods extending to October. This strong performance underscores Apple's enduring appeal and market penetration in the highly competitive Chinese consumer electronics landscape, reflecting consumer eagerness for the latest technology.</p>

          <p>Bavaria's state minister, Hubert Aiwanger, has affirmed the German state's openness to Chinese investment, despite broader European Union concerns about economic resilience and self-sufficiency. Aiwanger emphasized that protectionism and isolationism are not the answer, advocating for continued close relations with major economies like China, the USA, and Japan. This stance echoes a historical visit by a Bavarian politician to Beijing fifty years prior, underscoring a long-standing economic connection between the regions. Bavaria actively welcomes numerous Chinese companies, signaling a pragmatic approach to international trade and investment that prioritizes regional economic benefits while acknowledging wider geopolitical dynamics.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are aggressively expanding into the European market, challenging established legacy automakers on their home turf. At the IAA Mobility conference in Munich, Chinese brands showcased advanced technology and aggressive expansion plans, aiming to introduce mass-market models like Xpeng's Mona series and GAC's Aion EVs. Despite potential EU tariffs, these companies leverage affordability, battery technology, and production scale, leading to a near doubling of their market share in Europe in the first half of the year. European automakers face pressure to innovate faster and scale EV production to compete effectively.</p>

She views multi-club ownership as a necessity for growth in women's football, pooling resources for research and scouting, unlike the men's game. Kang's vision focuses on building a compelling product to attract fans and commercial resources, aiming for top-tier success while advocating for the sport's independent growth.</p>

          <p>An international team of divers has uncovered the remarkably preserved remnants of an 8,000-year-old Stone Age settlement on the seabed in Denmark's Bay of Aarhus. This discovery, part of a European Union-funded project, offers a unique "time capsule" of coastal life, preserved in an oxygen-free environment after rising sea levels submerged it. Researchers have found animal bones, stone tools, arrowheads, and worked wood, providing valuable insights into how ancient communities adapted to rapidly changing climates. The findings are particularly relevant today, as current sea level rise rates are comparable to those 8,000 years ago, threatening modern coastal populations globally.</p>

          <p>Three octogenarian Austrian nuns, Sisters Bernadette, Regina, and Rita, defiantly fled the Catholic care home where they were placed to return to their former Kloster Goldenstein convent in Elsbethen. They regained access with the help of former students and a locksmith, asserting their right to live there until the end of their lives, a right they claim was broken. Church authorities, who dissolved their community and deemed the convent rooms unsuitable for care, expressed displeasure. Despite initial lack of utilities, supporters are assisting the nuns, who are determined to stay in their cherished home, sparking a heartwarming human-interest story.</p>

          <p>An analysis reveals Charlie Kirk's significant role in Donald Trump's 2024 election victory, particularly by mobilizing younger voters, a demographic traditionally dominated by Democrats. Kirk's organization, Turning Point USA, successfully persuaded the Republican establishment to invest in youth outreach, contributing to Trump's improved performance with voters under 30. Experts noted Kirk's ability to project strength and masculinity, and his willingness to engage in debates, resonated with young men. His "Ballot Chasers" program in battleground states also helped mobilize low-propensity Trump supporters, demonstrating his instrumental contribution to the campaign's ground game and the broader MAGA coalition.</p>
