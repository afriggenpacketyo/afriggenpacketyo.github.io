          <p>Irish boxer Katie Taylor defeated Amanda Serrano for the third time, retaining her undisputed light-welterweight championship in a gripping trilogy fight at Madison Square Garden. The bout, which was more tactical than their previous encounters, concluded with a majority decision in Taylor's favor, with two judges scoring it 97-93 for her. Serrano acknowledged that her more cautious strategy did not pay off, while Taylor praised her opponent's skill and resilience. The event marked a historic all-female card at the iconic venue, further cementing the legacy of this significant rivalry in women's boxing.</p>

The Warren County Sheriff's Office shared photos of a smiling Stevenson on the return flight, where he was under heavy guard by multiple law enforcement agencies to prevent another incident. Stevenson had been on the run for over a month after slipping away from a contracted agent at a ticket counter.

          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior R&D staff, in a deal valued at $2.4 billion. The agreement includes licensing fees for some of Windsurf's technology but is not a full acquisition, leaving Windsurf to operate independently. This move intensifies the "AI talent war" among major tech companies, following similar high-profile hires by Meta and Microsoft. Windsurf has gained popularity for its "vibe coding" tools, which use AI to assist developers, and this deal underscores the immense value placed on top AI expertise.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, barring it from conducting indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in seven Southern California counties. The ruling responds to a lawsuit from the ACLU and other advocacy groups, which accused federal agents of unconstitutional racial profiling and targeting Latino communities. Judge Maame E. Frimpong found there was a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims and specifically prohibited agents from using factors like race or accent as the sole basis for a stop. The order also ensures attorney access for detainees at a Los Angeles facility.</p>

          <p>Following a controversy over sandals that closely resembled traditional Indian Kolhapuri chappals, luxury fashion house Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers. The company met with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents thousands of Kolhapuri artisans, to discuss future collaboration opportunities. The move came after critics on social media and in the fashion industry accused Prada of cultural appropriation for showcasing the design without acknowledging its origins. This initiative is being framed as a potential model for respectful collaboration between global brands and traditional craft communities.</p>

          <p>A New York federal judge has ruled that a lawsuit filed by two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege that Lovo deceptively used their voices to create and sell AI-generated voice clones without their consent, violating their contract and engaging in deceptive business practices. While the judge dismissed a federal copyright claim on the voices themselves, claims related to breach of contract and the improper use of their recordings for AI training data will proceed. This case is a significant development in the legal battles between artists and AI companies.</p>

          <p>Chinese law firms are increasingly establishing a global presence, driven by a government push and rising demand from Chinese companies expanding abroad. The number of overseas offices for Chinese law firms has grown significantly, reaching 208 branches in 2024, a 70% increase from 2018. These firms find that Chinese companies prefer their services due to shared language and trust. However, lawyers acknowledge the challenge of attracting non-Chinese clients amid rising geopolitical tensions, marking a pivotal moment for the internationalization of China's legal services market.</p>

          <p>With the patent for semaglutide, the active ingredient in weight-loss drugs like Ozempic, set to expire in China next year, dozens of local firms are racing to develop rival products. There are currently around 60 such drugs in clinical trials in China, positioning the country to enter the lucrative $150 billion global market for GLP-1 agonists. Analysts predict that the entry of up to 20 generic competitors will significantly drive down prices, making these treatments for diabetes and obesity more affordable and accessible for patients. This development could reshape the landscape of the highly profitable weight-loss drug industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lord Huron's 2015 song "The Night We Met" has become a massive global success a decade after its quiet release, accumulating over three billion Spotify plays. The track's popularity began to surge after it was featured in the Netflix series *13 Reasons Why* in 2017 and has since snowballed through its widespread use on TikTok. Frontman Ben Schneider attributes the song's enduring appeal to its relatable theme of wistful reflection on a past relationship, allowing it to resonate with a wide audience.

The event featured a fire ceremony led by an Earth Elder and focused on the interconnectedness of all life and the wisdom of pre-industrial cultures. The King's long-held belief system, which he once called a "call to revolution," advocates for sustainable practices and rejects a purely consumerist culture. This gathering aims to be the first of many, cementing this philosophy as a key part of his legacy.</p>
