          <p>Thousands of Bulgarians gathered in Sofia and other cities to protest the country's plan to adopt the euro, reflecting fears about economic impact and mistrust of institutions. Demonstrators, including members of the pro-Russian Vazrazhdane party, carried flags and banners opposing the currency change and calling for a referendum. Bulgarian President Rumen Radev also opposes euro adoption, citing concerns about inflation, but parliament rejected his referendum proposal. The article highlights that disinformation campaigns have contributed to public anxiety about the economic transition, particularly among those in rural areas unfamiliar with international transactions.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities advised the public to avoid the area and stay at least 600 feet away due to the potential health risk, especially for those allergic to bee stings. Beekeepers assisted in the rescue, working to re-hive the bees and locate their queen, and the road was closed for about 24 hours during the operation. By the next morning, most bees were expected to return to their hives.</p>

          <p>This article explores the use of corporate buzzwords, questioning whether they foster inclusion or impede trust. Studies suggest that jargon can undermine trust, particularly among younger employees who may cling to buzzwords as a means of navigating workplace culture. The piece argues that buzzwords are often used to distract from the primary goal of making money, and suggests that clear, human language is more effective.
