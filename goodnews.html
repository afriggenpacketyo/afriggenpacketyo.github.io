          <h2>Broadway's "Dorian Gray" and "Vanya" Explore Self-Perception in the Age of Social Media</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 08:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses two new Broadway productions, Sarah Snook's one-actor adaptation of "The Picture of Dorian Gray" and Andrew Scott's "Vanya," both of which examine themes of self-perception and performance in the context of modern social media. "Dorian Gray" uses technology like smartphones to critique the superficiality of image-centric culture, while "Vanya" suggests that richness can be found in embracing multiple intertwining voices within oneself. The article posits that these plays raise questions about whether performing a persona is a perversion of truth or a manifestation of self, reflecting the ongoing debate about social media's impact on identity and authenticity. Ultimately, the article suggests that "Vanya" offers a more optimistic view, suggesting that expressing oneself can be a form of liberation.</p>

          <p>This article features a poem by Caki Wilkinson titled "Good Lord, These Muscadines." The poem explores themes of intimacy, confession, and the acceptance of imperfection within a relationship. Through vivid imagery of muscadines, sour dishes, and undone sheets, the poem delves into the speaker's struggle with vulnerability and the realization that longing is not the only song in their repertoire. The poem encapsulates a moment of forgiveness and acceptance of the "utter glut" of shared life, moving beyond idealized longing to embrace the messy reality of connection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This Vox article argues for the adoption of self-driving cars, citing data from Waymo that suggests autonomous vehicles could significantly reduce traffic fatalities and injuries. The study showed Waymo's self-driving cars had substantially fewer crashes compared to human drivers. The author acknowledges the caveats, such as limited testing conditions and public apprehension, but contends that slowing down the development of autonomous vehicles is costing lives. The article calls for a shift in perspective, urging the public to focus on the potential benefits of AI drivers rather than isolated incidents, ultimately advocating for a more data-driven approach to transportation safety.</p>

          <p>A New York Times analysis suggests that President Trump's policies played a role in the re-election of Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. While Albanese avoided direct criticism of Trump, the global turmoil caused by Trump's return to power bolstered anti-Trump sentiment in Australia. Voters were concerned about the cost of living and alarmed by the market's reaction to Trump's policies. This contributed to Albanese's landslide victory and the defeat of his opponent, who was seen as emulating Trump's style.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This Guardian article explores the revitalization of traditional facial tattoos among Native American women, particularly within the south-eastern Indigenous nations. The Inchunwa Project is highlighted as a community-rooted collective working to reclaim this ancient practice, which was suppressed during colonization. The article details the significance of inchunwa, which means "to be marked, branded or tattooed," and how it represents a commitment to community, ancestral connection, and cultural continuity. The revival of tattooing is part of a larger effort to reclaim Indigenous traditions and challenge the notion that Native American cultures are relics of the past.</p>
