          <p>A ban on the sale of single-use disposable vapes has been implemented across the UK, aiming to protect children's health and the environment. Shops and supermarkets are now prohibited from stocking disposable vapes, although rechargeable and refillable devices remain available. Disposable vapes have been identified as a key factor in the rise of youth vaping, with millions of vapes discarded annually. While ministers anticipate a significant impact, health experts emphasize the need for further regulation to effectively address youth vaping.</p>
