          <p>A recent political analysis indicates that the Scottish National Party (SNP) is showing signs of recovery and renewed stability under its current leader, John Swinney. After a period of internal turmoil and a significant defeat in the last general election, the party's standing has improved, partly due to splintered support among its rivals. Polling suggests the SNP is once again competitive, with some in the party even discussing the possibility of winning a majority at Holyrood, which would be used to press for another independence referendum.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a new law designed to simplify the insurance claims process for residents who suffer a total loss of their homes in wildfires. The legislation allows victims to receive up to 60% of their personal property coverage, capped at $350,000, without the daunting task of creating a detailed, itemized list of every lost possession. This change is intended to provide quicker, more efficient financial support to survivors dealing with the catastrophic aftermath of a fire.</p>

          <p>As Beijing drafts its 15th five-year plan, a key focus is the evolving economic relationship with Taiwan, moving beyond traditional investment towards high-tech industrial partnerships. A recent delegation of Taiwanese business leaders, including from major component supplier Delta Electronics, visited mainland China to explore collaborations in the rapidly growing electric vehicle sector. This shift indicates a strategy of deeper integration in advanced supply chains, presenting both new opportunities and complexities for cross-strait relations.</p>

          <p>At a summit in Egypt, former U.S. President Donald Trump, alongside leaders from Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey, signed a declaration formalizing a peace plan for Gaza. The agreement follows the successful release of all living Israeli hostages by Hamas in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, ending a two-year military conflict. Trump declared it a "historic milestone," stating that the "long and painful nightmare is finally over" and that the focus can now shift to rebuilding the war-torn territory.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks saw a significant rebound on Monday after former President Trump softened his tone on trade tensions with China, calming investor fears of an escalating conflict. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 both posted strong gains, recovering a portion of the heavy losses incurred on Friday when Trump announced a potential 100% tariff on Chinese imports. While the market responded positively to the de-escalation, analysts caution that global trade issues continue to be a potential source of market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Evidence suggests the U.S. Air Force has successfully used the A-10C Warthog as a counter-drone platform during a recent deployment to the Middle East. An A-10 was photographed upon its return with kill markings depicting two Shahed-type drones, indicating it likely used its newly equipped laser-guided rockets in an air-to-air capacity. This adaptation provides a much more cost-effective method for neutralizing enemy drones compared to using expensive traditional air-to-air missiles, showcasing a new role for the aging aircraft.</p>
