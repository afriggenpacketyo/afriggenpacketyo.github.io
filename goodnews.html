          <p>The UK is preparing for a state visit by President Donald Trump, which is expected to offer a welcome distraction from Prime Minister Keir Starmer's mounting domestic political challenges. Starmer's government has recently experienced a cabinet reshuffle, the dismissal of the UK Ambassador to the US, and large public protests concerning immigration figures. The visit is designed to showcase Britain's "soft power" and reinforce the "special relationship" through discussions on trade, including potential agreements on tech, energy, and lower tariffs for steel and aluminum. Starmer aims to garner positive news from the visit amid his Labour Party's struggling approval ratings.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a 6-5 extra-inning loss to the Philadelphia Phillies, hindering their chances of securing the No. 2 seed in the National League postseason and the accompanying first-round bye. Despite rallying from deficits three times, including late-game heroics from Mookie Betts and Andy Pages, the Dodgers ultimately fell short. Manager Dave Roberts emphasized the team's focus on winning every game, viewing the series as an opportunity to scout potential playoff opponents. This defeat extends the Phillies' lead to 5½ games in the race for the second seed, leaving the Dodgers with a challenging path in their final 12 regular season games.</p>

          <p>Women's rugby teams are increasingly tracking players' menstrual cycles, which are now recognized as the "fifth vital sign" for female athletes, to optimize performance and overall health. Period symptoms such as fatigue, cramps, and hormonal fluctuations can significantly impact strength, endurance, and recovery, with a high percentage of elite sportswomen reporting negative effects. Teams employ various methods, including daily questionnaires, dedicated apps, and saliva tests, to monitor cycles and make necessary adaptations to training, nutrition, and recovery protocols. This personalized approach aims to maximize athletic potential and ensure well-being during demanding competitions like the Women's Rugby World Cup.</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping has urged greater efforts to develop a unified domestic market in China, asserting its crucial importance for securing a competitive edge globally and meeting national development objectives. In an article featured in Qiushi, the Communist Party's leading theoretical journal, Xi detailed six primary tasks, with a strong focus on curbing excessive cutthroat competition. He instructed industry associations to guide businesses in prioritizing product quality over price, actively opposing the production of low-quality goods. This initiative follows a July meeting of China’s Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission, where officials discussed cracking down on aggressive price competition and eliminating outdated industrial capacity.

          <p>The US and China have reportedly achieved a "framework" deal concerning TikTok's US operations, which could lead to American ownership as part of ongoing trade negotiations. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the agreement, indicating that Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping are anticipated to finalize the terms on Friday. This breakthrough occurs just before a looming Wednesday deadline for TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its US assets or face a ban over national security concerns. Oracle is reportedly among the companies poised to facilitate TikTok's continued operation in the US, though specific details regarding algorithm control and user data storage remain largely undisclosed.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has appointed Mike Liberatore, previously the finance chief at Elon Musk's xAI, as its new business finance officer, responsible for managing the artificial intelligence startup's extensive infrastructure expenditures. Liberatore's swift departure from xAI after only three months further escalates the bitter rivalry between OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Musk, who were once co-founders. This strategic hire follows OpenAI's recent $500 billion valuation and its growing commitments to computing resources, including a massive $300 billion deal with Oracle. Liberatore's exit from xAI contributes to a pattern of high-profile departures from Musk's competing AI venture.</p>

          <p>A group of teenagers in Bradford undertook a five-day challenge to remove all technology from their bedrooms, aiming to observe the effects on their well-being and daily routines. This initiative, part of the BBC's Teen Summit, permitted tech use only in communal areas of their homes. Participants, including 13-year-old Henry, reported significant improvements in sleep quality and increased interaction with family, while Elizabeth, also 13, explored new activities like ballet and baking. Experts attribute better sleep to reduced blue light exposure and fewer notifications. The project underscored the social importance of online gaming for teens and encouraged parents to establish clear boundaries for digital device usage.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are actively considering a strategic option to deploy Shohei Ohtani as a relief pitcher during the playoffs, even though he is primarily slated as a starter. This tactical flexibility is inspired by historical postseason successes, such as Walker Buehler's previous role. However, Major League Baseball's specific rules for two-way players present a significant hurdle: if Ohtani enters a game as a reliever, the Dodgers would forfeit his designated hitter role upon his exit from the mound. President of Baseball Operations Andrew Friedman voiced his frustration with this particular rule, suggesting it fails to adequately incentivize two-way play. The team is meticulously weighing these complex advantages and disadvantages as the postseason draws near.</p>

          <p>A Shanghai court has ordered two teenagers in China to pay 2.2 million yuan ($309,000) to two catering companies after they were filmed urinating into a hotpot broth. The incident, which occurred at a Haidilao restaurant and was subsequently posted online, ignited widespread public outrage and caused significant reputational damage. The court determined that the teenagers had infringed upon the companies' property rights and reputation through "acts of insult," causing "strong discomfort among the public." Their parents were also held liable for failing to fulfill their guardianship duties. Although Haidilao offered extensive compensation to affected customers, the court ruled that these additional payouts were a "voluntary business decision" and not to be covered by the teenagers.</p>
