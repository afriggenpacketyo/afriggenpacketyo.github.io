          <p>Google is set to invest $15 billion over the next five years to construct a major artificial intelligence data center hub in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The project, announced by Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian, will be the company's largest AI hub outside of the United States. The investment aims to build out significant data center capacity to meet the surging global demand for cloud services and AI infrastructure. This move highlights India's growing importance as a global technology hub and is part of Google's broader strategy to expand its computing capacity worldwide.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has completed the eleventh test flight of its massive Starship rocket, launching from its facility in South Texas. The mission saw the Starship upper stage separate from its Super Heavy booster, with the booster performing a controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico and the upper stage landing in the Indian Ocean as planned. This flight marks the final test before SpaceX moves to a new, more advanced version of the rocket designed for long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars. The successful test is a crucial step for NASA's Artemis program, which relies on a modified Starship for its lunar landing missions.</p>

          <p>Shares of LG Electronics India surged over 45% in their market debut, causing the subsidiary's market capitalization to surpass that of its South Korean parent company. The Indian unit's initial public offering was the most heavily subscribed in the country since 2008, attracting bids worth nearly $50 billion and demonstrating strong investor confidence. The successful listing highlights the significant growth potential of India's consumer electronics and appliance market, which is projected to nearly double by 2029. The IPO's success underscores the depth of India's domestic capital markets and continued investor interest in the region.</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old from Inverclyde, Cameron McGerr, is campaigning for CPR to be taught in all Scottish schools after losing both of his parents to heart conditions. Cameron believes that had he been trained in the life-saving skill, he might have been able to help save his father, who died from a cardiac arrest earlier this year. He has already successfully convinced his own school to introduce the training and has since taken his "Pulse of Life" campaign to the Scottish Parliament. His efforts have garnered support from health groups and prompted a meeting with Scotland's Education Secretary to discuss a nationwide rollout.</p>

          <p>The recent ceasefire agreement in Gaza, accompanied by a significant hostage and prisoner exchange, has captured the front pages of newspapers worldwide. Media outlets are highlighting the emotional reunions of Israeli hostages, some held captive for over two years, with their families. Coverage also shows celebrations among Palestinians as prisoners are released. The deal, brokered with the involvement of U.S. President Donald Trump, is being hailed as a potential "historic dawn" for the region. However, commentators caution that achieving a lasting peace will require sustained diplomatic effort beyond the current administration's term.</p>

          <p>Former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is intensifying his call for the urgent implementation of a national screening program for prostate cancer in the UK. Speaking as an ambassador for Prostate Cancer Research, Sunak argued that a targeted program focusing on high-risk groups, such as men with a family history and Black men, would be affordable and could save countless lives. The proposal involves using more reliable MRI scans alongside traditional PSA tests. The call comes as the UK National Screening Committee reconsiders its previous decision not to recommend routine screening, though some medical experts remain cautious about the potential for over-treatment.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Peking University have successfully restored a complete version of "Rhapsody on the Luo River Goddess," a celebrated 4th-century Chinese calligraphy masterpiece by Wang Xianzhi. Only about a quarter of the original scroll had survived over the centuries. By analyzing the stylistic traits of the remaining 250 characters, the team used an artificial intelligence model to replicate the artist's unique style and generate the missing verses. The project resulted in a full scroll of 919 characters, showcasing how modern AI can be fused with cultural preservation to revive ancient artistic treasures.</p>

          <p>In an effort to boost the number of blood donors, particularly among young people, the UK's Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) is partnering with NHS Blood and Transplant. As part of a new campaign, individuals applying for a driving licence will receive an email with a link encouraging them to register as a blood donor. Officials hope this will reach millions of potential donors annually, addressing the fact that over half of current regular donors are over 45. The initiative aims to replicate the success of a similar program for organ donor registration, which has been highly effective.</p>

          <p>The Seattle Mariners defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 10-3, securing a 2-0 lead in the American League Championship Series as the series heads to Toronto. The Blue Jays, who led the majors in comeback wins during the regular season, have struggled to generate offense, scoring only four runs in the first two games. Meanwhile, in the National League, the Los Angeles Dodgers won their NLCS opener against the Milwaukee Brewers with a 2-1 victory. The Blue Jays now face a significant challenge, as teams winning the first two road games in a best-of-seven series have historically gone on to win the series.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers showcased the power of their record-breaking $415 million payroll in a 2-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series.

Pitcher Blake Snell delivered eight scoreless innings, while a sixth-inning solo home run from first baseman Freddie Freeman gave them the lead. The win highlights the significant disparity between the two teams, with the Dodgers' ability to acquire elite talent providing a clear advantage in the high-stakes postseason matchup.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered a masterful performance, pitching eight scoreless innings with 10 strikeouts to lead his team to a 2-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 1 of the NLCS. The win came despite a bizarre and chaotic fourth-inning double play that cost the Dodgers a potential grand slam. A sixth-inning home run by Freddie Freeman provided the necessary offense, and while the bullpen created some tension in the ninth, reliever Blake Treinen ultimately secured the final out. Snell's historic outing, allowing only one hit, gave the Dodgers a crucial early advantage in the series.</p>

          <p>Atlanta Falcons running back Bijan Robinson had a career-best performance, rushing for 170 yards and scoring on an 81-yard touchdown run, the longest in the NFL this season. His efforts were key in the Falcons' 24-14 victory over the Buffalo Bills, handing the Bills their second consecutive loss. Buffalo's quarterback Josh Allen threw two touchdown passes but was also intercepted twice, struggling against Atlanta's defense. The Falcons' offense, led by Robinson and receiver Drake London, controlled the game, securing the win with a late field goal drive that left the Bills with no time for a comeback.</p>
