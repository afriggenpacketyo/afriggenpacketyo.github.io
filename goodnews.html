        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Sheffield in the U.K. have developed tiny robots, called "Pipebots," designed to navigate inside water mains to find and fix leaks without disruptive excavation. These robots are equipped with cameras and acoustic sensors to identify cracks in aging infrastructure, a significant issue in countries like the U.K. where water systems are old and waste millions of gallons daily. This innovation is part of a broader, government-supported initiative to modernize infrastructure management. The technology holds the potential to make maintenance more efficient and affordable globally.</p>

          <p>A small but dedicated group of elite remote control (RC) car racers are competing professionally, traveling the country with sponsors and pit crews in a scene reminiscent of NASCAR. These professional drivers, some of whom earn six-figure incomes, compete in high-stakes events like the Dirt Nitro Challenge, where their miniature cars can reach speeds over 60 mph. The article profiles several top racers, including Ryan Cavalieri and Adam Drake, exploring their journeys from childhood hobbyists to full-time professionals. It highlights the skill, engineering, and dedication required in this niche but highly competitive sport.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece profiles Democratic Representative Robert Garcia of California, who came to the U.S. from Peru as a child and was formerly undocumented. The author presents Garcia, now in a key leadership role on the House Oversight Committee, as a formidable and patriotic counter-voice to the Trump administration. Garcia's rapid political ascent is seen as a sign that voters desire aggressive and principled leadership. The article highlights his commitment to holding the administration accountable, particularly on issues of corruption and immigration, representing a version of the American dream that directly confronts Trump's political narrative.</p>

          <p>Comedian Nate Jackson, known for his viral crowd work clips on social media, has released his debut Netflix special, "Super Funny." In an interview, Jackson explains that his improvisational style was honed over years of hosting a weekly comedy show in Tacoma, Washington, where he had to generate new material constantly. He views crowd work not just as simple roasting but as a complex comedic structure that involves gathering information to build elaborate, interconnected jokes.

          <h2>Review: Charlotte Runcie's 'Bring the House Down' Satirizes the World of Arts Criticism</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Charlotte Runcie's debut novel, "Bring the House Down," offers a sharp and entertaining satire of the arts criticism world, set during the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. The story follows two critics: the acerbic and influential Alex Lyons, and his junior colleague, Sophie Ridgen, who narrates the tale. Alex's career begins to unravel after he gives a devastating one-star review to a show and then sleeps with its star, who subsequently turns her performance into a public takedown of him. The review finds the novel to be a compelling read, though it notes that the charisma of the central characters is sometimes more told than shown.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with the leaders of Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, and Senegal, signaling a shift in his administration's approach to Africa. While previously cutting foreign aid, the White House now emphasizes the commercial opportunities and security partnerships the continent offers. Analysts suggest the focus will be on securing access to critical minerals and addressing migration and drug trafficking routes that pass through the region. The meeting is also seen as a political opportunity for the African leaders, some of whom face domestic challenges to their rule, to gain international legitimacy.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this statutory leave is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks, forcing many who experience earlier loss to use sick leave or return to work immediately. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will give people necessary time to grieve. The move has been praised by campaigners as a huge step forward in formally recognizing early pregnancy loss.</p>

          <p>A 15-year-old from County Armagh, Oscar Black, has set a new record as the youngest person to complete a solo swim of the North Channel from Northern Ireland to Scotland. The grueling swim, which covered a distance of 46km due to strong currents, took him 16 hours and 38 minutes to complete. During the challenge, Black had to overcome numerous jellyfish stings and difficult currents that tested him mentally and physically. He described the experience as a significant mental challenge but ultimately worth the effort to achieve the record-breaking feat.</p>

          <p>Amid a national trend toward tougher policies, Los Angeles County is embracing harm reduction at its new Skid Row Care Campus to combat homelessness and addiction. The facility offers traditional treatment but also provides clean syringes, pipes, and naloxone for those not ready to quit drugs, aiming to prevent overdoses and build trust. This approach contrasts with the Trump administration's focus on forced treatment and recovery-first mandates. While controversial, proponents argue harm reduction saves lives, improves public health, and can be a gateway to long-term recovery for a vulnerable population.</p>

Current projects include testing the heat tolerance of coffee and cacao trees, creating a refuge for endangered pupfish, and researching methods to restore coral reefs.

He was sentenced to a year in prison in December for having a consensual relationship with a 17-year-old girl while on holiday, as the age of consent in the UAE is 18. The case was initiated after the girl's mother reported the relationship to UAE authorities. Campaign group Detained in Dubai, which advocated for his release, highlighted the case as an example of the risks tourists face from the UAE's strict laws.</p>
