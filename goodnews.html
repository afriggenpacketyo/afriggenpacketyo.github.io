          <p>Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi has revealed that the band's original members are feeling nervous ahead of their final farewell performance at Villa Park in Birmingham. This concert marks the first time in 20 years that Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward will play together, drawing over 40,000 fans from around the globe. Iommi acknowledged the physical toll of rehearsals on the aging musicians and confirmed that this will be their last-ever show as a group. He expressed hope that the gig will provide a fitting conclusion, viewing the band's legacy as living on through the many artists they inspired.</p>

          <p>The popular regional Mexican music group Eslabón Armado is set to perform at the Peacock Theatre in Los Angeles on July 19, where they will present their new independent album, “Vibras de Noche II.” As children of immigrants, the band members have expressed deep concern over the current situation facing their community, with lead singer Pedro Tovar vowing to participate in a benefit concert for affected families. In a recent interview, the musicians discussed their creative process, which involved setting up a home studio for a more natural and less-pressured recording experience. They also reflected on their strong connection with their young fanbase.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Successfully Cultivate Beating Human Heart Structure in Pig Embryo</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 22:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health in China has achieved a scientific breakthrough by growing a human heart structure within a pig embryo. The team announced that the chimeric heart, composed of human cells, beat independently for a duration of 21 days. To accomplish this, scientists reprogrammed human stem cells with genes designed to prevent cell death and enhance their integration within the pig host. These modified cells were then implanted into pig embryos at the blastocyst stage, which were subsequently transferred to surrogate sows for gestation, marking a significant step in organ cultivation research.</p>

          <p>South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed the detention of a person who crossed the heavily fortified military demarcation line from North Korea into the South. The individual was identified and secured by the military in the central-west section of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The person is now in custody and will be investigated by relevant authorities to determine their identity and motives, including whether it was a defection attempt. The incident comes amid heightened border tensions, although the South Korean military reported no unusual movements from North Korean forces in response to the crossing, which is a rare occurrence due to the DMZ's extensive fortifications.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Government Signals Intent to Address Detrimental EV Price Wars</h2>

          <p>China's government is showing signs of intervening in the country's electric vehicle market to curb the intense price wars that threaten the industry's stability. While market leader BYD reported a 31% sales growth, its recent price cuts have drawn criticism from competitors like Great Wall Motors, who warn of unsustainable competition. This "involution," or meaningless race to the bottom, has led to industry-wide losses and pushed automakers to seek profits overseas, prompting tariff threats from the U.S. and EU. The government's new focus aims to rein in the chaotic competition that its own industrial policies helped create. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ward Sakeik, a 22-year-old stateless Palestinian woman, has been released after being held in immigration detention for over four months. She was detained in February upon returning from her honeymoon in the U.S. Virgin Islands, a U.S. territory, despite having complied with ICE check-in requirements for years. Sakeik, who was born in Saudi Arabia to a family from Gaza, described harrowing conditions in detention and faced two deportation attempts by the government. Her release followed a legal battle and public outcry, and she now plans to continue her fight for other women she met while confined, highlighting the plight of those detained without legal resources.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has invited the public to suggest themes for the next generation of UK banknotes, and citizens have responded with a wide array of ideas. Suggestions range from celebrating Britain's maritime heritage and famous landmarks to featuring beloved classic TV characters like Bagpuss or scenes from "Fawlty Towers." While some wish to continue the tradition of honoring historical figures, others have proposed themes of nature, vintage trains, and even a British Bulldog. The public consultation reflects a desire for the new currency to represent the entire country's culture and history, though some question the effort given the declining use of cash.</p>
