          <p>Taylor Swift's lawyers have refuted claims that the pop star agreed to be deposed in the ongoing legal dispute between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni. Baldoni's legal team had requested a deadline extension to accommodate Swift's testimony, which Lively's attorneys argue is a tactic to create a media spectacle. Swift's counsel maintains she has no material role in the case but will comply if compelled by the court, though her schedule only permits a deposition in late October. The conflict stems from dueling lawsuits between the "It Ends With Us" co-stars.</p>

          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff expressed his "inspiration" for competitor Palantir, particularly its high stock market valuation, while also taking another jab at its pricing model. At a technology conference, Benioff noted Palantir's high revenue multiple and called its software the "most expensive" he has ever seen, joking that perhaps Salesforce isn't charging enough. This continues a public rivalry where Benioff has previously positioned Salesforce as a more affordable alternative. The comments highlight the competitive dynamics in the enterprise software and data analytics sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stellantis's Ram brand has officially canceled the development of its all-electric Ram 1500 pickup truck, attributing the decision to slowing consumer demand for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in North America. The company had previously delayed the truck's launch, which was originally slated for late 2024. Instead of a full BEV, Ram will focus on launching an extended-range electric truck next year, which will feature a gasoline engine alongside an electric generator. This strategic shift reflects broader adjustments within the automotive industry as automakers reassess their EV product strategies.</p>

The 12-story, 300-room luxury hotel is a key component of Stan Kroenke's larger Hollywood Park development. Despite challenges such as rising tariffs and labor shortages that have affected other construction projects, the builder, KPC Development Co., managed to avoid delays by preemptively paying tariffs on imported materials. The hotel will be part of Marriott's Autograph Collection.</p>

          <h2>Brazil's Conviction of Former President Bolsonaro Highlights Democratic Accountability</h2>

          <p>Brazil’s Supreme Court has found former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty of conspiracies related to his 2022 reelection loss, sentencing him to over 27 years in prison and barring him from future office. This article draws parallels between Bolsonaro and former U.S. President Donald Trump, noting both leaders challenged democratic norms, claimed electoral fraud, and saw their supporters riot. The author suggests Brazil's decisive legal action serves as a potent example of "horizontal accountability," where judicial institutions hold powerful leaders in check. The piece contrasts this with the ongoing legal and political battles in the United States.</p>
