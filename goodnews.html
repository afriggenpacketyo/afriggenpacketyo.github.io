          <p>This article provides a breakdown of estimated monthly annuity payouts based on different investment amounts and ages, offering insights for retirement planning. The payouts vary depending on factors such as the amount invested, the age when payments start, and life expectancy. The article highlights that annuities can provide predictable income during retirement, especially when other sources like Social Security and 401(k) plans may not fully cover expenses. It also notes that annuities are not suitable for everyone, as they involve locking up a lump sum of money, and advises shopping around for the best rates and features. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research from Northwestern University suggests that Duavee, a drug used to treat menopause symptoms, may also prevent breast cancer. The study found that the drug significantly reduced breast tissue cell growth, a key indicator of cancer progression, in post-menopausal women with stage 0 breast cancer. Patients taking the drug reported fewer hot flashes, and researchers are encouraged by the early results. However, more research is needed before the medication can be approved as a breast cancer prevention mechanism, as the study focused on reducing levels of one specific protein and did not directly show reduced recurrence of DCIS or development of invasive cancer.</p>
