          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) announced that its online services will face disruption until July due to a cyber-attack that occurred last month, estimating a ¬£300m hit to this year's profits. The attack, which targeted click-and-collect and contactless payments, is attributed to the hacking group Scattered Spider, known for previous attacks on Co-op and Harrods. M&S CEO Stuart Machin stated that the company took its online system down to protect the website and customers, and is gradually restoring operations. The company plans to offset around half of the financial impact through cost reductions and cyber-insurance.</p>

          <p>President Trump has unveiled plans for a futuristic 'Golden Dome' missile defense system, aimed at countering aerial threats to the U.S., including ballistic and cruise missiles. The system will incorporate next-generation technologies across land, sea, and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors, and is inspired by Israel's Iron Dome. The initial investment is projected at $25 billion, with potential total costs reaching $175 billion over time, though some estimates suggest it could be much higher. Space Force General Michael Guetlein will oversee the project, intended to deter and defend against attacks from anywhere in the world, including space.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 05:02:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously upheld the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners who sought to restrict public access. The judgment centered on interpreting a Dartmoor by-law that grants the public access to the commons for open-air recreation. The court concluded that open-air recreation naturally includes camping, affirming the public's right to camp on Dartmoor without needing permission from landowners. This decision is expected to reignite the debate over public access to land in England.</p>

          <p>NHS England will be the first country to offer a vaccine against gonorrhea, primarily targeting gay and bisexual men with a history of multiple sexual partners or STIs, starting in August. The vaccine, originally designed for meningitis B, has shown 30-40% effectiveness against gonorrhea, and health officials hope it will reverse the soaring infection rates. The decision comes as gonorrhea is becoming increasingly difficult to treat due to antibiotic resistance, with the vaccine seen as a crucial step in protecting individuals and preventing the spread of resistant strains. The vaccine will be offered through sexual health services, along with vaccines for mpox, HPV, and hepatitis.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New regulations in the real estate industry are creating opportunities for flat-fee brokerages as agents are now required to inform buyers and sellers that their fees are negotiable. These new rules have created an opening for brokerages that charge a flat fee. Flat-fee brokers aim to lower costs for consumers, particularly on high-end homes, by charging a fixed rate instead of a percentage-based commission. While traditional agents argue their higher fees reflect a greater level of service and localized expertise, the flat-fee model is gaining traction as consumers seek more cost-effective options in real estate transactions.

In the U.S., policies promoting EVs are politically divisive, but companies are under pressure to improve their battery technology to remain competitive.

This decision was made after Downing Street deemed it unacceptable for bosses at the troubled firm to reward themselves for failure.

          <p>Tim Friede, who has allowed himself to be bitten by venomous snakes over 200 times, has developed an immunity to multiple types of venom, which could potentially aid in the development of a universal antivenom.

Existing antivenoms are specific to certain venoms, but researchers studying Friede's blood hope to synthesize a treatment effective against multiple snake bites. This innovative approach could revolutionize the treatment of snake envenomation worldwide.</p>

          <h2>Maga Catholics on Collision Course with Pope Leo XIV</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 03:00:20 EDT</div>

          <p>The election of Pope Leo XIV, the first pope from the US, has been met with skepticism from some in the Maga movement, who view him as anti-Trump and pro-open borders. However, the new pope's focus on addressing issues such as inequality, climate change, and migration may challenge the Maga worldview. Drawing inspiration from Pope Leo XIII, the new pope is expected to address the challenges of globalization and right-wing populism, potentially creating tension with Catholic Maga figures who support nationalistic and insular policies. The Pope's vision could test the compatibility of their political views with Catholic social teaching.</p>

          <h2>Tokyo to Waive Water Fees to Combat Extreme Summer Heat</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 02:46:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Tokyo metropolitan government will waive basic water utility charges for households for four months this summer to encourage residents to use air conditioning and stay cool amid increasingly extreme heat. The supplementary budget bill includes 36.8 billion yen to cover the costs, benefiting approximately 8.2 million households. This measure aims to protect Tokyo residents' lives and daily living as real wages decline and predictions indicate an extremely hot summer. Metered water usage beyond the base fee will still be charged, but households can expect to save around 5,000 yen on their water bills over the four months.</p>

          <h2>Southport Stabbing Survivor Advocates for Safer Kitchen Knives</h2>

          <p>Leanne Lucas, a survivor of the Southport stabbings, is advocating for the use of blunt-ended kitchen knives to reduce the risk of serious injuries. Motivated by her discomfort around knives following the attack, Lucas launched the 'Let's Be Blunt' campaign to promote safer alternatives. The campaign aims to drive a cultural shift towards using blunt-tipped knives, which are considered equally effective for cooking but pose a lower risk of causing harm. Lucas compares the initiative to other public safety campaigns, such as the ban on indoor smoking, emphasizing the need for increased awareness and education.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is meeting with President Trump at the White House to reset relations between the two countries, which have been strained by U.S. criticism of South Africa's policies. Ramaphosa aims to address Trump's concerns about race relations and his government's policies, including the false claim of persecution of white Afrikaner farmers. The meeting is crucial as a vital free trade agreement is at stake amid other economic concerns. Despite the challenges, Ramaphosa hopes to charm Trump and find common ground, potentially leveraging South Africa's mineral wealth to counter China's interests in the region.</p>
