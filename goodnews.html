          <p>Tiow-Gan Ong, a prominent Taiwanese chemist, has relocated from Taipei to Shenzhen, China, joining the school of science and engineering at CUHK Shenzhen this month. Ong previously held professorships at National Taiwan University, the University of Malaya, and the University of Central Florida. Six years ago, he publicly observed a "talent outflow" from Taiwan, expressing a hope for talent retention on the island. His departure underscores the ongoing trend of highly skilled professionals moving from Taiwan to mainland China, contributing to discussions about academic and scientific talent migration in the region.</p>

          <p>Datong, a city in Shanxi province, successfully averted disaster during heavy summer rains, despite almost 20 hours of upstream flood discharges, thanks to proactive infrastructure development. Over 15 years ago, former mayor Geng Yanbo spearheaded a project to widen the city’s main waterway and reinforce its banks, an initiative initially met with skepticism due to the region's low rainfall. This article highlights how this foresight proved critical, prompting discussions on the importance of long-term investment in disaster prevention. Economists suggest such spending not only enhances urban resilience but also serves as an effective short-term economic stimulus, exemplified by Beijing's recent issuance of 1 trillion yuan in sovereign debt for disaster relief.</p>

Born in Tunis in 1938 to Sicilian parents, Cardinale became an international icon, starring in over 100 films across five decades. She was renowned for her sultry gaze and became a muse for acclaimed filmmakers Luchino Visconti and Federico Fellini, gracing the screen alongside stars like Marcello Mastroianni, Burt Lancaster, Alain Delon, and Henry Fonda. Her illustrious career, which began after winning a beauty contest that took her to the Venice Film Festival, left an indelible mark on European and Hollywood cinema throughout the 1960s and 1970s.</p>

CEO Eddie Wu Yongming, also chairman of Alibaba Cloud, declared the unit's ambition to become the "world's leading full-stack AI service provider." This surge in investment reflects Alibaba's belief that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) represent a new beginning, capable of revolutionizing industries and solving global challenges. The move mirrors increased AI spending by US tech giants, like Nvidia's $100 billion investment in OpenAI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democrat Adelita Grijalva secured a congressional seat in Arizona's 7th Congressional District, succeeding her late father and further narrowing the Republican majority in the House to 219-214. Grijalva's victory was widely anticipated in the left-leaning, Hispanic-majority district, where Democrats hold a significant voter registration advantage. Her campaign platform included a commitment to fight President Trump’s agenda, such as the "Big Ugly Bill," and to immediately sign a discharge petition to release Jeffrey Epstein’s files. This win highlights the ongoing political shifts and the importance of special elections in shaping the balance of power in Congress, with two more vacancies yet to be filled.</p>

His absence impacted the Cubs' playoff positioning and aided the Reds, a rival for a wildcard spot.

          <p>The U.S. Air Force plans to replace its C-17A Globemaster III and C-5M Galaxy cargo planes with a single Next Generation Airlift (NGAL) platform by the mid-2040s. The new aircraft will prioritize greater speed, operational flexibility, and enhanced defensive capabilities against evolving threats in the air and on the ground. Air Mobility Command head Gen. John Lamontagne emphasized the need for quicker refueling times and effective countermeasures, as current airlifters face increasing risks. While the C-17 and C-5 have served for decades, the Air Force aims to proactively recapitalize these aging fleets to maintain strategic airlift superiority.</p>

          <p>Tyrique George, a 19-year-old Chelsea forward, has seized a first-team lifeline with a starring performance in a Carabao Cup comeback victory against Lincoln City, after a potential £22m move to Fulham fell through. Playing out of position as a lone striker, George scored a crucial equalizer and assisted the winning goal, impressing manager Enzo Maresca. This breakthrough comes as Chelsea has signed numerous attacking players, making George's path to the first team challenging. His dedication, including extensive extra training from a young age, has allowed him to disrupt the typical "breakthrough, loan, sale" narrative for academy graduates, offering Maresca a valuable attacking option.</p>

The dismembered body parts of a petite white woman, estimated to be 30-50 years old, were found along the Willamette River and later buried under a headstone. The case went cold in the 1950s after critical evidence went missing. State police attribute the discovery of the remains' location to the Human Identification Program and plan advanced forensic testing. Investigators determined she died from blunt force trauma, and authorities are hopeful of finally restoring her identity after nearly 80 years.</p>
