          <p>Arsenal's Bukayo Saka has been recalled to the England national football squad for upcoming matches against Wales and Latvia after recovering from a hamstring injury. However, manager Thomas Tuchel has notably excluded prominent players such as Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, and Jack Grealish from the latest selection. The decision reflects Tuchel's strategy of maintaining continuity with the team that performed well in a recent 5-0 victory against Serbia. While the exclusion of in-form players like Foden and Grealish is surprising, it signals the manager's preference for rewarding recent success and team cohesion.</p>

          <p>Direct air travel between China and India is scheduled to resume, marking a tentative step toward normalizing relations that have been strained. India's largest airline, IndiGo, announced it will restart services between Kolkata and Guangzhou, with plans for more routes pending approval. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs stated the resumption of flights is expected to enhance people-to-people exchanges between the two nations. This development is seen as a cautious but positive move aimed at gradually repairing diplomatic and economic ties after a period of heightened tension.</p>

The studio, where legendary artists like The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, and Jimi Hendrix recorded landmark albums, is being revived as both a historic site and a refurbished guitar store. The reopening began with an exhibit featuring blues legend T-Bone Walker's guitar, celebrating its rich musical heritage. The full restoration of the recording studio is expected to be completed within a year, preserving a significant piece of rock and roll history for new generations of artists.</p>

          <p>United States Men's National Team coach Mauricio Pochettino has explained his philosophy of not telling players why they have been left out of the squad, stating that they should intuitively know the reasons based on their performance. This approach was highlighted as he announced the roster for upcoming friendlies, which saw the return of players like Weston McKennie but excluded others like Yunus Musah. Pochettino emphasized that no player has a guaranteed spot for the 2026 World Cup and that his goal is to change the team's culture to one of constant performance. His strategy focuses on building a competitive, open system where selection is earned.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the WNBA Finals approach, sports writers are analyzing the matchup between the Las Vegas Aces and the Phoenix Mercury. The Aces' success is largely attributed to four-time MVP A'ja Wilson's dominant performance and the team's strong defensive identity. The Mercury, meanwhile, have been praised for their tough team defense and the resilience they've shown under second-year coach Nate Tibbetts. Pundits are split on the outcome, with some favoring the Aces' star power, while others believe the Mercury's grit could lead to an upset. A'ja Wilson and Alyssa Thomas are seen as top contenders for the Finals MVP award.</p>

          <p>In response to high violent crime rates, Memphis, Tennessee, is the first city in a Republican-led state to receive federal intervention under a plan by President Trump, including federal agents and the National Guard. While some residents and local leaders are wary of the deployment, many are exhausted by the persistent violence and willing to accept the help, regardless of the political context. Local Democratic officials are engaging with the process to ensure it benefits the community, despite criticism. The city is seen as a test case for collaboration between federal, state, and local authorities to address crime.</p>

          <p>An opinion article reflects on the evolution of passenger rail, contrasting its historical development with China's modern high-speed railway revolution. The author notes that a journey from Beijing to Xian, which once took 15 hours by overnight sleeper train in the 1980s, now takes only four hours. The piece suggests that China's massive investment and rapid expansion of its high-speed network has transformed domestic travel and should serve as an inspiration for the rest of the world. It frames the railway as a mode of transport that has moved from a "Cinderella" status to a highly efficient and modern system.</p>

          <p>Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg, 70, is abdicating after a 25-year reign, with his 43-year-old son, Guillaume, set to be enthroned as the new head of state. The transition of power in the world's last grand duchy will be marked by a ceremony at the Grand Ducal Palace attended by European royalty and political leaders. While the role of the Grand Duke is largely representative, the change in leadership is a significant event for the small but wealthy European nation. The transition began in 2024 when Grand Duke Henri expressed a desire to "slow down," ensuring a smooth succession.</p>

However, it also delves into significant criticisms, such as the tendency to promote a "genius scientist" myth that overlooks the collaborative nature of modern research. The piece highlights the prizes' historical lack of diversity, with a strong bias toward male laureates from Western institutions. While the awards successfully capture public imagination, they also face calls to be more inclusive and better reflect the global scientific community.</p>
