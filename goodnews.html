        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has signaled that President Trump's self-imposed July deadlines for finalizing trade deals are not absolute. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the dates are "not critical" and could be extended, providing more time for negotiations with the European Union and other countries. This represents a softening of the administration's previous stance, which had threatened significant tariffs if agreements were not reached. The president retains the option to impose reciprocal tariffs if he believes it would be advantageous for the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has officially announced his campaign for a third term, positioning himself as a problem-solver who stands in stark contrast to the Trump administration. In his announcement, Pritzker highlighted his administration's achievements, including seven consecutive balanced budgets, multiple state credit upgrades, and progressive legislation on issues like the minimum wage and assault weapons. He criticized President Trump's policies on trade and immigration while sidestepping questions about a potential 2028 presidential run. The campaign launch sets the stage for the upcoming gubernatorial race in Illinois.</p>

          <p>Shares of the recently IPO'd stablecoin issuer Circle experienced a significant rally, recovering from a brief downturn earlier in the week. This volatility is typical for a new public company, especially within the crypto sector, which is sensitive to regulatory speculation and Federal Reserve policy. The article notes a potential rotation of funds, as crypto exchange Coinbase, which is the main distribution platform for Circle's USDC stablecoin, saw its stock rise while Circle's temporarily fell. The performance of both companies is closely tied to the future of stablecoin regulation and interest rate decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff revealed that artificial intelligence is now responsible for automating between 30% and 50% of the company's work. In an interview, Benioff described this shift as a "digital labor revolution," allowing employees to focus on higher-value tasks. This transition reflects a broader trend in the tech industry, where companies are leveraging AI to enhance efficiency and cut costs, which has also led to workforce reductions at Salesforce and other firms. Benioff noted that while Salesforce has achieved about 93% accuracy with its AI, reaching 100% is not a realistic goal.</p>

          <p>A newly reconstituted U.S. vaccine advisory panel, appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has recommended Merck's shot, Enflonsia, for protecting infants against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to endorse the preventative antibody and include it in the government's childhood immunization schedule. This decision provides some relief to public health officials and drugmakers concerned about the new panel's direction, as some of its members are known vaccine critics who did vote against the recommendation, questioning the shot's safety.</p>
