          <p>Digital physical therapy startup Hinge Health priced its IPO at $32 per share, the high end of its expected range, raising $273 million. The company, founded in 2014, will trade on the NYSE under the ticker "HNGE" and is valued at approximately $2.6 billion, down from its $6.2 billion private market valuation in 2021. Hinge Health uses software to remotely treat musculoskeletal injuries and chronic pain, reporting a 50% revenue increase in the first quarter, reaching $123.8 million, and a net income of $17.1 million, reversing a previous loss. This IPO is significant for the digital health sector, which has struggled since the post-COVID slowdown, and signals a potential resurgence in tech IPO activity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House of Representatives passed a tax bill that includes raising the cap on the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000, up from the current $10,000 limit established by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This provision, effective in 2025, phases out for incomes over $500,000 and increases annually by 1% from 2026 through 2033. The revised text also reduces itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket. However, the House proposal faces potential challenges in the Senate, where its passage is uncertain due to possible opposition.</p>

          <p>A new tax bill includes a provision for "Trump Accounts," offering a tax incentive for early savings, similar to a 529 college savings plan. Earnings in these accounts grow tax-deferred, and qualified withdrawals are taxed at the long-term capital-gains rate. While similar to custodial brokerage accounts (UTMA/UGMA), Trump Accounts avoid the "kiddie tax" on investment income. Experts suggest that 529 plans remain superior for higher education savings due to federal tax-free growth and the ability to roll unused funds into a Roth IRA, providing more flexibility and higher contribution limits. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican-backed legislation in the House does not include President Trump's suggestion to eliminate income taxes on Social Security benefits due to reconciliation process limitations. Instead, the bill proposes an extra $4,000 deduction for filers aged 65 and older, called an "enhanced deduction for seniors," available to both itemizers and those taking the standard deduction. This deduction is effective from 2025 but expires in 2029, with a full deduction for single filers earning $75,000 or less and married couples below $150,000, phased out above those amounts. Experts warn that eliminating taxes on Social Security could weaken the program's long-term stability, potentially leading to earlier depletion of trust funds and automatic benefit cuts.</p>

The price increases will affect most Nike shoes costing over $100, with prices rising by as much as $10, and clothing and equipment prices increasing by $2 to $10.

          <p>Seniors face a complex decision on whether to invest in gold due to its high price, with potential benefits including portfolio protection during inflation and economic uncertainty. While gold can offer stability, it doesn't generate income like dividends or interest, which may not suit seniors needing regular cash flow. Alternative, lower-cost options include fractional gold investing and gold ETFs, allowing investment without owning physical gold. Experts recommend a small portfolio allocation of 4% to 9% to add protection during inflationary periods, emphasizing that gold should act as a diversifier and stabilizer rather than a core holding.
