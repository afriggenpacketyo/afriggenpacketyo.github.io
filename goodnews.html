          <p>According to U.S. President Donald Trump, Israel has accepted the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, a proposal facilitated by Qatar and Egypt. During this period, all parties would work towards a permanent end to the conflict. Trump urged Hamas to accept the deal, stating that the terms will only worsen for them if they refuse. The specific conditions of the agreement have not been detailed, and it remains unclear whether Hamas will agree to the proposal.</p>

CEO Dylan Field stated the decision to go public is intended to allow the community to share in Figma's ownership and signals the company's intent to make significant moves, including acquisitions.

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia have distinguished themselves from the rest of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks by ending the first half of the year at all-time highs. Cramer noted that Microsoft's Azure cloud business beat expectations, while Nvidia's dominance in AI chips and persistent demand fueled its rally despite early-year concerns. He attributed Meta's success to its strong advertising performance, which helped it overcome a broader decline in growth stocks. These three companies have shown remarkable resilience and strength in a challenging market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's economy has demonstrated significant resilience through a turbulent first half of the year, navigating U.S. trade policy shifts while maintaining growth toward its 5% annual target. However, analysts warn that challenges remain for the second half of the year. While diversified trade partnerships have helped offset declining shipments to the U.S., some forecasts predict that export growth will slow or even contract. This suggests that Beijing still faces an uphill battle to sustain its economic momentum through the end of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Real Madrid's decision to pay a transfer fee for Trent Alexander-Arnold, rather than wait a month to sign him for free, appears to have paid off. The right-back provided a key assist in the Club World Cup, securing the club an extra ¬£10 million in prize money, more than covering his fee. While questions about his defensive work remain, he is adapting to coach Xabi Alonso's new system and has impressed with his attacking contributions. His performance, along with the emergence of young striker Gonzalo Garcia, has provided an early boost for the team.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law a major reform of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), aimed at accelerating housing construction. The changes largely waive CEQA's extensive environmental review process for most low- and mid-rise housing projects in urban areas, removing a tool often used by opponents to delay or block development. While hurdles like interest rates and labor costs remain, this reform marks a significant political shift away from using the 55-year-old law to stifle housing. The immediate effect may be more of a revolution in the development process than a sudden construction boom.</p>
