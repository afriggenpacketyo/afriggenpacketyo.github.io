          <p>The UK government has proposed expanding the ban on destructive bottom trawling in English waters to protect marine ecosystems. The proposal would increase the protected area from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 and covers 41 of the UK's 178 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). This announcement comes as the UN Ocean Conference begins in France, with warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the damaging effects of bottom trawling. A 12-week consultation period will seek input from the marine and fishing industry before implementation.</p>
