          <p>Elon Musk announced the end of his tenure as a "special government employee" leading President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), expressing gratitude to Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. Musk's departure follows his criticism of Trump's budget bill, which he believes undermines DOGE's efforts to cut spending. Despite stepping down, Musk affirmed that the DOGE mission to streamline government operations will persist. Musk had previously indicated his intention to dedicate more time to his companies, including Tesla and SpaceX, and less time to government work.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts directed the Trump administration to lift a pause on various immigration applications, stating that it is not in the public interest for immigrants to lose their legal status. The ruling is a reprieve for immigrants from Afghanistan, Latin America, Ukraine, and other regions whose ability to remain and work in the U.S. was threatened. The judge agreed with pro-immigrant advocates that the government's actions were arbitrary and capricious, violating federal administrative law. The programs affected by the order rely on a legal immigration authority known as parole, which allows temporary admission on humanitarian or public interest grounds.</p>

          <p>Yuichiro Tamaki, head of the Democratic Party for the People in Japan, faced criticism after referring to government rice stockpiles as "animal feed in a year." Tamaki was referencing reserve rice from 2021 that the government plans to release to curb soaring prices. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi called Tamaki's remark unfortunate, especially as the government works to release the rice effectively. Rice prices in Japan have hit record highs, increasing 98.4 percent from the previous year, prompting the government to intervene with stockpiled rice.</p>

          <p>Salesforce reported better-than-expected quarterly results and provided seemingly strong guidance, yet the market response was muted as investors analyzed the driving factors behind the improved outlook. While revenue and adjusted earnings per share exceeded expectations, Salesforce is benefiting from a weaker U.S. dollar, which provides an on-paper advantage. The company is seeing progress on AI, with combined annual recurring revenue for Data Cloud and Agentforce exceeding $1 billion. Salesforce's acquisition of Informatica was also a point of discussion, with executives highlighting its strategic importance for AI initiatives (not investment advice).</p>
