          <p>A group of Gen Z activists from the organization Generation Life are advocating for chastity before marriage as a solution to the perceived problems of modern dating culture. The article follows them on the Jersey Shore as they engage with peers, linking their message to the negative mental health effects of social media and the objectification it encourages. Rather than a purely religious argument, they frame chastity as a form of self-respect and a way to build deeper, less transactional relationships in a hyper-sexualized world.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is progressing well in his recovery from a left knee bone bruise and is expected to return sooner than the initial six-week timeline. The injury occurred during a play at third base but fortunately did not result in surgical-level damage. Muncy has already begun running, playing catch, and taking swings without significant discomfort. His return is seen as crucial for the Dodgers' offense, which has struggled to score runs during his absence from the lineup.</p>

Key economic reports on consumer and producer prices showed inflation trending in the right direction, but ongoing trade uncertainty continues to weigh on investor sentiment.

          <p>According to NYU professor and self-made millionaire Scott Galloway, the advice to "follow your passion" is a misleading platitude often given by those who are already wealthy. He argues that true career success is not found by blindly pursuing a passion, but by identifying something you have a talent for that is also commercially valuable in the market. Galloway suggests that finding the intersection of your skills and what society is willing to pay for is a much more effective strategy for building a successful and financially stable career.</p>
