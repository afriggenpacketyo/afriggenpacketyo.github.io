          <p>Africa's engagement in space science has evolved from simply hosting foreign infrastructure to developing its own technology tailored to continental needs, such as improving agriculture and connectivity. The newly inaugurated African Space Agency (AfSA) in Cairo aims to foster collaboration among nations with varying levels of space program maturity, from established players like Egypt and Nigeria to newer ones like Kenya and Rwanda. This intensified activity, supported by partnerships with Europe and significant investment from China, marks a new chapter for the continent's ambitions in space application.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence reflects on the fifth anniversary of the Abraham Accords, arguing they represent a historic achievement in Middle East peace born from a policy of strength and American leadership. He asserts that the accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab nations, have proven resilient even through recent conflicts and have fostered significant economic and social ties. Pence criticizes the Biden administration for not expanding the circle of peace and urges the Trump administration to prioritize bringing Saudi Arabia into the agreement.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to receive a rare second state visit to the United Kingdom, an honor extended by King Charles through Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Trump's well-known fascination with the British royal family is seen by the UK government as a key diplomatic lever to influence him on important issues like support for Ukraine. Despite Trump's unpopularity in the UK, which is expected to draw protests, the visit is viewed as a strategic use of "soft power" centered on royal pomp and circumstance to strengthen the bilateral relationship.</p>

          <h2>Experts Debunk Claims of Magnesium Lotion as a Sleep Aid, Citing Lack of Evidence</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Magnesium lotion has become a popular social media trend, with influencers claiming it improves sleep and remedies various ailments when applied to the skin. However, dermatologists are skeptical, stating there is little scientific evidence that magnesium can be effectively absorbed through the skin, which acts as a barrier. Experts suggest that any perceived benefits likely stem from the act of massaging the lotion or from the placebo effect, and while the lotion is probably harmless, proven medical treatments exist for specific conditions like restless legs syndrome.</p>

          <p>President Trump's upcoming state visit to Windsor Castle, his second to the UK, is steeped in royal protocol, a complex etiquette system that has tripped up past world leaders. The visit, which includes a carriage procession and state banquet, is seen as a "royal charm offensive" by the UK government to strengthen ties, leveraging Trump's known affinity for the monarchy. While such visits are about reinforcing alliances, public and media attention will be high, scrutinizing every interaction for potential protocol breaches or meme-worthy moments, similar to his 2019 visit.</p>

          <p>Following the successful IPO of Swedish payments company Klarna, investors are looking to other major private fintech firms that might soon go public, such as Stripe, Revolut, and Monzo. While digital payments giant Stripe opted for a secondary share sale earlier this year, a future public listing remains a possibility. Digital banks Revolut and Monzo have also seen their private valuations soar, and though their CEOs have been cautious about timing, they are widely considered strong candidates for a stock market debut in the near future.

The deal is expected to unlock billions in private investment and includes plans for US and UK companies to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool. This partnership will also support projects like nuclear-powered data centers, with both governments framing the collaboration as the start of a "golden age of nuclear" that will create jobs and enhance energy security.</p>

Central bank data shows that deposits at non-banking financial institutions, such as brokerages and mutual funds, surged for a second consecutive month in August. This capital rotation is driven by investors seeking better returns, as the earnings yield from major listed companies significantly outperforms the returns from government bonds and traditional savings accounts.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is exploring a plan to convert its retiring coal-fired power plants into nuclear facilities, a strategy that could accelerate its transition to clean energy. The "C2N" initiative, proposed by a top state-owned energy company, would involve replacing coal boilers with fourth-generation molten salt reactors while preserving existing infrastructure like turbines and grid connections. This approach could offer a direct path to decarbonization, especially in coastal areas, and may face fewer hurdles with site safety requirements and public acceptance compared to building new nuclear plants from scratch.</p>
