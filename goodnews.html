          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed a minimum 20% reduction in the number of four-star generals and admirals across the military. The directive, outlined in a memo to senior Pentagon leadership, aims to streamline leadership and optimize the military's effectiveness by removing unnecessary bureaucratic layers. Hegseth emphasized the need to shift resources from bloated headquarters to warfighters, questioning the necessity of the current number of top military officers compared to previous eras. The cuts are expected to be carried out expeditiously, though a specific timeline was not provided in the memo.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study suggests that the Haenyeo, female divers from Jeju Island in South Korea, may have developed genetic adaptations due to their generations-long diving practices. Researchers found that the Haenyeo exhibit lower blood pressure and enhanced cold-water tolerance, potentially protecting pregnant divers from high blood pressure complications. These adaptations, along with a non-genetic adaptation of a slower heart rate, could offer insights for developing new medical treatments. The Haenyeo's evolution highlights how cultural practices can drive genetic changes in isolated populations, similar to observations made by Darwin in the Galapagos Islands.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and India have formalized a bilateral trade agreement, reducing tariffs on key exports such as UK whisky and cars. This agreement occurs during a period of increasing global trade tensions, largely stemming from tariff policies initiated by the United States. The deal will gradually eliminate most tariffs on traded goods within a decade, with significant cuts to automotive tariffs and halving tariffs on spirits, aiming to strengthen economic ties between the two nations.</p>
