          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, which will allow taxpayer money to be used to help qualifying students pay for private school tuition. Most students attending an accredited private school will receive $10,000 per year, with additional funds for students with disabilities and home-schooled students. Supporters of the bill claim it ensures that students have the freedom to seek the educational option that is right for them, while critics argue it will hurt public schools by siphoning funds to wealthier students already in private schools.

          <p>China's coffee market is experiencing rapid growth, with approximately 12,000 net new coffee shops opening in the past year.
