          <p>South Korea's defense ministry has announced the suspension of its "Voice of Freedom" propaganda radio broadcasts directed at North Korea. This move is the latest in a series of de-escalation efforts by President Lee Jae Myung's new administration to improve relations with the nuclear-armed North. The program, which has been on and off since 1962, broadcasted outside information and K-pop music into the heavily restricted country. Despite these gestures, which also include dismantling loudspeakers at the border, North Korea has so far shown little interest in reciprocating.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United has agreed to a £55 million deal to sign forward Yoane Wissa from Brentford, following the player's public request to leave the club. The deal, which includes an initial £50 million fee plus £5 million in add-ons, comes as Newcastle seeks to strengthen its attack after selling Alexander Isak to Liverpool. Wissa, 28, accused Brentford of unfairly blocking his move despite receiving fair offers. The transfer marks a significant move for Newcastle, which is looking to fill the void left by its departing star striker.</p>

          <p>The final phase of England's largest-ever childcare support expansion has begun, offering working parents 30 hours of government-funded care for children aged nine months to four years. While the government claims the scheme will save parents thousands, many are facing long waiting lists and staff shortages at nurseries, limiting access. Some parents are taking extreme measures, such as scheduling C-sections before a term deadline to ensure earlier eligibility. Providers also warn that government funding rates are insufficient, forcing them to charge for extras like meals and nappies to cover costs.</p>

          <p>Employees at Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon national parks have voted overwhelmingly to unionize, with results certified last week. The move comes after the Trump administration initiated mass firings and proposed a $1 billion budget cut for the National Park Service, leading to rock-bottom morale and fears of job insecurity among staff. Workers, who will be represented by the National Federation of Federal Employees, cited long-standing issues like low pay and poor living conditions, which have been exacerbated by recent policies. The unionization effort aims to provide job protections and a platform for workers to advocate for better conditions.</p>

          <p>The Altadena Town & Country Club, a century-old community landmark in Southern California, has reopened its doors nearly eight months after being destroyed in the Eaton fire. The establishment served not only its members but also the wider community as a venue for fundraisers, meetings, and local events, and was a significant local employer. The reopening celebration brought together hundreds of residents, offering a sign of hope and healing for a community where many lost their homes and are still displaced. Officials and members hope the club's revival will inspire the broader recovery effort in the fire-ravaged area.</p>

          <p>A group of women, many of them professional welders, are volunteering to restore the SS Red Oak Victory, the last surviving ship built at the Kaiser Shipyard in Richmond, California, during World War II. Inspired by the "Rosie the Riveter" legacy, these modern-day Rosies are working to repair the historic vessel, which has fallen into disrepair. The project aims to honor the millions of women who contributed to the war effort by taking on industrial jobs traditionally held by men. The restored ship is intended to become a more prominent museum piece near the Rosie the Riveter National Historical Park.</p>

          <p>California's university and community college systems are partnering with major tech companies like Google and Microsoft to provide free artificial intelligence training for students and teachers. The initiative, announced by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to equip the future workforce with essential AI skills as the technology begins to replace certain entry-level jobs. While the deals provide access to valuable tools and resources, some educators express concern about the rapid, untested implementation of AI in classrooms and the potential for faculty to lose control over curriculum. The partnerships also raise questions about potential conflicts with existing anti-plagiarism software used by the schools.</p>

The inaugural piece is a commissioned 27-foot-long photo sculpture by artist Todd Gray, titled “Octavia Butler’s Gaze,” which will greet visitors at the entrance. The installation process involves drilling into the new building's signature concrete walls and applying a unique mineral-based glaze to create colored surfaces, a departure from traditional painted drywall. This marks a significant milestone for the new museum space, which is scheduled to open to the public in April 2026.</p>

          <p>A portion of the defunct Westside Pavilion mall in Los Angeles has been transformed into a luxury apartment complex, with residents beginning to move in this week. The 201 luxury units, named Overland & Ayres, were built on the site of a former Macy's parking structure. This redevelopment is part of a broader trend of repurposing "dead malls" that have been unable to compete with online shopping and modern outdoor lifestyle centers. The rest of the former mall is being converted by UCLA into a major research facility, reflecting a shift in urban land use from retail to housing and institutional purposes.</p>

          <p>Norwegian state-backed oil company Equinor has pledged nearly $1 billion in new capital to support Denmark's Orsted, the world's largest offshore wind developer. The move is a show of confidence in Orsted, which has been struggling financially and facing political attacks on its U.S. projects from the Trump administration. Equinor, Orsted's second-largest shareholder, stated its support reflects confidence in the future of offshore wind. The investment comes as the Trump administration continues to undermine the industry, recently canceling federal funding for infrastructure projects supporting offshore wind power.

          <p>A U.S. district court judge has issued a temporary restraining order to block the Trump administration from deporting dozens of unaccompanied migrant children back to Guatemala. The emergency injunction was sought by advocacy groups who argued the children would be at risk of abuse and that the action violated laws protecting minors who arrive in the U.S. alone. The Trump administration and Guatemala's president claimed the flights were for family reunification, not deportation. The ruling highlights the ongoing legal and political battles over the administration's sweeping efforts to remove undocumented migrants from the country.</p>

The move, which follows a previous pilot scheme, is expected to result in significant savings for commuters, with some ticket prices falling by nearly 50%. The policy aims to encourage more people to switch from cars to trains, providing environmental benefits and financial relief for travelers. The annual cost of the subsidy, estimated at £40-45 million, will be covered by the ScotRail budget if not offset by increased passenger numbers.</p>

This breakthrough in thermoelectric conversion could pave the way for self-charging wearable devices, such as smartwatches, eliminating the need for bulky batteries. The material harnesses the temperature difference between the human body (around 37°C) and the surrounding air to generate a constant power supply. According to the researchers' paper in *Nature*, this is the first high-performance thermoelectric material to achieve true elasticity, not just flexibility.</p>
