          <p>International Business Machines (IBM) experienced a significant stock drop despite reporting second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. The company's software revenue grew by 10%, slightly missing analyst consensus, while consulting and infrastructure revenue both beat forecasts. CEO Arvind Krishna noted that some clients are acting cautiously due to geopolitical tensions, but expressed optimism about future M&A opportunities in a rational regulatory environment. IBM maintained its full-year guidance for revenue growth and free cash flow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a comprehensive AI Action Plan designed to maintain U.S. dominance in the field of artificial intelligence. The plan includes over 90 policy actions, such as supporting the construction of data centers, expediting semiconductor plant programs, and modernizing the electrical grid. It also aims to eliminate "ideological bias" in AI by setting new rules for government contractors and withholding funds from states with what it deems burdensome regulations. The initiative also establishes a program to export AI packages to U.S. allies.</p>

          <p>Alphabet reported second-quarter results that beat Wall Street's revenue and earnings expectations, driven by strong performance in its search and cloud divisions. Despite the positive results, the company announced it will increase its 2025 capital expenditure forecast by $10 billion to a total of $85 billion, primarily to support growing demand for its cloud and AI services. The report also highlighted significant growth in YouTube advertising revenue and the user base for its AI Overviews and Gemini AI chatbot. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Exploring the American Origins of the Globally Understood Word "OK"</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 17:27:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The word "OK" is one of the most universally recognized terms, originating as a joke in 19th-century America. Scholars trace its first appearance to an 1839 Boston newspaper, where it was used as a playful, misspelled abbreviation for "oll korrect" (all correct). The term gained widespread popularity during President Martin Van Buren's 1840 reelection campaign, as his nickname "Old Kinderhook" aligned with the "O.K." initials. Its simplicity and versatility helped it spread globally, especially with the rise of telegraphy and its use by American soldiers abroad.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Considers Eliminating Capital Gains Tax on Home Sales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 17:26:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has indicated that his administration is considering a proposal to eliminate capital gains taxes on the sale of primary residences. Currently, profits exceeding $250,000 for single filers or $500,000 for joint filers are subject to this tax. The idea follows the introduction of the "No Tax on Home Sales Act" by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, which aims to unlock equity for long-term homeowners and address housing shortages. While the National Association of Realtors supports reform, experts suggest that raising the existing exemption is more likely than a complete elimination of the tax. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators, including Republicans Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, is backing legislation to shield U.S. small businesses from President Trump's tariffs on Canadian imports. The bill, named the CANADA Act, comes as the administration threatens a blanket 35% tariff on goods from Canada, the largest export partner for many states. Supporters of the bill argue that the tariffs harm small businesses that rely on cross-border trade by driving up costs and threatening jobs. The legislation specifically targets tariffs announced earlier this year.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>"Corn sweat" is the informal term for the moisture released by vast fields of corn through a process called evapotranspiration, which significantly increases humidity during hot, sunny weather. While a natural process for plants to cool themselves, the immense scale of corn cultivation in the Midwest can make heat waves feel more oppressive and dangerous, raising the heat index. This heightened humidity can offset the natural cooling effect of transpiration and prevent temperatures from dropping at night, increasing the risk of heat-related illnesses for vulnerable populations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes whether a 6-month certificate of deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account is a better option for a $10,000 deposit in the current economic climate. While a high-yield savings account offers flexibility, its variable interest rate is likely to decrease with anticipated rate cuts. A 6-month CD, conversely, offers a slightly higher, guaranteed interest rate, ensuring a predictable return for those who can afford to lock their money away for the term. The calculation shows the CD would likely earn more guaranteed interest over the six-month period. (not investment advice)</p>
