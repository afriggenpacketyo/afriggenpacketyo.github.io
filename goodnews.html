Diamondback Energy (FANG) is another highlighted stock, with RBC Capital analyst Scott Hanold citing the company's focus on free cash flow generation and shareholder returns as positive factors. The analysts' recommendations are based on in-depth financial analysis and the companies' ability to pay dividends. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's national police chief, Dieter Romann, has provided a positive initial assessment of the tightened border controls, dismissing concerns about overburdened personnel. Since September 2024, Germany reintroduced temporary checks at its land borders, reinforcing personnel with nearly 1,200 colleagues. Romann rejected the notion that personnel would be withdrawn from other operational areas, such as train stations, for border controls. The announcement comes as several states in Germany are also dealing with severe storms. The storms and border controls are separate events.</p>

          <p>Top U.S. universities, often divided by internal strife, are finding common ground in opposition to the Trump administration's policies targeting higher education. Measures such as defunding research, increasing endowment taxes, and dictating admissions and faculty appointments have united faculties, students, donors, and alumni. This newfound unity is seen as essential to repel what many view as an overreach of federal power. The administration's actions, initially supported by some seeking to address issues like antisemitism, are now widely regarded as draconian and harmful to students, faculty, and research initiatives. The events have sparked concerns about the future of academic freedom and the sector's global standing.</p>

          <p>A video of French President Emmanuel Macron's wife, Brigitte, touching his face during a public appearance has sparked debate and amusement. The incident occurred as the couple arrived in Hanoi, with the √âlys√©e Palace initially claiming the video was a deep fake before acknowledging it as a playful interaction. The event provided a distraction from the more serious political challenges facing the Macron administration. The Macrons' relationship has long been a subject of public fascination due to their age difference and unconventional beginnings, and the president has tried to make light of the incident.</p>

          <p>The late William F. Buckley Jr. played a significant role in American political and intellectual life for nearly half a century. He was the architect of the modern conservative movement, an author of numerous books, and a pioneer in media. His TV program, Firing Line, invented the talking-head cable-news programs of today. Buckley was also a discoverer and nurturer of talented young writers, and his magazine, National Review, was a platform for some of the best American writers and critics. He had a unique ability to engage with people across party lines and was known for his wit and intellectual curiosity.</p>
