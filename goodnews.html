          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's deployment of federal troops for law enforcement operations in Los Angeles was unlawful. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer issued an order prohibiting the troops from engaging in activities such as crowd control, arrests, and security patrols. The judge determined that the action violated the Posse Comitatus Act and effectively created a "national police force." The order is delayed until September 12 to allow the administration time to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has acquired a $4 billion stake in PepsiCo, signaling a push for significant changes at the consumer goods giant. In a letter to the board, Elliott outlined an agenda to restore business momentum and unlock shareholder value, calling it a "historic opportunity" to revitalize the company. Following the news, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, PepsiCo's shares jumped by 4% as investors anticipate a potential turnaround plan driven by the influential activist firm.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that former President Donald Trump's administration acted unlawfully by deploying federalized National Guard troops for domestic law enforcement in California. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer found that the action violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a historic law that restricts the use of the military for civilian policing. While the immediate impact is limited as most troops have since been demobilized, the ruling sets a significant precedent regarding presidential authority and is likely to be appealed by the administration.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage rates hovering near 7%, prospective homebuyers face the dilemma of whether to lock in a rate now or wait for a potential drop. Financial experts suggest that borrowers who have already found a home and are under contract should consider locking in their rate to protect against market volatility. However, those with more flexibility or who are actively working to improve their credit score might benefit from waiting, as a potential Federal Reserve rate cut could lead to lower borrowing costs later in the year.

          <p>Marc Rowan, CEO of Apollo Global, contends that the traditional investment model, particularly the 60/40 stock-and-bond portfolio, is no longer effective for diversification in the modern economy. He argues that public markets are now dominated by a handful of mega-cap tech stocks and passive indexing, which limits their ability to reflect the broader market's strength. Rowan suggests that investors should increasingly turn to private markets and alternative investments like private credit to achieve genuine diversification and potentially higher returns.

          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler, a veteran New York Democrat and the longest-serving New Yorker in the House, has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026. Citing the "necessity for generational change," the 78-year-old former House Judiciary Committee chairman stated his decision was influenced by a desire to pass the torch to new leadership within the Democratic party. First elected in 1992, Nadler played a key role in both impeachments of former President Donald Trump and has been a prominent figure in progressive politics for decades.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are pointing to a "golden opportunity" for some investors to pay 0% on long-term capital gains, thanks to new deductions in recent tax legislation. The 0% bracket applies to individuals and couples below certain taxable income thresholds, which more people may fall into due to higher standard deductions and other tax breaks. This allows for strategies like "tax-gain harvesting," where profitable assets can be sold tax-free during lower-income years to rebalance portfolios or reset an asset's cost basis for future tax savings.

This transition towards computational models and human-cell-based systems, known as "new approach methodologies," promises to make the drug development process faster, cheaper, and more ethically sound.</p>

His victory signals a leftward shift for the party as it aims to attract voters feeling politically homeless and disillusioned with the current government and opposition.</p>
