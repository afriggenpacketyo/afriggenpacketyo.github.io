The judge ruled that immigration officers acted unlawfully and that the embryos posed no threat.  Petrova's colleagues testified about her valuable cancer research. The Department of Homeland Security claims Petrova lied about the embryos, citing phone messages.  Petrova maintains she didn't realize the embryos needed to be declared.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has risen significantly since early 2024, exceeding $3,400 per ounce.  Several factors could drive further price increases in June: slowing inflation progress, interest rate pauses, and rising geopolitical tensions.  Investors may consider fractional gold, dollar-cost averaging, or gold ETFs to mitigate the high current price. Predicting the price with precision is difficult, but several factors suggest potential for further increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump defended his trade policies, denying accusations of "chickening out" on tariff threats.  He argues his actions are part of a negotiation strategy, citing the EU's willingness to meet after his tariff announcements.  Trump's recent delay of a 50% tariff on EU imports caused a stock market rally.  He credits the tariff threat with jumpstarting trade talks between the U.S. and the EU.</p>
