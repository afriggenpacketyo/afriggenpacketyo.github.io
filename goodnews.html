        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House clarified that President Trump's announcement regarding "Victory Day for World War I" on November 11 will be an additional proclamation and not a renaming of Veterans Day. The clarification came after Trump's initial social media post suggesting a full replacement, and also stating his intent to designate May 8 as "Victory Day for World War II". According to the Congressional Research Service, establishing a federal holiday or patriotic observance requires the passage of a law.</p>

          <h2>Biden Aides Considered Cognitive Test Before Election, Book Reveals</h2>

          <p>A new book reveals that Joe Biden's staff discussed the possibility of him taking a cognitive test before the 2024 election, but ultimately decided against it due to concerns it would raise further questions about his mental acuity. The book details that the discussion occurred in February 2024, months before Biden's poor debate performance against Donald Trump led to intense pressure for him to step down in favor of Kamala Harris. Harris subsequently lost the presidential election to Trump, resulting in the former reality TV star's second term.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists excavating the Basilica of St. Stephen in Rome discovered a deteriorated stone head depicting a Roman deity within the church's foundation. The statue head, featuring curly hair and a beard, is believed to be an ancient religious symbol predating the fifth-century basilica. The artifact will undergo documentation and restoration at the Central Institute for Restoration in Matera, with students involved in the process. The discovery is expected to enhance understanding of the historical and artistic context of the Appia Antica territory during the late antique period.</p>

          <p>This article features a collection of digitized photographs from 1902, taken by the Miles Brothers, documenting life in Alaska's Copper River Valley during the Klondike Gold Rush era. The photographs offer a glimpse into the rough conditions of the Valdez Trail, the landscape, and the lives of newly arrived residents and Alaska Natives. The collection, digitized from an album at the U.S. National Archives, provides a historical record of daily life in the Alaskan interior nearly 125 years ago.</p>

          <p>China is expediting the construction of its Burning Plasma Experimental Superconducting Tokamak (Best), a nuclear fusion reactor, aiming to achieve net energy generation by 2027. The project, now in its final assembly phase in Hefei, involves assembling tens of thousands of components. Chinese officials claim mastery of core technologies, both scientifically and technically, and emphasize the project's rapid progress, dubbed "China speed". The completion of this reactor would be a significant step toward commercializing nuclear fusion as a clean energy source.</p>

Musk celebrated the decision on social media, while some nearby residents have voiced concerns about the company's environmental impact. The city's government will consist of a mayor and two commissioners, with Bobby Peden, a SpaceX vice-president, serving as the first mayor.</p>

          <p>Sarah Snook stars in a one-person adaptation of Oscar Wilde's "The Picture of Dorian Gray," now on Broadway, exploring the dangers of image obsession in the age of social media. The play uses smartphones and elaborate camerawork to highlight the gap between false perfection and reality, showing how the act of deception becomes a source of pleasure for Dorian. The article contrasts this adaptation with "Vanya," another one-person show, to examine the different ways we imagine ourselves as characters in the modern world, and when performing a persona becomes a perversion of truth.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the ethical responsibilities of scientists in a world increasingly shaped by technology, referencing a conversation between Werner Heisenberg and Friedrich von Weizs√§cker after the bombing of Hiroshima. The authors argue that scientists have a duty to ensure their discoveries are used for good and to engage with the public and policymakers. They highlight ethical dilemmas posed by AI, biotechnology, advanced medical procedures, and climate change, and emphasize the need for scientific education and communication to inform public debate and policy decisions.</p>
