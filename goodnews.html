          <p>Christy Walton, a Walmart heiress, placed a full-page advertisement in the New York Times promoting the "No Kings" protest against President Trump, scheduled for June 14th. The ad lists declarations emphasizing values such as honoring commitments, defending against dictators, and supporting a healthy economy. The protest is intended to divert attention from the military parade in Washington, D.C., planned for the same day. Walmart has distanced itself from Ms. Walton's actions, stating that she does not serve on the board or play any role in decision-making at Walmart.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert and therapist emphasizes the importance of acknowledging fathers, especially those facing challenges, on Father's Day. The expert argues that the phrase "You should step it up" is harmful and suggests offering support and recognition instead. The article underscores that no father dreams of being away from their child and that parenting is a team sport requiring support systems. The expert also suggests reframing negative self-perceptions to promote healing and connection.</p>

          <p>USA Fencing's board of directors voted to amend its policy that prioritized states with LGBTQ-friendly laws for host sites, now prioritizing cost, safety and convenience. They also changed the policy preventing the playing of the national anthem at some events, now implementing a uniform national anthem policy. The decision follows criticism for punishing a fencer who refused to fence a trans opponent, including scrutiny from federal lawmakers. The organization is also preparing to change its transgender inclusion policy, requiring athletes to compete according to their biological sex.</p>

          <p>A group of Nobel laureates, scientists, writers, and artists issued an open letter warning of the resurgence of fascism, drawing parallels to the rise of fascism in Italy a century ago. The letter calls on those who value democracy to defend democratic institutions, challenge abuses of democratic principles, and uphold facts and evidence. They argue that democracies provide the best framework for addressing social injustices and fulfilling the post-war promises of human rights. The letter emphasizes the importance of international cooperation and multilateralism in maintaining a global legal order.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite surging tensions following Israeli strikes on Iran, market watchers believe Tehran is unlikely to retaliate by targeting the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil artery. Blocking the strait would disrupt global oil flows but could trigger further retaliation and draw backlash from China, Iran's largest oil customer. Analysts suggest that disrupting the channel could be more of a bane than a boon for Tehran, given how most of Iran's daily consumption goods come via that route. It is more likely that Iran would find alternative routes to demonstrate its displeasure with the current state of affairs.</p>

          <p>Summer Fridays, once a popular perk, are increasingly rare as more companies adopt flexible working arrangements. As work-from-home Fridays become more common, fewer employers offer shortened workweeks during the summer months. However, employees still value summer Fridays as the most desirable summer benefit, followed by summer hours and flextime. A survey found that 84% of workers are not offered any summer-specific benefits, even though 55% believe those benefits improve productivity.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a breakthrough in commercially extracting rubidium directly from salt lake brine, potentially reducing dependence on imports. The new method produces ultra-pure rubidium chloride from ultra-low concentrations, offering a domestic source for this strategically vital material. Rubidium is widely used in the electronics, specialty glass, and aerospace sectors, with military, technological, and civilian applications. This development could have significant implications for China's rare metals industry.</p>
