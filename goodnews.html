          <p>The UK economy grew by 0.7% at the start of this year, exceeding expectations and leading the G7 in growth rate. This growth was fueled by strong spending on services such as retail, hospitality, and finance. However, experts caution that the tariffs imposed by the U.S. may slow growth in the coming months, even with a recent trade deal between the UK and the U.S. This article reports on economic trends and is not investment advice.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez are closer to potential freedom after Governor Newsom withdrew his request for a clemency investigation, converting a scheduled parole hearing into an opportunity for early release. The move follows a judge's resentencing of the brothers to terms of 50 years to life, making them immediately eligible for parole. The brothers will have to demonstrate accountability for their crimes and convince commissioners they are unlikely to re-offend.

          <p>Marcus Rashford believes Manchester United would be prepared to sell him for ¬£40m, but his high salary may pose a challenge for potential buyers. While he had a significant impact on Villa's run to the Champions League quarter-finals, there have been no negotiations over a permanent transfer. The Rashford camp do not believe current United head coach Ruben Amorim wants to restore the player to his squad, while minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has previously spoken about his frustration at some of the team's highest earners not being on the pitch.
