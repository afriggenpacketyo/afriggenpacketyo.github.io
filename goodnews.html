          <h2>Texas Senate Bill Aims to Block Hostile Foreign Powers from Acquiring Land</h2>

          <p>Texas lawmakers are advancing Senate Bill 17, designed to prevent entities tied to countries like China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from purchasing land in Texas, particularly near critical infrastructure. Representative Cole Hefner emphasizes that the bill targets actions and affiliations, not ethnicity, focusing on protecting Texans from foreign espionage and influence. The law empowers the state's attorney general to investigate and block land deals posing risks to public health or safety, with exemptions for U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. SB17 is set to take effect Sept. 1, and Hefner hopes it will inspire a nationwide effort to secure the homeland.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 22:18:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hollywood studios are increasingly shifting film productions to the UK, attracted by generous tax incentives and lower labor costs. In 2024, 65% of UK production spending came from major US film studios and streaming giants, amounting to ¬£1.37bn, nearly a 50% increase from the previous year. The UK's Film Tax Relief offers a 25% tax rebate, making it cheaper to produce films compared to the US, where incentives operate on a state level. Films like Jurassic World: Dominion saved millions by shooting in the UK, highlighting the financial benefits driving this trend.</p>

          <p>Google will pay Texas $1.4 billion to settle claims that the company collected users' data without permission, according to the state's attorney general. The settlement resolves claims related to geolocation, incognito searches, and biometric data, with Texas arguing Google unlawfully tracked and collected users' private information. Google states the agreement settles old claims, some of which relate to product policies the company has already changed, and that no new product changes are required. This is the largest settlement won by any state against Google over data-privacy violations.</p>

          <p>Google has agreed to pay $1.4 billion to the State of Texas to settle lawsuits accusing it of violating the privacy of residents by tracking their locations, searches, and collecting facial recognition information. Attorney General Ken Paxton brought the suits in 2022 under Texas laws related to data privacy and deceptive trade practices. The lawsuits focused on the Google Photos app, the Nest camera, and Google Assistant, alleging the collection of biometric data without consent and misleading practices regarding location data and Incognito mode. Google has stated that it has already changed its product policies.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched towards Venus in 1972 but stranded in Earth orbit due to a rocket malfunction, is expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. Experts predict the re-entry will occur, but the exact location remains unknown, with its orbit placing it between 52 degrees north and south latitude. The spacecraft, designed to withstand Venus's atmosphere, may survive its re-entry, but the risk of injury on the ground is low. If pieces are recovered, they legally belong to Russia.</p>

          <p>California public health officials have issued an annual statewide quarantine on sport-harvested mussels due to the risk of naturally occurring toxins. The quarantine, effective through October 31, warns against eating mussels harvested along the West Coast due to potential paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid biotoxins. Biotoxins occur when algae bloom, causing shellfish to accumulate toxins in their tissue. Commercially grown mussels are exempt from the quarantine as they are regularly tested for toxins.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, has been released from ICE custody after a federal judge ordered her release on bail. Ozturk was detained in March after her visa was revoked by the Trump administration, allegedly due to her political speech. Judge William Sessions criticized the government for lacking evidence against her, noting the case rested solely on an op-ed she co-wrote. Ozturk's legal team argued she was targeted for criticizing the university's response to resolutions related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
