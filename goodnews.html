          <p>The U.S. Attorney for Maryland has informed the Department of Justice that there is insufficient evidence to charge Senator Adam Schiff with mortgage fraud. This development comes after President Trump publicly called for Schiff's criminal prosecution. Despite the prosecutor's assessment, a senior Justice Department official is reportedly pushing to keep the investigation active. Schiff's attorney previously dismissed the allegations as "transparently false" and "long debunked," indicating a continued political dimension to the probe.</p>

          <p>Industry experts at the 11th Global Blockchain Summit anticipate that increased collaboration between Hong Kong and mainland China could significantly advance the cryptocurrency sector. Hong Kong leads in crypto regulation, while the mainland excels in fintech development, including digital payments and AI. Despite the central government's long-standing ban on many crypto activities on the mainland, both markets are expected to gain from shared initiatives. Organizations like the Solana Foundation are already investing in China's developer ecosystem, highlighting the region's importance in the global payments industry.</p>

          <p>Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, announced that the company will not develop artificial intelligence services for "simulated erotica," diverging from OpenAI's recent stance. Suleyman expressed concerns about the creation of "seemingly conscious" AI, particularly in erotica-focused services, deeming it "very dangerous." This statement underscores a potential tension in Microsoft's relationship with its longtime partner OpenAI, which recently indicated it would allow verified adults to use ChatGPT for erotica. Microsoft continues to focus on its own AI services, launching new features for its Copilot chatbot.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that bullish investors typically prevail in the long run, advising against panic selling despite current market anxieties. He argues that government shutdowns historically have not significantly impacted the market, and fears regarding US-China tensions are often overblown. Cramer also notes that initial earnings season reports indicate tariffs have been factored into company valuations, and major financial institutions show low loan default rates. He emphasizes viewing the market as a collection of companies for investment rather than a series of coin flips. (not investment advice)</p>
