          <p>AI computing company CoreWeave has announced it will acquire data center provider Core Scientific in an all-stock deal valued at approximately $9 billion. The acquisition is a strategic move to strengthen CoreWeave's position in the AI sector by vertically integrating critical infrastructure, including 1.3 gigawatts of power capacity. This deal is expected to eliminate future lease obligations and enhance operational efficiency for CoreWeave. Following the announcement, Core Scientific's stock fell sharply, while CoreWeave's saw a smaller decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has begun to outline the platform for his newly announced "America Party," indicating it will be strongly pro-Second Amendment and supportive of Bitcoin. In posts on his social media platform X, Musk affirmed that "The Second Amendment is sacred" and that the party would embrace Bitcoin because "fiat is hopeless." He also endorsed a platform centered on free speech, reduced regulation, fiscal responsibility, and modernizing the military with AI. The move represents Musk's effort to create a new force in American politics, challenging the traditional two-party system.</p>

          <p>Bishop T.D. Jakes, a prominent faith leader, is stepping down as the senior pastor of The Potter's House, the Dallas megachurch he founded nearly 30 years ago. He officially installed his daughter, Sarah Jakes Roberts, and her husband, Toure Roberts, as the new co-senior pastors. The transition, which has reportedly been planned for years, follows a health incident in 2024 where Jakes suffered a heart attack. Jakes will continue his work as chairman of the T.D. Jakes Foundation and head of his entertainment and publishing enterprises.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to extend bereavement leave to include parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy. Currently, statutory leave is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. The proposed change, which is under consultation, would provide at least one week of unpaid leave, recognizing the emotional impact of early pregnancy loss as a form of bereavement rather than just sick leave. Advocates, including MP Sarah Owen and campaigner Myleene Klass, have praised the move as a significant step in acknowledging the grief of affected families.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to maintain high interest rates through July but potentially cut them later in the year, savers are questioning whether now is the right time to open a certificate of deposit (CD). Experts suggest that locking in a CD rate soon could be advantageous, as banks may lower their rates in anticipation of future Fed cuts. However, the decision depends on individual financial situations, including liquidity needs and savings goals. Advisors recommend strategies like CD laddering to balance the benefits of high fixed rates with the need for access to funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to communication experts, a well-executed apology from a leader can build trust, whereas a poor one can erode it. Citing recent corporate examples, consultant Lorraine K. Lee emphasizes that effective apologies require taking full responsibility, showing genuine empathy, and presenting a clear plan for rectification. Timing is critical; leaders should acknowledge issues promptly and follow up with a thoughtful response. The key is to sound human and vulnerable without making the apology self-serving, as audiences connect with the leader, not just the brand, fostering a culture of trust.</p>

          <p>Netflix has successfully lured numerous acclaimed directors, such as Martin Scorsese and Greta Gerwig, away from traditional studios, despite its limited commitment to wide theatrical releases. The streaming giant accomplishes this by offering lucrative contracts, significant creative freedom, and access to its vast global subscriber base of over 300 million. This strategy has made Netflix a haven for auteur filmmakers whose projects may be considered too expensive or risky for conventional studios. By prioritizing subscriber content over box office revenue, Netflix saves on marketing costs while still producing award-contending films.</p>

The Dodgers, inspired by her work, have installed a similar tile wall in their clubhouse and included a plaque crediting Bennett as the inspiration.
