          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order approving a deal to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new joint-venture company. The new entity, valued at $14 billion, will be overseen by American investors including Oracle, Silver Lake, and the Abu Dhabi-based MGX fund, with parent company ByteDance retaining less than a 20% stake. This arrangement addresses national security concerns by placing the app's security and data under U.S. control, averting a potential ban that was mandated by Congress.</p>

With U.S. homeowners holding record levels of equity, the lower rates present a timely opportunity for financing, especially as further rate cuts are anticipated later this year.

Historically, the team that dominates the first day has gone on to win, making a fast start crucial for Europe's chances of winning on U.S. soil. Other critical elements will be the European team's ability to manage the notoriously boisterous New York crowd, the influence of experienced players, and how each captain's strategic decisions play out under pressure.</p>

It explores archival pieces, including Ginsberg's 1966 essay advocating for marijuana and coverage of his influence on literary movements in Calcutta. The piece contrasts his explosive, counter-cultural work like "Howl" with the more formal poetry of his father, Louis Ginsberg, creating a portrait of a complex and influential figure who championed the dispossessed and pushed cultural boundaries.</p>

Ukrainian officials offered mixed reactions; some see it as a positive signal that Trump recognizes Russia's weakness, while others are skeptical, believing it is a way for the U.S. to distance itself from the conflict. Political analysts suggest the change may stem from a realization that Russian President Putin is not a reliable partner for a peace deal, though they caution against excessive optimism.</p>
