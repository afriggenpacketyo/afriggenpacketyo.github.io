          <p>Undefeated British heavyweight boxer Moses Itauma, 20, is set for the most significant fight of his young career as he faces veteran Dillian Whyte in Saudi Arabia. Itauma, who has an impressive record of 12 wins with 10 knockouts, is seen as a major rising star in the division with a style that draws comparisons to champion Oleksandr Usyk. A victory against a well-known opponent like Whyte would significantly elevate Itauma's profile and potentially position him for a future world title shot. The fight is considered a critical test to see if the highly-touted prospect can live up to the considerable hype surrounding him.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing trend in business and marketing involves celebrities bypassing traditional retail models to create their own companies and sell products directly to their fanbases. This direct-to-consumer approach allows stars to leverage their personal brands and social media reach to build dedicated customer communities. Musician John Legend, who launched his own skincare brand, is one of many public figures capitalizing on this strategy. The shift reflects a change in consumer behavior, where audiences are often more influenced by the personalities they follow than by conventional advertising, creating new opportunities for celebrity-led enterprises.</p>

          <p>In 1968, Nathaniel Estes established a plumbing business in Denver's Five Points neighborhood, which grew to become more than just a local enterprise. Over the years, his company evolved into a vital institution and a pillar of support within the area's Black community. The business not only provided essential services but also created opportunities and served as a stabilizing presence in the neighborhood. Estes's story illustrates how a small, locally-owned business can have a profound and lasting impact on the social and economic fabric of the community it serves.</p>

          <p>South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung has announced his intention to restore a 2018 military agreement with North Korea in an effort to reduce tensions along their shared border. The pact, which was suspended last year, includes measures like creating buffer zones and no-fly zones to prevent accidental clashes. Speaking on the anniversary of Korea's liberation, Lee stated his government would take proactive steps to rebuild trust, citing the recent cessation of propaganda broadcasts and leaflet balloon launches. He urged Pyongyang to reciprocate these efforts and return to dialogue, though the North's response remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>As hosts of the Women's Rugby World Cup, England's Red Roses are the overwhelming favorites to claim the title, having lost only once in their last 58 matches. The team has dominated the sport, securing six consecutive Six Nations Grand Slams and sitting comfortably atop the world rankings. Their only recent major defeat was a narrow loss to New Zealand in the 2022 final, a result they have since avenged multiple times. Head coach John Mitchell acknowledges that managing the immense pressure of home-field expectation will be as crucial as their on-field performance when the tournament kicks off.</p>

          <p>Defining what constitutes a living organism presents complex scientific and philosophical challenges, as explored by developmental biologist Crystal Rogers.

The discussion delves into the standard biological checklist for life, such as growth, reproduction, and response to stimuli. It also considers how these definitions might be tested by future technological advancements and hypothetical scenarios, such as those famously debated within the context of science fiction like 'Star Trek'.</p>

          <p>According to Carlsberg's CEO, current economic pressures are causing a bifurcation in consumer beer-drinking habits, with sales volumes declining for mid-range core brands. Drinkers are increasingly choosing either premium, high-end beers or more affordable economy options, squeezing the market for traditional mainstream products. This trend reflects a broader 'spending pause' among global consumers, where selective splurging on treats coexists with budget-conscious purchasing. The shift is also favoring at-home consumption over more expensive outings to bars and restaurants, presenting both challenges and new opportunities for major brewers.</p>

          <p>Achieving quality sleep can be challenging, particularly during summer heatwaves, but several evidence-based strategies can help. Daily exercise is proven to increase sleep duration and quality by boosting melatonin production and reducing stress. It is also advisable to avoid caffeine in the afternoon and evening, as its effects can linger for many hours and disrupt natural sleep cycles. Reducing screen time before bed is crucial, as the light and mental stimulation can interfere with the body's ability to wind down, with reading a book being a recommended alternative for better sleep hygiene.</p>

The ruling found that the Department of Education acted unlawfully when it threatened to withhold federal funding from institutions that continued DEI initiatives. The judge determined that the guidance, which broadly interpreted a Supreme Court ruling on admissions, created a "sea change" in regulation and illegally chilled protected speech.

The operation involves female police officers running undercover in plain clothes in targeted areas, with uniformed colleagues nearby to intervene and educate perpetrators. An officer participating in the campaign described the behavior as making her feel "horrible" and "icky," highlighting the negative impact it has on women's sense of safety. The initiative was prompted by a local survey where 94% of female residents reported experiencing harassment, yet nearly half never reported it.</p>
