        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump, during a speech in Saudi Arabia, denounced Western intervention and nation-building, a statement met with applause from his audience but also skepticism from some observers. He asserted that the U.S. would no longer lecture other nations on how to live, urging the people of the Middle East to chart their own destinies. While some welcomed the shift away from perceived American overreach, others worried about the potential consequences of reduced U.S. pressure on human rights issues. Trump's remarks came at the start of a tour through Gulf Arab states focused on business deals and diplomatic objectives, including urging Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel and seeking a deal with Iran over its nuclear program.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved a plan to raise the minimum wage for hotel and airport workers to $30 per hour by 2028, despite warnings from business leaders about potential job losses and a slowdown in tourism. The proposal also mandates additional healthcare contributions for workers. Supporters argue that the wage increase will benefit low-income workers and boost the local economy, while opponents contend that it will force businesses to cut staff, reduce operations, and deter future investments in the city. The vote reflects a significant victory for labor unions and underscores the ongoing debate over wage policies in the tourism industry.</p>

While Newsom has proposed some cuts to the program, including capping enrollment and adding a monthly premium, he emphasized the state's commitment to supporting its undocumented residents. The move highlights California's distinct approach to immigration and healthcare policy and sets the stage for a potential clash with the federal government.</p>
