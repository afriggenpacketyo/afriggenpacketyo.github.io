          <p>Authorities in Dresden, Germany, have ordered the evacuation of approximately 17,000 people to facilitate the defusal of a 250-kilogram British bomb from World War II. The unexploded ordnance was discovered during demolition work on the Carola Bridge, a site where another bomb was found earlier in the year. The evacuation zone includes numerous hotels and the city's historic Frauenkirche, a major tourist landmark. This event highlights the lingering dangers of WWII, as unexploded bombs are still regularly found across Germany, requiring large-scale safety operations.</p>

          <p>According to an analysis by JPMorgan, HSBC is expected to maintain the highest dividend yield among banks in the Greater China region, projecting shareholder returns between 9% and 11% for the year. The forecast follows HSBC's announcement of a second-quarter dividend and a $3 billion stock buyback plan. Analysts believe these shareholder returns are secure, as the bank holds a significant capital buffer that can absorb potential impairments from its stake in China's Bank of Communications (Bocom). JPMorgan subsequently raised its price target for HSBC's stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Exploring the Untapped Tactical Potential of the Football Throw-In</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 03:02:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores why the throw-in remains one of football's most underdeveloped tactical elements, despite the brief era of Rory Delap's famously long throws for Stoke City. It argues that teams could gain a significant advantage by training players to specialize in long, flat throws, similar to how set-piece coaches have revolutionized corners and free-kicks. The analysis highlights that since the offside rule does not apply to throw-ins, there is vast potential for creating set plays and exploiting defensive vulnerabilities. The piece questions the "snobbery" that associates long throws with unsophisticated football, suggesting innovation is long overdue.</p>

          <p>U.S. artificial intelligence leader OpenAI has launched two new open-source AI models, GPT-OSS-120b and GPT-OSS-20b, marking a significant shift in its strategy. CEO Sam Altman described the models as "the best and most usable" in the world, positioning them to compete directly with a growing number of popular open-source models from China, such as Alibaba's Qwen family. This move represents a return to OpenAI's origins, as its last open model was released in 2019. The release is seen as a strategic challenge to China's current dominance in the sheer volume of available open-source AI.</p>

          <p>China's campaign to resolve local government debt has achieved its first major success, with the Inner Mongolia autonomous region being removed from a list of 12 high-risk jurisdictions. The achievement was announced in a local budget review, which emphasized the need to consolidate this progress and continue debt resolution efforts. The region, a key producer of coal and renewable energy, had previously been forced to halt major infrastructure projects like a subway system due to financial risks. This development is a positive signal for Beijing's broader strategy to control and restructure debt in high-risk areas across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent decision by Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit to end his pursuit of an NFL career highlights the immense challenges crossover athletes face. Experts point to several key obstacles, including the complexity of learning an NFL playbook, which one former player described as more difficult than studying for the bar. Another factor is the "planet theory," which posits that there is a surplus of athletes with the speed and skill for positions like wide receiver, making it harder to stand out. In contrast, athletes with rare size for lineman positions, like Jordan Mailata, are often given more specialized attention and time to develop.</p>

          <h2>China Increases Coffee Imports from Africa, Driven by a Growing Market and Zero-Tariff Policies</h2>

          <p>China is actively strengthening its coffee supply chains from top African producing nations like Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Uganda, driven by a booming domestic coffee culture and favorable zero-tariff policies for certain African goods. Chinese companies, such as the rapidly expanding Cotti Coffee, are signing agreements to invest in local coffee industries and procure thousands of tons of beans annually. Analysts view this as a strategic move by China to "lock in supply" and leverage uncertainty in global trade, securing new sources for its growing consumer market while fostering economic ties with African partners.</p>

          <p>McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown has expressed confidence that the Formula 1 title fight between his drivers, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, will not lead to a serious falling out. Acknowledging that the teammates will likely "swap paint again," Brown believes the mutual trust, respect, and open communication within the team will prevent any bad blood from developing. With Norris closing in on Piastri's championship lead, Brown stated the team plans to proactively manage any growing tension and has already discussed how to handle the emotional outcome when one driver ultimately wins the title and the other loses.</p>

          <p>Max Muncy made a powerful return to the Los Angeles Dodgers lineup, driving in four runs and hitting two home runs in a 12-6 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. His performance provided a much-needed spark for the team, which had struggled offensively during the month he was sidelined with a knee injury. Muncy's comeback, which occurred two weeks ahead of schedule, is seen as a crucial boost for the Dodgers, who were relatively quiet at the trade deadline. The win also featured strong offensive contributions from other slumping hitters, suggesting a potential turnaround for the team's lineup.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks extended their winning streak, securing a 100-91 victory over a formidable Indiana Fever team that was playing without its injured star, Caitlin Clark. The Sparks, who have now won seven of their last eight games, were powered by strong performances from Kelsey Plum and Rickea Jackson, who each scored 25 points. With their full roster finally healthy, the Sparks are building momentum and chemistry as they push for a playoff berth. The game was briefly interrupted when a sex toy was thrown onto the court, the third such incident in the WNBA in a week.</p>

          <p>The NFL and ESPN have entered into a nonbinding agreement that would see ESPN acquire the NFL Network, NFL Fantasy, and distribution rights for the RedZone channel. In exchange, the NFL will receive a 10% equity stake in ESPN, a deal estimated to be worth over $2 billion. The move is expected to significantly bolster ESPN's upcoming direct-to-consumer streaming service by adding more high-value football content. While the deal still requires final negotiations and regulatory approval, it marks a major strategic shift, transforming the NFL from a media licensee into a direct platform partner with ESPN.</p>

          <p>China is facing a rocket shortage that is creating a divide between national space priorities and local ambitions as it races to build satellite internet constellations to rival SpaceX's Starlink. The state-backed Guo Wang project appears to be receiving priority access to the country's reliable Long March rockets, having launched three batches of satellites in a single week. This has left other ambitious projects, like Shanghai's Qianfan constellation, turning to private rocket companies to deploy their satellites. The competition for limited launch capacity may force Beijing to officially favor one candidate to lead its challenge against Starlink.</p>

          <p>The city of Hiroshima marked the 80th anniversary of the world's first atomic bombing with a solemn ceremony, including a moment of silence at the exact time the bomb was dropped on August 6, 1945. Survivors, families, and officials gathered at the peace memorial park, with the ruins of the Genbaku Dome as a backdrop. Hiroshima's mayor warned against the growing acceptance of nuclear weapons and global military buildup, calling on the world to learn from history's tragedies. Representatives from about 120 countries attended, as leaders like Pope Leo XIV and the UN Secretary-General issued statements on the urgent need for nuclear disarmament.</p>
