          <p>Dario Amodei, CEO of AI startup Anthropic, has responded to David Sacks, President Trump's AI and crypto czar, regarding claims that the company promotes 'woke AI' policies. Amodei stated Anthropic aligns with the Trump administration on key AI policy areas and seeks collaboration across the political spectrum to ensure AI benefits Americans. The controversy arose after a co-founder's essay sparked debate on AI regulation, with Sacks accusing Anthropic of a 'regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering.' Amodei clarified the company's preference for a uniform federal approach over fragmented state laws.</p>

        </div>

          <p>Weighted vests are gaining popularity as a fitness trend to intensify workouts, but medical experts advise caution regarding their use. Dr. Jon LaPook notes that while vests can increase calorie burn and heart workload, individuals with underlying health conditions should consult a doctor due to the added stress. Studies on bone health benefits are inconclusive, but they may help prevent falls by strengthening muscles, provided the vest doesn't cause imbalance. Users should start with 5% of their body weight, wear it briefly, and ensure proper fit to avoid joint stress.</p>

          <p>General Motors (GM) stock surged over 15% after the automaker exceeded Wall Street's Q3 earnings and revenue expectations, prompting an increase in its 2025 financial guidance. GM's adjusted earnings per share reached $2.80 on $48.59 billion in revenue, with adjusted EBIT at $3.38 billion. The company raised its adjusted EBIT outlook to $12-13 billion and adjusted EPS to $9.75-$10.50, signaling confidence in its trajectory. Despite a $1.6 billion special charge related to its EV pullback, GM's CEO Mary Barra thanked President Trump for tariff updates, while CFO Paul Jacobson noted only 40% of EVs are currently profitable.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance issued a stern warning to Hamas, stating that the U.S.-brokered Gaza peace plan requires the organization to disarm and 'behave itself.' Speaking at the newly opened Civilian Military Cooperation Center (CMCC), crucial for the ceasefire deal, Vance reiterated President Trump's earlier threat of 'fast, furious and brutal' obliteration if Hamas fails to cooperate. He expressed confidence in the durability of the peace but underscored the necessity for Hamas to cease internal violence and adhere to the agreement's clear terms. The message emphasizes the administration's resolve to enforce the peace accord.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Pancho Villa: World Champion, 1923," profiles Francisco "Pancho Villa" Guilledo, the first Filipino boxer to win a world title in 1923. Artist Joe Aquilizan and Professor Dr. Bernard Remollino co-authored the book, drawing from Aquilizan's extensive collection of memorabilia. Villa's career, marked by 90 wins and a reputation for speed and power, challenged racial perceptions in the 1920s. His historic flyweight championship victory opened doors for future Filipino fighters like Manny Pacquiao. Villa's career was tragically cut short when he died at 24 from an infection after a dental procedure.</p>
