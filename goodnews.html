          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The ruling prevents the Department of Homeland Security from ending the program in September, stating the administration lacks the authority to partially vacate a TPS designation before its scheduled expiration in February 2026. The judge noted that migrants have built lives in the U.S. based on the existing timeline, while the administration argued conditions in Haiti have improved sufficiently for their return.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has implemented the nation's toughest law regulating PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," largely due to the advocacy of Amara Strande, who died from cancer at age 20. "Amara's Law" will phase out the manufacture and sale of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032, addressing a public health crisis linked to the chemicals. Strande's powerful testimony before her death galvanized lawmakers to act, creating a lasting legacy aimed at protecting communities from environmental contamination.</p>
