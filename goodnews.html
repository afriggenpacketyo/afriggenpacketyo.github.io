The company's stock rose significantly following the announcement, reflecting investor confidence in its position within the evolving digital finance landscape. This growth occurs within a more favorable U.S. regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies, with Circle planning to launch a new proprietary blockchain called Arc.

The company hopes the popular attraction will boost the overall visitor rate to the venue, which currently sits around 7% of Las Vegas tourists.

          <p>Paraguayan lawmakers are considering a new law to encourage the local assembly of electronic and digital goods using imported parts, many from China. The proposal aims to create jobs and diversify the economy by allowing companies to brand these products as "Made in Paraguay." Officials see this as a strategic opportunity to become an attractive assembly hub, capitalizing on recent U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods and similar levies on Brazilian exports. The policy would mirror Paraguay's successful automotive strategy, which has led to 90% of motorcycles being assembled domestically.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is working to finalize the legal and mechanical details of a deal imposing a 15% export tax on specific Nvidia and AMD AI chips sold to China. This arrangement allows the companies to receive export licenses for their China-specific chips in exchange for a portion of the revenue paid to the U.S. government. A White House spokesperson confirmed the Department of Commerce is ironing out the implementation and suggested the policy could potentially expand to other companies in the future. However, trade law experts have raised questions about the legality of such a fee for export licenses.</p>
