          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge advises parents to delay giving children smartphones and social media access for as long as possible to foster better mental health and future success. She recommends starting conversations about responsible technology use at least six years in advance, ideally in late elementary school. Twenge suggests two primary actions: first, proactively teach children about online privacy and the value of their time away from screens. Second, establish and enforce firm rules, such as using parental controls, banning phones from bedrooms overnight, and starting with a basic, non-internet-connected phone to build healthy habits.</p>

          <p>Michael Berkowitz, a former commodities trader, successfully launched the luxury coat brand Norwegian Wool from his Bronx apartment with an initial investment of $50,000 of his own money. He identified a market gap for stylish, high-performance wool coats suitable for cold winters, a niche that traditional Italian fashion houses and functional arctic-wear brands overlooked. After testing his first prototype in a supermarket's walk-in freezer, Berkowitz built a profitable company that now sells its products in over 100 stores, including Saks Fifth Avenue. The brand has gained a following among financiers, politicians, and celebrities, and was even featured in the HBO show "Succession."</p>

          <h2>Warren Buffett Explains His Preference for Productive Assets Over Gold</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warren Buffett detailed his investment philosophy, categorizing assets into three types and explaining why he avoids investments like gold. He described the first category as currency-denominated assets like bonds, which he views as a bet on government stability that typically lose value over time. The second category, which includes gold, consists of non-productive assets that investors buy hoping someone else will pay more later, a speculation he compares to a chain of hope. Buffett stated his preference for the third category: productive assets like farms or businesses, which generate tangible value and returns, making their intrinsic worth independent of daily market fluctuations.

          <p>Cities across the globe, including New York, London, and Montreal, are increasingly redesigning streets to prioritize cycling, leading to cleaner air, quieter neighborhoods, and healthier residents. By implementing infrastructure like protected bike lanes, safer intersections, and bicycle-specific traffic signals, urban cycling is shifting from a high-risk activity to a safe and practical mode of transportation for all ages. This movement is further propelled by the rise of e-bikes, which expand the accessibility of cycling. While challenges like pedestrian safety and cultural resistance from drivers persist, the trend marks a significant step toward more sustainable and people-friendly urban environments.</p>

          <p>Marissa Coreno, an Ohio woman, was diagnosed with Stage II breast cancer at age 27 after discovering a lump in her armpit, a symptom she initially dismissed due to her age and lack of family history. Her story highlights a rising trend of breast cancer diagnoses in women under 50, who often face more aggressive tumors and are too young for routine mammogram screenings. After undergoing extensive treatment including chemotherapy, a double mastectomy, and radiation, Coreno is now cancer-free and advocates for young women to be vigilant about their health. She emphasizes that early detection is crucial and that life after treatment can be beautiful and fulfilling.</p>

          <p>Retail giants like Target and Walmart are experiencing a significant boom in trading card sales, with the category becoming a major driver of revenue ahead of the holidays. The resurgence in popularity, particularly for Pokémon and sports cards, is fueled by Millennial and Gen Z consumers who are driven by nostalgia and, in some cases, view the cards as alternative investments. Target reported that its trading card sales are up nearly 70% year-to-date and are expected to exceed $1 billion in annual revenue. This low-tech pastime's consistent, non-seasonal demand makes it an attractive category for retailers looking to offset risk.</p>

          <p>The Nikon Small World 2025 photomicrography competition showcases a series of stunning images that reveal the intricate and often surprisingly beautiful structures of everyday objects when viewed under a microscope. The photographs transform familiar items into abstract art, displaying vibrant colors and complex geometric patterns that are invisible to the naked eye. This collection serves as a reminder that perception is limited and that a hidden world of complexity exists just beyond our normal range of vision. The images challenge viewers to guess the subject matter before revealing the microscopic reality.</p>

          <p>Several high-profile figures from England's successful women's football setup, including former general manager Anja van Ginhoven and technical director Kay Cossington, are leaving the Football Association for Bay Collective, a new U.S.-based multi-club ownership group. This move signals a significant talent drain from the established European structure to a new, well-funded American enterprise focused exclusively on the women's game. Van Ginhoven compared the move to shifting from a slow-moving "tanker" to a nimble "speedboat," highlighting the appeal of building a progressive and sustainable ecosystem for women's football from the ground up with fewer bureaucratic constraints.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Pew Research Center analysis of federal data reveals that two-thirds of Americans who get divorced eventually remarry, with men being slightly more likely to do so than women. The study highlights the significant financial benefits of remarriage; the median household wealth of remarried adults is comparable to those in their first marriage and substantially higher than that of divorced, single adults. While divorce rates have generally declined since the 1980s, the phenomenon of "gray divorce" among those over 50 has been an exception, though even that rate has recently leveled off.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comprehensive guide for the millions of Americans acting as caregivers for ill or elderly adults, drawing on advice from nearly 600 people with firsthand experience. It offers practical wisdom on navigating the complex U.S. healthcare system, adjusting to the "new normal" of a caregiving life, and the critical importance of asking for and accepting help to avoid burnout. The guide emphasizes that true self-care for caregivers is not about luxuries but about setting boundaries and protecting one's own mental and physical health.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that the anti-Trump "Resistance" movement, often dismissed by critics as "cringe" for its earnestness, is a powerful and necessary antidote to the cynicism of the MAGA movement. While aesthetics like pink hats drew mockery, the underlying idealism about democracy and the rule of law fueled effective on-the-ground organizing that contributed to Democratic victories in 2018 and local successes. In an era of authoritarian threats, the article contends that sincere, idealistic belief in American institutions is not naive but a crucial tool to combat the nihilism that allows such movements to thrive. True resistance combines this belief with concrete, community-based action.</p>
