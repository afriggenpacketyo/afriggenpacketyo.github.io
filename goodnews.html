          <p>Actress Aimee Lou Wood, star of "The White Lotus," has publicly stated she does not regret calling out a viral Saturday Night Live sketch that poked fun at her teeth and accent. Wood, 31, described the April skit as "mean and unfunny," and views her decision to speak out as a crucial step in breaking a personal pattern of silence against bullying. She emphasized that she is happy for her personal journey of self-advocacy, regardless of any "chaos" that followed. SNL bosses reportedly apologized for the sketch, which some viewers criticized as misogynistic.</p>

          <p>Dr. Gladys Maestre's research in South Texas has uncovered alarmingly high rates of memory loss, affecting nearly 20% of people over 65, potentially reaching 40%, significantly exceeding the national average of 12%. Her study, conducted through the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, is exploring various contributing factors, including genetic predispositions, health issues like diabetes, environmental pollution, and generational trauma and poverty. While the reasons remain unclear, the impact is profound for families. Texas lawmakers have overwhelmingly approved a $3 billion bill to fund dementia research over the next decade, awaiting voter approval.</p>

          <p>An Oregon couple and other electric vehicle buyers faced distress when their car dealership failed to file necessary IRS paperwork, nearly costing them thousands in federal EV tax credits. The article highlights a widespread issue where dealerships neglect a "time-of-sale report," jeopardizing buyers' eligibility for the $7,500 new EV credit or $4,000 used EV credit. Consumers are urged to diligently follow up on all documentation to ensure they secure these incentives, as the federal EV credit is expected to expire on September 30. The National Auto Dealers Association issued a reminder about proper paperwork.</p>

          <p>Matthew McConaughey revealed he maintained an "eight-year period" of short, unsubstantial conversations with his mother, Kay, due to her tendency to share personal information with the media. This "hiatus" began after she gave a tour of his childhood home without his consent, leading to details appearing in the news. McConaughey explained that he eventually lifted the restriction once he felt more secure in his fame, now allowing his mother to speak freely and even tell "raunchiest stories." The two are set to co-star in the upcoming film "The Lost Bus," where she plays his mother, showcasing their reconciled relationship.</p>
