The Arene system powers the multimedia system, voice agent, center display, and advanced safety technologies in the new RAV4.

          <p>An analysis of the second episode of the TV anime "Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX" explores a surprising plot twist where Char Aznable captures the Federation's white mobile suit, Gundam. This act of seizing an enemy's weapon during battle is known as "capture" in military terms. The article speculates on the reasons behind this unexpected turn of events, highlighting the differences in character interactions and trust compared to the original "First Gundam" series. The analysis suggests that small changes in the storyline can lead to vastly different outcomes, which may be a key theme of the series.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously upheld the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners who sought to restrict public access. The ruling centers on the interpretation of the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, affirming that the public has a right of access to the commons for open-air recreation, which includes camping. This decision is expected to reignite the debate over public access to land in England, where Dartmoor National Park is a rare exception to the general lack of wild camping rights on private land. The court emphasized that public regulation of land use is more effective than private challenges.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has unveiled plans for a "Golden Dome" missile defense system, aimed at countering next-generation aerial threats to the U.S., including ballistic and cruise missiles. The system would consist of advanced technologies across land, sea, and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors. The plan is partly inspired by Israel's Iron Dome, but would be much larger and designed to combat a wider range of threats, including hypersonic weapons. The initial investment is projected at $25 billion, with a total cost of $175 billion over time, although some estimates suggest it could be much higher.</p>

The virus is typically found in birds and transmitted by mosquitoes, with rare cases of transmission to humans. The UKHSA has stated that the risk to the general public is very low, but advice will be issued to healthcare professionals.</p>

          <p>The charity Women in Sport is calling for urgent action from sports leaders to address the barriers that prevent young black girls from accessing and staying involved in sports. A new report indicates that black girls are less likely to participate in sports despite having higher aspirations to become elite athletes. Racism, misogyny, and inflexible sporting structures contribute to 48% of black girls "falling out of love" with sport during their teens. The charity recommends better representation, diversity training, enforcement of anti-discrimination policies, and more community initiatives to support black girls in sports.</p>

This reflects Japan's gradual departure from pacifism following World War II, encouraged by the U.S. and European partners. Amid threats from China, North Korea, and Russia, Japanese firms are increasingly seeking military business and partnerships, including the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP) jet fighter project with Britain and Italy.</p>

The National Association of Realtors settled a lawsuit that has ushered in new policies, including requiring agents to inform clients that fees are negotiable. Flat-fee brokerages are gaining traction by charging a fixed amount for their services, potentially saving clients thousands of dollars. However, traditional commission-based agents argue that their higher fees are justified by the level of service and expertise they provide. (not investment advice)</p>
