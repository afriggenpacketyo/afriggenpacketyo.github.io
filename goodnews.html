Cramer pointed out the favorability of subscription model businesses, citing Netflix, Spotify, and Cintas, with the latter's success signaling a positive outlook for the broader economy. He advises considering buying these stocks if they drop 5 to 8% from their current levels (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that anti-discrimination laws apply equally to all employees, regardless of their majority or minority status. The justices rejected the view that members of a majority group must present more evidence of discrimination to win a lawsuit. The ruling revives a lawsuit brought by Marlean Ames, who claimed she was discriminated against by a lesbian supervisor. Experts say the decision may lead to more "reverse discrimination" lawsuits surviving motions to dismiss in some regions. </p>
