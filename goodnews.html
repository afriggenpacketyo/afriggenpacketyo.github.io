          <p>Tech billionaire Peter Thiel's venture capital firm, Founders Fund, has disclosed a 9% stake in the ether treasury company Bitmine Immersion Technologies, causing its shares to surge. This investment has also lifted the stock of similar companies focused on Ethereum. The move comes amid a broader wave of interest in Ethereum, fueled by new stock trading options in Europe and renewed optimism about the potential passage of a U.S. stablecoin bill, which has also contributed to a rally in the price of ether itself.

          <p>An insurance program in Ahmedabad, India, offers financial protection to informal workers, like waste pickers, who lose income during extreme heatwaves. The parametric insurance, a collaboration between a women's union and a nonprofit, automatically pays out when temperatures exceed a set threshold, providing a crucial safety net. This initiative helps workers avoid taking on high-interest loans and manage expenses without risking their health by working in dangerously hot conditions.</p>

          <p>Westinghouse's interim CEO informed President Trump of the company's plan to construct ten AP1000 nuclear reactors in the United States, with construction to begin by 2030. This announcement aligns with a recent executive order by Trump aiming to quadruple U.S. nuclear power by 2050. The plan is ambitious, given that the last two similar reactors built in Georgia faced significant budget overruns and delays, which contributed to the company's past bankruptcy.</p>
