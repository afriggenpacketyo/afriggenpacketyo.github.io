          <h2>California Governor Proposes Pause on Immigrant Health Care Expansion Amid Budget Deficit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 21:00:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed pausing the expansion of state-funded health care benefits to low-income immigrants without legal status starting in 2026 due to a $12 billion budget deficit. The decision is driven by higher-than-expected program costs and economic uncertainty, although Newsom insists California remains committed to supporting immigrants. Under the proposal, new applications for Medi-Cal will be halted, and existing enrollees may face a $100 monthly premium starting in 2027. The changes are estimated to save the state $5.4 billion by 2028-2029, as California grapples with the financial strain of recovery from wildfires and federal tariff policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with Ahmad al-Sharaa, Syria's interim president and former Islamist militant, after announcing the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria. The meeting signifies a potential shift in U.S. foreign policy, aiming to normalize relations with the new Syrian government to curb Iranian influence. Trump urged al-Sharaa to deport Palestinian terrorists, prevent the resurgence of ISIS, and invest in Syrian oil and gas. The decision to lift sanctions has drawn criticism and calls for caution from some, who emphasize the need for congressional approval and coordination with allies, particularly Israel.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 20:19:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced, their lawyer argued that the culture and politics of the 1990s, including punitive sentencing policies, unfairly influenced their original trial. The defense highlighted the media's mockery of the brothers' claims of sexual assault, which may have prejudiced the jury. Today, a more sympathetic view of sexual assault victims and a greater focus on rehabilitation have fueled renewed interest in the case, with social media campaigns and documentaries contributing to a shift in public perception. The case underscores how societal attitudes and legal strategies evolve over time, potentially impacting the outcomes of criminal proceedings.</p>

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States experienced a significant decline last year, marking the strongest indication yet of progress against the opioid crisis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a nearly 27% drop in drug fatalities nationwide. However, these gains are threatened by proposed budget cuts to federal health programs, including those addressing addiction. Experts warn that these cuts could undermine ongoing efforts to combat the crisis and reverse the positive trend.</p>
