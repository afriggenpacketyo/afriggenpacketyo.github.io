          <p>Preliminary government data reveals that migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border reached a new historic monthly low in June, with just over 6,000 recorded. This significant decrease continues a lull in illegal immigration that the Trump administration credits to its aggressive policies, including swift deportations and a halt to migrant releases. The figures stand in sharp contrast to the record-high numbers seen during the previous administration, with officials noting that no migrants were released into the U.S. for a second consecutive month. The administration has also increased interior enforcement and promoted a self-deportation program.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Israel has accepted the necessary conditions for a two-month ceasefire in its war with Hamas, urging the group to accept the deal. While the president did not provide specific details of the proposal, he stated that Qatar and Egypt would deliver the final terms to Hamas. Neither Israeli nor Hamas officials have publicly commented on the agreement, which aims to end the 21-month conflict that began with Hamas's attack in October 2023. Previous efforts for a ceasefire have stalled, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has maintained he will not end the war until Hamas is defeated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France has enacted a comprehensive ban on smoking in most public areas, including beaches, parks, and near schools, in a major public health initiative. The new law aims to "denormalize" smoking and combat the 75,000 tobacco-related deaths that occur in the country annually. Violators of the ban face fines starting at 135 euros, though an initial grace period is expected. Despite previous bans in restaurants and bars, over 30% of French adults still smoke, a rate higher than in many other European nations. The one remaining refuge for smokers, caf√© terraces, remains a point of contention for both business owners and patrons.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has implemented the nation's strictest state law regulating PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," which are linked to serious health issues like cancer. The legislation, informally named "Amara's Law," is a tribute to Amara Strande, who advocated for the ban while dying from liver cancer at age 20. The law will phase out and ultimately eliminate the manufacture and sale of nonessential PFAS products by 2032. 3M, the company that developed and manufactured the chemicals, has agreed to pay the state $850 million for cleanup and will cease PFAS production by the end of the year.</p>

Nvidia overcame concerns about competition, rallying hard due to persistent, unrivaled demand for its AI semiconductors. Meanwhile, Meta's stock surged after its quarterly earnings demonstrated the exceptional strength of its advertising business, overcoming an earlier decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's economy has demonstrated considerable resilience through a turbulent first six months of 2025, navigating US trade policy shifts while maintaining steady growth toward its 5% annual GDP target. However, analysts warn that significant challenges lie ahead for the second half of the year. While diversified trade partnerships have helped offset declining shipments to the US, some forecasts predict that overall export growth will slow to zero or even contract. This potential slowdown is attributed to the front-loading of orders earlier in the year and an expected decline in US consumer spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of England is planning the first major redesign of its banknotes in over half a century and is asking the public for input on new themes. Since 1970, notes have featured notable historical figures, but future designs could celebrate themes like nature, innovation, architecture, or key historical events. The public can submit their views and suggest their own ideas for the next series of ¬£5, ¬£10, ¬£20, and ¬£50 notes. The move could bring UK currency design in line with other countries that feature landmarks and wildlife, though the monarch's portrait will remain a fixture.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has enacted major reforms to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a landmark 1970 environmental law, in an effort to spur housing construction. The new legislation, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, waives CEQA requirements for most low- and mid-rise housing developments in urban areas already zoned for multifamily use. This change eliminates the risk of lengthy environmental studies and lawsuits from opponents, which have historically delayed or blocked housing projects. The move signals a significant political shift, prioritizing housing abundance over the procedural hurdles that critics say have stifled development and worsened the state's affordability crisis.</p>
