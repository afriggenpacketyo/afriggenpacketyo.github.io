          <p>A new draft of a major crypto bill in the U.S. Senate includes a provision to ensure that stocks and other securities do not get reclassified as commodities if they are tokenized. The legislation, known as the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, seeks to establish a clear regulatory framework for digital assets, defining the jurisdictions of the SEC and CFTC. Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis expressed hope that the bill will pass both the Senate Banking and Agriculture Committees in the coming months and reach the president's desk by the end of the year.

The article details the complexities and high-security requirements of presidential aircraft, such as anti-surveillance technology and air-to-air refueling capabilities, which contribute to production challenges with Boeing. Recent mechanical issues on planes used by the Vice President and Secretary of State have underscored the urgency of modernization, though new aircraft are not expected for several more years.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order creating a formal designation for countries that wrongfully detain U.S. nationals, enabling the government to impose punitive measures like sanctions and travel restrictions. The policy is modeled after the existing framework for state sponsors of terrorism and aims to deter nations from using American citizens as political bargaining chips. The move was praised by families of formerly detained individuals, including Paul Whelan and the daughter of Robert Levinson, as a powerful deterrent against what they describe as an escalating practice of hostage-taking by rogue regimes.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the United States will host the G20 summit in 2026, coinciding with the nation's 250th anniversary. Trump suggested that the event would be held at his Doral golf resort in Florida, a proposal similar to one he made for the G7 during his first term, which was withdrawn after criticism regarding potential conflicts of interest. The president also stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping would be welcome to attend as observers. Vice President JD Vance will represent the U.S. at this year's summit in South Africa.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made a last-minute change to their pitching rotation, scratching scheduled starter Tyler Glasnow due to back tightness. Two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani, who was not scheduled to pitch until Monday, volunteered to take the mound on short notice for the series opener against the Baltimore Orioles. Manager Dave Roberts praised Ohtani's willingness to step up, expressing hope that Glasnow's issue is minor and that he will be able to pitch again early next week. Ohtani's start was his first since August 27 as he continues his return from Tommy John surgery.</p>

Clarke noted that the team adopted a more physical formation to avoid being dominated as they had been in their previous match in Denmark.

          <p>Giorgio Armani, the legendary Italian designer who passed away at 91, is remembered for single-handedly transforming the Hollywood red carpet from a fashion afterthought into a global runway. Before Armani, many stars dressed themselves with mixed results, but he pioneered the strategy of dressing celebrities for major events, starting with Richard Gere in the 1980 film "American Gigolo." His relaxed, elegant suits became a status symbol, and by establishing a dedicated office to liaise with the entertainment industry, he made high fashion an indispensable part of celebrity culture and built a global empire.</p>

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot climbs to $1.8 billion, the second-largest in history, the potential winner will likely have the option to remain anonymous. In recent decades, many states have changed their laws to protect lottery winners from the security risks and harassment that often accompany public disclosure of their identities. While publicizing winners was once seen as essential for maintaining trust in the lottery system, the focus has shifted to privacy. Legal experts advise winners to use intermediaries like trusts to claim their prize and to avoid public attention.</p>
