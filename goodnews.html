          <p>A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has taken effect, marking the first phase of a US-brokered peace plan for Gaza. This initial stage involves the release of 20 living Israeli hostages in exchange for approximately 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees from Gaza. Increased humanitarian aid is also expected to enter the Strip, which has been facing dire conditions. A multinational force, including troops from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, and the UAE, will monitor the ceasefire, though no US forces will be on the ground in Gaza. This article details the immediate terms and monitoring mechanisms of the agreement.</p>

          <p>Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has activated new powers to regulate Google's search and search advertising services, designating the tech giant with "strategic market status." This follows a nine-month investigation concluding Google holds substantial market power, with over 90% of UK searches on its platform. While not a finding of wrongdoing, the designation could lead to Google implementing fairer search rankings and giving publishers more control over content usage, including in AI-generated responses. Google expressed concerns that such interventions might hinder innovation and growth in the UK. This article details the CMA's significant move in digital market regulation.</p>
