          <p>Greta Thunberg, once criticized on Chinese social media, is now receiving support in China, particularly after Israeli forces stopped her attempt to sail to Gaza. The activist, along with others, aimed to break Israel's siege of Gaza but was intercepted and deported. Chinese social media users have shifted their sentiment, praising Thunberg's consistent support for Palestine and opposition to Israel. Comments on Weibo, China's Twitter, express respect for her actions and acknowledge her commitment to her beliefs, even among those who previously dismissed her environmental activism. Thunberg's journey from departure to deportation was closely followed, marking a notable change in public opinion towards her in China. </p>

          <p>The annual financial disclosures for Supreme Court justices have been released, revealing income from books for Sotomayor, Gorsuch, and Jackson, with Jackson earning $2 million from her memoir. Sotomayor also reported reimbursements for travel and lodging from universities and conferences, while Thomas reported no gifts or outside income, remaining an honorary member of the Horatio Alger Association. Roberts, Kavanaugh, Barrett, and Gorsuch disclosed teaching positions at various law schools, earning additional income. These disclosures have received increased scrutiny following reports of undisclosed travel and gifts received by Justice Thomas, prompting calls for a code of conduct for the Supreme Court, though enforcement mechanisms remain a point of contention. </p>

          <p>After decades of research, the Australian National Maritime Museum has confirmed that Captain Cook's HMS Endeavour rests in Newport Harbor, Rhode Island. Historians originally pinpointed the location in 1998, and subsequent research verified that the wreck is indeed the Endeavour. The ship, famous for Cook's voyages across the Pacific, was later used to transport British troops during the American Revolutionary War and deliberately sunk in 1778. The identification of the wreck is significant for Australia, New Zealand, England, the United States, and First Nations peoples throughout the Pacific Ocean, and efforts are underway to protect the site. The confirmation resolves a long-standing mystery surrounding the final resting place of the historic vessel. </p>

Starmer stated that the inquiry will leave "no stone unturned" and that he agreed with Baroness Casey's conclusion on the need for a national inquiry. The decision follows Baroness Casey's report, which recommends both a national police operation to review cases of child exploitation and a national inquiry overseen by an Independent Commission. Starmer said he had been "calling out" politicians who had done nothing in power but were now making claims. </p>
