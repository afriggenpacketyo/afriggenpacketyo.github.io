          <p>The UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has uncovered and dismantled the country's first known illegal factory for weight loss drugs in Northampton. This operation resulted in the largest-ever single seizure of trafficked weight loss medications by a law enforcement agency globally, including thousands of unlicensed pens and raw ingredients valued at over £250,000. Officials warned the public about the severe dangers of purchasing such untested and unauthorized products online, emphasizing that these criminal networks pose a serious risk to public health while profiting from illicit trade.</p>

          <p>In her first UK interview since the election, former Vice President Kamala Harris indicated she is considering another run for the presidency in 2028, stating she is "not done" with public service. She dismissed unfavorable polls and reiterated her campaign warnings about Donald Trump, whom she labeled a "tyrant," asserting that his actions in office have validated her concerns. Harris also reflected on her 2024 campaign loss, attributing the defeat largely to the compressed timeline following Joe Biden's late withdrawal from the race, while expressing her belief that a female president will be elected in the near future.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has acquired a nearly 5% stake in engineering and construction company Fluor, aiming to unlock shareholder value from Fluor's significant investment in nuclear technology firm NuScale Power. Starboard argues that Fluor's 39% holding in NuScale, which constitutes over half of Fluor's market capitalization, is depressing the valuation of its core business. The firm is pushing for a separation, such as a sale or tax-free spinoff of the NuScale shares, which it believes could lead to a substantial rerating of Fluor's stock and significant returns for investors.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new survey from Charles Schwab reveals that 45% of investors are interested in alternative assets like private equity and real estate, moving beyond traditional stocks and bonds. Financial advisors suggest that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can provide a more accessible and liquid way to gain exposure to these less-traditional markets, mitigating some risks like multi-year lockup periods. While younger investors show growing interest in alternatives, experts still recommend that core long-term goals are best served by a diversified portfolio of traditional assets, which have a proven history of growth.

          <h2>Trump Reverses Plan to Deploy Federal Agents to San Francisco After Mayoral Intervention</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump personally called San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie to announce he was canceling the planned deployment of federal agents to the city. The decision reportedly came after lobbying from prominent tech CEOs and the mayor, who presented the president with positive crime statistics and economic data. The incident highlights a capricious approach to domestic policy, where a military-style intervention was seemingly initiated and then withdrawn based on personal appeals from influential figures rather than a formal strategic assessment. The reversal has provided temporary relief, but the president's message suggests the reprieve may be conditional.</p>

          <p>Negotiating teams from Afghanistan and Pakistan are scheduled to meet in Istanbul to strengthen a fragile ceasefire along their shared border. The talks follow recent deadly clashes that began after Afghanistan's Taliban rulers blamed Pakistan for explosions in Kabul, leading to cross-border military strikes from both sides. A second truce, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, is currently holding, and the Istanbul meeting aims to establish mechanisms to ensure its stability. Pakistan is focused on addressing what it calls terrorism originating from Afghan territory, while the Taliban government emphasizes protecting its territorial integrity.</p>

          <p>A Goldman Sachs report indicates that major Chinese companies are strategically shifting their export focus from the United States to markets in Southeast Asia and other developing regions. This pivot allows them to leverage cost advantages while also moving up the value chain by exporting higher-end products, which has reportedly boosted their profit margins. Since 2018, China's exports to non-US markets have grown at a 7.5% compound annual rate, while exports to the US have slightly declined, reflecting a diversification strategy in response to geopolitical and trade tensions.

          <p>Autumn marks the annual tarantula mating season in California, when male spiders emerge from their burrows in a perilous search for a mate. This period, typically running from July through November and peaking after the first fall rains, offers the best chance to spot the arachnids in areas like the Santa Monica Mountains. The journey is fraught with danger, as female tarantulas are known to be cannibalistic, sometimes eating their suitors even after a successful mating. While their venom is not dangerous to humans, urbanization poses threats like roads and swimming pools to the wandering males.</p>

          <p>A new, large-scale artificial surf park is planned for the coastal city of El Segundo, a departure from other California wave pools which are located inland. The project, valued at $175 million, will feature a 2.2-acre lagoon and is being developed by an owner of the Palm Springs Surf Club on a former aerospace campus. The development aims to make surfing more accessible in a controlled environment, appealing to both beginners and experienced surfers who face crowded conditions in the ocean. The park will join a growing sports and entertainment hub in the area.</p>
