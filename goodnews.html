          <h2>New Study Suggests China's Dam on Tibetan Plateau May Increase Dry-Season Water Flow to India</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 00:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new scientific study indicates that China's construction of a major dam in Tibet might not lead to the water crisis in India that many had feared. By analyzing data from two existing upstream dams, Zangmu and Jiacha, researchers found that water flow during the dry season has actually increased downstream. Specifically, low flows in February saw a more than 50 percent rise, suggesting the dam's water regulation could alleviate drought conditions rather than exacerbate them, countering previous concerns about water scarcity.</p>

          <p>Iga Swiatek claimed her first Wimbledon championship with a decisive 6-0, 6-0 victory against American opponent Amanda Anisimova in a final that lasted just 57 minutes. This marks the sixth Grand Slam title for the 24-year-old Polish player, who remains undefeated in major finals. The match was a historic "double bagel," the first in a Wimbledon women's final in 114 years. For Anisimova, reaching the final was a significant achievement after taking a career break in 2023 for mental health reasons.</p>

          <p>China's space sector is experiencing a boom in private investment, with the global space economy projected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2035. This growth is driven by interest in space travel, manufacturing, and resource mining, supported by technological advances and government backing for private enterprises like i-Space and LandSpace. As this commercialization accelerates, Hong Kong's status as an international financial hub makes it a prime candidate to facilitate investment and support the industry's expansion. The article suggests the city can become a vital nexus for financing China's ambitious leap into the commercial space race. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several start-ups, including UK-based Better Dairy, are pioneering the creation of lab-grown cheese that mimics the taste and texture of traditional dairy products without using animal milk. The process involves genetically modifying yeast to produce casein, the key protein in milk, through a technique called precision fermentation. While facing challenges such as high production costs, regulatory hurdles, and a recent decline in plant-based food sales, these companies believe their products can overcome the quality issues of current vegan cheeses. They aim to launch commercially within the next few years, targeting both consumers and food manufacturers.</p>

          <p>The reality TV show "Love Island" is experiencing a revival in viewership, with its social media engagement, particularly on TikTok, growing even faster than its television audience. The show's official accounts have gained over a million followers on TikTok this year, where short clips, recaps, and fan analyses allow viewers to keep up with the drama without watching the full nightly episodes. While this strategy is attracting a new and wider audience, some observers and former contestants worry that consuming the show through bite-sized, out-of-context clips may distort the reality of the events and contestants.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered his best pitching performance of the season, setting the tone for the Los Angeles Dodgers to end their seven-game losing streak with a 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants. In his longest outing since returning to the mound after surgery, Ohtani pitched three scoreless innings, striking out four and allowing only one hit. While bulk reliever Emmet Sheehan earned the win, Ohtani's dominant start provided the momentum the team desperately needed. The outing is another positive step in his gradual buildup as a starting pitcher.</p>
