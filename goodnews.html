          <p>Asian stock markets experienced a significant surge, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbing over 2% to a near four-year high, driven by a strong tech sector performance. This rally followed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish remarks, signaling a potential easing of monetary policy next month. Mainland China's CSI 300 also extended gains, reaching a 37-month high, partly fueled by expectations of capital rotation from the U.S. to China and shifts from bonds to equities. Chinese property stocks notably rallied after Shanghai eased homebuying rules, contributing to the broader market optimism across the region. (not investment advice)</p>

This move allows customers lower upfront costs and battery swapping options, attracting a broader customer base beyond its traditional high-end market.

          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper announced an $18 billion acquisition of Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's, aiming to bolster its struggling U.S. coffee business. The deal, which values JDE Peet's at 15.7 billion euros, is expected to generate $400 million in cost synergies over three years. Following the acquisition, Keurig Dr Pepper plans to split its beverage and coffee units into two separate, U.S.-listed companies, effectively unwinding their 2018 merger. This strategic move seeks to enhance appeal to at-home coffee drinkers and expand into cold coffee offerings, while creating two focused entities with significant annual net sales.
