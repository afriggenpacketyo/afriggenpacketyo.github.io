          <p>England's women's rugby team has announced an unchanged lineup for the upcoming World Cup final against Canada at a sold-out Twickenham stadium. Head coach John Mitchell is maintaining the same starting fifteen and replacements that secured a 35-17 victory over France in the semi-final. The Red Roses, currently on a 32-Test winning streak, are seeking their first World Cup title since 2014 after losing the last two finals to New Zealand. The event is set to break attendance records for a women's rugby match, highlighting the growing prominence and support for the sport.</p>

This positive performance contrasted with mixed results across other Asia-Pacific markets, which did not follow Wall Street's recent downturn in tech stocks like Nvidia. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index saw a slight decline, while mainland China's CSI 300 posted gains. The varied market movements reflect differing regional economic sentiments and investor reactions to global tech sector volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

Before winning gold in Paris, he created a brew called 'Paris Gold' as a form of manifestation, a technique he has embraced in his sport. Now, ahead of the Para-athletics World Championships in New Delhi, Pembroke is preparing to defend his title while also developing a new beer to inspire his compatriots for the 2026 Winter Games.

          <p>A woman whose body was found in Spain in 2005 has been identified after two decades as Liudmila Zavada, a 31-year-old Russian citizen. The breakthrough came through 'Operation Identify Me,' an international initiative led by Interpol that publicly shares information on unidentified bodies to generate new leads. Her identity was confirmed after Turkish police matched her fingerprints in a national database, leading to a DNA confirmation with a relative in Russia. This marks the third successful identification from the campaign, which aims to solve cold cases of women who were murdered or died under suspicious circumstances across Europe.</p>
