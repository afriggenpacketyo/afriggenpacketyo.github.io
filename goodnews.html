          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly developing a financial aid package potentially exceeding $10 billion to support U.S. farmers, particularly soybean producers, who have been negatively impacted by trade disputes. Chinese boycotts on American soybeans have left farmers with full silos and excess crops, a situation a top White House economic adviser called unacceptable. Discussions involving the Treasury and Agriculture Departments are in the early stages, with an announcement of "big measures" expected soon. President Trump has suggested that revenue collected from tariffs could be used to fund this relief effort and ensure American farmers remain financially stable during the ongoing trade conflicts.</p>

          <p>Cerebras CEO Andrew Feldman confirmed that the AI chip company still intends to go public despite recently withdrawing its initial public offering registration. In a statement, Feldman explained that the business has evolved significantly since its original filing a year ago, necessitating an updated prospectus with new financial and strategic information. The company recently secured a $1.1 billion funding round at an $8.1 billion valuation, adding new investors not mentioned in the previous filing. Feldman stated that withdrawing and refiling is in the best interest of investors and will allow for a more accurate representation of the company's value when it enters the public markets.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a slow autumn, the domestic box office is projected to finish the year strongly, potentially pushing the total 2025 haul to a post-pandemic record of over $9 billion. Analysts anticipate a series of major holiday releases, including "Wicked: For Good," "Zootopia 2," and "Avatar: Fire and Ash," will provide a significant boost in ticket sales. Currently, the year-to-date box office is running about 4% ahead of the previous year, and a strong fourth quarter is expected to surpass the 2023 record of $9.05 billion. The positive outlook extends into 2026, with a slate of highly anticipated blockbusters expected to continue the growth trend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a widespread push from major corporations for employees to return to the office, work-from-home rates have remained stable since early 2023. Stanford professor Nick Bloom attributes this to a "growing compliance gap," where employees engage in passive resistance against RTO mandates, often with the tacit approval of middle managers who are reluctant to enforce unpopular rules. Workers are also adopting practices like "coffee badging"—showing up for just a few hours—to meet attendance requirements while preserving flexibility. This trend indicates that many employees are finding ways to comply with RTO policies on their own terms, even as companies try to reassert control.</p>

A key part of this strategy is the development of TechZity, a €100 million project in Vilnius set to become Europe's largest startup hub, housing 5,000 workers. The nation hopes to replicate the success of its thriving fintech industry, which became a European leader by creating a favorable regulatory environment and fostering innovation.

Additionally, the court will hear arguments on state laws that ban "conversion therapy" for minors and prohibit transgender athletes from competing in girls' sports. The term is expected to be defined by these disputes over executive power and cultural conflicts, with the court's 6-3 conservative majority poised to make impactful rulings on a range of national issues.</p>
