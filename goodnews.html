          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 14:55:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. crude oil futures experienced a decline of approximately 2% following OPEC+'s agreement to boost production for the second consecutive month, raising concerns about potential oversupply. The decision to increase output by 411,000 barrels per day in June, nearly tripling Goldman Sachs' forecast, has intensified fears of a recession driven by U.S. tariffs. This situation is expected to negatively impact investment in exploration and production, with oil majors like Chevron and Exxon reporting lower first-quarter earnings due to weaker oil prices, creating uncertainty in the market. Oil prices in April posted the biggest monthly loss since 2021.</p>

          <p>OpenAI announced that its nonprofit will retain control of the company, even as it restructures into a public benefit corporation, bowing to pressure from civic leaders and ex-employees. The company, backed by Microsoft and valued at $300 billion, made the decision after discussing the matter with the attorneys general of California and Delaware. This move comes amidst a legal battle with Elon Musk, who co-founded the group as a nonprofit research lab and seeks to prevent OpenAI from converting into a for-profit company.

          <p>Debt management programs can provide relief from high-rate debt by consolidating unsecured debts into a manageable monthly payment with potentially lower interest rates. To qualify, individuals need eligible types of debt, sufficient income, a meaningful level of debt, and a willingness to close credit cards. If ineligible, alternatives include debt settlement, debt consolidation loans, or bankruptcy. Consulting with a credit counselor is recommended to determine the best course of action for managing debt and achieving financial stability. This article is not investment advice.</p>

          <p>President Trump asserted that gasoline prices have fallen below $2 per gallon, attributing it to his economic policies and urging the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. However, current data from AAA and GasBuddy indicate that the national average is over $3 per gallon. The $1.98 figure appears to be referencing RBOB gasoline futures, which do not reflect retail prices inclusive of taxes, transportation, and other costs. Experts caution that RBOB prices are irrelevant to consumers as they do not represent what drivers pay at the pump.</p>

          <p>With gold prices soaring, investing in gold bars and coins presents both opportunities and challenges. The rising price offers potential for quick profits but also raises the entry barrier for new investors. Easy access to gold through online retailers and local jewelers is a pro, but storage costs and insurance can be a drawback. Fractional gold offers a lower entry price point for investors while still getting invested in bullion. Prospective investors should also monitor the market daily, as price fluctuations are inevitable. Investors should carefully consider these factors and limit gold to no more than 10% of their portfolio. This article is not investment advice.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended President Trump‚Äôs economic policy of trade reform, tax cuts, and deregulation at the Milken Institute Global Conference. He urged business leaders to invest in the United States, promising a favorable tax and regulatory environment. The former hedge fund manager said that all three elements of the policy must be taken together in order to be understood. His appearance came amid ongoing concerns about the impact of Trump's tariffs on the global economy, and that he was attempting to shift the policy discussion to tax cuts, which he has predicted Congress could pass by early July.</p>

The class action lawsuit against the US government to determine who was eligible for adoption was denied by a judge and sealed the records.</p>
