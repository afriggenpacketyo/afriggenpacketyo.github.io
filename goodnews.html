          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence received the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for upholding the constitutional transfer of power after the 2020 election, despite pressure from President Trump. In his acceptance speech, Pence repeatedly invoked the Constitution as the common ground binding Americans together, emphasizing the need to find common ground in divided times. Pence acknowledged differences with both Democrats and his own Republican Party on issues like spending, tariffs, and support for Ukraine. Pence's actions on January 6, 2021, were recognized as a principled stand against efforts to overturn the election results.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research indicates that learning new languages physically alters the brain and enhances cognitive abilities, acting as a workout that reshapes neural pathways. Neuroscientists have found that multilingual individuals process information differently due to the rewiring of brain circuits involved in language processing. Studies show that learning a language increases gray matter structure in areas related to language processing and executive function. While multilingualism may improve cognitive skills like memory and problem-solving, it's unclear if this directly translates to higher intelligence.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed a widely effective antivenom using blood from Tim Friede, a man intentionally bitten by numerous deadly snakes over 18 years to self-immunize. Researchers isolated antibodies from Friede's blood that reacted with neurotoxins from 19 of the world's deadliest snakes. The new antivenom, tested in mouse trials, proved protective against venom from black mambas, king cobras, and other dangerous snakes. Friede's unique immune history offers hope for a broad-spectrum antivenom that could be administered in rural settings or by hikers.</p>

          <p>A podcast from The Atlantic explores the complexities of defining old age and the debate over classifying it as a disease. Dr. Kiran Rabheru, a geriatric psychiatrist, discusses his opposition to the World Health Organization's proposal to designate old age as a disease, arguing it would reinforce ageism. The podcast also touches on the concept of healthspan, focusing on extending the period of healthy living rather than just lifespan, and the importance of reframing aging in a more positive light.</p>
