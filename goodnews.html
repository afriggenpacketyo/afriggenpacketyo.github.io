          <p>President Trump stated that Iran provided "early notice" of missile strikes targeting the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, downplaying the severity of Iran's response to U.S. bombings of Iranian nuclear sites. He asserted that this early warning allowed for the prevention of casualties and injuries. Trump also announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire starting at midnight ET, following a week of escalating tensions. Diplomatic sources indicated that Iran's counterattack was expected and calibrated, with U.S. and Qatari officials preparing in advance, echoing a similar advance notice given during Iran's 2020 strikes on a U.S. military base in Iraq.

          <p>NHS England will offer at-home HPV test kits to women who have delayed cervical screening, aiming to increase participation rates. The DIY test kits, available from January, allow women to swab the lining of the vagina to test for human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes most cervical cancers. The initiative seeks to address barriers such as embarrassment, discomfort, and lack of time that prevent women from attending screenings, with the goal of increasing the screening rate to 77% over three years. Women who test positive for HPV will be invited for further examination to check for cell changes. Optimism score is not to be found within the summary.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>RBN Energy executive Rusty Braziel told CNBC that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil shipping passage, despite recent tensions with the U.S. Braziel argues that closing the strait would harm Iran's own interests, as it exports 1.7 million barrels of oil per day through it. While the market has considered this threat for over 20 years, Iran has never actually closed it, and oil prices dropped on Monday, indicating the market's skepticism. Braziel also noted that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China pose serious issues for exporters, making global customers more reluctant to buy other energy products from the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, many Trump voters expressed support, viewing the action as consistent with protecting American interests and preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. While some criticized the strikes as a betrayal of Trump's non-interventionist promises, others believed the actions were preventative and aligned with an "America First" approach. Trump voters largely defended the decision to proceed without Congressional approval, emphasizing the need for swift action.
