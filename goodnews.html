          <p>Nottingham Forest has completed the signing of 23-year-old French striker Arnaud Kalimuendo from Rennes for a reported fee of £26 million. Kalimuendo, who scored 18 goals in 34 appearances last season, has signed a five-year contract with the Premier League club. This acquisition is part of a significant summer spending spree for Forest, which has already invested over £144 million in six other players, including recent high-value signings Omari Hutchinson and James McAtee. The move aims to bolster the team's offensive options, providing competition and support for forward Chris Wood as the club prepares for a potential European campaign.</p>

          <p>Bournemouth has reached an agreement with Liverpool to sign 19-year-old winger Ben Doak for an initial fee of £20 million, with an additional £5 million in potential add-ons. The Scottish international, who spent last season on loan at Middlesbrough, is expected to finalize the transfer within 24 hours, pending a medical examination. The move is intended to provide Doak with more first-team football opportunities, as he has made only 10 appearances for Liverpool since joining from Celtic in 2022. This signing is part of a busy summer for Bournemouth, which is actively reshaping its squad following several high-profile departures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global markets are showing cautious optimism as European leaders meet with President Trump to discuss an end to the war in Ukraine, but geopolitical experts warn that a resolution is unlikely to be a 'quick fix.' While traders hope for a peace deal to stabilize the global economy, analysts suggest that negotiations will be a long and complex process, noting that Russia may use prolonged talks to continue its military operations. The inconclusive summit between Trump and Putin last week underscores the difficulty of reaching a ceasefire, let alone a permanent peace agreement. Defense stocks, however, have risen, reflecting expectations of increased military spending regardless of the diplomatic outcome.</p>

          <p>Chinese sportswear company Xtep International reported a record interim net profit of 913.6 million yuan, a 6.4% increase from the previous year, driven by a surge in marathon participation across China. The company's professional running segment, which includes the Saucony and Merrell brands, saw the most significant growth, with sales jumping 32.5% to 785.1 million yuan. Chairman Ding Shuipo attributed the success to the company's 'professional-to-mass' strategy, which leverages the high performance of its professional brands to boost sales across its mass-market products. The strong financial results reflect the growing popularity of running as a sport in the Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>

'Skibidi,' a gibberish word from a viral YouTube series, and 'tradwife,' short for 'traditional wife,' are now officially defined. Other new entries capture modern work culture, such as 'mouse jiggler,' a device used to feign activity while working remotely, and 'broligarchy,' which describes a small group of powerful male tech leaders. Lexicographers stated that they only add words they believe will have lasting power and significance in the language.</p>

          <p>The Marshall Islands, previously considered the last country in the world without a national soccer team, made its historic international debut in a match against the U.S. Virgin Islands. The game was held in Springdale, Arkansas, home to a large Marshallese diaspora community of around 15,000 people. Despite a 4-0 loss, the team was met with overwhelming support and pride from the crowd, who celebrated the milestone of finally having a team to represent their nation on the world stage. The event was a significant moment for the community, symbolizing representation and unity for the small island nation.</p>

          <p>A fisherman using a sonar device on the Mississippi River in Minnesota has likely solved the nearly 60-year-old disappearance of Roy Benn, who went missing in 1967. The fisherman discovered a submerged 1960s-era Buick and alerted authorities, who recovered the vehicle and found human remains inside. The car's vehicle identification number matched that of the 1963 Buick belonging to Benn, who was 59 when he vanished. While the remains are pending formal identification, authorities believe they belong to Benn and have notified his remaining family. The discovery is seen as a long-awaited breakthrough that could finally bring closure to the cold case.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite growing calls on social media for Los Angeles to withdraw from hosting the 2028 Olympics due to issues like wildfires, budget deficits, and political tensions, doing so is almost impossible. The host city contract signed with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) does not provide an exit clause for the city and breaking it would expose L.A. to billions of dollars in lawsuits for damages and lost revenue. Unlike Denver, which rejected the 1976 Winter Games, the modern Olympics are a massive financial enterprise, making a last-minute relocation unfeasible. L.A. is legally and financially committed, with preparations, including securing major sponsorships, already well underway.</p>

          <h2>New Biography Explores the Intersection of James Baldwin's Art, Activism, and Love Life</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nicholas Boggs' new biography, 'Baldwin: A Love Story,' offers a deeply researched look into how James Baldwin's personal relationships and lifelong search for love shaped his literary and activist work. The book argues that Baldwin's experiences as a Black, gay man, along with his complex, often unrequited love affairs, were the primary fuel for his most powerful novels and essays, including 'Giovanni's Room' and 'The Fire Next Time.' Boggs uncovers new details, including a previously unknown long-term relationship, to illustrate how Baldwin transmuted his private life into profound public indictments of American racism and sexual hypocrisy. The biography is being hailed as the new gold standard for Baldwin studies.</p>

          <h2>Personal Essay Explores Identity and Reinvention Through Inherited Jewelry</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A writer reflects on the powerful connection between jewelry, memory, and personal identity, centered on a gold watch inherited from her grandmother. The essay explores how accessories, worn daily, become emblems of who we are and who we aspire to be, often more so than clothing. The author contemplates her grandmother's life of constant reinvention—from ballet dancer to painter—and how her eclectic jewelry collection was part of that performance of self. Wearing the watch connects the author to her grandmother's past and her own future, serving as a talisman that blurs the lines between generations and embodies the ongoing process of becoming oneself.</p>
