          <p>Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, driven by the growing popularity of its innovative foldable phones. In the second quarter, Samsung's market share increased from 23% to 31%, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%, according to data from Canalys. This shift is attributed to Samsung's wider range of products, including the Z Fold 7 and Z Flip models, which offer new form factors and are gaining traction on social media. While Apple still leads the U.S. market, its recent performance has concerned investors, and the company is now expected to release its own foldable iPhone by 2026 to compete.

          <p>Manchester City began their Premier League season with a commanding 4-0 victory over Wolves, highlighted by a standout debut from Dutch midfielder Tijjani Reijnders. The 27-year-old, a recent signing from AC Milan, made an immediate impact by scoring one goal and providing an assist, becoming only the second City player after Sergio Aguero to achieve this on their league debut. Manager Pep Guardiola praised Reijnders as a "top signing for the coming years," noting his pace and ability to create space. The dominant performance suggests a strong start for City as they look to rebound from a disappointing previous season and reassert their strength in the league.</p>

          <p>A cross-party group of 96 British Members of Parliament has formally requested that the government expedite a plan to bring sick and injured children from Gaza to the UK for urgent medical treatment. In a letter to senior ministers, the MPs highlighted the collapse of Gaza's healthcare system and stressed that children are at imminent risk of death. They are calling for the removal of any barriers, such as biometric checks, to facilitate the evacuations, which they argue should be based solely on clinical need. The letter also suggests that evacuated families should have the option to claim asylum in the UK after treatment is complete.</p>

          <p>Sunderland marked their return to the Premier League with a decisive 3-0 victory over West Ham, securing their first win in the opening month of a top-flight season in over a decade. After a goalless first half, the Black Cats scored three times, with goals from Eliezer Mayenda, Dan Ballard, and Wilson Isidor. The win brought jubilant celebrations from home fans, who have endured a long wait for such a strong start after the club's eight-year absence from the top division. The performance of several new signings, part of a £132 million summer spending spree, suggests the club is determined to remain in the Premier League.</p>

          <p>Australia's national rugby team, the Wallabies, secured a remarkable 38-22 victory over world champions South Africa in the Rugby Championship opener in Johannesburg. After trailing 22-0 in the first 20 minutes, Australia mounted an incredible comeback to claim their first win at the historic Ellis Park stadium since 1963. The Springboks initially dominated with three early tries, but the Wallabies shifted the momentum by taking control at the breakdown. Captain Harry Wilson was a key player, scoring two tries, as the visitors outmaneuvered the home team in a stunning turnaround that marks one of Australia's greatest Test match wins.</p>

          <h2>Cardiologists Recommend Salmon for Heart Health in Adults Over 60</h2>

          <p>Cardiologists are strongly advising adults over the age of 60 to incorporate more salmon into their diets to support cardiovascular health. Dr. Cheng-Han Chen, an interventional cardiologist, highlights that salmon is an excellent source of high-quality protein and one of the best natural sources of omega-3 fatty acids. These essential fats can help increase HDL ("good") cholesterol while lowering LDL ("bad") cholesterol, reduce inflammation, and support healthy blood vessel function. Since the heart is a muscle, consuming adequate protein is crucial for maintaining its strength and overall function, making salmon a particularly beneficial choice for aging individuals seeking to protect their heart.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback to the British High Street, with its managing director confirming the return of standalone physical stores. The relaunch was kicked off with the brand's first catwalk show in seven years, held in London's Trafalgar Square. After its parent company, Arcadia, collapsed in 2020, all Topshop stores were closed, and the brand was sold to online retailer Asos. Industry experts note that while nostalgia may attract its former millennial and Gen-Z customer base, Topshop will face challenges in attracting new shoppers and competing with fast-fashion prices in the current economic climate.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both closed the week at record highs, driven by investor optimism following a cooler-than-expected July inflation report. The consumer price index data increased market expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September, fueling a rally early in the week. Despite a subsequent report showing a rise in wholesale inflation, the odds of a rate cut remained high. The market's upward momentum was also supported by strong earnings from companies like Cisco, which reported significant growth in its AI infrastructure business, reinforcing positive sentiment around the tech sector.

          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Catherine, are reportedly moving to Forest Lodge, an eight-bedroom home in Windsor Great Park, along with their three children. The family has been residing at Adelaide Cottage since 2022, but a royal source indicated that the move is intended to provide a "fresh start" after a challenging period that included the princess's cancer diagnosis. The relocation is seen as a long-term plan, with Forest Lodge considered their "forever home" where they will live when they eventually become King and Queen. The move is being privately funded, and the couple will continue to maintain their focus on family privacy.</p>

          <p>A Phoenix-based startup, Steel + Spark, is repurposing old shipping containers to create innovative and rapidly deployable shelters for the city's unhoused population. Architect Brian Stark designed the "X-WING" shelters, which are constructed from four containers arranged in an 'X' shape, creating five individual rooms and shared courtyard spaces. These units, which can be built in just one week, are equipped with air conditioning and solar panels, providing a sustainable and cost-effective solution to the housing crisis. The project aims to utilize existing materials to offer dignity and stability to residents, with plans to expand the concept into a larger apartment complex for low-income seniors.</p>
