          <p>Four giant pandas housed at the Adventure World amusement park in Wakayama, Japan, have departed for China as their loan agreement expires. The departure of the female panda Rauhin and her three offspring leaves only two giant pandas remaining in the entire country, located at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo. The Wakayama zoo has had a successful joint breeding program with China since 1994, raising 17 cubs. While saddened by the departure, zoo officials expressed hope to welcome new pandas in the future, continuing the cooperative conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on President Trump's recent on-camera use of an expletive when discussing the conflict between Israel and Iran. The author, Gary Nunn, suggests that while unconventional for a president, the moment felt authentic and effectively conveyed a frustration shared by many people. The piece argues that the public is tired of overly polished and scripted political speech, and that judicious, genuine use of strong language can make politicians seem more human and trustworthy. It posits that breaking linguistic norms can sometimes be a powerful tool for communication, even if it masks other political complexities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is navigating a pivotal week, marked by significant victories and pressing challenges that could define the presidency. Key wins include a favorable Supreme Court ruling limiting nationwide injunctions against executive orders and securing increased defense spending from NATO allies. However, major challenges remain, including finalizing numerous trade deals by a July 8 deadline and ensuring the passage of the "one big beautiful bill" through the Senate. The combination of successes and unresolved issues creates a high-pressure environment as the administration pushes its agenda on multiple fronts.</p>

          <p>A top economist at China International Capital Corporation argues that China's mature third-party payment systems, such as WeChat and Alipay, provide a "comparative advantage" in the global race to develop stablecoins. In a research note, Peng Wensheng stated that these platforms already function similarly to stablecoins, being pegged 1:1 with fiat currency and backed by a robust regulatory framework. He suggests their stability is ensured by strict safeguards, including customer funds being backed by central bank money. This perspective emerges as stablecoins become a central topic in global financial discussions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent study has found a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals who follow a traditional Japanese-style diet. The research, conducted by the Japan Institute for Health Security, assessed diets that include rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and seaweed. The study also looked at a modified version that added fruit, fresh vegetables, and dairy products. These findings suggest that dietary patterns rich in these specific foods may have a positive impact on mental well-being, offering a potential nutritional approach to complementing the fight against depression.</p>
