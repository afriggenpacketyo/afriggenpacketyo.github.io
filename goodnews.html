          <p>Hong Kong's Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu has announced the creation of a working group to promote the 'silver economy,' targeting the city's growing elderly population to stimulate economic growth. The working group will focus on five key policy areas, including increasing elderly consumption, developing industries catering to older individuals, promoting quality assurance in related products, establishing financial safeguards, and boosting productivity among older individuals. This initiative recognizes the significant potential of the elderly consumer market, as those aged 65 or over are expected to comprise more than a third of Hong Kong's population by 2043.</p>

Singapore is viewed as a safe jurisdiction with political and economic stability, making it an attractive location for high-net-worth individuals seeking to protect their assets from global risks.

          <p>Twenty companies have applied to purchase a total of 110,000 tons of government stockpiled rice in Japan, following the agriculture minister's announcement of direct sales contracts to curb rising prices.

The average price of rice in supermarkets has doubled from last year, prompting the government to intervene more proactively to stabilize costs.

          <p>A groundbreaking study by Chinese scientists has challenged Darwinian evolution by demonstrating that acquired traits can be inherited without changes to DNA. Researchers found that rice plants exposed to cold stress passed on an adaptive tolerance to low temperatures across multiple generations through DNA methylation changes, bypassing genetic mutations. This research supports the long-dismissed evolutionary theory of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, suggesting that environmental factors can induce heritable epigenetic variations. The findings position Lamarckism as a significant force in evolution, prompting a reevaluation of epigenetics within evolutionary biology.</p>

          <p>China's large industrial enterprises saw a 3% year-on-year increase in profits for April, despite ongoing trade tensions with the United States. For the first four months of the year, industrial profits recorded 1.4% growth, with private enterprises showing the highest growth rate. The April data is the first indicator of industrial profit health since the escalation of the trade war, before the agreement of a 90-day trade truce. However, uncertainty remains high due to the unclear trade relationship between China and the US. (not investment advice)</p>
