          <p>President Trump promoted the new Trump Savings Account program, included in the GOP megabill, during a White House roundtable with lawmakers and CEOs. The program aims to provide a strong start for American children at no cost to taxpayers by depositing $1,000 into a tax-deferred, low-cost index fund for each newborn. Additional contributions up to $5,000 annually would be permitted, allowing the funds to be used for college or a down payment on a home upon adulthood. House Speaker Mike Johnson praised the policy as a transformative measure to help American families and set up the next generation for success.

          <p>A federal judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million lawsuit against Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and Lively's publicist, Leslie Sloane, which alleged civil extortion and defamation. The lawsuit stemmed from Lively's accusations of sexual harassment and retaliation against Baldoni during the production of "It Ends With Us," accusations Baldoni denies. A separate defamation lawsuit filed by Baldoni against The New York Times, which initially reported Lively's complaint, was also dismissed. Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a complete victory, while The New York Times emphasized its commitment to protecting honest reporting.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As retirees face rising costs and fixed incomes, they are increasingly considering home equity products like HELOCs and reverse mortgages. A HELOC functions as a revolving line of credit, suitable for temporary cash needs and one-time expenses, requiring repayment within a set period. In contrast, a reverse mortgage is a longer-term solution where repayment isn't required until the borrower dies or sells the home, making it suitable for covering monthly expenses. Choosing between the two depends on individual financial circumstances, the purpose of the funds, and the ability to repay.

          <p>A federal judge has restricted the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) access to federal databases, citing a "breach of law and trust." The ruling follows a lawsuit filed by federal employees alleging a breach of privacy, as the court found that OPM granted DOGE broad access without demonstrating a credible need. The judge criticized the Trump administration's handling of OPM records, noting the failure to acknowledge mistakes and follow cybersecurity procedures. The ruling comes amid ongoing legal battles over DOGE's access to sensitive information, with the Supreme Court recently handing down decisions related to DOGE's access to Social Security Administration records.

          <p>In an economy with persistent inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer an opportunity to save money and earn returns that outpace inflation. Today's leading CD accounts provide higher returns and the ability to lock in rates for the term of the CD, with FDIC or NCUA insurance up to $250,000. Strategies for obtaining good CD rates include exploring online banks, which often offer more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs, and considering short-term CDs, which currently have higher interest rates than longer terms due to the inverted yield curve. Laddering CDs, buying CDs with staggered maturity dates, can help take advantage of high rates while saving for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A study indicates that U.S. tourists are reducing their summer trips to Europe, with only 33% planning to visit, a 7% decrease from last year, primarily due to high travel costs and political concerns. However, Chinese travelers are offsetting this decline, with 72% planning European summer trips, a 10% increase. Chinese travelers are motivated by growing disposable incomes and a desire for lifestyle experiences, though they are also becoming more budget-conscious. Europe remains a key destination for Chinese tourists, particularly for luxury goods shopping. Optimism score is self-contained and does not directly refer to the article's sentiment.</p>

          <p>China's film distributors have pledged to increase the number and quality of imported films to diversify the country's cinematic offerings, as domestic productions have dominated the market. At a conference organized by the China Film Group Corporation and Huaxia Film Distribution, distributors committed to bringing in "good titles from multiple countries" and leveraging imported films to expand the market. Foreign films have faced a challenging situation this year, with box office returns lagging behind domestic rivals. Officials emphasized the need to encourage more international films to enter the Chinese market. Optimism score is self-contained and does not directly refer to the article's sentiment.</p>
