          <p>Poland initiated its presidential election amidst heightened security concerns due to the ongoing war in Ukraine and worries about the U.S.'s commitment to European security. The leading candidates include Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski, aligned with Prime Minister Donald Tusk, and Karol Nawrocki, supported by the Law and Justice party. Polls suggest a likely runoff between Trzaskowski and Nawrocki, with a far-right candidate also potentially influencing the outcome. The election's outcome will significantly impact Poland's stance on key issues and its relationship with the EU.</p>

          <p>A new internal survey conducted by the Bundeswehr Center of Military History and Social Sciences suggests that the German military does not have "systemic" extremism, with only 0.4% of soldiers exhibiting right-wing extremist attitudes. However, the study also identified problematic chauvinist and xenophobic views among some soldiers. Some researchers remain skeptical, pointing out potential limitations of voluntary surveys and the influence of recent scrutiny on right-wing extremism within the Bundeswehr, particularly in the context of the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in the New York Times contrasts Europe's resurgence of night trains with the United States' declining investment in public infrastructure. While Europe revitalizes its sleeper train network to compete with short-haul flights, America struggles with underfunded rail systems and prioritizes car-centric infrastructure. The author argues that America's focus on cars has led to decreased happiness and mental health, advocating for investment in rail networks as a more sustainable and community-oriented alternative.</p>
