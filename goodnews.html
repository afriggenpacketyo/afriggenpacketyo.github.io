          <p>A growing number of couples are choosing to include their pet dogs in their wedding ceremonies, treating them as integral family members. Dogs are taking on roles such as ring bearers, "flower girls," and greeters, bringing a unique sense of joy and comfort to the special day. To meet this demand, specialized dog chaperone services have emerged to manage the pets, ensuring they are well-cared for and prepared for their roles. This trend reflects a broader societal shift where pets are increasingly viewed as cherished members of the family, akin to children.</p>

          <p>A court filing from the legal dispute between Elon Musk and OpenAI has revealed that Musk asked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to participate in a $97.4 billion bid to acquire the AI company in early 2025. The proposal was made when Musk, through his company xAI, was attempting to form an investor consortium to take over OpenAI, which he co-founded as a non-profit. According to the filing, neither Zuckerberg nor Meta signed the letter of intent or invested in the bid. This information surfaced as part of OpenAI's counterclaims against Musk in their ongoing lawsuit.</p>

          <p>A tentative settlement has been reached between Elon Musk's social media company, X, and former employees who filed a $500 million lawsuit over unpaid severance. The lawsuit was initiated after thousands of workers were laid off following Musk's 2022 acquisition of the company, then known as Twitter. The plaintiffs argued they were denied the severance benefits promised under the company's original plan. The parties have jointly requested a postponement of a court hearing to finalize the agreement, the details of which have not yet been made public.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old from Northern California, Julian Her, caught a massive 63.7-pound white sea bass during a family fishing trip in Tomales Bay. The impressive catch is now being submitted to the International Game Fish Association for verification as a potential junior world record. The current record, set in 2002, stands at 59 pounds. The young angler, who weighs only slightly more than his catch, has garnered significant local and media attention for his remarkable once-in-a-lifetime achievement.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, slowed to 3.1% in July from 3.3% in June, marking its lowest level since November 2024. While the figure was slightly higher than economists' expectations, it reflects a continued cooling trend, partly due to easing rice price inflation which had previously surged. The "core-core" inflation rate, which also excludes energy and is closely watched by the Bank of Japan, remained steady at 3.4%. This data comes as the central bank continues to face pressure regarding its monetary policy, with inflation remaining above its 2% target for the 40th consecutive month. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to deliver a highly anticipated speech at the annual Jackson Hole economic symposium, where markets will be looking for signals on future monetary policy. Analysts widely expect Powell to lay the groundwork for a potential interest rate cut in September, though he is likely to maintain a data-dependent stance. The address is also expected to touch upon the Fed's long-term policy framework review and reaffirm the central bank's independence amid political pressure from the Trump administration. The speech is seen as a critical moment for shaping near-term market sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Miami has ordered the complete closure of the "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention facility within 60 days, delivering a significant blow to the Trump administration's immigration policies. Judge Kathleen Williams ruled that the makeshift camp, built in the Florida Everglades, caused irreparable environmental damage and violated laws protecting the sensitive ecosystem. The injunction prohibits any new detainees from being brought to the site and mandates the removal of all camp infrastructure after the 60-day period. The ruling is a major victory for the environmental groups and the Native American tribe that filed the lawsuit.</p>
