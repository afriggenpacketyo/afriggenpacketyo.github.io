          <p>With the increasing frequency of rocket launches by companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin, physicists are studying the impact of sonic booms on communities. Kent Gee at Brigham Young University is leading research into the unique three-part sonic boom generated by Falcon 9 boosters, aiming to understand what noise levels are acceptable to the public. As SpaceX tests the larger and louder Starship rocket, there's a push to gather data to mitigate potential disruptions before they become widespread. The goal is not to halt launches, but to find ways to lessen the noise impact on surrounding areas, ensuring that space exploration can continue without negatively affecting communities.</p>

          <p>Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced the capture of Lenton Vanburen, the sixth inmate who escaped from a New Orleans jail earlier in May. Vanburen, who was originally serving time for parole violation and weapons charges, was apprehended in Baton Rouge. Ten inmates escaped on May 16 after forcing open a cell door and breaching a wall, with surveillance video capturing their escape through a loading dock. The escape went unnoticed for several hours due to the absence of a deputy in the area, and at least nine people have been arrested in connection with the incident, including a maintenance worker accused of aiding the escape.</p>

          <p>Senators Ted Cruz and Ben Ray Lujan have introduced a bipartisan bill to streamline the presidential permitting process for international bridges and land ports of entry with Mexico and Canada.

Mayor Victor Trevi√±o of Laredo expressed gratitude for the bipartisan effort and urged Congress to pass the bill, which also includes a provision barring future administrations from considering environmental documents created under the National Environmental Policy Act.</p>

          <p>Japan has lost its position as the world's largest creditor to Germany for the first time in 34 years, according to the Finance Ministry. While Japan's gross external assets rose to a record high of 533.05 trillion yen, it was surpassed by Germany's 569.65 trillion yen. The yen's depreciation increased the value of Japan's foreign-currency assets, and Germany benefited from a large current account surplus. Japan increased its net external credit for the seventh consecutive year, driven by direct investment in the United States, while the U.S. has a net external liability.</p>
