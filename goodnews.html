          <p>U.S. Representative Jerrold Nadler, a prominent liberal Democrat from New York, has announced he will not seek re-election, ending a 34-year career in Congress. Nadler, 78, cited the need for generational change within the Democratic party as a key factor in his decision. A vocal critic of Donald Trump and the chairman who steered articles of impeachment through the House Judiciary Committee in 2019, his departure marks the end of an era for a significant voice on the party's left flank. He expressed confidence in the Democrats' chances of retaking the House next year.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Marie Tidball, who has a congenital disability, is highlighting the significant accessibility challenges within the historic Houses of Parliament. Despite the Equalities Act being passed there, Tidball describes difficulties with basic access, from door handles to the long distances between committee rooms and accessible toilets. Her experience is part of a broader inquiry by the House of Commons Modernisation Committee, which has heard from several disabled MPs about the need for urgent improvements to make the building more inclusive and reflective of the 22% of the voting population with disabilities.</p>

          <p>The Old Faithful Inn, located in Yellowstone National Park, is celebrated as a national treasure and a benchmark for American national park architecture. Constructed in 1904, it is considered the largest log cabin in the world, built from thousands of uniquely twisted trees described as "freaks of the forest." The inn's iconic rustic style, known as "parkitecture," was so influential that it inspired the design of grand lodges in other major parks like Yosemite and Glacier. For over a century, it has survived natural disasters while welcoming millions of visitors.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge issued an emergency order to block the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala unless they have a formal deportation order. The ruling came just hours before planes were scheduled to take off, halting what lawyers for the children described as a rushed government plan to remove hundreds of minors. The judge's temporary restraining order was justified on the grounds that the government's plan appeared to circumvent legal protections that allow these children to seek humanitarian protection in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Musician Tom Odell shared a moving story about how a 2016 performance he considered a personal failure profoundly inspired a teenage Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas to pursue their own music careers. Years later, Eilish invited Odell to open for her world tour, a full-circle moment he described as a "wonderful lesson." The experience taught him that even on days when one feels they have nothing to offer, their actions can still have an unexpectedly positive and significant impact on others.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Liverpool's summer transfer window reveals how the club transformed from a relatively conservative spender into a record-breaker, with an outlay of £415 million. This shift was fueled by a combination of factors, including a build-up of funds from previous windows, significant commercial growth, and a strategic decision to capitalize on their recent Premier League title win. The club's ambition to evolve the team under new manager Arne Slot culminated in the British record signing of striker Alexander Isak, marking a new era in their transfer policy.</p>

          <p>A new scientific study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a significant human fossil found in a Greek cave, to be at least 286,000 years old. This finding, achieved through advanced uranium-series dating, places the skull firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era and resolves decades of conflicting age estimates. The fossil, likely belonging to the species Homo heidelbergensis, strengthens the theory that more primitive human populations coexisted alongside emerging Neanderthals. This discovery provides a critical key to understanding Europe's complex and branching human evolutionary history.</p>
