          <p>Secretary of War Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine visited Puerto Rico to reinforce the U.S. military's expanding operations against Caribbean drug cartels. The visit underscores the Trump administration's strategy to increase naval presence near Venezuela to disrupt narcotics trafficking, which recently included a lethal strike on a vessel allegedly carrying narco-terrorists. Puerto Rican Governor Jenniffer González-Colón welcomed the officials, highlighting the island's strategic role in the regional crackdown and supporting the administration's America First policies to secure borders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate dropping to its lowest level in nearly a year, prospective homebuyers can take steps to secure even better terms. Key strategies include improving one's credit score, as higher scores directly translate to lower interest rates, and increasing the down payment to at least 20% to reduce lender risk and avoid private mortgage insurance. Additionally, borrowers should consider alternatives to the standard 30-year fixed loan, such as an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), which can offer a significantly lower initial interest rate.

          <p>Shares of the online brokerage Robinhood experienced a significant surge after S&P Global announced its addition to the prestigious S&P 500 index, effective September 22. The inclusion, which ends months of speculation, is a major milestone for the company as it typically triggers substantial stock purchases from passive index funds that track the benchmark. Robinhood will replace Caesars Entertainment in the index, capping a strong year for the stock, which is up more than 210% year to date despite volatility since its 2021 public offering.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While most seniors cannot completely avoid paying for Medicare Part B, there are specific circumstances that allow for delaying enrollment or receiving financial assistance for the monthly premiums. The most common method is to remain on a creditable employer health plan after age 65, which allows for penalty-free delayed enrollment. For those with limited income, state-run Medicare Savings Programs or qualifying for Medicaid can cover the premiums. However, it is crucial to note that forgoing Part B can render seniors ineligible for essential supplemental coverage like Medigap or Medicare Advantage plans.</p>

          <h2>Evaluating High-Yield Savings Accounts Versus CDs for a $40,000 Deposit Amid Shifting Interest Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 15:52:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Savers with a significant sum like $40,000 face a choice between high-yield savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs), both of which still offer attractive returns. A key consideration is the long-term interest potential, as a CD locks in a fixed rate, protecting against future declines, whereas rates on savings accounts are variable. However, CDs require the depositor to leave the funds untouched for the entire term to avoid penalties, making high-yield savings a better option for those who need liquidity and access to their money.

          <p>Projections from Norway's parliamentary election indicate that Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere's center-left Labour Party is on track to secure a narrow victory. The left-leaning alliance is expected to win a slim majority of 87 seats in the 169-seat parliament, allowing the minority government to remain in power. The election campaign focused on domestic issues like inflation and public services, but international uncertainty, including the war in Ukraine and U.S. trade policies, may have encouraged voters to favor the stability of the incumbent government.</p>

          <p>England manager Thomas Tuchel has announced his intention to utilize long throw-ins as a key offensive strategy for the upcoming World Cup. This tactic, famously employed by Stoke City's Rory Delap over a decade ago, is seeing a resurgence in the Premier League for its effectiveness in creating scoring chances. With limited preparation time, Tuchel sees focusing on set-piece opportunities like throw-ins as an efficient way to gain a competitive edge. Experts like throw-in coach Thomas Gronnemark support the move as a sensible and potent addition to the team's arsenal.</p>

          <p>California is set to experience a significant cooldown this week as a low-pressure system moves in from the Pacific Northwest, bringing what meteorologists call an "early season cold front." Temperatures are expected to drop 10 to 20 degrees below normal, providing relief from recent sweltering heat and monsoon conditions. While Northern California may see soaking rains that could help suppress wildfire risks, Southern California is more likely to experience only light drizzle.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage rates falling to an 11-month low, many homeowners who bought during recent peaks are considering refinancing. A crucial factor is whether current rates are at least one percentage point lower than their existing rate, a common benchmark for justifying the move. Homeowners must also weigh the risk of waiting for potentially lower rates against the immediate savings, and carefully calculate the closing costs, which typically range from 2% to 6% of the loan amount, to ensure the long-term savings outweigh the upfront expense.

While a standard quarter-point cut remains the most likely scenario with an 88% probability, some traders believe the faltering labor market could prompt the central bank to take more aggressive easing action. The final decision will likely be influenced by upcoming inflation data, which could either solidify the case for a smaller cut or increase pressure for a larger one. (not investment advice)</p>
