          <p>Jerome Cohen, a highly respected and pioneering scholar of Chinese law, has died at the age of 95. As professor emeritus at New York University’s School of Law and founder of its US-Asia Law Institute, Cohen profoundly influenced global discussions on China's legal system, trade, and human rights over six decades. He was notably the first American to practice law in the country under Communist rule, and his writings on Chinese criminal procedure and international law are considered groundbreaking. The article highlights his reputation as both an advocate for Chinese dissidents and a proponent of continued engagement with Beijing, solidifying his towering impact on the field of Asian law.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly's oral weight loss pill, orforglipron, has demonstrated "meaningful weight loss" and cardiometabolic improvements in phase 3 clinical trials for adults without diabetes. Over 72 weeks, participants on the highest dose achieved an average loss of 27.3 pounds, with many losing 10-15% of their body weight. The article notes that while its safety profile is consistent with existing GLP-1 injectables, some medical professionals suggest its weight loss results might be less pronounced than with injectables. Eli Lilly plans to seek regulatory approval for both obesity and type 2 diabetes treatment, potentially by 2026, positioning it as a convenient oral alternative to current injectable medications. This development could address obesity as a global health challenge.</p>

          <p>California's Senate Bill 576, awaiting the governor's signature, seeks to prohibit streaming services from playing commercials louder than their programming. The legislation was spurred by consumer complaints, particularly from new parents like Richael Keller, whose baby was disturbed by blaring ads. While the federal CALM Act already regulates broadcast and cable TV, it doesn't cover streaming. The article explains how sound engineers can make ads seem louder while staying within average loudness rules. Streaming industry groups initially opposed the bill, citing control issues, but became neutral after an amendment removed private lawsuit provisions, highlighting a growing regulatory focus on streaming content.</p>

          <p>As China drafts its 15th five-year plan, a key focus is addressing the urgent financial woes of local governments. The article highlights a recent clampdown on undeclared overseas income, with wealthy individuals in Hubei and other provinces facing significant back taxes and late fees. This aggressive enforcement, though China has long required such taxes, marks a departure from previously lax and discretionary collection. The moves are part of a broader effort to secure cash for local administrations, and the upcoming five-year plan is expected to outline strategies to alleviate these financial pressures and inform high-level policy priorities.

          <p>China has officially endorsed Brazil's $125 billion Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF), a significant fund designed to reward nations for preserving tropical forests. Announced at a New York sideline event, this initiative gains crucial momentum ahead of COP30. The TFFF will invest in low-risk assets, channeling returns to tropical countries based on forest preservation, with penalties for deforestation and a fifth of resources allocated to Indigenous peoples. Brazilian President Lula da Silva pledged $1 billion, urging other nations to contribute to this "investment in humanity" against climate chaos, emphasizing its potential to provide predictable, long-term finance for vital forest basins.

          <p>Major League Baseball will introduce a player challenge system for called balls and strikes starting in the 2026 season, following years of testing in minor leagues and a major-league debut in spring training. This automated strike zone (ABS) system allows batters, pitchers, and catchers to challenge calls, with an automated video displaying the pitch's location. Each team begins with two challenges, retaining one if the call is overturned. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred stated the system balances the umpire's role with correcting missed calls and preserving game pace. Players who experienced the system in trials generally found it to be a positive change that doesn't slow the game.</p>

Experts suggest Canada, with its world-class institutions and proximity to the U.S., is a natural destination for these workers.

It clarifies that research findings are uncertain; while some studies show an association, others, particularly a large Swedish sibling study, found the link disappeared when controlling for genetics and other factors, suggesting no causal effect. Medical experts emphasize that untreated fever and pain during pregnancy pose known dangers, and acetaminophen remains one of the safest over-the-counter options. The FDA's new warning advises minimizing routine use for low-grade fevers but balances this with the drug's established safety for more serious conditions.

For instance, a 10-year loan at 8.43% costs $494.45 monthly. It also compares these to Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), which offer even lower variable rates but carry the risk of future increases.
