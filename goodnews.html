          <h2>Stock Market Recovers After Initial Fears Over Trump's Trade Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 15:41:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wall Street has rebounded from April's downturn, fueled by hopes for renewed trade discussions between the U.S. and China. Despite this recovery, investors remain concerned about the potential economic consequences of President Trump's trade policies, including tariffs on various imports. While the S&P 500 has largely recovered its losses, it remains below its February high, and questions persist about the long-term impact of tariffs on economic growth, hiring, and investment. The article suggests that while recent optimism has buoyed the market, the underlying concerns about the economic fallout from trade policies have not entirely dissipated.</p>

          <p>Following the Trump administration's dismissal of scientists working on the National Climate Assessment report, two scientific associations are soliciting research to continue the report's work. The American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union aim to "sustain the momentum" of the report, which assesses the impacts of climate change in the United States. The NCA is considered important for future projections and decision-making, and the Trump administration's decision to cancel the report has drawn criticism from scientists who emphasize the necessity of the report for dealing with the future impacts of climate change.</p>

          <p>Temu, the Chinese e-commerce platform, has ceased direct shipments from China to the U.S. due to the expiration of the de minimis rule and new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The company has shifted to fulfilling orders from U.S.-based warehouses and is actively recruiting local sellers to join the platform. This change in strategy aims to circumvent higher levies and maintain pricing for American shoppers. The article also notes that other retailers like Shein have raised prices to account for the new tariffs.</p>

          <p>Major footwear brands, including Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour, are requesting a tariff exemption from President Trump, citing an "existential threat" to the footwear industry. The companies argue that the tariffs pose a significant burden on affordable footwear for lower and middle-income families. The Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America trade group warned that the tariffs would not bring manufacturing back to the U.S. and would instead create uncertainty for businesses.</p>
