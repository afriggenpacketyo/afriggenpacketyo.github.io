        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission proposed weakening environmental conditions tied to agricultural subsidies in response to widespread farmer protests across the EU. These protests were triggered by concerns over EU regulations and cheap imports. The proposed changes aim to reduce the administrative burden on farmers, potentially saving them up to ‚Ç¨1.58 billion annually. Smaller farmers would be exempt from conditions linking subsidies to environmental regulations, and certified organic farms would be considered automatically compliant. The Commission hopes these measures will boost farmers' competitiveness and allow them to focus on food production while protecting natural resources.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. drug overdose deaths experienced a significant decline in 2024, with 30,000 fewer deaths compared to the previous year, marking the largest one-year drop ever recorded. Provisional data from the CDC estimates around 80,000 overdose deaths, a 27% decrease from 110,000 in 2023. Experts attribute this decline to increased naloxone availability, expanded addiction treatment, and shifts in drug use patterns. Despite the positive trend, concerns persist that reductions in federal funding could hinder further progress. The Trump administration's view of opioids as primarily a law enforcement issue also worries public health leaders, who advocate for a public health approach focused on support rather than punishment.</p>

The decision comes after the merger of Discovery Communications and WarnerMedia, and the subsequent addition of Discovery+ content.

          <p>Chinese researchers are facing challenges in pursuing groundbreaking ideas due to a system that prioritizes immediate results and established reputations. Many researchers find themselves burdened with administrative duties, limiting their time for actual research. The competitive tenure and funding system, which favors factors like awards, further discourages exploratory projects. This environment makes it difficult for researchers to invest the necessary time and effort into truly original concepts, hindering China's potential for scientific breakthroughs.
