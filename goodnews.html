          <p>William H. Webster, a distinguished public servant who uniquely led both the FBI and the CIA, has passed away at the age of 101. His extensive career included serving as FBI director under Presidents Carter and Reagan from 1978 to 1987, followed by his role as CIA director until 1991. Before his agency leadership, Webster was a U.S. Navy lieutenant in two wars, a federal judge, and a U.S. Attorney.

          <p>Scientists in China have successfully synthesized high-purity hexagonal diamonds, a rare structure first discovered in a meteorite in 1967. This variant, known as lonsdaleite, is believed to form under the extreme heat and pressure of meteorite impacts and has a different atomic arrangement than common cubic diamonds. The research team produced crystals up to 100 micrometres in size, a significant achievement that provides definitive proof of the material's existence on a macroscopic scale. This breakthrough could pave the way for new applications leveraging the unique properties of hexagonal diamonds.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders delivered a standout performance in his NFL preseason debut, earning praise from figures like LeBron James. Sanders, a fifth-round draft pick, threw for 138 yards and two touchdowns in the first half against the Carolina Panthers, leading his team to a 30-10 victory. Despite starting as fourth on the depth chart, his poise and effectiveness in leading three touchdown drives have sparked discussion about his future role. Sanders remained focused on his performance, stating he doesn't worry about factors outside of his control like the team's depth chart.</p>

          <p>Fire crews have made significant progress on the Canyon fire burning near the Los Angeles and Ventura county line, reaching 28% containment on the 5,370-acre blaze. This progress allowed authorities to downgrade evacuation orders to warnings for approximately 2,700 residents, with all other warnings being lifted. The fire, which started during a heatwave, destroyed at least two structures and resulted in three minor injuries to firefighters. Despite the positive developments, officials remain cautious due to hot weather, rugged terrain, and extremely dry fuel conditions in the area.</p>

          <p>Frustrated by the negative experiences and mental fatigue associated with dating apps, 30-year-old founder Lucy Rout has launched Haystack Dating, a company that hosts in-person events. The model aims to create safer, more meaningful connections by matching attendees into small groups based on an algorithm that considers interests and personality traits. This move taps into a growing trend of people seeking real-life interactions, as data shows a decline in users for major dating apps like Tinder and Hinge. The events focus on shared activities to foster genuine connections and better behavior than is often found online.</p>

          <p>Actor Chris Hemsworth has described learning he has a heightened genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's disease as a significant "gear shift" in his life. During a genetic test for a documentary series, he discovered he carries two copies of the APOE4 gene, increasing his likelihood of developing the disorder by eight to ten times. Hemsworth stated the revelation prompted a shift in his motivations, focusing more on purpose, contribution, and living a healthier life to maximize time with his family. This new perspective influenced the second season of his show, making it a more personal and educational exploration of health.</p>

          <h2>Economic Uncertainty Fuels 'Treatonomics' Trend of Spending on Small Luxuries and Experiences</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-08 22:11:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is on the rise, as people spend on small, affordable luxuries and larger, memorable experiences to boost morale during uncertain economic times. This phenomenon expands on the classic "lipstick effect," where consumers buy small treats when they cannot afford major purchases. Analysts note that in the current climate, consumers may cut back on daily expenses but will splurge on items like concert tickets or collectibles for a sense of joy and enrichment. This shift is partly driven by changing life milestones, with many people celebrating smaller "inch-stones" rather than traditional achievements like home ownership.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the NASA astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has died at the age of 97. Lovell is celebrated for his calm leadership that helped guide his crew safely back to Earth after an oxygen tank explosion crippled their spacecraft on its way to the moon in 1970. This event became known as a "successful failure." He was also a member of the Apollo 8 crew, the first mission to orbit the moon in 1968, during which he famously described Earth as a "grand oasis in the vastness of space." Lovell's family remembered him as their hero with unshakeable optimism.</p>

          <p>A fire broke out in a chapel within the historic Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba, Spain, but was quickly extinguished by firefighters, averting a potential disaster. The mayor of Cordoba praised the "rapid and magnificent intervention" of the fire crews. The blaze, which may have been caused by a short circuit in an electric sweeper, sent smoke billowing from the UNESCO World Heritage Site. The building, a jewel of Islamic architecture from the 8th century that was converted into a cathedral in the 13th century, is a major tourist attraction and a symbol of the city's rich history.</p>

The lawsuit, brought by several county district attorneys, claimed that Walmart sold items, including produce and prepared foods, that weighed less than what their labels indicated, a violation of state law. As part of the settlement, Walmart will pay $5.5 million in civil penalties and implement measures to ensure accurate weighing and pricing in its California stores.

          <p>Actress Gina Carano and Disney have settled the lawsuit she filed after being fired from the show "The Mandalorian" in 2021 over her controversial social media posts. This article argues the settlement was the right decision, characterizing her firing as an overreaction to posts that were ignorant rather than malicious. It notes that while social media outrage led to her termination, the company's decision to settle, and even express hope for future collaboration, represents a reasonable resolution. The author suggests the initial firing, not the settlement, was the real capitulation to pressure.</p>
