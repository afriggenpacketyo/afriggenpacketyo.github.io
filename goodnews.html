        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump lauded Elon Musk for his work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as Musk's tenure as a "special government employee" concludes. Trump credited Musk with overhauling the federal government and saving roughly $170 billion, though some analyses dispute this figure. While Musk's official role is ending, Trump suggested Musk will remain involved, continuing to advise the administration. Musk defended DOGE's work, stating he expects it will achieve its $1 trillion savings goal over time, despite criticism over cuts to various programs and agencies. </p>

          <p>Elon Musk wrapped up his time as the public face of DOGE, leaving behind an estimated $175 billion in government cost-cutting. These savings came from slashing government contracts, selling assets, and identifying improper payments. Trump highlighted specific cuts, such as funding for Arab Sesame Street and transgender mice research. Musk maintains that the savings will continue to build, reaching $1 trillion in the coming years, despite challenges from negative press, lawsuits, and the need for congressional approval. </p>

          <p>Loretta Swit, known for her role as Maj. Margaret Houlihan on the TV series "M*A*S*H," has died at 87. Swit starred on stage and screen, but she was best known for her role as a foil to Alan Alda's Capt. Benjamin Franklin "Hawkeye" Pierce on "M*A*S*H," which aired for 11 seasons on CBS, from 1972 to 1983. Swit won two Emmys for her performances on "M*A*S*H" and was nominated eight other times for her work on the show. As the show developed and incorporated more dramatic plot lines with the comedic ones, Swit wanted to portray Houlihan as more than the "Hot Lips" nickname her character was given. </p>

The CDC's stance underscores the agency's continued support for COVID-19 vaccination for children, aligning with its broader recommendations for immunization.

In Nepal, the government is conducting a monkey census to understand the extent of complaints about monkeys stealing food from people's property.
