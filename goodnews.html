          <p>Crystal Palace defeated Liverpool 2-1 in a thrilling Premier League match, ending Liverpool's unbeaten streak. Palace dominated the first half but only led by one goal, allowing Liverpool to equalize late in the game. However, a 97th-minute winner from Eddie Nketiah secured a historic victory for Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. The result moves Palace to second in the league table and highlights their impressive form under manager Oliver Glasner, extending their unbeaten run to 18 games.</p>

          <p>Pakistan's first nationwide HPV vaccination campaign, aimed at preventing cervical cancer in girls, is facing a significant wave of misinformation. False claims, including that the vaccine is dangerous and causes infertility, have been spread through AI-generated videos and by a local politician. This fact-check article refutes these claims, citing extensive scientific research from global health organizations that confirms the vaccine's safety and effectiveness in reducing HPV infections. The spread of these rumors echoes past vaccine skepticism in Pakistan, which has previously hampered public health initiatives like polio eradication campaigns.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems has settled its $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit against Rudy Giuliani, a former attorney for Donald Trump. The lawsuit, filed in January 2021, accused Giuliani of spreading damaging falsehoods about the company's voting machines following the 2020 presidential election. The terms of the settlement are confidential, and a court filing shows both parties have voluntarily agreed to dismiss the case. This resolution follows a similar confidential settlement Dominion reached just days earlier with another former Trump attorney, Sidney Powell, in a separate defamation case.</p>

          <h2>New Study Finds Wild Chimpanzees Regularly Consume Alcohol from Fermented Fruit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 14:10:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study has revealed that chimpanzees in the wild regularly consume significant amounts of alcohol by eating fermented fruit. Researchers observed that the animals ingest a daily dose equivalent to a small bottle of beer for a human. This behavior, documented in national parks in Uganda and the Ivory Coast, suggests that alcohol consumption is not exclusively a human cultural phenomenon and may have deep evolutionary roots. The findings support the "drunken monkey hypothesis," which posits that an attraction to ethanol evolved in our primate ancestors.</p>

          <p>For the eighth year in a row, Finland has been named the happiest country in the world according to the World Happiness Report. The report measures happiness based on citizens' evaluation of their own lives on a scale of zero to ten. Experts suggest Finnish happiness is rooted more in contentment and societal well-being than in daily expressions of joy. Factors contributing to this include a strong social safety net, accessible public services like comprehensive libraries, high trust in institutions, and a close connection to nature, all of which create a stable and supportive environment for citizens.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents an analysis of Colgate-Palmolive, arguing that the Dividend King's stock is currently undervalued. The company demonstrates strong financial health with a 33% return on invested capital and a history of successful acquisitions and product innovation. Currently trading at a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio below its historical average, its dividend yield of 2.5% is also unusually high. With a low dividend payout ratio and consistent share buybacks, the company is positioned for steady, long-term growth, making it an attractive option for conservative investors.

          <p>Beyond their on-field dominance, England's Women's Rugby World Cup victory was built on a consciously cultivated and inclusive team environment. This contrasts with the experience some players had during the previous campaign three years ago. Head coach John Mitchell and the players made a collective effort to foster unity through team-bonding activities like movie nights and by keeping all squad members involved, regardless of selection. This focus on "being where our feet are" and supporting one another helped the team manage the pressure of being both tournament hosts and heavy favorites.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced that an Israeli-made Patriot air defense system has been operational in Ukraine for the past month, with two more systems expected to arrive this fall. This development is notable given Israel's previous reluctance to provide military aid to Ukraine and its complex relationship with Russia. In other news, Ukrainian drones reportedly struck a key Russian oil pumping station. Separately, the International Paralympic Committee has controversially lifted its ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes, a decision condemned by Ukraine's sports minister as a betrayal of Olympic values.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the unique power of young adult literature, using Judy Blume's iconic novel "Forever," which turns 50 this year, as a central example. Such books often serve as a rite of passage, providing young readers with a rare glimpse into topics like sexuality from a female perspective. The piece argues that the appeal of these novels lies in their ability to validate the private anxieties and desires of teenagers. By reflecting their inner worlds, these stories help young people feel seen and understood during a formative and often confusing period of their lives.</p>

          <p>Belva Davis, a trailblazing journalist who became the first Black woman television reporter on the U.S. West Coast, has died at the age of 92.

Davis became a trusted and respected figure in the Bay Area, covering major stories from the assassination of Harvey Milk to the AIDS crisis for stations like KPIX and KQED. Remembered as a mentor who opened doors for a new generation of journalists, she won eight regional Emmy Awards during her distinguished career.</p>
