          <p>Maria Van Kerkhove, a top global health expert at the WHO, delivered a commencement address at Georgetown, urging graduates to challenge existing healthcare systems and innovate in the face of uncertainty. She highlighted the impact of the Trump administration's actions, including withdrawing from the WHO and halting technical exchanges, which have been detrimental to global health efforts. Van Kerkhove emphasized the importance of collaboration and the need for new approaches to address global health challenges, particularly in pandemic preparedness. She noted that the pandemic accord is crucial for ensuring equitable access to medical countermeasures and promoting international cooperation. </p>

          <p>A recent report indicates an increase in treasure finds across the United Kingdom, offering an opportunity for tourists interested in metal detecting. The U.K. Office for National Statistics reported millions of overseas visits, and the British government's coroners' report showed a 12% increase in reported treasure finds. "Treasure" is defined as objects at least 200 years old with significant historical or cultural importance. Devon, Dorset, Norfolk, Suffolk, and Yorkshire are among the counties with the highest number of finds, though new tourism-related fees have been implemented. </p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are proceeding cautiously with Shohei Ohtani's return to pitching, prioritizing his role as a hitter due to the team's depleted pitching staff. Tyler Glasnow and Blake Snell are sidelined, leaving Yoshinobu Yamamoto as the only reliable starter. The Dodgers face a challenging stretch of games against winning teams, making Ohtani's bat crucial, and the team aims to avoid jeopardizing his offensive capabilities by exposing him to unnecessary risks on the mound. The team will need to rely on less consistent pitchers and manage their bullpen carefully. </p>
