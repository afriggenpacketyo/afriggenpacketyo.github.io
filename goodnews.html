          <p>Following a record-breaking Powerball drawing where winning tickets were sold, a data analysis reveals significant disparities in take-home winnings based on state tax laws. Winners in states like California and Texas, which do not tax lottery prizes, receive the largest payouts after federal taxes are deducted. Conversely, states with high income tax rates, such as New York and Minnesota, see the lowest net winnings for jackpot recipients. The article breaks down the financial implications for winners depending on their location and choice between an annuity or a lump-sum payment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The South Korean government has announced a deal with the United States to release over 300 of its citizens who were detained during a large-scale immigration raid at a Hyundai electric vehicle plant in Georgia. The raid, part of the Trump administration's broader immigration enforcement agenda, targeted a manufacturing site still under construction. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained 475 people in total, sparking concern from Seoul, a key U.S. ally. South Korea plans to send a charter plane to bring the workers home once administrative procedures are finalized.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot reached an estimated $1.8 billion, the second-largest prize in the game's history, with winning tickets ultimately sold in both Missouri and Texas. The drawing concluded a three-month period without a grand prize winner, driving the total to its historic high. The winning numbers were 11, 23, 44, 61, 62, with a Powerball of 17. A single winner choosing the cash option would receive an estimated $826.4 million before taxes. The odds of winning the jackpot stand at a staggering 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>English cricketer Jacob Bethell has expressed that he probably should have played more during a challenging first home summer in his international career. The 21-year-old all-rounder, who had an impressive debut Test series last winter, found himself in a limited role this season. After missing a Test against Zimbabwe due to his Indian Premier League commitments, he lost his spot in the Test XI and was used sparingly. Bethell acknowledged the lack of match time but stated he will learn from the experience and views the break as potentially beneficial for his future.</p>

          <p>Hypertension, known as the "silent killer," affects over half of Americans by age 40 and significantly increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and dementia. New guidelines from the American Heart Association advocate for earlier intervention, recommending lifestyle changes once blood pressure exceeds 130/80 mm Hg and medication for readings of 140/90 or higher. Effective management includes a low-sodium diet, regular exercise, limited alcohol, and stress reduction techniques. Additionally, a new class of medication targeting the hormone aldosterone shows promise in treating resistant hypertension, offering a potential new tool for patients.</p>

          <p>With gold prices surging to new records amid economic uncertainty and expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, investors are increasingly looking to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset. Financial experts generally recommend gaining exposure through low-cost, liquid exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track physical gold, such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), rather than owning physical bullion. While gold can act as a hedge during volatile times, advisors caution against over-allocation, typically suggesting that it comprise less than 3% of a diversified investment portfolio.

          <p>A Utah judge has invalidated the state's congressional map, ruling that the Republican-controlled legislature unconstitutionally overrode the will of voters who had established an independent redistricting commission. In 2018, voters approved a measure to end gerrymandering, but lawmakers ignored it and passed a map that heavily favored the GOP by splitting Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County. The ruling, which orders a new map to be drawn, is a significant victory for voting rights advocates. It stands in contrast to a national trend where both parties are increasingly attempting to draw partisan maps to secure electoral advantages.</p>

          <p>The latest transfer window has highlighted the growing financial disparity between England's Premier League, which spent over £3 billion, and Spain's La Liga, with a comparatively modest £592 million outlay. This gap is largely due to La Liga's strict economic controls, implemented in 2013 to ensure financial sustainability after numerous clubs faced bankruptcy. While these rules have stabilized the league and attracted investors, they have also limited spending power. Despite the financial constraints, Spanish clubs continue to perform strongly in European competitions, leveraging robust youth academies to remain competitive against their wealthier English counterparts.

          <p>A total lunar eclipse will be visible across parts of the United Kingdom, turning the full moon a reddish color in an event commonly known as a "Blood Moon." The spectacle occurs when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow on the lunar surface. The red hue is caused by sunlight filtering through Earth's atmosphere. While the full eclipse will be visible from 18:30 to 19:52 BST, viewing in the UK is dependent on local moonrise times, with eastern areas getting the best and longest view. The next total lunar eclipse visible from the UK will not occur until 2026.</p>

His canonization was fast-tracked by the Vatican in an effort to inspire faith among young people. The process required proof of two miracles attributed to his intercession.
