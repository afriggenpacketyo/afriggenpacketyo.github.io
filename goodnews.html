          <p>With mortgage rates hovering near 7%, prospective homebuyers face the difficult decision of whether to lock in a rate now or wait for a potential drop. Experts suggest that while rates feel high compared to the pandemic era, locking in is advisable for those already under contract for a home to avoid market volatility. However, those with more flexibility, a good credit score they are still improving, or casually searching for a home might benefit from waiting, as a potential Federal Reserve rate cut this fall could provide some relief.

          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler, a 78-year-old Democrat and the longest-serving New Yorker in the House, has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026. Citing the "necessity for generational change in the party," Nadler stated his decision was influenced by observing the challenges faced by older political leaders. First elected in 1992, Nadler has had a prominent career, including chairing the House Judiciary Committee and serving as a manager during Donald Trump's first impeachment. His retirement opens up his seat for a new generation of leadership.</p>

          <p>This article profiles three scientists who discovered they carry two copies of the APOE4 gene variant, which gives them a 60% chance of developing Alzheimer's disease. Instead of succumbing to despair, they have channeled their expertise into proactive measures, including participating in clinical trials, advocating for research funding, and leading drug discovery efforts. One scientist is focused on lifestyle interventions like diet and exercise, while another runs clinical trials for drugs specifically targeting the APOE4 genotype. Their stories highlight a shift towards preventative action and advocacy within the high-risk community.</p>

          <p>Swedish "buy now, pay later" firm Klarna is aiming to raise as much as $1.27 billion in its highly anticipated U.S. initial public offering. The company plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "KLAR," with shares priced between $35 and $37, potentially valuing the company at up to $14 billion. The majority of the shares in the offering will be sold by existing stakeholders rather than the company itself. The IPO filing revealed a 20% year-on-year revenue increase for the June quarter, though its net loss also widened. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For savers looking to protect their money from inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) currently offer competitive returns, with many top accounts outpacing the current inflation rate. While national average yields for CDs are relatively low, online banks are offering significantly higher rates, particularly for short-term CDs of six months to one year. This phenomenon, known as an inverted yield curve, presents an opportunity for savers to lock in strong returns. Experts suggest strategies like laddering CDs to maximize earnings while maintaining some liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are pointing to a "golden opportunity" for investors to potentially pay a 0% tax rate on long-term capital gains, thanks to new deductions in recent legislation. The 0% bracket applies to individuals with taxable income up to $48,350 or married couples with income up to $96,700 for 2025. With an increased standard deduction and other new tax breaks, more investors may fall into this bracket, allowing them to sell profitable assets without a tax penalty. This can be used for strategies like "tax-gain harvesting" or resetting an asset's cost basis. (not investment advice)</p>

He expressed interest in collaborating with former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's new left-wing movement to challenge the government.

          <p>Landslides are a common and deadly geological event, affecting millions globally and often triggered by factors like excessive rainfall, earthquakes, or human activity. This article explains that they are broadly classified into four types—falls, topples, slides, and flows—based on how the land moves. The failure of slope materials to resist downward forces is the primary cause, a pressure that can be exacerbated by natural events or industrial activities. While destructive, landslides can be prevented through engineering solutions like improving drainage and building retaining walls.</p>

This share far outpaces the industry average and has allowed Cadillac to attract customers from rival luxury brands like Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW.
