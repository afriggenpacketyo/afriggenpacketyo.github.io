          <p>The U.S. government recorded a budget surplus of $258.4 billion in April 2025, driven by large individual tax deposits, marking the first monthly surplus of the fiscal year and the second-largest in U.S. history. Despite this surplus, the government still faces a $1.049 trillion deficit for the fiscal year so far, with Social Security, net interest, and Medicare representing the largest outlays. The article suggests ways to improve personal fiscal health, including cutting wasteful spending, shopping around for cheaper car insurance, avoiding bank fees, and creating passive income streams through real estate.

          <p>Harvard University has discovered that a document in its archives, previously thought to be an unofficial copy, is actually one of the few remaining original copies of King Edward I's reaffirmation of the Magna Carta. The article humorously suggests that this discovery comes at a fortuitous time, as Donald Trump has frozen federal grants and contracts to the university. While the Magna Carta may not be a financial windfall, it serves as a powerful symbol of the importance of checks and balances and the limitations of power, values that are currently being challenged. The author argues that the Magna Carta is a reminder of the duty to push back against unchecked authority. </p>

          <p>This article discusses the evolving role of college chaplains in an era where fewer young people identify with established religions. The article highlights that college students are attending religious-life programs in larger numbers than they have in decades, and many colleges have more chaplains than in the early 2000s. Chaplains are now embracing alternative forms of spirituality and self-care, and are engaging with students on a range of issues beyond traditional faith, such as housing insecurity, safety threats, and campus protests. The article emphasizes that chaplains are providing a sense of belonging, meaning, and purpose for students, regardless of their religious beliefs. </p>
