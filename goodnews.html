          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has not endorsed Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, citing a need for further discussion on Mamdani's vision. While Jeffries praised the campaign's focus on affordability and organizational success, he expressed concerns over Mamdani's past rhetoric, particularly regarding Israel and antisemitism. Jeffries stated that the self-proclaimed democratic socialist will need to clarify his positions to gain the confidence of the communities he represents. The two politicians, whose districts do not overlap, plan to meet in person to discuss these issues.</p>

          <p>Communities across the globe have been celebrating Pride Month throughout June with parades, festivals, and demonstrations, honoring the legacy of the 1969 Stonewall Uprising. These events serve as both a celebration of LGBTQ+ identity and a symbol of the continuing struggle for equal rights and inclusion. From Washington, D.C., to Kathmandu, participants have gathered, often wrapped in rainbow flags and carrying protest signs. The month of events, which first received U.S. federal recognition in 1999, culminates in major marches like the one scheduled in New York City.</p>

          <p>A new biography, "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America" by Sam Tanenhaus, explores the origins of the modern conservative movement through its intellectual leader, William F. Buckley, Jr. An excerpt from the book details his upbringing, heavily influenced by his father, a wealthy oil speculator, and his family's deep Catholic faith. It describes the family's grand estate in Sharon, Connecticut, named Great Elm, where the young Buckley was one of ten children. This environment shaped the future founder of the National Review and host of "Firing Line," who saw himself as an heir to a legacy rather than a founder.</p>

          <p>A new biography by Sam Tanenhaus, "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America," posits that William F. Buckley Jr. was the founder of the modern conservative political movement. The article explores how Buckley, through his magazine National Review and TV show "Firing Line," catalyzed a movement that elevated figures like Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan. Tanenhaus argues that Buckley's intellectual and cultural influence paved the way for the modern Republican Party and, ultimately, for Donald Trump. The analysis also touches on Buckley's controversial views, including his early opposition to civil rights legislation.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has significantly altered its flagship welfare reform bill following a threatened rebellion from over 120 of its own backbench MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the government had to shift its approach after substantial concerns were raised about planned cuts to benefits like the Personal Independence Payment (PIP). Key concessions include limiting PIP cuts to new claimants and allowing the health-related component of Universal Credit to rise with inflation for existing recipients. Rebel MPs expressed satisfaction with the changes, likely ensuring the bill's passage.</p>

          <p>The upcoming movie "Superman," directed by James Gunn, presents a new take on the iconic hero, portrayed by actor David Corenswet. Gunn explains his vision for a more vulnerable character who is not indestructible and feels more grounded, while Corenswet discusses the challenge of embodying a lonely alien who desperately wants to be part of humanity. The film, the first from the new DC Studios, seeks to honor the legacy of Christopher Reeve's portrayal while offering a fresh perspective. Corenswet, like Reeve, is a Juilliard-trained actor, bringing a theatrical depth to the role.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service is warning Americans about a "brushing" scam where individuals receive unsolicited packages containing low-value items. This scheme is used by third-party online sellers who have obtained personal information to create fake transactions and post fraudulent "verified" reviews in the recipient's name. While receiving a free item may seem harmless, it indicates a potential data breach that could lead to identity theft or financial fraud. The USPS advises reporting such incidents, checking financial accounts for unusual activity, and updating passwords to protect personal information.</p>

          <p>A new analysis challenges the narrative of a Gen Z "sex recession," arguing that while young people may be having less sex, they are leading a new sexual revolution. The article suggests that this generation is more sexually progressive, actively questioning traditional definitions of virginity, sex, and gender roles. They are also highly adept at connecting their personal experiences with sexuality to broader political issues, such as reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ advocacy. This shift is happening against a backdrop of rising sexual conservatism, creating a defining cultural and political battle for the generation.</p>

Despite economic uncertainty, the report notes persistent progress in savings behaviors, partly driven by plan design features like automatic enrollment.

In a startup environment, Jain explains, every team member must be able to identify a problem, get into the details to devise a solution, and personally see it through.
