          <p>President Trump adopted a conciliatory tone during his meeting with the new Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, despite previously criticizing Canada and joking about annexing it as the 51st state. Trump expressed his affection for Canada, surprising many given his recent rhetoric. Carney, however, firmly rejected the idea of Canada becoming part of the U.S., asserting that Canada is not for sale. The meeting covered a range of topics, including trade relations, with Trump stating that tariffs on Canadian goods would remain in place, leading to continued discussions on trade and other complex issues between the two nations. The meeting aimed to foster a friendly relationship despite existing tensions.</p>

          <p>The Met Gala appearances of Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan and artist Diljit Dosanjh, marked their first times at the event, but sparked disappointment among some South Asian fans who felt they were not given due respect. During an interview with Khan, Vogue's livestream co-hosts appeared unaware of his global fame, leading to an awkward exchange. Diljit Dosanjh's arrival was briefly shown on the livestream before the camera quickly panned away, and he was not interviewed. Fans expressed their frustration online, emphasizing the significant international followings both stars have cultivated and suggesting that their cultural impact was not adequately acknowledged during the event's coverage.</p>

          <p>A plant in Shanxi, China, is being upgraded with French technology to produce aluminum from China's low-grade ore, potentially reducing the country's reliance on imported bauxite. China, a top aluminum producer and consumer, has depended on imports from Guinea and Australia due to its lack of high-quality bauxite. The new technology, developed by French chemist Yves Ocello from IB2, neutralizes silica and sulfur, enabling the use of high-silica bauxite in the Bayer process. IB2 signed a 22-year agreement with Chinese firm Liulin Senze Coal & Aluminum in 2023 to implement the technology, aligning with Beijing's plan for a greener aluminum industry.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly stated that Canada is "not for sale" during an Oval Office meeting with President Trump, who had romanticized the idea of Canada joining the U.S. Trump, who has repeatedly floated the idea of acquiring Canada, said there would be "tremendous" benefits to Canada in the event of a "wonderful marriage" between the two countries. Carney emphasized the importance of partnership and building together, despite tensions on trade and borders. The meeting also addressed trade discussions, with Carney cautioning not to expect confirmation of progress until a deal is reached.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing a new law to make climbing on the Winston Churchill statue in Parliament Square a criminal offense, as part of the Crime and Policing Bill. This measure aims to protect war memorials and monuments from desecration, with offenders facing potential prison sentences and fines. The decision follows several incidents where demonstrators targeted the statue, including spraying graffiti and using it as a platform for protests. Prime Minister Starmer emphasized the deep respect for Churchill and the need to criminalize acts that disrespect his legacy and the sacrifices of the greatest generation.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's team lobbied officials in West Lake Hills, Texas, to keep details of his mansion and security operations private, citing his work with the Trump administration as justification. The request was made in response to a disagreement with neighbors over the construction of a 16-foot fence and gate without proper permits. Musk's staff argued that as a "federal public official," his property records should be exempt from public records laws. However, the city attorney ruled against a closed meeting, and Musk lost his appeal to keep the fence and gate on his property at a Zoning and Planning Commission meeting.</p>
