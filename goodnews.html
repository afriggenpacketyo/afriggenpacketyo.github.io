          <p>Nvidia's stock has turned positive for the year, joining Meta Platforms and Microsoft as the third "Magnificent Seven" member to achieve this milestone amid a broader market recovery. The surge followed CEO Jensen Huang's announcement of a significant AI chip sale to Saudi Arabia, potentially mitigating revenue headwinds from China restrictions. Analysts suggest this deal could offset billions in revenue losses tied to China's shipping constraints. While Nvidia's market capitalization has surpassed $3 trillion, the stock remains below its 52-week high from January. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With inflation declining and interest rate cuts on the horizon, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) is emerging as an attractive borrowing option for homeowners. HELOCs offer relatively low interest rates compared to personal loans and credit cards, allowing homeowners to leverage their equity for various financial needs. As home equity levels remain elevated, homeowners can access substantial funds while maintaining a healthy equity buffer. However, borrowers should carefully assess their repayment capabilities and consider potential interest rate fluctuations before opting for a HELOC.</p>
