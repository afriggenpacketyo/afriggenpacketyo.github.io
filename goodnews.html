          <p>Indonesia and the United States have commenced their largest annual joint military exercises, "Super Garuda Shield," involving forces from 11 other countries. These drills, featuring over 4,000 Indonesian and 1,300 American troops, aim to bolster stability in the Asia-Pacific region and enhance deterrence against potential threats. The exercises take place amidst U.S. efforts to encourage allies to take China's growing influence more seriously, though Washington maintains the drills are not aimed at Beijing. China, however, views these expanded exercises as an attempt to create an "Asian NATO" to limit its regional power.</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C. students are returning to school this week amidst President Trump's surge of National Guard troops and federal law enforcement, a move Mayor Muriel Bowser deems unnecessary for student safety. Bowser asserts that D.C.'s existing safe passage programs are sufficient, noting a prior decrease in crime rates. While the Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith acknowledged some positive impact from federal agents, the presence of military-style vehicles and troops near public transport raises new questions about student well-being. The city is focused on ensuring a joyful and safe start to the school year for its 100,000 students.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders confirmed his frustration after being benched by head coach Kevin Stefanski before a potential game-winning drive in a recent preseason game. Despite a challenging performance where he was sacked five times, Sanders, who was on an exercise bike, wanted to lead the final two-minute drive. Stefanski defended his decision to use veteran Tyler Huntley, citing the overall offensive struggles and the plan to give Huntley a final drive. The team has named Joe Flacco as the Week 1 starter, with the backup situation still uncertain as the 53-man roster deadline approaches.</p>

          <h2>Op-Ed Questions Why Tackle Football Remains for Boys If Deemed Unsafe for Girls</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article raises a critical question: if tackle football is considered too dangerous for girls, leading to the rise of girls' flag football, why is it still celebrated and tolerated for boys? The article highlights the growing popularity of flag football for girls and the historical tendency to adapt sports for women based on perceived physical limitations. It underscores the known health risks of tackle football, including CTE and Parkinson's disease, arguing that society has not adequately addressed the self-destructive aspects of masculinity fostered by the sport, particularly for young working-class men of color. The piece suggests a reevaluation of the sport's role and a potential shift towards flag football for all youth.</p>

          <h2>Unanswered Questions Emerge About Ozempic's Long-Term Impact on Human Desire and Emotion</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 06:04:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic, initially for diabetes, are now widely used for weight loss and show promise for various conditions, including dementia and addiction. However, a major unanswered question concerns their long-term effects on human desire and emotion beyond suppressing harmful compulsions. Patients report reduced cravings for unhealthy foods and alcohol, but some also experience new cravings or a diminished emotional connection to food. Scientists are exploring whether these drugs subtly alter broader human motivations and pleasures, with concerns about potential unintended consequences on the "messy human experience" of living.

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping sent independence day greetings to Ukraine, a message posted by Ukrainian President Zelensky on social media. Xi's message highlighted steady development in China-Ukraine relations over 33 years and expressed readiness to guide bilateral ties for mutual benefit and long-term development. While China insists on neutrality in the conflict, its increasing closeness with Russia has raised suspicions in Ukraine. Zelensky appreciated the congratulations, affirming both sides' interest in a long-term dialogue based on mutual respect for peace and stability.</p>

          <p>A special general election for Iowa state senate district 1 pits far-right Republican Christopher Prosch, known for controversial views on abortion and conspiracy theories, against Democrat Catelin Drey, a marketing executive focused on affordability and gun violence. A victory for Drey would end the Republican supermajority in the state senate, potentially signaling a "blue wave" ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The race is seen as a referendum on Governor Kim Reynolds and the Republican party's embrace of extremism. Democrats are focusing on economic issues to connect with working-class voters and challenge the perception of being out of touch.</p>

          <h2>New Research Suggests Fish May Experience Pleasure from Being Groomed</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B suggests that fish, specifically bluestreak cleaner wrasse and threadfin butterflyfish, may experience pleasure and actively seek it out. Researchers observed butterflyfish preferring areas where they had been groomed by cleaner wrasse, even when parasite-free. Experiments involving opioid mimics and blockers indicated that this "liking" of grooming is mediated by the fish's opioid system, while the "wanting" to be groomed might involve dopamine. This research challenges the perception of fish as simple-minded animals, suggesting they possess rich behaviors driven by emotional-like states, with implications for their treatment in aquariums and aquaculture.</p>

          <p>The fashion industry is confronting significant changes as artificial intelligence allows for the creation of digital models and clones, impacting human models' careers. While some models, like Hannah James, explore creating digital replicas to stay competitive, concerns are mounting over job displacement and unclear compensation standards. Controversial AI-generated ads from brands like Guess and H&M have sparked backlash, prompting debate about the technology's ethical implications and the potential for unrealistic beauty standards. Experts suggest brands need to foster genuine connections with consumers and address the challenges of fair compensation and worker rights in this evolving landscape.</p>

          <p>China is increasing minimum e-commerce delivery fees in major hubs like Guangdong province to curb "disorderly low-price competition" and promote higher product quality. This policy, stemming from a directive by President Xi Jinping, aims to guide companies towards more orderly market practices and facilitate the exit of outdated capacity. The price adjustments primarily affect e-commerce clients, with minimal impact on individual consumers. Analysts predict this "anti-involution drive" will expand to more regions, reflecting Beijing's broader efforts to regulate its booming digital economy and encourage sustainable growth.

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans' public school system has undergone a radical transformation into an almost entirely charter-based model, showing significant improvements in test scores, graduation rates, and college-going. Former principal Mary Haynes-Smith, initially resistant, now praises the autonomy granted to charter schools. However, the system remains a "work in progress," with challenges like socioeconomic disparities influencing access to higher-rated schools and the painful process of closing underperforming charters. While the willingness to adapt has driven gains, experts suggest new strategies are needed to move beyond current improvements, possibly including the district directly running some schools again.</p>

          <p>A fitness trend promoting weighted vests for improved posture, weight loss, and increased bone and muscle growth is gaining traction, especially among women in perimenopause. However, scientific research does not strongly support claims for significant bone density or muscle strength benefits from simply walking with a weighted vest. Experts emphasize that more effective methods for building strength involve resistance training through a full range of motion. While weighted vests can offer some cardiovascular benefits by increasing energy expenditure, they are not a substitute for proven exercises and should be approached with realistic expectations.</p>

Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard is also doubtful for the Liverpool match with a shoulder injury. While there's optimism that neither player will face long-term absence, the club's deeper attacking talent, including recent signings, is expected to mitigate the impact of these key injuries.</p>
