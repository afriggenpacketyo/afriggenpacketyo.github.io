          <p>Senate Majority Leader Thune outlines the Republican agenda focused on American strength, security, and prosperity through a reconciliation bill. The bill aims to fully fund border security measures and President Trump's policies, preventing Democrats from leveraging resources for other government spending. It also prioritizes defense funding, including investments in missile defense systems and new ships, and extends the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) permanently. The bill includes reforms to Medicaid, such as removing illegal immigrants from health programs and introducing work requirements, in order to return to a fiscally sustainable path.</p>

The mummy, believed to be between 10 and 15 years old, was found in a sitting position with arms and legs bent. The remains were discovered in a shroud containing calabash gourds, along with ceramic objects such as plates, bottles, and jugs. The tomb and artifacts are associated with the pre-Inca Chancay culture, which inhabited the Lima area between the 11th and 15th centuries.</p>

          <p>A university teaching assistant grapples with the ethical dilemma of enforcing academic rules against AI use when students question the value of traditional humanities education. The real aim of a humanities education is the formation of human persons. Students sense that generative AI proves the utilitarian vision for the humanities is a sham. To address this, educators should focus on cultivating practical wisdom, or phronesis, in students, helping them make sound judgments in complex situations, and offering choices about AI use with reflective assignments to promote reasoning skills.</p>

          <p>Jennie Marie Mahalick Petrini, whose house burned down in the Eaton fire in Altadena, has decided to rebuild despite the challenges and costs involved. Petrini's decision is driven by a combination of emotional attachment to the property, financial considerations, and community ties. While many fire survivors are choosing to sell their burned lots, Petrini's low mortgage rate and insurance payouts make rebuilding a more viable option. She plans to use various strategies, including a Small Business Administration loan and a "like-for-like" rebuild, to expedite the process and keep costs down.</p>

The survey, conducted in five languages, found that approximately 70% of registered voters agreed that eligible voters should receive ballots in their preferred language. Support was strong across various demographic groups, with Democrats and independent voters showing particularly high levels of agreement. Advocates argue that providing translated ballots would increase voter turnout and make the voting process more accessible to diverse communities.</p>
