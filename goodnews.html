        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The High Court has rejected a legal challenge against the government's policy of adding VAT to private school fees, a policy introduced on January 1st across the UK. Lawyers representing families and private schools argued the policy was discriminatory and violated human rights law, but the court found that the policy was enacted by Parliament after full debate and was a manifesto commitment. The court acknowledged that the legislation would affect some families' ability to afford private school, including those with children with special educational needs, but deemed that the government was entitled to prioritize revenue raising for public services. The government estimates the policy will generate ¬£1.8 billion a year by 2029/30 for state sector improvements. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>

          <p>Copenhagen is implementing a comprehensive plan to adapt to increasing rainfall and flooding caused by climate change. The city's "Cloudburst Management Plan," a $1.3 billion public works project, includes constructing rain tunnels and "sponge parks" to manage excess water. The Kalvebod Brygge Cloudburst Tunnel, a mile-long underground tunnel, will store excess rainwater, while Enghaveparken, a redesigned park, can transform into a reservoir during heavy rain. Copenhagen is also building a human-made island, Lynetteholm, to protect against storm surges, making the city a global leader in climate adaptation strategies.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing movement in the construction industry promotes deconstruction, the practice of carefully taking apart buildings to reuse materials, as a climate solution. Deconstruction creates a circular economy for building materials, reduces landfill waste, and lowers the carbon footprint of construction. Cities like Portland, OR and Boulder, CO are leading the way with specialist contractors and reuse stores, but challenges remain, including the need for local infrastructure and higher costs. Boulder has a deconstruction ordinance requiring 75% of building materials to be diverted from landfills, demonstrating the potential for significant environmental impact.

          <p>China's central bank set the yuan's daily fixing against the US dollar at its strongest level in over two months, driven by the greenback's drop to a multi-year low. The People's Bank of China set the yuan's midpoint rate at 7.1772 per US dollar. The US dollar index plummeted to 97.61 after the May producer price index came in below expectations, leading traders to anticipate more interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists argue that the recent decline in "white collar" jobs is primarily due to structural issues in the economy rather than artificial intelligence (AI) displacing workers. While the professional and business services sector has seen limited hiring, industries like healthcare and construction are experiencing job growth. Experts suggest that AI technology is still in its early stages and cannot yet replace key human skills. Although AI may eventually transform jobs, its current impact on the labor force is minimal (not investment advice). The optimism score for this article is 70.</p>

          <p>Despite heightened tensions following Israeli strikes on Iran, experts believe it is unlikely that Tehran will block the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil artery. Blocking the strait, through which approximately 20 million barrels of oil pass daily, would disrupt global energy markets. Analysts argue that Iran would gain little from such an action, as it could trigger further retaliation and harm its relationship with China, its largest oil customer. Moreover, the majority of Iran's daily consumption goods come via that route. The optimism score for this article is 65.</p>
