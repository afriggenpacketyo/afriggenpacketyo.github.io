          <p>The Powerball lottery jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.1 billion, marking the fifth-largest prize in the game's history. This increase follows Saturday's drawing, where no ticket successfully matched all six winning numbers for the $1 billion grand prize. While nine tickets won $1 million by matching the five white balls, the top prize has remained unclaimed since May 31. The next drawing offers a winner the choice between an annuity or a lump sum cash value of approximately $498.4 million before taxes.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri secured a victory at the Dutch Grand Prix in a race marked by significant drama and multiple incidents. His teammate, Lando Norris, was forced to retire from a comfortable second-place position due to an oil leak with only seven laps remaining. This unexpected turn of events significantly impacts the drivers' championship, extending Piastri's lead over Norris to 34 points. The chaotic race also saw Red Bull's Max Verstappen take second place and French rookie Isack Hadjar achieve his first-ever podium finish.</p>

          <p>Veteran actor Henry Winkler, recently honored at the Television Academy Hall of Fame, shared his insights on maintaining a grounded perspective despite over five decades in Hollywood. The "Happy Days" star emphasized that fame has not altered his view of the world, his family, or the people he meets, attributing his longevity to gratitude and a love for his craft. Winkler also recounted a dramatic moment from his past where he helped talk a suicidal teenager off a ledge, highlighting a career defined as much by human connection as by iconic roles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid record-high consumer debt and persistent inflation, a growing number of American homeowners are tapping into their home equity through cash-out refinances. This financial strategy, which now constitutes 59% of all refinancing, allows people to pay off high-interest debts like credit cards, even if it means accepting a higher mortgage rate. Lenders report a surge in these transactions as households find themselves equity-rich but cash-poor. While this can provide immediate financial relief and reduce monthly payments, experts caution borrowers to address the underlying spending habits that led to the debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At 80 years old, musician John Fogerty has released "Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years (John's Version)," an album of re-recorded hits from his legendary band. For decades, Fogerty did not own the rights to the iconic songs he wrote, a painful legal battle that led him to stop performing them for a time. Encouraged by his wife, Julie, he eventually bought back his catalog and recorded the new album with his sons, who are part of his touring band. The project represents a personal and professional triumph, allowing him to reclaim his musical heritage.</p>

          <p>The UK has finalized a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 anti-submarine frigates, marking the UK's largest-ever warship export deal by value. The warships will be constructed at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow, a move the government says will support thousands of UK jobs into the 2030s. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 advanced frigates to operate in the region. Norwegian officials cited the UK as their most strategic partner in making the decision.</p>

          <p>In a humorous commentary, comedian Jim Gaffigan confesses to his recurring summer problem: an overabundance of cucumbers from his garden. He recounts his annual cycle of ambitious spring planting, including a misguided attempt at "succession planting," which only multiplies his harvest. The piece humorously details his journey from enjoying fresh cucumbers to being overwhelmed by them, despite his efforts at making salads and pickles. Ultimately, he concludes that he is simply not a farmer and comically pleads for someone to take his excess cucumbers off his hands.</p>

          <p>Neurosurgeon and author Dr. Sanjay Gupta is exploring the complex nature of chronic pain, emphasizing that its source often lies in the brain rather than the site of an old injury. His work highlights revolutionary treatments like deep brain stimulation, which was life-changing for a musician suffering from a rare and excruciating condition. This approach involves mapping the brain's unique pain signals and using electrical impulses to interrupt them before they are consciously felt. This research offers new hope by demonstrating that pain circuitry is measurable and can be targeted and treated directly.</p>

          <p>This article offers parenting advice based on the principle that children listen best when they feel emotionally safe and connected. Author Reem Raouda, who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, shares six "magic phrases" designed to build cooperation rather than demand obedience. Phrases like "I believe you" and "Let's figure this out together" help defuse conflict, validate a child's feelings, and shift the dynamic from adversarial to collaborative. The approach emphasizes that genuine listening is a natural outcome of a relationship built on respect and trust.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author makes a case for hunting as a more honest and sustainable way to consume meat, challenging the reflexive disdain it often receives from the political left. She recounts her own journey to becoming a hunter in Montana, describing the emotional gravity and deep connection to nature involved in harvesting an animal. The author argues that responsible hunting, rooted in conservation principles funded by hunters themselves, is a vital tool for ecosystem management. She posits that hunters and vegetarians share more common ground in their ethical food considerations than either group might admit.</p>

He reveals that Springsteen himself was significantly involved in the film and gave his approval, which ultimately gave White the confidence to bring his own interpretation to the performance.</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, sheds light on the little-known origins of surfing in the mainland United States. In 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes—David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui—were studying at a nearby military school and visited the coast. Finding waves that reminded them of Honolulu, they fashioned boards from local redwood and demonstrated the royal sport of "surfboard swimming" to amazed locals. This event is now recognized as the moment the seed of American surf culture was planted, 140 years ago.</p>
