          <p>British tennis player Ollie Tarvet, ranked 733rd in the world, has become an unexpected Wimbledon favorite after making his Grand Slam debut. The 21-year-old, who prefers to be called Ollie, advanced to the second round and is now set to face defending champion Carlos Alcaraz on Centre Court. A student in the US college system, Tarvet is approaching the daunting match with quiet confidence, viewing it as an opportunity to win rather than just an experience. A victory would be one of the biggest upsets in Wimbledon history, marking a remarkable moment for the young underdog.</p>

          <p>The 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, has affirmed that the institution of the Dalai Lama will continue after he passes away. In a video message from Dharamshala, India, the 89-year-old spiritual leader stated that he was making the decision in response to requests from Buddhists worldwide. He emphasized that the Gaden Phodrang Trust, which he founded, will have the sole authority to search for and recognize his reincarnation according to tradition. This announcement is significant as it preempts potential interference from the Chinese government, which views him as a separatist and may attempt to name its own successor.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a comfortable 6-1 victory against the Chicago White Sox, propelled by another excellent performance from pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto. The Japanese star pitched for seven innings, allowing only one run and striking out eight batters, lowering his ERA to 2.51. The Dodgers' offense started strong with a four-run rally in the first inning, and Shohei Ohtani later contributed with his 30th home run of the season. The game highlighted the significant gap in quality between the league-leading Dodgers and the struggling White Sox.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric car manufacturer Xpeng reported strong sales for June, delivering over 34,000 vehicles and marking its eighth consecutive month above the 30,000-unit threshold. This performance comes amid an intense price war in China's EV market, where dominant player BYD continues to expand its lead. Other rivals like Nio and Li Auto showed more mixed results, with Nio seeing a slight increase while Li Auto's deliveries dropped from the previous month. The fierce competition has drawn criticism from the Chinese government for being non-productive, even as companies like Xiaomi enter the market with aggressively priced models.

          <p>Borussia Dortmund has advanced to the quarter-finals of the FIFA Club World Cup after a 2-1 victory over CF Monterrey in Atlanta. Forward Serhou Guirassy was the key player, scoring two early goals in the first half with assists from Karim Adeyemi. Although Monterrey improved in the second half and scored a goal, Dortmund held on to secure the win. The German club becomes the final European team to reach the last eight and will now face Real Madrid in the next round. The loss for Monterrey means all five teams from the Concacaf region have been eliminated from the tournament.</p>

          <p>The United States, Japan, India, and Australia, collectively known as the "Quad," have announced a new initiative to secure a stable supply of critical minerals. The move is widely seen as an effort to reduce global reliance on China, which currently dominates the processing and refining of minerals essential for high-tech industries like semiconductors. In a joint statement, the group expressed concern about economic coercion and supply chain disruptions stemming from dependence on a single country. The announcement was made following a meeting of the nations' foreign ministers in Washington, D.C., aimed at strengthening strategic stability in the Indo-Pacific.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The decision blocks a plan to revoke their legal status and work permits in September, which would have been years ahead of a previously established 2026 deadline. The judge stated that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation before its official expiration. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, asserting that district courts cannot prohibit the Executive Branch from enforcing immigration laws.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has implemented the strictest law in the U.S. regulating PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," which are linked to serious health issues. The legislation, called "Amara's Law," is named after Amara Strande, who advocated for the ban while dying from a rare cancer she believed was linked to the chemicals in her community's water. The law will phase out the manufacture and sale of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032. The effort was a response to decades of PFAS waste from manufacturer 3M, which has since agreed to pay the state $850 million for cleanup.</p>
