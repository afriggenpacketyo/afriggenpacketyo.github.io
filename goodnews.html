          <p>Anker Innovations is recalling 1.15 million portable chargers due to the risk of overheating, which can lead to fires and explosions. The recalled "PowerCore 10000" power banks, model number A1263, were sold between June 2016 and December 2022. There have been 19 reports of fires and explosions, including minor burn injuries and property damage exceeding $60,700. Consumers are advised to stop using the chargers immediately and contact Anker for a free replacement, while also following local guidance for proper disposal of lithium-ion batteries.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers can potentially lower credit card interest rates without switching cards by calling and directly asking the issuer for a rate reduction, particularly if they have a good payment history. Enrolling in a debt management plan through a credit counseling agency can also help secure lower rates across multiple cards. Additionally, exploring temporary hardship programs offered by card companies and leveraging an improved credit score can provide avenues for rate reduction. Researching competitive offers from other companies can strengthen negotiating power with the current card issuer.</p>

          <p>President Trump's effort to secure a retrial in the E. Jean Carroll case, where he was found liable for sexual assault and defamation, has been rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. His lawyers requested an en banc review, which was also denied, leaving the Supreme Court as his final option. Carroll and her attorney praised the decision, emphasizing that Trump remains liable for sexual assault and defamation. The case stems from Carroll's claim of a mid-1990s encounter in a New York City department store.</p>

          <p>The IPO market is experiencing a revival in June, with successful public debuts from companies like Chime, Voyager Technologies, and Circle. This resurgence is encouraging more companies to consider going public, which is expected to benefit investment banking divisions within Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. However, geopolitical tensions, such as Israel's attack on Iran, and unpredictable trade policies by President Trump could introduce volatility. Despite these risks, experts anticipate 2025 will be a stronger year for IPOs than 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Consumer sentiment in early June rebounded significantly, surpassing expectations as concerns about tariffs and inflation eased. The University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers showed across-the-board gains in sentiment indexes, with respondents also lowering their near-term inflation outlook. The moves coincided with a softening in rhetoric surrounding President Donald Trump's tariffs, though consumers still perceive downside risks to the economy. The one-year inflation outlook tumbled from levels not seen since 1981, reflecting beliefs that trade policy may still contribute to inflation.</p>
