          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales have voted to decriminalize abortions performed later in pregnancy. The Labour MP for Gower, Tonia Antoniazzi, spearheaded the effort, advocating for compassion rather than criminalization for women who undergo abortions after 24 weeks. This change in legislation aims to provide support and understanding for women in difficult situations who seek late-term abortions. The vote reflects a shift in perspective toward viewing these cases as matters of healthcare rather than criminal offenses. The decision is a win for the women in England and Wales who find themselves in these situations.</p>

          <p>Kraft Heinz announced it will remove artificial food dyes from all U.S. products starting in 2027, with immediate cessation of new product development using these dyes. Nearly 90% of Kraft Heinz's U.S. products are already free of synthetic dyes, with ongoing efforts to remove dyes from remaining products or replace them with natural colors. This decision follows federal health officials' plans to phase out petroleum-based food dyes voluntarily. The company's iconic Heinz Tomato Ketchup has never contained artificial dyes, and Kraft Mac & Cheese previously removed artificial dyes a decade ago, opting for spices like paprika and turmeric.</p>

Lyles did not elaborate on the specific complications that led to the cancellation, but expressed disappointment that the event could not proceed. Hill had challenged Lyles to a 50-yard race after Lyles won 100m gold at the Olympics, and recently ran a personal best of 10.15 seconds in the 100m.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have proposed a tax break for tipped workers as part of a broader tax cut package. The Senate measure is similar to a House GOP provision but includes key differences, such as capping the tax deduction at $25,000 per year and varying income limits. While the House bill makes the tax deduction unavailable for individuals earning over $160,000, the Senate bill gradually reduces the value of the deduction for incomes exceeding $150,000. The Senate proposal aims to fulfill President Trump's "no tax on tips" campaign pledge. (not investment advice)</p>

Companies like AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Merck are investing billions in developing ADCs, designed to deliver chemotherapy directly to cancer cells while sparing healthy ones. While traditional chemotherapy can affect both healthy and cancerous cells, ADCs offer a more precise approach. Some experts believe it will take years before ADCs can broadly replace chemo, but drugmakers are seeing promising results in certain settings.</p>
