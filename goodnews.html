          <p>Ireland's Katie Taylor secured a third victory over Amanda Serrano at Madison Square Garden, retaining her undisputed light-welterweight championship via a majority decision. The judges scored the bout 97-93, 97-93, and 95-95, concluding the historic rivalry in women's boxing. While less explosive than their previous encounters, the fight was a tactical and gripping contest where Taylor's smarter, more economical boxing ultimately proved decisive. Following the win, the 39-year-old Taylor remained non-committal about her future in the sport, suggesting she will take time to decide her next steps.</p>

          <p>A fugitive who escaped custody at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in May has been recaptured and extradited back to Kentucky. The Warren County Sheriff's Office shared photos of the man, Sedrick T. Stevenson, smiling broadly while being escorted by multiple officers on a plane. Stevenson, who was wanted on multiple charges, had initially slipped away from an agent at a ticket counter. His secure return involved a coordinated effort between U.S. Marshals and various Seattle-area law enforcement agencies to prevent another escape attempt.</p>

          <p>Google has announced a deal to hire Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior R&D employees. The agreement, valued at $2.4 billion, includes compensation and a nonexclusive license for Google to use certain Windsurf technology, while Windsurf remains an independent entity. This move intensifies the AI talent war among major tech companies, coming after Windsurf had reportedly been in acquisition talks with OpenAI. The deal allows Google to integrate top AI coding talent into its DeepMind division to advance its work on agentic coding and Gemini.</p>

          <p>Luxury fashion brand Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers after facing controversy over sandals that closely resembled traditional Kolhapuri chappals. The brand was criticized by Indian fashion critics and politicians for showcasing the design without acknowledging its cultural origins. In response, Prada held a meeting with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents Kolhapuri artisans, to discuss collaboration opportunities. This move is seen as a positive step toward respectful engagement between global fashion houses and traditional craft communities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, halting indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in seven Southern California counties, including Los Angeles. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit by the ACLU and other groups, which accused federal agents of unconstitutional tactics like racial profiling and warrantless arrests. Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong found a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims and enjoined agents from making stops based solely on factors like ethnicity, language, or location. The decision is being celebrated by civil rights advocates as a crucial defense of constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has ruled that a lawsuit from two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege the company used their voices without permission to create AI-generated voice clones for its platform after hiring them for what they were told were internal projects. While the judge dismissed federal copyright claims related to their voices, claims of breach of contract, deceptive practices, and copyright infringement related to the AI's training data will proceed. The decision is seen as a significant victory for artists in the ongoing legal battles against AI companies.</p>

While this expansion helps Chinese enterprises navigate international markets, lawyers face challenges in winning non-Chinese clients amid rising geopolitical tensions, marking a pivotal moment for China's legal services industry.</p>

This has caused some confusion and led to large numbers of abandoned power banks at airports. The move follows earlier regulations that barred the in-flight charging of these devices, as public scrutiny of their safety intensifies.</p>
