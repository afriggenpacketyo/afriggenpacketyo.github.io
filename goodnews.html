          <p>Ad-tech company AppLovin saw its stock rise significantly after reporting second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations. The company's growth is largely attributed to its AI technology, which enhances ad targeting in mobile games. CEO Adam Foroughi also anticipates future growth stemming from the legal battle between Apple and Epic Games. The court's ruling against Apple's App Store policies could lead game developers to increase their advertising budgets, directly benefiting platforms like AppLovin. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes whether a 3-month certificate of deposit (CD) or a money market account would yield higher returns on a $20,000 deposit amid a shifting interest rate environment. While a money market account might currently offer a slightly higher rate, its variable nature means earnings could decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts rates as expected. A 3-month CD provides a fixed, guaranteed return, making it a more predictable, albeit potentially marginally less profitable, option for savers seeking stability over a short term.

          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut appearing likely in September, this article explores the continued utility of high-yield savings accounts. It argues that even with a rate reduction, these accounts will likely offer significantly better returns than traditional savings accounts. The analysis suggests that any rate cuts will probably be small and gradual, and the flexibility of a high-yield account is valuable in an unpredictable economic climate, making it a worthwhile option for savers.

          <h2>New Archaeological Findings Suggest Pompeii Was Reoccupied After Vesuvius Eruption</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 14:52:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists have uncovered new evidence indicating that some survivors of the 79 AD Mount Vesuvius eruption returned to live in the ruins of Pompeii. The findings suggest an informal settlement where people lived in "precarious conditions," repurposing the ground floors of old homes into cellars. This discovery challenges the long-held narrative that the city was completely abandoned after the cataclysmic event. It provides a clearer picture of a "precarious and grey agglomeration" that existed amidst the ruins before the area was fully deserted centuries later.</p>
