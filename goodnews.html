          <p>British tennis player Cameron Norrie was eliminated from the US Open after suffering his seventh career loss to 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic in the fourth round. Djokovic, battling a lower back injury that required on-court treatment, persevered to win 6-4, 6-7 (3-7), 6-2, 6-3. This victory propels the Serb into the last 16 as he pursues a standalone record 25th major title, his first tournament since Wimbledon. Djokovic humorously noted his team wants him to "suffer on the court" to maximize playing minutes, underscoring his enduring competitive spirit despite physical challenges and the high stakes of the tournament.</p>

Their 9,000-mile journey from Peru to Australia was completed in an astonishing 140 days, surpassing the previous record of 162 days. The expedition was fraught with challenges, including violent tropical storms and high winds, during which Lachlan was even swept overboard before being rescued. Beyond their remarkable athletic achievement, the brothers have successfully raised over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar, demonstrating immense dedication to both adventure and philanthropy and inspiring many with their perseverance.</p>

          <p>A 10-mile stretch of the scenic Angeles Crest Highway (Highway 2) has reopened to the public, just in time for Labor Day weekend, after being closed for years due to extensive storm and fire damage. Heavy rains in 2022-2023 caused slope failures and pavement collapses, with further damage from the 2024 Bridge fire. Repairs, costing approximately $7.9 million, included new guardrails, retaining walls, and drainage systems, significantly restoring vital access. The reopening notably restores access to popular hiking trails and is expected to alleviate overcrowding at other trailheads. However, officials warn of extreme fire danger in the Angeles National Forest, urging visitors to adhere to safety prohibitions.</p>

The incident led to the immediate cordoning off of the building's lobby and entrance. LAPD spokesperson Jennifer Forkish confirmed an unintentional discharge involving a non-sworn security services division employee, assuring that there were no serious injuries and that Internal Affairs investigators are handling the matter. This occurrence underscores potential safety concerns even within secure government facilities and among personnel familiar with firearms, prompting a thorough internal review.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has unanimously blocked the Trump administration's plans to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 600,000 Venezuelans, ruling that the administration's actions were likely unlawful. The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's decision, finding that the Homeland Security Secretary lacked authority to vacate a prior TPS extension. The judges emphasized that Congress designed TPS to be predictable and insulated from political shifts, providing stability for those fleeing dire conditions. This ruling offers a potential path for the administration's "illegal actions" related to Venezuelan TPS to be undone, despite DHS condemnation and ongoing political tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has significantly challenged President Trump's authority to impose sweeping tariffs, ruling that many of his import taxes on foreign products are not legally permissible. The 7-4 decision largely upheld a lower court's finding that Trump exceeded his power under federal economic emergency laws, specifically the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act. While the ruling doesn't immediately block the tariffs, it allows the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court. This article explains the court found Congress, not the President, holds core tariff power, marking a major setback for Trump's signature trade strategy and potentially impacting future trade policy.</p>
