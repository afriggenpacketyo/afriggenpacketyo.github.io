          <p>Derrick Groves, the last of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in May, has been captured in Atlanta, ending a multi-agency manhunt. Groves was found in the crawl space of a home after a brief standoff with a SWAT team. The escape, which occurred through a hole behind a toilet, highlighted significant security flaws at the facility, which the sheriff attributed to poor design and staffing issues. Groves, who was convicted of a 2024 double murder, will now face additional charges related to his escape, bringing what officials called "long-awaited calm" to the community.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 15:21:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners needing to borrow money, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) is currently a much more affordable option than a credit card. The average interest rate for a credit card stands at 22.25%, whereas the median rate for a HELOC is just 7.89%, making credit cards over 180% more expensive. While both have variable rates that may decrease with future Federal Reserve cuts, the significant initial gap means HELOCs will remain the cheaper choice. Furthermore, the interest paid on a HELOC may be tax-deductible if used for home improvements, offering an additional financial advantage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's captain, Harry Kane, has been ruled out of the upcoming friendly match against Wales due to a minor ankle injury sustained during a recent game with his club, Bayern Munich. The injury is not considered serious, and the team hopes he will be fit for the World Cup qualifier against Latvia next week. In his absence, manager Thomas Tuchel will select a replacement captain from among Jordan Henderson, John Stones, or Declan Rice. The article notes England's reliance on Kane, who is the nation's record goalscorer, and discusses potential replacements like Ollie Watkins and Marcus Rashford.</p>

          <p>Shares of AI cloud provider CoreWeave rose by as much as 8% following the announcement of new tools designed to help developers create AI agents. The company introduced a serverless reinforcement learning service that automates computing power allocation, which it claims can train models faster and at 40% lower cost. This launch follows CoreWeave's $1 billion acquisition of Weights and Biases and major deals with OpenAI and Meta to provide essential AI infrastructure. The company's growth reflects the surging demand for Nvidia GPUs, which are critical for operating advanced AI models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In her first conference speech as party leader, Kemi Badenoch announced that a future Conservative government would abolish stamp duty on the purchase of primary residences in England and Northern Ireland. She positioned the move as a way to unlock the housing market, promote social mobility, and help people achieve home ownership. The tax would still apply to additional properties and purchases by non-UK residents. Badenoch stated the estimated £9 billion annual cost would be covered by planned savings from cuts to welfare, foreign aid, and the Civil Service, part of her plan to rebuild the party's economic credibility.</p>

With maximum sustained winds dropping to 70 mph, just below the Category 1 hurricane threshold, the storm is expected to continue weakening. A tropical storm watch remains in effect for parts of the Baja California Sur peninsula. While the storm is forecast to remain offshore, it is generating large swells that are likely to cause life-threatening surf, rip currents, and coastal flooding in the region.</p>

          <p>As the New Jersey gubernatorial race between Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli narrows, the state's Latino electorate is emerging as a key demographic that could decide the outcome. In 2024, President Trump made significant gains among Latino voters in several New Jersey districts, a trend Democrats are now working to reverse. National Latino advocacy group UnidosUS is endorsing Sherrill, aiming to mobilize voters on issues like housing and healthcare. The election is being watched nationally as a test of voter sentiment and whether Democrats can counter the GOP's recent inroads with this crucial voting bloc.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates, savers looking for high returns should act now to lock in favorable rates on Certificates of Deposit (CDs). While the peak rates of 6-7% are gone, competitive rates are still available, particularly for short-term CDs, with many offering yields around 4%. These rates are significantly higher than traditional savings accounts and provide a hedge against future rate declines. The article advises savers to explore online banks, which typically offer higher rates than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions, to find the best terms before rates fall further.

          <p>Despite gold's recent surge to record prices above $4,000 an ounce, some financial advisors caution that stocks remain a superior long-term investment. Pat Beaird of Beaird Harris Wealth Management notes that while gold "glitters," it is the compounding of earnings from equities that builds wealth over time. Historical data shows that over a 30-year period, the S&P 500's annualized total return has significantly outpaced that of gold. While gold can serve as a safe-haven asset during periods of turmoil, advisors suggest its returns are not as reliable and recommend limiting its allocation in a diversified portfolio.

          <p>For older homeowners on fixed incomes, a single-purpose reverse mortgage can be an affordable way to access home equity for a specific, essential expense. Unlike more common HECMs, these loans are offered by state or local agencies and are restricted to one approved use, such as paying property taxes or funding critical home repairs. This targeted approach typically results in lower fees and costs. However, these programs often have income limits and are not available in all areas, making them a niche but potentially valuable financial tool for qualifying seniors who need targeted assistance without taking on monthly payments.
