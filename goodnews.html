          <p>The Federal Reserve is anticipated to maintain current interest rates at its upcoming policy meeting, but will likely provide updated economic forecasts that could influence market behavior. Investors will be closely watching the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) projections, particularly regarding the potential for future rate cuts and their assessment of inflation trends. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's commentary on softening labor data and the risks associated with tariff-driven inflation will also be closely scrutinized. Despite pressure from the White House for easier monetary policy, the Fed is expected to remain in a "wait-and-see" mode, carefully monitoring geopolitical developments and their potential impact on the economy.

          <p>New Yorkers will use ranked-choice voting in the upcoming mayoral primary, allowing voters to rank their top five candidates. If no candidate receives over 50% of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and the second-choice votes are then counted. This system has led to unusual alliances, such as progressive candidates cross-endorsing each other to prevent former Governor Andrew Cuomo from winning. Results will be delayed until July 1 due to the complexity of tabulating ranked-choice ballots.</p>
