          <p>Doordash has announced its acquisition of SevenRooms, a restaurant booking platform, for $1.2 billion in an all-cash deal expected to close in the second half of 2025. The announcement coincided with Doordash's first-quarter revenue report, which fell short of expectations, causing shares to drop by about 4%. Revenue was reported at $3.03 billion versus the expected $3.09 billion, while earnings per share were 44 cents adjusted versus the expected 39 cents. The article also mentions that Deliveroo, a British food delivery service, has agreed to a deal with Doordash worth $3.9 billion.</p>

          <p>A Reddit user sparked a viral debate after sharing his frustration over a girlfriend's friend asking to use their kitchen for an entire week, including refrigerator space. The user, who does most of the cooking and cleaning, felt his personal space was being violated, while his girlfriend accused him of being rude. Most Reddit users sided with the man, deeming the request absurd and entitled, while etiquette expert Diane Gottsman suggested the friend should offer compensation for the extended use of the kitchen.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to consider a case involving a Maine lawmaker, Laurel Libby, who was censured for a Facebook post criticizing a transgender athlete. The Maine House stripped Libby of her voting rights after she refused to apologize for the post, raising First Amendment concerns about free speech and the rights of constituents to representation. While offensive speech is generally protected, the case hinges on whether stripping a lawmaker of voting rights punishes both the lawmaker and their constituents, setting a potentially alarming precedent.</p>

          <p>The Taiwanese dollar experienced a pullback after a historic surge that saw it reach multi-decade gains, fueled by speculation of pressure from Washington to strengthen the currency. Despite the easing, the Taiwanese dollar remains significantly up against the U.S. dollar this year. Experts attribute the currency's volatility to exporters converting U.S. dollar reserves and life insurers hedging their U.S. dollar debt, while the central bank's absence has fanned speculation of a quiet currency realignment.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions with the US, China has largely refrained from significantly de-dollarizing its economy, according to an Oxford Economics report. The report suggests that China's export-oriented economy necessitates substantial dollar assets, and weakening the yuan is a more likely response to trade tensions than selling US Treasury holdings. The advisory firm also noted that there are few high-grade and liquid foreign assets to park China‚Äôs US$3.2 trillion official foreign exchange reserves.</p>
