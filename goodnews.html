          <p>Nvidia and AMD have reached an unusual agreement with the Trump administration, consenting to pay the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from certain AI chip sales to China. In return, the companies will receive export licenses for their H20 and MI308 chips, securing access to the lucrative Chinese market. While investors view the deal as a net positive, analysts describe it as a transactional "pay-to-play" tactic that sets a strange precedent for U.S. trade policy. The arrangement underscores the strategic importance of semiconductors in the ongoing tech competition between the U.S. and China. (not investment advice)</p>

This shift could streamline the buying process, but it also poses a significant challenge to established online marketplaces like Amazon and payment processors such as PayPal by potentially controlling the initial product discovery phase. Experts believe the new battleground for online retail will be for user attention in the "pre-sale" phase, where AI assistants guide consumer choices.

          <p>Shares of lithium mining companies, including U.S.-based Albemarle, experienced a significant surge on Monday after a major Chinese supplier suspended production. The Yichun Project mine, operated by battery maker CATL and responsible for a notable portion of the global lithium supply, halted operations due to an expired permit. This development has tightened the already delicate supply-and-demand balance for the critical battery component. Investors reacted to the news with the expectation that reduced supply will lead to an increase in lithium prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>American Malls Find New Life by Replacing Anchor Stores with Churches, Bowling Alleys, and Bookstores</h2>

          <p>Struggling American shopping malls are undergoing a transformation, replacing vacant anchor stores like Sears with unconventional tenants such as churches, entertainment venues, and large bookstores. This strategy aims to drive "cross-shopping" by turning malls into community hubs with diverse attractions beyond traditional retail. For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio converted a former Sears into a thriving church, which has brought thousands of new visitors. Data suggests this mixed-use approach is reviving foot traffic, as malls evolve from pure shopping destinations into multifaceted community and experiential spaces.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The annual Perseid meteor shower is expected to reach its peak on the nights of August 11 and 12, offering a dazzling celestial display. Known for its fast and bright meteors, the shower originates from debris left by the comet Swift-Tuttle. However, this year's viewing may be somewhat hampered by the bright light of the recent Sturgeon Moon, which could obscure fainter meteors. For the best experience, stargazers should find a location away from city lights, allow their eyes to adjust to the darkness, and look up after midnight.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied the Trump administration's request to unseal grand jury materials from the case of convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. Judge Paul Engelmayer ruled that releasing the documents would not provide any meaningful new information, stating they are redundant of trial evidence and contain no "untapped mine lode" of undisclosed facts. The judge suggested the government's motion might be a "diversion" aimed at creating the illusion of transparency rather than providing it.

Conversely, CDs are recommended for those who want to lock in a guaranteed higher interest rate for a set term, especially if they anticipate market rates will fall.

New signings Hugo Ekitiké and Florian Wirtz showed encouraging signs, with both contributing to goals and demonstrating creative energy. However, the team's shift to a new 4-2-3-1 formation left them looking defensively open, a problem seen throughout their pre-season. The absence of key midfielders exacerbated issues, with the back line often looking unsettled and vulnerable to simple through-balls, suggesting a period of adjustment will be needed.</p>
