        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April, driven by investors seeking refuge from the U.S. markets following President Trump's trade policies, with institutional investors being the primary drivers. The shift was prompted by concerns over Trump's tariffs and their potential impact on the U.S. economy, leading investors to diversify into perceived safe-haven assets like Japanese stocks and bonds. While the U.S. has since softened its trade stance, the initial surge into Japanese assets highlights the sensitivity of global markets to trade policy uncertainties. The article suggests that while confidence in U.S. assets is being restored, the long-term impact on Japanese markets remains to be seen. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Japanese parliament has enacted a law to allow preemptive acts of cyberdefense, enabling the government to monitor communications data and neutralize hostile servers in the event of an attack. The "active cyberdefense" law mandates operators of key infrastructure to report cyber breaches, with police initially handling server neutralization and the Self-Defense Forces intervening in sophisticated incidents. This move aims to enhance Japan's cybersecurity capabilities to match those of the United States and major European nations. An independent panel will oversee data acquisition and server neutralization to ensure proper government surveillance and protect personal rights. (article)</p>

          <p>Europe has been warned that it must reform quickly or become a ‚Äúshock absorber‚Äù of tectonic upheavals in global trade imbalances resulting from the US-China trade war. While the recent easing of tensions between the superpowers has led to a mutual reduction in tariffs, economists caution that Europe must adapt to Washington's efforts to reorder trade. Without deeper political integration and better coordination of fiscal and industrial policies, Europe risks being forced to adjust to the choices of others without shaping the outcomes.

          <p>Northern California's commercial crab season is under threat due to migrating endangered humpback whales, leading to entanglements with traditional crab fishing ropes. Fisherman Brand Little is using a high-tech system with remote-controlled pop-up devices to limit rope usage and avoid whale injuries. While the technology has proven effective, its high cost and resistance to change among fishermen pose challenges to widespread adoption. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has shortened the crab season to mitigate the risk to whales, but Little can keep fishing because of his use of the experimental device. (article)</p>

          <p>Ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene, when a land bridge connected the two continents. A new study found that horses from Alaska and northern Yukon are related to populations from Eurasia and crossed the Bering land bridge multiple times between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago. The Dalianensis horses, named after the northeastern Chinese city of Dalian, are shown to have a mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. The study, published in Science, highlights the genetic exchanges between North America and Eurasia in both directions. (article)</p>
