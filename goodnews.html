          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 06:00:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in the U.K. have created small robots, known as "Pipebots," designed to navigate inside underground water pipes to identify and potentially fix leaks without costly and disruptive excavation. These robots use cameras and acoustic sensors to travel through the pipe network, sending real-time data to engineers. This innovation is part of a broader effort to modernize aging water infrastructure, reduce water waste, and prevent pollution from damaged pipes. The technology could offer a more efficient and affordable solution for maintaining critical infrastructure globally.</p>

          <p>Beyond a casual hobby, remote control car racing has a dedicated professional circuit where elite drivers compete for sponsorships and prize money, much like in full-scale motorsports. At events like the Dirt Nitro Challenge, these pros, some of whom have been racing since childhood, showcase immense skill, piloting their high-speed buggies through complex dirt tracks. The scene is a tight-knit community of racers, mechanics, and families who travel the country. It highlights a unique and competitive niche sport where precision driving and technical expertise are paramount for success.</p>

          <p>Representative Robert Garcia, a Democrat from California, has quickly risen to a prominent leadership role on the House Oversight Committee, positioning himself as a leading figure in the opposition to the Trump administration. This article profiles Garcia, who came to the U.S. from Peru as a child and was formerly undocumented, highlighting his journey to citizenship and his unapologetic stance against what he calls Trump's "enormous grift." Garcia's ascent is seen as part of a generational shift in the Democratic party, which is increasingly looking for aggressive and charismatic leaders to challenge the administration.</p>

          <p>A friendly but fierce rivalry has erupted on social media between UCLA and UC Berkeley, with both institutions claiming the title of the nation's number one public university. The dispute stems from two different U.S. News & World Report rankings: a global list where Berkeley placed higher, and a national list where UCLA has been ranked first for several years. Fans, alumni, and even university chancellors have joined the playful sparring online. The debate highlights the significant weight placed on college rankings and the varying methodologies that can produce different outcomes.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to amend its Employment Rights Bill to grant parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy the legal right to paid bereavement leave. Currently, this leave is only available for stillbirths after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will give people essential time to grieve without having to use sick leave. Campaigners and politicians have praised the move as a significant step forward in recognizing early pregnancy loss as a true bereavement and ending the stigma surrounding it.</p>

          <p>Oscar Black, a 15-year-old from Northern Ireland, has set a new record as the youngest person to swim the North Channel solo, from Northern Ireland to Scotland. The grueling swim took him 16 hours and 38 minutes, during which he battled strong currents that extended his journey to 46km and endured numerous jellyfish stings. Despite the immense physical and mental challenges, which at times made him question his endeavor, Black persevered to complete the record-breaking feat. He described the accomplishment as a difficult but ultimately rewarding experience.</p>

          <p>A significant environmental problem exists across the U.S. in the form of hundreds of thousands, and possibly over a million, undocumented and unplugged "orphan" oil and gas wells. These defunct wells can leak methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and other toxins into the air and water, but finding them is a major challenge. A multi-billion dollar federal program is now funding efforts by states, tribes, and researchers to locate these wells using historical records, drones, and fieldwork. However, the cost of properly plugging them is immense, and policy changes are needed to prevent currently active wells from being orphaned in the future.</p>

          <p>Biosphere 2, the massive glass enclosure in the Arizona desert famous for its 1990s self-sustainability experiment, has evolved into a serious scientific research facility now run by the University of Arizona. Once a subject of media scrutiny and parody, it now houses unique, large-scale ecosystems like a rainforest, an ocean, and a desert, which scientists use to conduct critical climate change research. Current experiments focus on everything from the heat tolerance of coffee plants to coral reef restoration and watershed dynamics. The facility provides an unparalleled, controlled environment for studying Earth's complex systems.</p>

          <p>A debate is raging over the health impacts of seed oils like canola and soybean, with some wellness influencers and public figures claiming they are toxic and drive inflammation. However, many nutrition researchers argue that these claims are overblown and that the science does not support them. While seed oils are high in omega-6 fatty acids, clinical trials have not shown that they increase inflammation in the body; in fact, they can help lower bad cholesterol. Experts largely agree that the greater health concern is the overconsumption of ultra-processed foods, where these oils are prevalent.</p>

He received a royal pardon from Dubai's ruler. The case drew international attention, as the age of consent is 18 in the United Arab Emirates, and highlighted the risks tourists face from the country's strict laws. Campaign groups that supported Fakana emphasized the need for greater awareness among travelers about local laws that can criminalize behavior not considered illegal at home.</p>
