          <p>Israel has instructed its military to cease offensive actions in Gaza, permitting only defensive measures, according to Israeli sources. This move follows a statement from Hamas expressing readiness to release all hostages as part of a U.S.-proposed ceasefire plan, although further negotiations are still required for a comprehensive agreement. The decision underscores a top priority for Israel to secure the hostages' return and will be executed in full coordination with the U.S. administration, with a negotiating team expected to be dispatched soon.</p>

The full-back, currently contracted to Harlequins, acknowledged the rumors and reports that many of her England teammates have already signed pre-contract agreements. Kildunne emphasized that while she is focused on her upcoming season with Harlequins, the emergence of new leagues and investment is a necessary direction for the sport's growth following the Red Roses' recent success.</p>

          <p>A study by Italian researchers suggests that Venice's iconic bronze Lion of St Mark may have originated in Tang dynasty China as a tomb guardian before being transported to Europe. The researchers base their theory on stylistic similarities to Chinese mythical beasts and lead isotope analysis, which indicates the copper matches ore from China's Lower Yangtze River basin. The study also speculates that the statue could have been brought to Venice by the family of famed explorer Marco Polo, though some scholars in China have expressed skepticism about this proposed origin story.</p>

          <p>The film 'The Smashing Machine' chronicles the dramatic life of former MMA heavyweight champion Mark Kerr, with Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson in the starring role. The movie, based on a 2002 documentary of the same name, explores Kerr's rise to the top of the sport in the late 1990s and his subsequent battle with opioid addiction. Johnson, who has been a long-time admirer of Kerr's story, is producing the film, which has received critical acclaim and is seen as a second chance at recognition for the retired fighter, who is now sober and has been involved in the film's promotion.</p>

The project, titled "States of Elevation," involved Jornet cycling between the mountain ranges and running up each peak, covering over 3,000 miles across six states entirely under his own power. Jornet, widely considered the greatest mountain athlete of his generation, undertook the challenge not for records, but to explore a new landscape and follow what he described as "the most aesthetic line" through the American wilderness.</p>

          <p>The Nobel Prize has a rich and complex history filled with interesting and controversial details that are often overlooked. For instance, the Curie family amassed five prizes across two generations, while Albert Einstein promised his future prize money to his ex-wife in their divorce settlement before he had even won. The article also highlights historical oversights, such as the exclusion of female scientists like Lise Meitner and Rosalind Franklin from prizes for discoveries they were instrumental in, and instances where prizes were awarded for science that was later debunked.</p>

          <p>Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi as its new leader, setting her on course to become the nation's first female prime minister. The conservative former Economic Security Minister won an intraparty vote, defeating Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi in a runoff. Her election comes as the LDP seeks to regain public trust after a series of election losses. As leader of the party with a majority in the lower house, Takaichi's confirmation as prime minister is highly likely when parliament votes in mid-October.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sanae Takaichi, poised to be Japan's first female prime minister, is an ultra-conservative politician who has built her career within the country's male-dominated ruling party. A protégé of former leader Shinzo Abe, she is a historical revisionist and China hawk who supports traditional family roles and opposes policies like same-sex marriage. While her rise is historic in a country with low gender equality in politics, her conservative stances may not advance women's issues and could create friction with Japan's neighbors and its moderate coalition partner.</p>

          <p>The 1998 BBC documentary "Premier Passions," which gave viewers an unfiltered look at Sunderland's tumultuous 1996-97 Premier League season, is being remembered as the club returns to the top flight. Former manager Peter Reid, known for his expletive-filled halftime team talks featured in the series, looks back on the production, acknowledging that his methods might not be acceptable today. The series captured a pivotal moment as the club prepared to leave its historic Roker Park stadium, documenting both the on-field relegation battle and off-field modernization efforts.</p>

          <p>The first supermoon of 2025, known as the Harvest Moon, is set to appear on the night of October 7th, kicking off a series of three consecutive supermoons. A supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides with its closest approach to Earth, making it appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than usual. This year's Harvest Moon is the full moon closest to the autumn equinox and is notable for rising around sunset for several consecutive evenings, a phenomenon that traditionally provided extra light for farmers.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's decision to treat Hamas's conditional response to his 20-point peace plan as a full acceptance marks a pivotal moment in the two-year Gaza conflict. By immediately calling on Israel to halt its bombing, Trump has cornered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and prioritized the release of hostages over Hamas's complete disarmament. This pragmatic, deal-making approach is seen as uniquely Trumpian, driven by a desire to secure a foreign policy win, further his Abraham Accords, and respond to shifting public opinion and his own frustration with Netanyahu's actions.</p>
