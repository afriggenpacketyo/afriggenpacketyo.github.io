          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials have reached an agreement on a trade framework after high-level talks in London, which now awaits approval from President Trump and President Xi. The agreement aims to implement the Geneva consensus and follows a phone call between the two presidents last week, seeking to stabilize strained relations. If both leaders approve, the framework will be implemented, signaling a commitment to de-escalate trade tensions and continue dialogue. The fact that the two sides will now brief their leaders "is a clear sign that some disagreements or unresolved details still require internal discussion," said Jianwei Xu, senior economist at Natixis.</p>

          <p>Europe's electric vehicle (EV) market is experiencing a recovery in 2025, with registrations of electrified vehicles increasing by 20% from January to April. The rebound is largely attributed to a new EU mandate requiring automakers to cut fleet-wide CO2 emissions by 15% from 2021 levels, spurring corporate sales to avoid hefty fines. Despite this growth, consumer skepticism remains, with interest in EVs stagnant and hybrids favored due to charging concerns. Chinese automakers are also gaining ground, with BYD surpassing Tesla in European sales in April, highlighting the fast-changing dynamics of the European auto market.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that consuming a cup of chickpeas daily may help lower cholesterol levels, particularly for adults with prediabetes. The study, presented at the NUTRITION 2025 conference, found that participants who ate chickpeas for 12 weeks experienced a significant reduction in elevated cholesterol. Dr. William W. Li explained that chickpeas improve lipid metabolism and lower inflammation through the gut biome. He suggested various ways to incorporate chickpeas into one's diet, such as roasting them as a snack or stewing them with vegetables, while advising against excessive oil or deep frying to maintain their nutritional benefits.</p>

The article contrasts this with George H.W. Bush's preference for The Waltons, highlighting how politicians can appear out of touch when using pop culture for political gain. The Simpsons, at its core, was a wholesome show that reflected the everyday anxieties of middle-American families.</p>

          <p>Two years after the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam, the landscape in southern Ukraine is undergoing a natural transformation, with lush vegetation and diverse wildlife returning to the exposed basin. The Dnipro River has reformed vast floodplains, resembling the area's pre-dam state from the 1950s, with ecologists noting a significant increase in plant and animal species. However, the future of this ecosystem is uncertain, as Ukraine considers rebuilding the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, a decision opposed by ecologists who fear it would destroy the newly formed landscape. Engineers argue that rebuilding the plant is vital for supplying water to the region and ensuring the safe operation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.</p>

          <h2>Peruvian Blueberry Growers Eye China Amid U.S. Tariff Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-11 06:08:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Peruvian blueberry growers are seeking new markets, particularly in China, due to rising production and U.S. tariffs. Peru has become a major exporter of blueberries, but the U.S. tariff war is pushing growers to diversify their export destinations. China's growing demand and a new port near Lima that cuts shipping time have made it an attractive market. Valle y Pampa, a major producer, is planning its first big China shipment to mitigate the impact of a 10% U.S. tariff on all goods from Peru. (not investment advice)</p>
