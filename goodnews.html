        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Milda Mitkutė, the creator of the second-hand clothing app Vinted, transformed a personal problem of having too many clothes into a billion-dollar business. The idea originated in 2008 when, faced with moving to a smaller apartment, she conceived of a website to sell her excess wardrobe. After partnering with a friend, Justas Janauskas, they quickly launched a basic site that gained popularity through word of mouth, eventually expanding internationally. Despite early financial struggles, Vinted became Lithuania's first tech unicorn in 2019 by focusing on a user-friendly, no-fee model for sellers, successfully tapping into the sustainable fashion market.</p>

The 13.1-mile course started in Newcastle, passed through Gateshead, and finished in South Shields. In the elite races, Sheila Chepkirui won the women's competition, while Alex Mutiso secured victory in the men's event. The wheelchair races were won by Sean Frame and Mel Nicholls.

          <p>A growing number of Western countries, including France, Canada, Australia, and Belgium, have announced they will recognize a Palestinian state at the upcoming UN General Assembly. This follows the formal recognition earlier this year by Ireland, Norway, and Spain, signaling a significant shift in the diplomatic landscape concerning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Currently, 147 of the 193 UN member states officially recognize Palestine. While the General Assembly vote is largely symbolic, as full UN membership requires Security Council approval where the U.S. holds veto power, it reflects increasing international pressure for a two-state solution.</p>

          <p>Following the recent $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot win, with tickets sold in Texas and Missouri, the after-tax winnings will differ significantly based on state laws. Winners in states with no income tax on lottery prizes, such as Texas, Florida, and California, will take home the largest amount after federal taxes are withheld. Conversely, states with high income tax rates, like New York and New Jersey, will see the lowest payouts. Federal law mandates a 24% withholding on winnings over $5,000, with the total federal tax burden reaching about 37%, before any state taxes are applied. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The South Korean government announced it has reached an agreement with the United States for the release of over 300 of its citizens who were detained in a major immigration raid. The raid targeted a Hyundai electric vehicle battery plant currently under construction in Georgia. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detained 475 people in total during the operation, which is part of the Trump administration's broader crackdown on immigration. South Korea, a key U.S. ally, expressed "concern and regret" over the raid and is arranging a charter flight to bring the released workers home.</p>

          <p>English cricketer Jacob Bethell has expressed that he feels he should have played more during the recent home summer season. The 21-year-old all-rounder, who had an impressive debut Test series last winter, found himself in a limited role this year. After missing a Test against Zimbabwe due to his Indian Premier League commitments, he lost his spot in the Test XI and was a spare batter for four matches against India. Bethell acknowledged the lack of game time was a learning experience and suggested the break might ultimately be beneficial for his long-term career.</p>

          <p>With over half of Americans developing high blood pressure by age 40, new American Heart Association recommendations stress the importance of early intervention to prevent serious health issues. Hypertension, often called the "silent killer" due to its lack of symptoms, is a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, and dementia. The guidelines advocate for lifestyle changes like a low-sodium diet, exercise, and stress reduction for blood pressure above 130/80 mm Hg. For readings of 140/90 mm Hg or higher, starting treatment with two medications is now recommended to effectively manage the condition and improve long-term health outcomes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With gold prices hitting new records and gaining over 35% this year, investors are increasingly looking to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset amid economic uncertainty. Financial experts generally recommend gaining exposure through gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), rather than purchasing physical bullion. ETFs are considered more liquid, tax-efficient, and have lower transaction costs compared to storing physical gold. Despite the current rally, most financial advisors suggest limiting gold to a small portion of a well-diversified portfolio, typically less than 3%, due to its commodity-based price volatility.

          <p>The burgeoning rivalry between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz will see its next chapter in the US Open men's final, marking their third consecutive Grand Slam title match this season. Their rivalry, dubbed 'Sin-caraz,' first gained prominence with a memorable quarter-final match at the same tournament three years ago. This year, Sinner defended his Australian Open title, while Alcaraz triumphed at the French Open before Sinner claimed victory at Wimbledon. Their meeting in New York makes them the first men in the Open era to contest three Grand Slam finals in the same season, solidifying their status as the new leaders of men's tennis.</p>

          <p>Observations from four powerful telescopes, including the Hubble and James Webb, have confirmed that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is highly unusual. While believed to be a comet, it exhibits peculiar traits not seen in solar system comets, such as an extremely high ratio of carbon dioxide to water in its gaseous atmosphere. The object was also observed to be active at a much greater distance from the Sun than is typical. Despite its activity, it lacks a distinct cometary tail, instead showing a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust. These strange characteristics are providing scientists with a rare opportunity to study an object formed outside our solar system.</p>

His decision to move back to China full-time is part of a notable trend of high-profile academics of Chinese descent leaving top Western institutions to take up positions in their home country, bolstering China's growing academic and research capabilities.</p>

          <p>A Utah judge has struck down the state's Republican-drawn congressional map, ruling that the GOP-led legislature unconstitutionally overrode the will of the voters. In 2018, Utah citizens approved a proposition to create an independent redistricting commission, but lawmakers subsequently ignored its work and passed their own heavily gerrymandered map. The invalidated map had divided Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County among four districts to ensure Republican victories. The court has ordered the legislature to draw a new, fairer map, marking a significant victory for anti-gerrymandering advocates and reinforcing the principle that voter initiatives should be honored.</p>
