          <p>A century after the 1925 Scopes trial, where a teacher was prosecuted for teaching evolution in Tennessee, its impact on the U.S. cultural divide over science, religion, and education persists. The trial, a media spectacle featuring lawyers Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan, was the first to be broadcast on radio and highlighted a deep national rift. While the verdict was guilty, it sparked a long-term backlash against evolution in schools, leading to decades of downplayed science education and subsequent legal battles over "creation science" and "intelligent design." Today, although a majority of Americans accept evolution, the cultural and political conflicts a la the Scopes trial continue to echo in modern debates.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following one of Southern California's longest-ever toxic algal blooms this spring, the Marine Mammal Care Center has released its final sea lion patient. The bloom sickened over 1,500 marine animals, with the center in San Pedro treating nearly 400 sea lions and dolphins. The release of the sea lion, named Patchouli, marks a transition to scientific investigation. Researchers will now analyze samples collected from the animals, including those that did not survive, to better understand how the toxin affects them and their unborn young. The study will also explore potential links between the algal bloom and runoff from recent wildfires.</p>

          <h2>Experts Offer Science-Based Tips to Avoid Mosquito Bites</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Beyond common methods like bug sprays, entomology experts suggest several surprising, science-backed strategies to reduce mosquito bites. Sammy Ramsey from the University of Colorado, Boulder, and Brian Byrd from Western Carolina University share their insights on how to make oneself less appealing to these insects. Their advice covers various tactics that people may not typically consider when trying to prevent bites during mosquito season. The article presents these effective prevention methods in an interactive quiz format, allowing readers to test their knowledge and learn new ways to stay protected from mosquitoes. These tips provide practical alternatives for those looking to avoid traditional repellents or simply enhance their defense.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece discusses the economic landscape of East Asia, particularly in light of new U.S. tariffs of 25% on Japan and South Korea. The author argues that while Japan and South Korea built their economies on home-grown technologies, China evolved from an original equipment manufacturer to a high-tech powerhouse with a robust, automated supply chain. Unlike its neighbors, China's economic leverage provides a model for the region. The article suggests that by focusing on innovation in areas like electric vehicles, where companies like BYD challenge Tesla, and by leveraging strengths in industrial robotics, China, Japan, and South Korea can solidify their roles as global titans of technology.

          <p>A new study has identified Virginia as the top state for french fry consumption in the United States. Based on a poll of 5,000 adults, the average Virginian reportedly eats at least 21 pounds of fries annually. Following closely are Alabama, Georgia, and Maryland, where residents consume about 20 pounds per year. The study, commissioned by McCain Foods ahead of National French Fry Day, reveals that the average American eats a minimum of 17 pounds of fries each year. This translates to a staggering national total of over 5.6 billion pounds of the popular food item consumed annually across the country.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. will send more weapons to Ukraine, reversing a decision from the previous week to halt some critical arms shipments. The announcement came during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, where Trump stated he was "not happy" with Vladimir Putin and that Ukraine needed to be able to defend itself from intense attacks. The prior pause reportedly included key defensive systems like Patriot air defence missiles. The Pentagon confirmed it would send additional defensive weapons at the president's direction, a move that provides relief to Kyiv amid escalating Russian drone and missile strikes.</p>

She scored just 41 seconds into her senior debut and provided a noticeable spark in a recent loss to France, demonstrating her ability to influence a game quickly. Manager Sarina Wiegman selected Agyemang as a wildcard, hoping she could "bring something different," a sentiment echoed by teammates who praise her strength and on-pitch presence. Agyemang herself expresses a calm focus on helping the team, vowing to be ready whenever called upon as England fights to stay in the tournament.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to ban employers from using non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to silence victims of workplace sexual misconduct and discrimination. Through an amendment to the Employment Rights Bill, any confidentiality agreement attempting to prevent workers from speaking out about harassment will be rendered void. This move addresses the misuse of NDAs, highlighted in cases involving figures like Harvey Weinstein, to cover up potential criminality. Campaigners, who have long advocated for this change, called it a "huge milestone" that demonstrates the government understands the abuse of power inherent in such practices, protecting victims rather than powerful individuals.</p>

          <p>Australia's central bank has surprisingly decided to hold its policy interest rate at 3.85%, contrary to economists' expectations of a 25-basis-point cut. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) stated it needs more time and information to confirm that inflation is sustainably on track to its 2.5% target. While recent monthly inflation data was broadly in line with forecasts, the RBA noted it was slightly stronger than expected. The decision comes as Australia's economy is experiencing a growth slowdown. Analysts now predict the next rate cut could occur in August, after the RBA has reviewed the comprehensive quarterly inflation data. (not investment advice)</p>
