          <p>Australian markets experienced a downturn in early trading following Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's reelection, marking his second consecutive term in 21 years, signaling a desire for policy stability. The S&P/ASX 200 index edged down by 0.29%, reversing gains from the previous session, while the Australian dollar slightly depreciated against the U.S. dollar. Trading volumes were thin, with Japanese, South Korean, Hong Kong, and Chinese markets closed for public holidays. U.S. futures also saw a slight decline, contrasting with the strong performance in Wall Street last week, where the S&P 500 achieved its longest winning streak since 2004.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced plans to impose a 100% tariff on all foreign-produced movies entering the United States, citing the decline of the American motion picture industry due to incentives offered by other countries. Trump stated that this situation poses a national security threat, as it involves messaging and propaganda. He has authorized the Department of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative to begin implementing the tariff immediately. This announcement follows pauses in several of Trump's other tariff plans due to market turmoil and backlash.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the impact of President Trump's policies and persona on recent elections in Canada, Australia, Germany, Britain and Singapore. In Canada and Australia, center-left parties won by campaigning against Trump-like conservatives, while in Singapore, stability amid Trump's trade wars boosted the incumbent party. In Germany, Trump's policies indirectly helped the new chancellor push through spending limit suspensions. However, in Britain, a Trump-aligned party gained ground, indicating the unpredictable nature of Trump's influence on global politics. The article suggests that while anti-Trump sentiment may be a factor in some elections, the impact varies across different political landscapes.</p>

          <p>As more women turn to egg freezing to delay childbearing, some experts caution against relying on the procedure due to its high costs and lack of guarantees. Vardit Ravitsky emphasizes that egg freezing is a gamble with financial and medical risks, and success is not assured. She suggests that companies should instead implement policies like paid parental leave and flexible hours to make it easier for women to have children younger. Despite these concerns, many women view egg freezing as a valuable option, understanding that it is not a certainty but the right move for them.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the increasing popularity of egg freezing among young women as a way to preserve their fertility and delay childbearing.

While expensive, some companies offer egg freezing as a benefit. Despite the potential for success, it's emphasized that egg freezing is not a guarantee, and women should be aware of the costs and risks involved.</p>
