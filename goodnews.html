          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships reveals that parents who avoid defiance use language that fosters cooperation. Traditional parenting phrases can trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, hindering learning. Instead, language that respects a child's autonomy while maintaining boundaries is more effective. The article suggests alternative phrases to avoid threats, bribes, and harsh consequences, promoting emotional safety and respect. By shifting from control to empathy and leadership, parents can reduce power struggles and raise emotionally resilient children.</p>

          <p>Prescriptions for Mounjaro, a weight loss injection, are now available at GP surgeries in England, but only for those meeting strict criteria. NHS England plans a staggered approach to reach those most in need, manage GP workload, and NHS resources. Eligible patients include those with a BMI of 40 or over and specific health conditions. Some GP practices warn that few patients will qualify initially, and pharmacy organizations fear demand will exceed supply. The medicine makes you feel fuller so you eat less, leading to significant weight loss in clinical trials.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian rights activist recently released from ICE detention, returned to Columbia University to reaffirm his commitment to Palestinian freedom and opposition to the university and the Trump administration. Khalil criticized Columbia for attempting to suppress pro-Palestinian activism and accused them of funding the killing in Gaza. He was detained for over 100 days and missed the birth of his first child. Despite the ordeal, Khalil remains dedicated to advocating for Palestinian rights and denouncing the university's actions.</p>

          <h2>China Dominates Electric Vehicle Market</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has become the world leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold in the country last year being electric. This shift is attributed to government subsidies, long-term planning, and dominance in battery production. China's BYD now leads the global EV market, surpassing Tesla. The government provided vast subsidies to grow the industry, encouraging companies like BYD to switch from smartphone batteries to EVs. This combination of planning and funding has allowed China to dominate critical supply chains in battery production, but other countries see it as unfair business practice.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist hopes to establish a clinic by year-end offering ketamine for severe depression, providing an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This move follows a private clinic in Lanarkshire that began offering ketamine-assisted therapy. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors. The clinic director admits the cost of ketamine-assisted therapy may be out of reach for many and hopes it will soon be available on the NHS. The Royal College of Psychiatrists is due to publish a new report on psychedelics later this year, with updated information on ketamine.</p>

          <p>Max Muncy hit two home runs and drove in seven runs, matching a career high, as the Dodgers defeated the Washington Nationals 13-7. Muncy's performance overshadowed Shohei Ohtani's second pitching start of the season, where Ohtani pitched a scoreless first inning. Ohtani also contributed with a three-run triple and a two-run home run. Muncy's grand slam in the sixth inning erased a 3-0 deficit, shifting the game's momentum. The Dodgers secured a weekend series win and improved their record to 7-3 on their 10-game homestand.</p>

          <p>Keegan Bradley secured the Travelers Championship by one shot, denying Tommy Fleetwood his first PGA Tour title. Fleetwood, after 41 top-10 finishes, held a two-shot lead with three holes to play and a one-shot advantage going into the final hole. However, a poor putt on the 18th led to a bogey, allowing Bradley to win with a birdie. Fleetwood expressed his disappointment, describing it as "the worst way to finish." Bradley, the 2011 US PGA Championship winner, will captain the USA at the Ryder Cup in September.</p>

It marks the first time the Bellingham brothers have scored in the same competition. Bellingham also confirmed he will undergo surgery to address a long-standing shoulder issue after the tournament.</p>
