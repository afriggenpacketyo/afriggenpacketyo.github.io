        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following days of intense, youth-led anti-corruption protests that led to the previous government's collapse, Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, has seen a return to calm. Former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki has been sworn in as the nation's first female interim prime minister. The appointment, which followed negotiations involving the army and protest representatives, is seen as a stabilizing move. In response to the unrest, which was fueled by economic woes and a controversial social media ban, the parliament has been dissolved and new elections are scheduled for March 5.</p>

          <p>In an effort to address both a declining birth rate and a need to strengthen its scientific workforce, Shanghai has launched a new subsidy program for female researchers. The initiative provides a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (US$7,010) to support women returning to work after childbirth. Initially targeting 20 new mothers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the program is for women under 40 with a doctoral degree. While the initial scope is limited, it is being viewed by some as a positive step toward supporting women in demanding scientific careers.</p>

The championships mark a significant moment for the city, which hosted the 2020 Olympics without spectators due to the pandemic, and enthusiastic crowds have turned out to support the athletes. Despite organizers moving start times earlier, the extreme weather has posed a significant challenge, with one Japanese athlete collapsing after finishing. The event highlights both the excitement of the crowd's return and the severe physical toll of competing in such conditions.</p>

          <p>In a stunning high school football game, Corona Centennial defeated the nation's number-one-ranked team, Mater Dei, with a final score of 43-36. The victory was particularly notable as it marked the first time in a decade that Mater Dei had lost to a Southern Section opponent other than powerhouse St. John Bosco. The game was a rollercoaster, with Centennial dominating the first half before Mater Dei staged a massive comeback to take the lead, only for Centennial to rally for the win in the final minutes. The upset reshapes the landscape of Southern California high school football.</p>

          <p>Line dancing is experiencing a significant revival, moving from village halls to viral TikTok trends and attracting a much younger audience. The resurgence is largely attributed to the crossover success of country-pop artists like Sabrina Carpenter and Dasha, which has made the genre "cool again." Enthusiasts note that the dance style has evolved, incorporating routines to a wide variety of music beyond traditional country. This modern appeal, combined with its benefits as a social and low-impact exercise, is breaking down old stereotypes and creating a vibrant, diverse community of dancers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pre-orders for Apple's new iPhone 17 series in China have started exceptionally strong, breaking previous sales records. Within the first minute of availability, sales on the e-commerce platform JD.com exceeded the total first-day volume of last year's iPhone 16 series. The intense demand led to technical difficulties on Apple's official website and caused in-store pickup slots in major cities like Shanghai to be fully booked within 20 minutes. Delivery times for new orders are already stretching into mid-October, indicating robust consumer interest in Apple's latest smartphone despite a competitive market.</p>

          <p>At a major auto show in Munich, Chinese electric vehicle (EV) companies like Xpeng and GAC made a significant impression, signaling their ambitious plans to expand into the European market. These firms are directly challenging legacy European automakers by competing on price, advanced technology, and in-car features, such as integrated refrigerators and massage seats. While European brands like BMW and Volkswagen showcased their own new EVs, there are concerns they are not innovating fast enough to counter the rapid development cycles of their Chinese rivals, who are gaining market share in the region.</p>

Despite the risks in a climate of increasing crackdowns on LGBTQ+ rights and free expression in Lebanon, he refuses to cancel his shows, arguing that his dance is a political act that can inspire others to be themselves.</p>
