          <p>President Trump has agreed to extend the deadline for imposing 50% tariffs on the European Union to July 9th, following a request from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Von der Leyen stated she needed more time to reach a "good deal" with the US, emphasizing the close trade relationship between the two entities. This extension provides additional time for negotiations aimed at resolving trade disputes and potentially averting increased tariffs. Trump initially threatened the tariffs due to frustration with the pace of negotiations, but the extension signals a willingness to continue discussions. (not investment advice)</p>

The mosaic, made of rare marble and porphyry, was part of an inlaid floor on one of the ships. It was eventually recovered during Mussolini's regime, but disappeared after World War II, later resurfacing in the possession of art dealer Helen Fioratti, who had purchased it in good faith. The mosaic has since been seized and returned to the Museum of the Roman Ships, and a replica is being made for Fioratti.</p>

          <p>Archaeological discoveries in Rome, including the unearthing of what is believed to be Emperor Caligula's pleasure gardens, have prompted scholars to re-examine the historical portrayal of the controversial ruler. While Caligula has been depicted as deranged and despicable, some historians argue that these accounts may be exaggerated, relying on gossip and second-hand stories. The gardens, discovered during the construction of an underground parking lot, offer insight into the opulence and lavish parties that took place during Caligula's reign. These findings, combined with a reevaluation of historical texts, seek to uncover a more nuanced understanding of the emperor's life and legacy.</p>

Dr. Daniel Perl discovered microscopic scarring in the brains of service members and veterans who died by suicide. Special Operations Command commissioned a study to look for brain injuries from cumulative, low-level blasts, with Harvard professor Dr. Brian Edlow leading the research. The study found changes in brain structure to a region critically important because it modulates emotion and cognition, leading to a new five-year study planned by SOCOM with 200 subjects.</p>

          <h2>Emotionally Safe Parenting: A New Approach to Raising Successful Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 17:59:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting" emphasizes attunement to a child's emotional needs, focusing on building resilience, trust, and connection through open communication. This approach encourages parents to accept emotions without dismissing them, respond without shaming, and view "bad" behavior as a signal for support. Emotionally safe parents prioritize their own inner healing, set boundaries with empathy, and prevent shame by reconnecting after conflicts. This parenting style aims to create an environment where children feel safe expressing themselves and showing up as their authentic selves.</p>
