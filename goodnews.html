        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Emerging market stocks are gaining traction as the 'sell U.S.' narrative strengthens, fueled by factors such as a weaker U.S. dollar, a potential peak in U.S. bond yields, and China's economic recovery. Bank of America has identified emerging markets as the 'next bull market,' while JPMorgan has upgraded emerging market equities, citing attractive valuations and easing U.S.-China trade tensions. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has seen an 8.55% year-to-date increase, outperforming the S&P 500's 1% climb. Dented confidence in U.S. assets, marked by a selloff in U.S. Treasuries, equities, and the greenback, has further propelled the bullish outlook for emerging markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sixteen European consumer groups are pressing the EU to act against seven low-cost airlines, including Ryanair and easyJet, over their baggage fees. The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) accuses these airlines of misleading passengers with additional charges for baggage that doesn't meet their guidelines, causing confusion and distress at check-ins. The consumer groups argue that such practices breach EU consumer law and are demanding an investigation by the European Commission and national consumer authorities, seeking sanctions for these 'illegal' practices. Ryanair and Norwegian have defended their policies, stating they comply with EU law, while other airlines argue that the action would decrease consumer choice.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have concurred that the current dollar-yen exchange rate accurately reflects economic fundamentals, a statement made during bilateral tariff negotiations. This acknowledgement implies that the yen's recent weakness against the dollar is no longer a point of contention in trade discussions, diverging from President Trump's view that it contributes to the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. Kato expressed concerns about the global economic impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, while both sides reaffirmed their commitment to market-determined exchange rates. Japan is considering a compromise on U.S. tariff rates to expedite a trade deal, but removing tariffs on cars and auto parts remains a priority.</p>

The facility will utilize advanced technologies like AI and robotics to improve the efficiency of seeding, climate control, irrigation, and harvesting, supporting the cultivation of over 10 crop varieties, including tomatoes, cucumbers, melons, and strawberries. This collaboration, involving a 120 million dirham investment, aims to transform desert farming and serves as a model for agricultural innovation across the Persian Gulf, contributing to sustainable regional development as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with conservative holdouts to rally support for the budget package, which contains his second-term agenda, as GOP leaders made concessions to fiscal hawks and blue-state Republicans. House Speaker Mike Johnson described the meeting as productive, with plans to move forward with the legislation. However, the Rules Committee met late into the evening to address demands for more spending cuts from conservatives and concerns about the state and local tax deduction (SALT) cap from blue-state Republicans. The developments came as leaders raced to pass the budget package before the Memorial Day deadline.</p>

          <p>The Army has begun preparing to transport Abrams tanks from Fort Cavazos, Texas, to Washington, D.C., for its 250th birthday parade on June 14, which coincides with President Trump's birthday. The parade, expected to cost between $25 million and $45 million, will feature 28 M1 Abrams tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles, Stryker vehicles, and vintage military platforms. The event, designated as a 'national security special event,' has prompted speculation that Trump is using the occasion to stage a grand military display. The parade will trace the Army's evolution from the Revolutionary War to the present day.</p>

          <p>Southern California has experienced the brunt of a heat wave, with temperatures expected to slightly decrease, bringing a return of 'May gray' and cooler temperatures. Woodland Hills reached 95 degrees, but temperatures remained below record levels. A low-pressure system will sweep into the region, bringing overcast conditions and the possibility of cloudy beach weather on Memorial Day. While forecasters predict another round of heat may be on the horizon by the middle of next week, the recent heat has increased the risk of brush fires, with heightened fire department responses.</p>

          <p>Nearly all of the 381 books removed from the U.S. Naval Academy library for addressing anti-racism and gender issues have been returned following a Pentagon-ordered review. About 20 books are still being reviewed. The back-and-forth reflects issues in the Trump administration's efforts to purge DEI content from federal agencies. The Pentagon issued a directive to military leaders to review library books addressing diversity, anti-racism, or gender issues. The libraries had to remove educational materials 'promoting divisive concepts and gender ideology' because they are incompatible with the Defense Department's core mission.</p>

USIP's mission is to provide analysis and resources to promote peace and reduce the chance of U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts, with staff often deployed to conflict zones.</p>
