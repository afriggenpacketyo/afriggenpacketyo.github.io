          <p>Returning to the Hollywood Bowl after a seven-year absence, Colombian music star Juanes delivered an emotional performance that included a message of unity for the city's diverse Latino community. Referencing the fear caused by immigration raids, he urged the audience to stay united now more than ever. The concert featured songs from his latest album, "Vida cotidiana," as well as classic hits like "La camisa negra." He also paid tribute to Mexican culture by performing with a mariachi band, solidifying his connection with the Los Angeles audience.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author reflects on turning 35 and the realization that adulthood is a constant process of "winging it" rather than reaching a state of settled certainty. Using the French TV show "Bref" as a bookend to his own journey as an American immigrant in France, he contemplates themes of identity, regret, and connection. The author grapples with finding personal joy and meaning in a life more incredible than he imagined, while simultaneously witnessing a world beset by political turmoil and conflict, ultimately finding hope in the unwritten pages of his future.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Farmer Gains Attention for Building Homemade 7-Meter Submarine</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 00:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province has fulfilled a lifelong dream of invention by constructing his own 7-meter-long submarine. Having managed a riverside dock for years, the man was inspired by a television program in 2014 featuring a submarine. Using 5,000 yuan (about $700), he secretly purchased steel plates, a battery, and an engine to begin construction. His creation has since been seen navigating a local river, drawing stares and admiration from fellow villagers for his ingenuity and determination to build a vessel that could travel underwater.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Core Inflation Eases in June Amid Economic Headwinds and Tariff Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, primarily due to easing rice prices after the government released stockpiles. Despite the moderation, inflation remains above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for the 39th consecutive month. The economic outlook is complicated by concerns over potential U.S. tariffs, with President Trump recently stating he does not expect a trade deal with Japan. Economists worry that persistent yen depreciation and higher tariffs could hinder growth and increase market volatility ahead of upcoming elections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has acknowledged past US accusations that European nations were not funding their own defense sufficiently, admitting they had been "free-riders." In an interview, Merz stated that Europe now understands it must do more and is increasing its defense spending in response to the threat posed by Russia. He also commented on relations with the US, noting he is on good speaking terms with President Trump and coordinating on issues like the war in Ukraine and trade tariffs. The comments came as Germany and the UK work to strengthen a bilateral friendship and defense treaty.</p>

          <p>China has revealed a new military drone that takes off and lands vertically on its tail, similar to a rocket, before transitioning to horizontal flight. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which resembles the US military's V-BAT drone, was tested for reconnaissance and situational awareness in a mountainous region. Developed by a state-owned aircraft group, its design allows for high-speed flight without needing a runway, providing greater operational flexibility in rugged terrain. The drone also features an intelligent control system capable of autonomous route planning and threat avoidance.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common and benign vein condition, after he experienced mild swelling in his lower legs. The announcement followed public speculation fueled by images showing Trump with swollen legs and a bruised hand, which the press secretary attributed to frequent handshaking and aspirin use. A letter from the presidential physician stated that medical tests found no evidence of more serious conditions like deep vein thrombosis and that Trump "remains in excellent health."</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the TSA may soon alter its long-standing restrictions on liquids in carry-on luggage for air travel. Speaking at a conference, Noem said she is questioning "everything TSA does" and that the size requirements for liquids might be the next policy to be updated. The potential change follows the recent elimination of the rule requiring passengers to remove shoes during security checks. Noem did not provide specific details on what the new liquid rules might be or a timeline for their implementation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reviews several new film releases, led by the horror sequel "I Know What You Did Last Summer." The review finds the new installment to be an improvement on the mediocre 1997 original, with self-aware humor and well-executed action, though it still falls short of being memorable. Also reviewed is Ari Aster's "Eddington," a neo-western set during the 2020 pandemic starring Joaquin Phoenix and Pedro Pascal, which explores political and social divides in a small New Mexico town. The article also covers the bullfighting documentary "Tardes de soledad" and two LGBTQ+ dramas.</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old from Colchester, Essex, has fully immersed himself in the culture and style of the 1940s, an era he fell in love with after learning about the World Wars. The teenager, named Lincoln, dresses exclusively in period clothing, listens to music from the time, and even rides a 1939 bicycle. He developed a passion for the era's sense of community and elegance, and he now works at a 1940s-themed tea room and antiques shop. His family supports his passion, which he sees as a way to honor the sacrifices made during that time.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An ice core believed to be the oldest ever recovered, potentially dating back 1.5 million years, has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey for analysis. Drilled from deep within the Antarctic ice sheet, the glassy cylinder contains trapped air bubbles, dust, and volcanic ash that hold vital clues about Earth's past climate. Scientists will carefully melt the ice to study these ancient materials, hoping to understand a mysterious shift in the planet's glacial cycles and gain insights into our current era of climate change. The research could revolutionize our understanding of Earth's environmental history.</p>
