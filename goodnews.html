        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans are considering a tax package that would eliminate several consumer tax breaks related to clean energy, potentially impacting households interested in electric vehicles and home energy efficiency upgrades. The proposed changes would terminate tax credits for new and used EVs, as well as incentives for projects like installing solar panels and heat pumps, after 2025, significantly earlier than the current law allows. Experts advise consumers considering these investments to act quickly to claim the breaks this year, especially by opting for upfront rebates at dealerships for EV purchases. The proposed repeal aims to raise money for a broader tax package, but it would also increase the U.S. deficit by trillions over the next decade.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has cautioned that financial markets may be undergoing a "fundamental regime change" due to investors rethinking the riskiness of U.S. assets amid ongoing trade tensions. The ECB's Financial Stability Review noted market sensitivity to U.S. tariff policies and shifts away from traditional safe havens like U.S. Treasuries and the dollar. This reassessment could trigger broader shifts in global capital flows with far-reaching consequences. ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos suggested there is a risk of a market correction due to elevated valuations and strong uncertainty, urging caution among investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lowe's has reaffirmed its full-year forecast, citing increased sales among home professionals that offset slower demand from do-it-yourself customers. The home improvement retailer's quarterly sales slightly missed Wall Street expectations, but earnings exceeded estimates. CEO Marvin Ellison highlighted investments in stores, technology, and customer service as key factors in navigating the challenging housing market. While overall consumer health is strong, customers are still delaying larger purchases, and Lowe's anticipates a gradual improvement in discretionary spending and store traffic.</p>

CEO Brian Cornell acknowledged the company's market share losses in several merchandise categories and announced a new Enterprise Acceleration Office to simplify operations and accelerate growth.

          <p>The Senate has passed a surprise "no tax on tips" bill, potentially allowing workers to deduct all "qualified tips" from 2025 through 2028. This proposal gained momentum after endorsements from both Trump and Vice President Harris during campaign appearances in Nevada. While proponents argue it would provide relief to hardworking Americans, critics contend it benefits only a narrow subset of the workforce and could create policy issues. The bill's potential impact on income classification and tipping behavior is uncertain, as tipping is a social behavior rather than a strictly economic transaction.</p>

          <p>Buy now, pay later (BNPL) debt can be sold to debt collectors if payments are not made, potentially impacting credit scores. BNPL providers typically attempt to collect the debt in-house before outsourcing to third-party agencies or selling the debt. Consumers should verify the debt, understand their rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and negotiate a settlement or payment plan. If BNPL debt is part of a larger debt problem, exploring debt relief options may be necessary. The article advises taking action to address BNPL debt in collections to avoid further financial consequences.</p>

The FDA's vaccine committee is scheduled to meet to discuss the latest data on vaccine safety and efficacy. The new framework would allow an estimated 33% of the U.S. population to be eligible for the shots, matching recommendations from other countries.</p>
