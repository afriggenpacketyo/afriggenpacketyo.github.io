          <p>The United States and South Korea have concluded a new trade agreement, establishing a 15% blanket tariff on South Korean exports to the U.S. As part of the deal, President Donald Trump announced that South Korea will also establish a $350 billion fund for investments in the United States, which he will personally help select. South Korean President Lee Jae-myung stated the fund is intended to help Korean companies with strengths in key industries like semiconductors, biotech, and energy expand into the American market. The deal marks a significant development in the Trump administration's international trade policy.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Reveals Why Magnitude 8.8 Russian Earthquake Caused Minimal Widespread Damage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 18:55:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, one of the largest ever recorded, resulted in surprisingly little damage and no reported deaths outside the immediate vicinity. Experts explain that the tsunami's energy was primarily directed into the open Pacific Ocean, between Alaska and Hawaii, allowing it to dissipate before reaching populated coastlines. While the remote Russian town of Severo-Kurilsk experienced significant waves, other areas like the U.S. West Coast saw much smaller, less destructive tsunamis. This event serves as a "best-case scenario" for a major quake, highlighting how location and directionality are crucial factors in a tsunami's destructive potential.</p>

          <p>Rangers secured their place in the next round of the Champions League qualifiers with a 3-1 aggregate victory over Panathinaikos, despite a challenging second-leg match in Athens that ended in a 1-1 draw. The Greek team took the lead on the night, creating a tense period for Rangers, but a crucial equalizing goal from Djeidi Gassama quelled the hosts' momentum. The team demonstrated significant resilience and character under pressure, with standout performances from players like defender John Souttar and goalkeeper Jack Butland. While the performance showed areas for improvement, the result is a significant step forward for the club under its new head coach.</p>

          <p>Microsoft's market value exceeded $4 trillion in after-hours trading after the company released a stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings report. The software giant's stock jumped 8% on the news, driven by its fastest revenue growth in over three years, with its Azure cloud business being a key performer. If the stock gains hold, Microsoft will become the second company, after Nvidia, to reach this exclusive valuation milestone. The surge highlights investor confidence in Microsoft's strategy and its prominent role in the booming artificial intelligence sector, further solidifying its position as one of the world's most valuable companies.

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, citing an uncertain economic outlook and persistent, though moderating, inflation. The rate-setting committee's statement noted that economic growth has been steady, and the labor market remains strong. However, the potential impact of tariffs on consumer prices continues to be a key concern for the central bank. The decision was not unanimous, with two voting members dissenting in favor of a rate cut, a rare occurrence. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that the economy is in good shape but faces risks, justifying a cautious, wait-and-see approach. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>William "Bill" Elwell, the founder and longtime operator of the iconic Bill's Burgers in Van Nuys, has passed away at the age of 98. Elwell opened the small burger shack in 1965 and became a local legend, known for his humor, occasionally gruff demeanor, and dedication to his craft, working there for 60 years. He famously enforced a "cash only, no substitutions" policy, with a menu stating, "You can’t have it your way, this is not Burger King." His death has prompted an outpouring of affection from generations of customers and fellow restaurateurs who were inspired by his work ethic and the timeless quality of his food.</p>

          <h2>Judge Dismisses Alec Baldwin's Malicious Prosecution Lawsuit Against New Mexico Officials</h2>

          <p>A New Mexico judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by actor Alec Baldwin, in which he alleged malicious prosecution by state officials regarding the fatal "Rust" film set shooting. Baldwin had sued prosecutors and law enforcement, claiming they made him a celebrity scapegoat after an involuntary manslaughter charge against him was dropped last year. The new judge dismissed the civil suit due to a lack of significant action in the case over the past six months. This ruling marks another step towards concluding the legal saga surrounding the 2021 on-set death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, following the earlier conviction of the film's weapons handler.</p>

          <h2>The Calming Effect of Watching Stressful Television Shows Explored</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 18:14:08 EDT</div>

          <p>Popular television shows like "The Bear" and "The Pitt" are captivating audiences with intensely stressful, high-anxiety narratives, raising the question of why such content can be so appealing. Psychologists suggest that watching characters navigate high-pressure situations induces a form of "vicarious stress," a fight-or-flight response that can feel good because it carries no real-world risk for the viewer. These shows often use hyperrealistic, real-time filmmaking techniques that create a strong sense of empathy and immersion. For many viewers, particularly younger audiences accustomed to constant real-world anxiety, watching relatable characters overcome mundane but intense challenges can be a cathartic and validating experience.</p>

This IPO comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated in 2023 due to regulatory opposition. Figma's successful public offering is a positive signal for the tech IPO market, which has been slowly reopening after a quiet period. The company has shown strong revenue growth, increasing by 40% in the most recent quarter compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The tsunami threat to the United States has largely passed following a massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula. The quake, one of the strongest ever recorded, triggered tsunami warnings and advisories across the Pacific, including for Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast. While some areas in Hawaii and California experienced minor flooding and small waves, widespread, catastrophic damage was averted. Officials in Hawaii and other coastal states issued evacuation orders as a precaution but were able to lift them after observation. The event caused significant flooding in the sparsely populated Russian region near the epicenter but resulted in no major damage or injuries elsewhere.</p>

Her decision opens up the race to succeed term-limited Governor Gavin Newsom in the nation's most populous blue state. In her statement, Harris said her public service will not be in elected office "for now," but vowed to remain politically active by helping elect Democrats nationwide. Having previously served as California's attorney general and U.S. senator, her potential candidacy had effectively frozen the gubernatorial field, with polls showing her as the top choice among voters.</p>

It spotlights six artists, including Argentine electronic artist Juana Aguirre, Chilean singer-songwriter Gepe, and Guatemalan cellist Mabe Fratti. The piece contends that some of the most progressive and creative Latin music is being made outside the major label system. It makes a case for why these artists' unique fusions of folk, electronic, rock, and avant-garde sounds deserve recognition in major categories like Album of the Year, beyond just niche alternative fields.</p>

While ratings for the stock market are more positive, two-thirds of adults expect the prices of goods they buy to go up in the coming months. This outlook is dampening spending plans, with half of the country, particularly those at lower income levels, planning to cut back on discretionary purchases. The poll suggests that while some economic indicators are viewed favorably, persistent concerns about inflation continue to cloud the overall financial outlook for many households.
