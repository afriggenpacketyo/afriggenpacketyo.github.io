          <p>A report details the events outside a Home Depot in Paramount, California, where protests erupted following the sighting of border patrol agents. The protests, sparked by stepped-up immigration enforcement actions, led to clashes between authorities and demonstrators. The situation escalated, resulting in the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops to L.A. The report contrasts the reality on the ground with the rhetoric used to justify the federal intervention.

The MLSPA also said that the league has attempted to ‚Äústrong-arm‚Äù the players into CBA waivers that do not regard the Club World Cup.
