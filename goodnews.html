        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a conversation with Ross Douthat, Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) assesses the Democratic Party's response to Donald Trump's second term, arguing that the party was unprepared for Trump's coordinated assault on the rule of law and the threat to democracy. Murphy emphasizes the need for Democrats to meet Trump's messaging with equal force, engage in more risk-tolerant tactics, and address the perception that the current version of democracy is rigged in favor of billionaires and special interests. He suggests focusing on campaign finance reform, curbing the influence of lobbyists, and unrigging the economy to make it fairer for small businesses and workers. Murphy also touches on cultural issues, advocating for empathy and less judgment on topics like transgender athletes and immigration, and calls for a more robust conversation about the regulation of technology and the spiritual health of the nation.</p>

          <h2>Nintendo Anticipates Strong Sales for Switch 2 Despite Tariff Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nintendo projects sales of 15 million Switch 2 consoles in its first fiscal year, despite potential challenges from U.S. tariffs. The forecast came as Nintendo reported a decline in revenue and profit for the recent fiscal year, attributed to consumers delaying purchases in anticipation of the new console. The company's president, Shuntaro Furukawa, acknowledged that additional tariffs could impact demand in the U.S., where Nintendo faces duties of 46% on consoles manufactured in Vietnam. Market analysts remain optimistic about the Switch 2's potential, citing a strong existing user base and Nintendo's history of conservative forecasts. The article also notes that Nintendo delayed pre-orders for the Switch 2 in the U.S. after the initial announcement of Trump's sweeping tariffs on countries around the world.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a trade agreement with Britain, marking the first deal since the imposition of tariffs on numerous trading partners. The agreement, details of which remain unclear, could involve lowered British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, and the removal of British taxes on U.S. technology companies. The agreement is viewed as a win for both countries, who have sought closer economic cooperation, and would offer vindication for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's cultivation of Trump. The announcement follows nearly three years of negotiations between British and European Union officials.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that home washing machines may not effectively eliminate harmful bacteria from clothing, even at high temperatures, potentially spreading superbugs. The research tested various washing machine models and found that some failed to disinfect clothing adequately, raising concerns about antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The study suggests domestic detergents could potentially create antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria, and recommends that healthcare professionals and institutions re-evaluate policies allowing workers to wash work clothing at home. The study also recommends using disinfectants monthly and running empty washes at high temperatures to disinfect machines.</p>

          <p>A woman discovers a new side to her deceased mother through a collection of letters from WWII servicemen and comment cards she wrote about them, revealing her experiences working at Red Cross dances in Rome. The letters, written on airmail paper, showcase the charm and earnestness of young soldiers who met the author's mother, Omah, while she was in her late teens. The comment cards provide glimpses into her impressions of the men, noting their dancing skills and personalities. The discovery sheds light on a chapter of her mother's life previously unknown to her children, including romantic interests and her involvement in supporting servicemen during the war.</p>

          <p>California beaches are currently experiencing a natural phenomenon as hundreds of thousands of glittering blue creatures, known as Velella velella or "by-the-wind sailors," wash ashore. These small, mini-sailboat-like creatures are typically found on the open sea but are being blown onto coastal sands due to prevailing wind patterns. While harmless to humans, the velellas are often mistaken for Portuguese man o' war due to their bright blue color, and are in fact colonies of specialized hydrozoa. These mass strandings are expected this time of year, but scientists are exploring a possible connection between these events and rising ocean temperatures.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is expected to announce a trade deal with the United Kingdom, a move that could ease investor concerns following Trump's implementation of global tariffs. The UK government confirmed that Prime Minister Keir Starmer will provide an update on trade negotiations with the US. The UK is considering lowering tariffs on US cars and cutting digital sales tax affecting US tech companies. The Trump administration's tariff policies, particularly the 145% levy on Chinese imports, have created uncertainty in global markets. The UK is eager for trade deals post-Brexit and views a deal with the US as key, while negotiations are also ongoing to lower tariffs on steel and autos.</p>

          <p>A digital likeness of the late author Agatha Christie has been created using artificial intelligence to "teach" an online writing course, raising ethical questions about the use of A.I. to resurrect the dead. While the course's creators emphasize that it uses Christie's own words and that her family has approved the project, some ethicists argue that the technology blurs the lines between fact and fiction and lacks the author's consent. The project is part of a growing trend of using A.I. to recreate historical figures, prompting debate about the ethics of such representations and their potential impact on creativity and artistic integrity.</p>
