          <p>Irish boxer Katie Taylor defeated Amanda Serrano for the third time, retaining her undisputed light-welterweight championship in a highly anticipated match at Madison Square Garden. The bout, which was more tactical than their previous encounters, concluded with a majority decision, with two judges scoring it 97-93 for Taylor and one scoring it a 95-95 draw. While Serrano had moments of success, Taylor's strategic boxing and strong finish secured the win in what was a historic all-female card at the iconic venue. Both fighters expressed immense respect for each other following the conclusion of their epic rivalry.</p>

          <p>A fugitive, Sedrick T. Stevenson, who escaped custody at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in May, has been recaptured and returned to Kentucky. The Warren County Sheriff's Office released photos showing a broadly smiling Stevenson on the return flight, escorted by multiple law enforcement officers under heightened security. Stevenson had been on the run for over a month after slipping away from a contracted agent at a ticket counter. He was being extradited to Kentucky to face multiple charges, including being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm and assault.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration arrests in several California counties. The ruling responds to a lawsuit from advocacy groups alleging that federal agents used unconstitutional tactics like racial profiling and warrantless arrests, particularly targeting Latino communities. Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong found that stops based solely on factors like race or location are unconstitutional. The decision follows recent clashes between protesters and agents during raids, and President Trump has since authorized officers to arrest anyone they believe is assaulting them.</p>

          <p>Google has announced a significant move in the AI talent war, hiring CEO Varun Mohan and other senior employees from the AI coding startup Windsurf. The deal involves Google paying $2.4 billion for licensing fees and compensation, though it is not a full acquisition of the company. Windsurf, which had previously been in acquisition talks with OpenAI, will remain an independent entity. This 'acqui-hire' highlights the intense competition among tech giants like Google, Meta, and Microsoft to secure top talent in the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>Luxury fashion house Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers after facing criticism for showcasing sandals that closely resembled traditional Kolhapuri chappals. The controversy erupted when the brand presented the footwear at Milan Men's Fashion Week without acknowledging its Indian origins, leading to a social media outcry. Following discussions with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents Kolhapuri artisans, Prada is now exploring collaboration opportunities. The Chamber also plans to patent the traditional sandal design to protect it from future copyright issues.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit filed by two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. will move forward after a federal judge in New York denied the company's request for a full dismissal. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege their voices were cloned and sold without permission after they were hired for what they were told was internal work. While the judge dismissed federal copyright claims related to their voices, claims of breach of contract, deceptive practices, and copyright infringement related to training data will proceed. The case represents a significant development for artists seeking to protect their work from misuse by AI companies.</p>

          <p>Driven by a government push and growing demand from Chinese companies operating abroad, Chinese law firms are significantly increasing their global presence. The number of overseas offices for Chinese firms has grown by 70 percent since 2018, as Chinese businesses prefer legal support from trusted domestic lawyers. This expansion is seen as crucial for supporting the global ambitions of Chinese enterprises. However, these firms face challenges in attracting non-Chinese clients amid rising geopolitical tensions, marking a pivotal moment for China's legal services industry as it navigates the international market.</p>

          <p>China's civil aviation authority has enacted an emergency ban on carrying substandard power banks onto flights, following several incidents where defective units caught fire. The new rule, effective June 28, prohibits passengers from bringing portable lithium-ion batteries that lack the mandatory China Compulsory Certification (3C) safety mark. This has led to confusion among travelers and large piles of abandoned power banks at airports. The move comes as Chinese manufacturers face increased scrutiny over product safety, with regulators expected to conclude a review of power banks by the end of July.</p>

          <p>With the patent on the popular weight-loss drug semaglutide (sold as Ozempic) expiring in China next year, dozens of Chinese companies are developing rival medications. There are currently around 60 such drugs in clinical trials, positioning China to compete in the lucrative US$150 billion global market for these treatments. The entry of cheaper generic versions is expected to significantly increase accessibility and drive down prices for patients. Analysts predict that up to 20 generic manufacturers in China will soon compete for market share, transforming the landscape for diabetes and obesity drugs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A terminal operator at the Port of Long Beach has initiated a $365-million expansion project, despite a recent slowdown in port activity linked to rising tariffs and trade uncertainty. The project will increase cargo-handling capacity by 50% and allow larger ships to dock, strengthening the U.S. supply chain. Container movement at the port has recently declined, with loaded exports down over 18% in May compared to the previous year. Despite the challenging economic climate, port officials expressed confidence in moving forward with the infrastructure investment to meet future demand.</p>

          <p>A ten-year-old song by the band Lord Huron, 'The Night We Met,' has achieved massive, unexpected success, surpassing three billion streams on Spotify. Originally the final track on their 2015 album, the song gained initial traction after being featured in the Netflix series '13 Reasons Why' in 2017. Its popularity has since snowballed on social media platforms like TikTok, where its wistful lyrics about a soured relationship have resonated with millions. The song's slow-burning success is a rare phenomenon for a track that was not a hit upon its initial release.</p>

The King's long-held views, once considered unconventional, are described as a 'call to revolution' against consumer culture and environmental destruction. The summit aimed to draw on the wisdom of Indigenous peoples and apply these principles to address global challenges.</p>
