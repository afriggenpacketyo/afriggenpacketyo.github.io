          <p>England has secured qualification for next summer's World Cup, prompting head coach Thomas Tuchel to finalize his squad plans amidst intense competition for places. This article highlights ten players, including Jude Bellingham, Cole Palmer, and Phil Foden, who have "points to prove" to Tuchel. The coach emphasizes that no player has an automatic spot, requiring consistent performance and alignment with team spirit. Key issues include Bellingham's recent exclusion, Palmer's lingering injury, and the challenge for Foden to reclaim his central role. Tuchel aims to build a cohesive and effective team, ensuring each selected player adds significant unique value for the upcoming tournament.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated the central bank is likely to cut its key interest rate twice more this year, citing a sharp slowdown in hiring as a growing risk to the U.S. economy. Speaking to the National Association of Business Economics, Powell stated that the job market's weakness is now a greater concern than inflation, which has risen due to tariffs but lacks broader pressures. This article highlights that lower rates aim to reduce borrowing costs, stimulate business expansion, and encourage hiring. Powell also defended past asset purchases while acknowledging, with hindsight, they could have stopped sooner, a critique from the Treasury. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite flight delays and air traffic controller shortages caused by the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, aviation experts affirm that air travel remains safe. This article explains that delays are a precautionary measure to maintain safety standards, not an indication of compromise. While controllers and TSA officers are working without pay, potentially leading to stress and sick-outs, pilots retain final authority on flight safety. Experts emphasize that the risk of accidents is not higher, though travelers should anticipate increased delays and cancellations. The Transportation Secretary acknowledged the system is slowed for safety, highlighting the impact of staffing issues.</p>

This article highlights that only 2% of Gen Z align with their bosses' priorities, leading to frustration for both employers and young job seekers. The author, a CEO and professor, advises Gen Z to honestly assess their desire for wealth and consider temporarily embracing "Boomer values" like delayed gratification and work-centrism for career progression, especially given the looming threat of AI replacing entry-level jobs and the need for adaptability.</p>
