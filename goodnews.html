          <p>British heavyweight boxer Fabio Wardley is preparing for a significant fight against undefeated Australian contender Justis Huni, which is scheduled to take place at the home of Wardley's beloved Ipswich Town Football Club. In addition to his boxing career, Wardley is also anticipating the birth of his first child with his partner, which is due just a week after the fight. Wardley, who started boxing at 19 after working in recruitment, views his upcoming fight as a step closer to a world-title shot, potentially as early as 2026. He is approaching fatherhood with the same dedication and determination that has driven his boxing career.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 04:26:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a new radar technology that allows aircraft to track moving targets without emitting radar signals, maintaining radio silence. The innovation, detailed in China‚Äôs Journal of Radars, involves a "space-time decoupling two-channel clutter cancellation method" that enables a silent aircraft to detect moving vehicles with high clarity. Traditional methods struggle with clutter from reflections off land, sea, or buildings, making it difficult to detect moving targets, but the new technology clears the screen of noise, enabling clear detection of vehicles. This advancement marks a significant step in bistatic airborne radar technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government, led by Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, is set to require builders to install solar panels on the "vast majority" of new build homes in England, aiming to reduce carbon emissions and lower energy bills for households. The new regulations, to be included in the Future Homes Standard, will mandate solar panels unless buildings fall under specific exemptions. The government anticipates that solar panels could save the typical household ¬£500 annually on energy bills. While the Home Builders Federation supports the move, they caution against overly burdensome paperwork that could hinder efforts to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's central bank has implemented a larger-than-expected interest rate cut, lowering the benchmark policy rate to 5.5%, the lowest level since August 2022. This marks the third consecutive rate cut since February, driven by softened inflation and slower-than-expected growth amid global uncertainty. While the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, it acknowledged concerns about potential tariffs from the United States. The decision also comes as India's inflation is largely on a downtrend, which also affords the RBI room to cut rates. Given the outsized cut in the policy rate, the RBI said that there is limited room for monetary policy to support growth, and will change its monetary policy stance to "neutral" from "accommodative."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has implemented a ban on "unfair" bonuses for senior executives at six water companies that fail to meet environmental and consumer standards, lack financial resilience, or have criminal convictions. This measure comes amid growing public concern about sewage spills and rising bills, while water companies have paid out significant rewards to executives over the past decade. The ban, backdated to April 2024, allows regulator Ofwat to claw back bonuses or take enforcement action. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized that the era of profiting from pollution is over, though concerns remain about companies potentially circumventing the ban by raising base salaries.</p>
