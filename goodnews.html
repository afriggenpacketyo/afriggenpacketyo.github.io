          <p>China has opened an international operations center for its digital yuan in Shanghai, aiming to enhance its use in cross-border payments and overseas markets. The People's Bank of China highlighted three platforms designed to accelerate the digital currency's internationalization, offering an alternative to the US dollar-dominated global financial architecture. This initiative represents a strategic move by China to reshape the global financial system and improve the efficiency of international transactions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, publicly admitted that his party and other left-wing groups previously "shied away from people's concerns around illegal immigration." He noted the rising popularity of Reform UK as a challenge for both major parties and is set to announce plans for a compulsory UK-wide digital ID scheme to tackle the issue. Starmer emphasized the need for "patriotic national renewal" and rejected "toxic" solutions from Reform UK, while also criticizing the Conservative government's "failure" on immigration over 14 years.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has preliminarily approved a $1.5 billion settlement between AI company Anthropic and authors/publishers who alleged the illegal use of nearly half a million pirated books to train chatbots. The agreement, which pays about $3,000 per book and does not apply to future works, was hailed as a "major step" by the Association of American Publishers in holding AI developers accountable. While a June ruling found AI training to be fair use, this settlement resolves claims about how materials were wrongfully acquired from pirate websites.</p>

          <p>California Senate Bill 576, inspired by an 8-month-old baby being woken by a blaring commercial, seeks to regulate the volume of advertisements on streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video. Federal law already governs traditional TV ads, but streaming platforms are currently exempt. If signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, this bill could effectively set a national standard, as companies often adopt California's regulations nationwide. The Motion Picture Association has opposed the bill, citing complexities in controlling ad volumes from various sources.</p>

          <p>Approximately 200 pieces of live coral, illegally smuggled from Indonesia and seized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at JFK Airport, have found a new home at the New York Aquarium. The coral, protected under endangered species acts, was in poor health after five days in transit and would have perished without intervention. Aquarium staff, describing the facility as a "coral hospital," successfully rehabilitated many pieces, which are now on public display. This effort serves to educate visitors about illegal wildlife trade and conservation.</p>

          <p>Residents of a California town are on edge after an aggressive neighborhood squirrel attacked several people, sending two to the emergency room for bites and scratches. The "very mean squirrel" has been observed leaping at legs, arms, and faces, causing lacerations requiring stitches in some cases. Animal experts suggest the unusual behavior likely stems from humans hand-feeding or raising the squirrel, causing it to lose its natural fear and become aggressive when not given food. Authorities advise against feeding wildlife to prevent such incidents.</p>

          <p>A former senior official, Yang Weimin, has urged China to prioritize boosting household income over the next five years to drive economic growth, as the nation increasingly relies on consumption. His comments come ahead of the Communist Party's Central Committee plenum, where the next five-year plan will be discussed, likely emphasizing income and GDP growth, industrial upgrading, and technological innovation. Yang stressed that weak consumer demand in China is fundamentally a matter of income, advocating for an increased share of household disposable income in national income.</p>
