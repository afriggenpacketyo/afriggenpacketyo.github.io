          <p>People in China are fondly remembering the life and work of Jane Goodall, the celebrated primatologist and environmentalist, following her passing. State broadcaster CCTV shared a recent interview where she expressed her lifelong dedication to forests, animals, and the planet's future. Goodall is renowned for her groundbreaking research on chimpanzees in Tanzania, which revealed their capacity for tool use, rational thought, and complex emotions. Many Chinese citizens recalled learning about her influential work in their school textbooks, praising her as a great woman who treated animals as friends and championed their protection.</p>

          <p>China has completed the assembly of the world's largest single-unit floating offshore wind power system in Beihai, a city in the country's south. The massive 16-megawatt turbine features a rotor with a diameter of 252 meters, covering an area equivalent to seven soccer fields. All key components were domestically produced, highlighting the nation's advancements in clean energy technology and its push to expand its marine economy. The system is expected to generate enough electricity to power thousands of average American homes annually once it is installed offshore and connected to the grid.</p>

          <p>Direct flights between India and China are set to resume by late October, ending a five-year suspension that began during the COVID-19 pandemic and continued due to prolonged border tensions. The Indian embassy in China announced the move as part of a gradual normalization of relations between the two nations. The decision follows Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China last month, the first in seven years, aimed at mending ties that had deteriorated after a deadly border clash in 2020. Indian carrier IndiGo has already announced it will restart flights between Kolkata and Guangzhou.</p>

          <p>England manager Thomas Tuchel is confronted with several difficult squad selection choices as key players Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka return to fitness. Following an impressive 5-0 victory over Serbia, Tuchel must now decide how to reintegrate the star players without disrupting the team's newfound momentum. The primary dilemmas involve the advanced midfield role, where Morgan Rogers has excelled in Bellingham's absence, and the right wing, where Noni Madueke has been a standout performer. With the World Cup approaching, these decisions will be crucial in shaping the team's core lineup for the tournament.</p>

          <p>Former Manchester United and England star Wayne Rooney has stated that the current generation of Premier League defenders is not as skilled as those he faced during his playing career. In a recent podcast episode, Rooney asserted that defenders from his era were of a higher caliber. While he praised Arsenal's William Saliba and Gabriel as the best current pairing for their leadership and communication, he maintained they would not rank among the top defenders he played against. Rooney also shared his personal list of the top five defenders he competed against in the Champions League, reflecting on their unique strengths.</p>

          <h2>Review: Taylor Swift's 'The Life of a Showgirl' Is a Polished but Cautious Pop Album</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-03 00:06:27 EDT</div>

          <p>Taylor Swift's new album, "The Life of a Showgirl," is described in a new review as a meticulously crafted pop record that serves as a retreat from the emotional rawness of her previous work. The article suggests the album, created with hitmakers Max Martin and Shellback, feels like an act of "damage control" after the divisive reception of "The Tortured Poets Department." While praising the album's expert hooks and potential for radio hits, the review critiques its lyrical depth, noting a lack of the vivid storytelling found in her past work. The collection of songs is seen as a safer, more polished effort that contrasts sharply with its predecessor's confessional style.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of divers has discovered a trove of Spanish treasure valued at an estimated $1 million off the coast of Florida. The find includes over 1,000 gold and silver coins that were part of the cargo of a Spanish fleet wrecked by a hurricane in 1715. The coins, believed to have been minted in Spanish colonies, were en route to Spain when the ships sank. This discovery is particularly significant for historians because many of the coins still have visible dates and mint marks, providing a tangible link to the Spanish Empire's Golden Age. The area is aptly known as the "Treasure Coast" due to frequent similar finds.</p>

          <p>A new generation of Silicon Valley defense technology startups, known as "neoprimes," is attracting billions in venture capital and challenging established industry leaders like Lockheed Martin and Boeing. Companies such as Anduril Industries are developing advanced, software-first systems in areas critical to national security, including AI, autonomy, and space technology. This investment trend is driven by the Pentagon's focus on competing with high-tech adversaries, signaling a shift away from counter-insurgency warfare. These startups are often leaner and faster than legacy contractors, aiming to close critical technology gaps for the U.S. military. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A corgi shepherd mix named Opie, who disappeared from his Northern California home during a storm in July, has been found safe more than 2,000 miles away in a Chicago suburb. The dog was turned in as a stray to local police, who scanned his microchip and were able to contact his owner. The owner, who was shocked to learn her dog was on the other side of the country, immediately flew to Illinois to be reunited with her pet. How Opie made the cross-country journey remains a mystery, but the reunion highlights the importance of microchipping pets and keeping contact information updated.</p>
