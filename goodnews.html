          <p>Actor Matthew McConaughey reveals in his new book, "Poems & Prayers," that a key to his long-lasting marriage with Camila Alves is sleeping in a queen-size bed instead of a king. He argues that the larger bed creates too much physical distance between a couple, whereas a smaller one encourages closeness and intimacy. McConaughey emphasizes the importance of prioritizing the marital relationship, noting that demonstrating a healthy partnership serves as a powerful example for their children. The actor believes this simple change has been genuinely beneficial for his 13-year marriage.</p>

          <p>In his new book, "Breakneck," analyst Dan Wang explores the divergent paths of the U.S. and China by contrasting their leadership styles, characterizing America as a "lawyerly society" and China as an "engineering state." Wang posits that while China's engineer-led focus on infrastructure and manufacturing has produced remarkable physical dynamism, it has often come at the expense of individual happiness and service-sector jobs. He argues that the U.S. could learn from China's ability to execute large-scale projects but warns against adopting its authoritarian tendencies. The book challenges both nations to learn from each other's successes and failures to avoid self-defeating competition.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that the storm will strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday but is expected to remain over open waters for several days. Its current projected track carries it north of the Caribbean and away from the U.S. mainland. However, the system could pass east of Bermuda early next week, potentially bringing some impacts to the island as it continues to intensify.</p>

          <p>A homeowner in Hermosa Beach, California, has successfully lived in a remodeled house that generates more energy than it consumes for over a decade, achieved at a cost lower than traditional construction. The "Green Idea House" utilizes 26 solar panels, an all-electric appliance system, and clever design features like strategic roof overhangs and a "thermal chimney" for natural cooling. The project demonstrates that net-zero living is achievable with off-the-shelf technology and meticulous planning, saving the family thousands annually on utility bills. However, it also highlights the need for homeowner dedication and adaptation to a rapidly changing climate.</p>

          <p>Legendary pitcher Clayton Kershaw has announced his retirement after an 18-year career, all spent with the Los Angeles Dodgers. His tenure is celebrated not just for his individual accolades, including three Cy Young awards, but for being the cornerstone of the franchise's revival from a period of turmoil and bankruptcy. When Kershaw debuted in 2008, the Dodgers had not won a postseason series in 20 years; his consistent excellence guided the team through its darkest times into an era of sustained success. His final seasons saw him as a veteran leader on a superstar-laden team, solidifying his legacy as a pivotal figure in Dodgers history.</p>

          <p>A dramatic, youth-led uprising in Nepal, fueled by anger over government corruption and unemployment, has led to the resignation of Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli and the appointment of the nation's first female prime minister, Sushila Karki. The protests, largely organized by Gen Z activists using social media to expose the lavish lifestyles of politicians' families, escalated into violent clashes after a government crackdown. Karki, a former chief justice known for her anti-corruption stance, was chosen as the interim leader, reflecting a powerful generational shift and a demand for systemic change in the Himalayan nation.</p>

          <p>In the markets of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, edible insects like caterpillars (Mbinzo) and palm weevil larvae (Mpose) are staple foods and sought-after delicacies. Rich in protein and vitamins, these insects provide an essential, organic food source in a country where conventional meat is often unaffordable for the majority of the population. While caterpillars are harvested from the wild and can be expensive, maggots are being commercially farmed by NGOs like Farms For Orphans to combat malnutrition. The practice reflects a traditional and sustainable approach to nutrition that is gaining increased attention for its potential to improve food security.</p>

          <p>Renowned television producer David E. Kelley is reaffirming his commitment to filming in California, keeping all his current and upcoming projects, including "Big Little Lies" and "The Lincoln Lawyer," based in the Los Angeles area. Despite industry trends of moving productions out of state for better tax incentives, Kelley's company chose to stay, a decision reinforced after recent wildfires devastated local communities. This move, supported by an enhanced state film tax credit program, aims to reinvest in the local industry and its workforce. The decision provides a much-needed boost to L.A.'s production activity, which has seen a decline in recent years.</p>

          <p>South African police have dismantled a major crystal methamphetamine laboratory on a farm in Volksrust, seizing drugs with an estimated street value of $20 million. During the raid, authorities arrested five individuals from a North American country and the farm's caretaker, while two other suspects believed to be from West African nations managed to escape. The discovery of industrial-scale equipment highlights South Africa's role as both a major consumer market and a key transit point for illicit drugs. This operation marks a significant blow to organized crime in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Neuroscientist Tom Bellamy's new book, "Smitten," explores the science behind "limerence," a term for intense romantic infatuation characterized by obsessive thoughts and emotional highs and lows. Bellamy explains that while limerence is a natural part of early love, it can become an unhealthy addiction if the object of affection is unavailable or sends mixed signals, driving the brain's reward system into a state of craving. He offers strategies to break the cycle, such as limiting contact, reframing positive daydreams into negative "daymares," and focusing on new personal goals to create a sense of purpose outside the obsession.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Liberal Democrats Face Challenge of Moving Beyond Stunts to Substantive Policy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 04:54:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey's playful stunts have successfully garnered media attention and contributed to electoral gains, the party now faces the challenge of defining its substantive political identity. Polling suggests that many voters, including Lib Dem supporters, view the antics as making the party look less serious and are unclear about its core policies. As the party gathers for its conference, the key question is how to translate its increased parliamentary presence into a broader appeal. The party aims to capture centrist voters alienated by the Conservatives and Reform UK by focusing on patriotism and values, but it must still develop a compelling economic message.</p>
