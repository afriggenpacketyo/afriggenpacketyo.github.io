          <p>China is escalating its efforts to build a satellite internet network to rival SpaceX's Starlink, but a shortage of rockets is creating a bottleneck. The state-backed Guo Wang project has recently increased its launch frequency, signaling national priority and monopolizing state-owned rocket capacity. This has forced other ambitious projects, like Shanghai's Qianfan, to turn to private launch companies to deploy their satellites. The competition highlights a growing divide between national strategic goals and the capabilities of the commercial space sector in China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of the state correctional facility in Norco by fall 2026. The shutdown is attributed to a significant decline in the statewide prison population and is expected to save the state $150 million annually. The facility, which currently houses nearly 2,800 inmates and employs 1,200 staff, will not release inmates early but will transfer them to other prisons. The future of the site, which was originally a luxury resort in the 1920s, is uncertain, though local officials hope for its restoration.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway among Chinese economists and policy thinkers regarding whether to include measurable consumption targets in the country's next five-year plan. Proponents, like economist Chang Xiuze, argue that setting a national "household consumption rate" as a key indicator is necessary to boost domestic demand and improve citizens' lives. They point to China's relatively low rate of 39.6% in 2023 as a cause for concern. However, other scholars are skeptical, questioning whether such a metric is operationally feasible as a policy goal, highlighting a key strategic discussion for China's economic future.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki, who was sidelined early in the season with a shoulder impingement after an underwhelming start, is showing signs of a potential comeback. The Japanese phenom has progressed in his throwing program, with the team encouraged by changes to his delivery and a new two-seam fastball he developed while injured. After being a major offseason acquisition, Sasaki's struggles and injury had made him an afterthought for the 2025 season. Now, there is renewed hope he could return by late August and provide valuable pitching depth for the team's World Series defense.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced second-quarter financial results that exceeded revenue expectations but fell short on adjusted earnings per share. The company reported adjusted earnings of 48 cents per share on revenue of $7.69 billion, with sales rising 32% year-over-year. Despite strong growth in its Client and Gaming segment, AMD's AI business revenue declined due to U.S. export restrictions on chip sales to China. For the upcoming quarter, AMD projects sales of $8.7 billion, surpassing analyst forecasts, as it prepares to launch its new Instinct MI400 AI chips. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion from a FEMA disaster mitigation program. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program and redirected its funds without congressional approval. The judge stated that the transfer could cause "irreparable harm" to communities vulnerable to natural disasters. The BRIC program provides critical funding for local infrastructure projects designed to protect against events like floods.</p>

          <p>A massive copper mining project in Afghanistan, backed by the state-owned China Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC), is reportedly making significant progress toward beginning extraction this year. The Mes Aynak Mine, which sits on one of the world's largest untapped copper deposits, was awarded to MCC in 2008 but has been stalled for 17 years due to security issues and the presence of ancient archaeological ruins. The Taliban has announced a shift to more expensive underground mining to help preserve the historical relics. This renewed activity signals a major step in developing Afghanistan's mineral wealth.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, the United States saw a decrease in crime across every measured category in 2024. The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, shows that violent crime fell by 4.5%, with murders dropping by nearly 15%. Property crimes also saw a significant 8.1% decrease, including a notable 18.6% drop in motor vehicle thefts. While experts note that overall crime rates are trending down from a post-pandemic spike, they also caution that the data only reflects crimes reported to police and that aggravated assaults remain relatively high.</p>

Allen, a six-time Pro Bowl selection and one of the franchise's all-time leading receivers, was traded to the Chicago Bears last season in a salary-cap move. His return provides a much-needed experienced target for quarterback Justin Herbert, especially following the recent retirement of Mike Williams. Allen joins a receiving corps led by Ladd McConkey and is expected to bring versatility and veteran leadership to a relatively young group.</p>
