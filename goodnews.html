          <p>Shasti Conrad was elected as the Democratic National Committee's vice chair, resolving the controversy surrounding David Hogg's departure from party leadership. Hogg stepped down due to internal divisions sparked by his plan to primary challenge vulnerable incumbent Democrats. The DNC has faced criticism over its leadership and financial stability, with reports of officials considering borrowing money. The election of Conrad aims to refocus the party on key issues after a period of internal strife and procedural debates, as members expressed a desire to move beyond the distractions and focus on more pressing matters. The election process itself involved multiple rounds of voting and highlighted underlying tensions within the DNC, with some members alleging discrimination in the initial election results.</p>

The AI hiring war has intensified, with Meta investing heavily in talent and technology for superintelligence, including a significant stake in Scale AI to attract Alexandr Wang. Meta also sought to acquire Safe Superintelligence and reached out to Perplexity AI, but deals did not materialize. Bosworth emphasized Meta's belief in AI's potential to assist humans and highlighted the company's investments in personnel and computing power. OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman claimed Meta offered substantial signing bonuses and annual compensation to attract talent, but OpenAI's top employees chose to stay.</p>

The event featured DJs, dancing, vendors, and partnerships with Black Lives Matter, transforming the pier into a lively festival. Attendees enjoyed music spanning generations, from Aaliyah to YG, and participated in activities like rhythmic breathing exercises and sound baths. The celebration honored the history of the Ebony Beach Club, which was founded in 1957 but barred from opening due to racial discrimination, and provided a space for Black people to occupy the pier and enjoy the holiday.

          <p>Tesla is launching its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, offering a select group of people the chance to ride in Model Y Robotaxis. The pilot program will operate within a geofenced area, with a limited number of cars and a "Tesla Safety Monitor" in the front passenger seat. The robotaxis can be hailed via a Robotaxi App, with service available from 6 a.m. to midnight. This launch follows scrutiny from government officials and safety advocacy groups regarding autonomous vehicle safety, and some Texas lawmakers have requested a delay until new regulations take effect. The success of this robotaxi service could significantly boost Tesla's market value, potentially reaching a $2 trillion market cap by the end of 2026.</p>

          <p>A federal appellate court has ruled that a Louisiana law mandating the posting of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms is unconstitutional. The court's decision supports civil liberties groups' argument that the law violates the separation of church and state and would isolate non-Christian students. While the plaintiffs believe the ruling applies to all school districts in Louisiana, the state's Attorney General disagrees and intends to appeal. The case is expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court, potentially testing the court's stance on religion and government, referencing previous Supreme Court cases regarding similar laws.</p>

          <p>Kroger plans to close 60 of its supermarkets across the U.S. over the next 18 months, representing approximately 5% of its Kroger-branded stores. The company did not specify which locations will be affected but stated that all employees at the closing stores will be offered roles at other Kroger locations. The decision to close stores is expected to provide a modest financial benefit, with the resulting savings being invested in customer experience initiatives. The announcement was made alongside Kroger's first-quarter earnings report, which showed a slight decrease in sales compared to the same period last year. (not investment advice)</p>
