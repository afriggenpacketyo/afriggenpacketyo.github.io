          <p>Louise Perry argues that Elon Musk is a visionary who, despite his volatility and recklessness, is driven by a desire to save humanity from future threats and its own complacency. Perry acknowledges Musk's recent political setbacks but emphasizes the success of his space program, SpaceX, which launched seven times more tonnage into space than the rest of the world combined in the first half of 2024. Musk's vision extends beyond politics, focusing on space exploration and the establishment of a multi-planet civilization to ensure humanity's survival. The article draws parallels between Musk and Cecil Rhodes, another businessman, politician, and visionary who bent reality around his will.</p>

          <p>German customs reported a significant increase in processed items in 2024, with e-commerce driving a surge in deliveries primarily from China. Customs handled 235 million online deliveries, with 90% originating from China, leading to concerns about cheap goods and counterfeit products. Discussions are underway, including at the European level, to potentially abolish the existing tariff limit of ‚Ç¨150 on goods from websites like Temu. Additionally, customs seized 161 weapons of war and saw a rise in marijuana confiscations, though there is no confirmed link between the latter and Germany's partial legalization of the drug.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has ordered Lindsey Hill, the woman who accused former Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer of sexual assault, to pay more than $300,000 for violating the terms of a settlement agreement. Bauer and Hill had settled dueling lawsuits two years ago, with neither party paying any money to the other. However, Hill later claimed on social media that Bauer "handed back an insurance sum to me that was meant for him in order for me to drop my countersuit," leading Bauer to sue her for violating the settlement agreement. Hill did not contest or respond to the suit, resulting in a default victory for Bauer.</p>

          <p>Millennials are entering midlife with different experiences and expectations than previous generations, often facing financial instability and a lack of traditional milestones. The traditional midlife crisis stereotype of abandoning family for a sports car doesn't resonate with millennials, who are more focused on self-expression, mental health, and personal growth. Many are seeking opportunities for fitness journeys, career changes, and personal awakenings, rather than succumbing to despair. The article explores how economic factors, societal pressures, and changing lifestyles are shaping the millennial midlife experience, highlighting the importance of adaptability and self-awareness.</p>

          <p>In his advice column, James Parker responds to a reader feeling disconnected and disillusioned, questioning how to live in a world perceived as an evil farce. Parker argues that the reader is, in fact, punk rock and encourages using this world-withering vision as a stimulant rather than a philosophical end point. He suggests using the disgust to sharpen senses, refine language, and find beauty in the mundane. Parker recommends the band Godflesh as a musical outlet for these sentiments, emphasizing the importance of finding meaning and connection despite the world's absurdities.</p>
