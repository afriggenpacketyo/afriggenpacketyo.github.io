          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to temporarily cease indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in seven California counties, citing concerns of unconstitutional racial profiling. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit by advocacy groups that presented a "mountain of evidence" showing federal agents were targeting people based on their skin color and ethnicity. The order specifically bars agents from using factors like race, accent, or presence at day laborer sites as the sole basis for a stop.</p>

          <p>After facing a significant cultural backlash for showcasing sandals that closely resembled traditional Indian Kolhapuri chappals, luxury brand Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers. The company held a meeting with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents the artisans, to discuss future collaborations. This move follows criticism from Indian fashion experts and politicians, who called on the brand to acknowledge the design's cultural roots, prompting a wider discussion about respectful collaboration in global fashion.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, halting certain immigration enforcement tactics in several Southern California counties. The ruling prohibits federal agents from conducting stops based solely on factors such as a person's apparent race, their use of Spanish, or their presence at specific locations like car washes or day laborer sites. The judge found a "mountain of evidence" supporting claims by the ACLU and immigrant rights groups that agents were engaging in unconstitutional racial profiling and warrantless arrests.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has ruled that a lawsuit from two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege the company deceptively used their voices to create AI clones for its text-to-speech platform. While the judge dismissed federal copyright claims related to the voices themselves, claims of breach of contract, deceptive business practices, and improper use of their recordings as training data will proceed, marking a notable development in artists' rights against AI companies.</p>

The number of overseas offices for Chinese law firms has seen a substantial increase, reflecting a strategic move to support the nation's global economic footprint, though winning non-Chinese clients remains a challenge amid geopolitical tensions.</p>
