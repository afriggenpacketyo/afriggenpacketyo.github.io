          <h2>Hollywood Productions Increasingly Drawn to the UK Due to Tax Incentives and Lower Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 22:18:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hollywood studios are increasingly shifting film productions to the UK, attracted by generous tax incentives, lower labor costs, and centralized national funding for film. Last year, 65% of UK production spending came from major US film studios and streaming giants, amounting to ¬£1.37 billion. The UK's Film Tax Relief offers a 25% tax rebate, making it cheaper to produce films like Jurassic World: Dominion, which saved Universal ¬£89.1 million. While President Trump has suggested tariffs on movies made abroad, a federal tax incentive in the US could be a possible solution to keep productions stateside.</p>

          <p>Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene announced that she will not be running in the upcoming Georgia Senate race against Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff, citing her unwillingness to fight for a Republican team that she believes refuses to win. Greene's decision came shortly after Georgia Governor Brian Kemp also decided against running for the Senate seat, leaving the primary field largely open. Republicans are aiming to unseat Ossoff to expand their majority in the Senate, but recent polling data showed Greene trailing significantly behind Ossoff, while Kemp had a closer hypothetical matchup.</p>

          <p>A new BBC drama, The Bombing of Pan Am 103, dramatizes the 1988 Lockerbie bombing and the subsequent Scots-US investigation, revealing how flaws in the response to victims' families influenced protocols after 9/11. Kara Weipz, whose brother died in the bombing, noted that families learned of their loved ones' deaths through news reports, highlighting the need for improved notification systems. Screenwriter Gillian Roger Park emphasized the families' role in advocating for reforms, which led to strengthened travel warning systems and tighter baggage screening. The drama also portrays the compassion of Lockerbie residents who volunteered to help traumatized families, showcasing acts of connective humanity amidst the tragedy.</p>

          <p>Taiga Nishino, a 15-year-old Japanese figure skating prodigy, is gaining recognition for mastering two quadruple jumps, drawing comparisons to junior champion Rio Nakata. Nishino landed a quad toe loop for the first time in competition and has previously executed a quad salchow. Despite recent rapid growth, which required adjustments to his skating equipment, Nishino's coach, Misao Sato, describes him as honest and earnest, consistently delivering results. Nishino aims to achieve strong results at the World Junior Championships and Junior Grand Prix Final next season, marking him as a rising star in the sport.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift has been subpoenaed in the ongoing legal dispute between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni over allegations surrounding their 2024 film "It Ends with Us." Swift's spokesperson stated that the subpoena is a publicity stunt to draw attention to the case, emphasizing Swift's limited involvement with the film, which only included permitting the use of her song "My Tears Ricochet." Lively sued Baldoni, alleging sexual harassment on set, while Baldoni countersued Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, for defamation, seeking $400 million. A federal judge is likely to combine both lawsuits into one trial scheduled for March 2026.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 but stranded in Earth orbit due to a rocket malfunction, is expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere on Friday or Saturday. The spacecraft, originally intended for Venus, weighs roughly 1,050 pounds and is protected by a heat shield, increasing the likelihood that parts of it will survive re-entry. While the exact landing location remains unknown, its orbit places it between 52 degrees north and south latitude. Experts say the risk of injuries on the ground is low, and any recovered pieces legally belong to Russia.</p>

The proposed amendment, championed by Baroness Beeban Kidron, aims to facilitate licensing agreements between creators and companies.

The quarantine covers the entire California coastline, and there are no known antidotes for these toxins. Commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt due to frequent testing.
