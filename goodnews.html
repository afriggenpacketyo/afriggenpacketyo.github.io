          <p>Asia-Pacific stock markets are projected to open higher, with particular attention on Japan after Sanae Takaichi's election as the Liberal Democratic Party leader. Her pro-stimulus stance suggests continued accommodative monetary policy from the Bank of Japan, potentially including a rate hike by early 2026. This policy shift is expected to reorient the economy towards investment and demand through public-private partnerships, driving market optimism. The Nikkei 225 index futures are already indicating a significant rise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Veteran journalist Lesley Stahl shared her experience interviewing the "band" Spinal Tap for a segment on "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues," the sequel to the iconic mockumentary. Stahl found herself immersed in the characters played by Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer, who improvised their responses in full rockstar persona. Director Rob Reiner explained that both films were made with only an outline, relying entirely on the actors' spontaneous comedic talent. The interview highlighted the unique, unscripted nature of the mockumentary genre that the original film pioneered.</p>

          <p>China is heavily investing in AI and robotics, aiming to break US dominance in high-end chip production, with Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang acknowledging their rapid progress. Chinese tech firms like Alibaba and Huawei have unveiled powerful new chips, with Huawei making its designs publicly available to reduce reliance on US products. While some experts caution about the lack of verifiable data, the competition is undeniable, fueled by intense domestic rivalry and a vast talent pool. Despite breakthroughs, China still relies on the US for the most powerful chips and developed supply chains, but is rapidly closing the gap. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to significantly raise H-1B visa fees to $100,000 is prompting India to actively encourage skilled professionals to return home. Policymakers in Delhi view this as an opportune moment to reverse the brain drain and attract talent in technology and other innovative industries. Anecdotal evidence suggests a growing interest among Indians settled in the US to relocate, driven by an increasingly hostile immigration environment. However, experts warn that a large-scale reverse migration will require concerted government effort and clear incentives, which are currently lacking. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced significant reforms to the housing market, aiming to reduce costs, cut delays, and halve failed property sales. Housing Secretary Steve Reed stated the changes would save first-time buyers an average of £710 and shorten transaction times by up to four weeks. Key proposals include legally requiring sellers and agents to provide upfront information about property condition and leasehold costs, and potentially introducing binding contracts to prevent late withdrawals. The reforms also seek to boost professional standards across the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mohamed Salah's reduced defensive work is becoming a tactical issue for Liverpool, particularly against stronger teams, leading to defensive overloads on the right flank. While Salah's freedom to stay high up the pitch enhances his attacking prowess, the players behind him are not providing adequate cover. This imbalance was evident in a recent loss to Chelsea, where defensive weaknesses were exploited. While Salah's goal-scoring form is expected to improve, the team's overall lack of control in games this season is a concern. The team needs to regain patience and composure to improve their balance.</p>

          <p>Historian Martin Powers discusses how examining Chinese society and government through visual art offers unique insights into political ideas and social history. Unlike texts, public images reveal widely understood concepts, such as the Han dynasty prime minister's adherence to national policy over local disputes, depicted across various media for centuries. Powers argues that art "participates" in political debate by illustrating intergroup relations and power dynamics. He highlights how aristocratic art, both East and West, often portrays dominant figures exercising arbitrary privilege, a concept Montesquieu termed "honour."</p>

          <p>Despite a looming government shutdown, the stock market remains resilient, driven by speculative buying and a belief in a "Trump put" that prevents major downturns. This complacency fuels parabolic moves in tech and growth stocks, with a new generation of buyers chasing high-risk, high-reward opportunities. The market's strength is partly attributed to a rapid rebound after initial tariff concerns, bolstered by the president's intervention. While many professionals view this as unsustainable, the article suggests taking profits, even in a "year of magical investing," to mitigate potential future losses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As China prepares its 15th five-year plan, there's a growing imperative for Beijing to shift its economic strategy from being the world's largest exporter to becoming the largest importer within the next 5-10 years. This pivot aims to accelerate the transition to a consumption-driven economy and address structural imbalances. Such a move would have profound geopolitical and economic implications, signifying a maturation of China's economic model. This strategic reorientation reflects a long-term vision for "high-quality development" and reduced reliance on Western markets. (not investment advice)</p>
