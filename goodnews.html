          <p>Manchester United has reportedly made a significant bid for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko, with the total financial package potentially reaching €85 million (approximately £73.8 million). The offer includes a guaranteed payment of €75 million, signaling the club's serious intent to acquire the 22-year-old Slovenian forward. United is said to believe this is a fair valuation and that the player is interested in a move to Old Trafford. The club faces competition from Newcastle, which has also submitted a substantial bid, as negotiations with the German club continue for the highly sought-after player.</p>

          <p>Photographs circulating online appear to show a new Chinese sixth-generation stealth aircraft, sparking analysis and speculation among military experts. The images reveal a sleek, tailless design with a lambda-wing layout, suggesting it could be a high-speed drone or a collaborative combat aircraft rather than a piloted fighter. Analysts note its slim fuselage and smaller size compared to other known prototypes, like the J-36, which may indicate an optimization for stealth over maneuverability. This development suggests China may be advancing multiple next-generation combat aircraft programs simultaneously, continuing its rapid military modernization efforts.</p>

          <p>Palantir's stock jumped over 7% after the software analytics company reported its first-ever quarter with over $1 billion in revenue, significantly beating analyst expectations. The strong performance was fueled by surging demand for its artificial intelligence platforms and increased government contracts focused on efficiency. CEO Alex Karp described the results as a "once in a generation, truly anomalous quarter," highlighting a 68% year-over-year growth in U.S. revenues. The company also raised its full-year revenue guidance, now expecting between $4.142 billion and $4.150 billion, reflecting strong confidence in its continued growth trajectory.

          <p>Pfizer has raised its full-year adjusted profit outlook, citing effective cost-cutting measures and strong quarterly performance, which caused its shares to rise. The pharmaceutical giant's second-quarter earnings and revenue surpassed Wall Street estimates, driven by robust sales of its Covid products and other key drugs. The company now projects a full-year adjusted profit between $2.90 and $3.10 per share, up from its previous forecast. This optimistic guidance comes as Pfizer navigates President Trump's calls for lower drug prices and potential tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals, indicating confidence in its ability to manage these external pressures.

          <p>Contrary to expectations, Gen Z employees are the least likely generation to favor fully remote work, according to a new Gallup report. Only 23% of Gen Z workers prefer an exclusively remote setup, compared to 35% of millennials, Gen X, and baby boomers. The study suggests younger employees feel their career development and mentorship opportunities are compromised in a fully remote environment. Instead, a significant 71% of Gen Z expressed a preference for a hybrid model, indicating a strong desire for in-person connection, collaboration, and a clearer understanding of their role within their organizations.</p>

          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and lines of credit (HELOCs) offer a more affordable borrowing option compared to high-interest personal loans or credit cards. As of early August 2025, average interest rates for 10-year home equity loans are around 8.41%, while the average HELOC rate is approximately 8.26%. These rates are considerably lower than many alternatives and may decrease further if the Federal Reserve implements anticipated rate cuts. While these products provide access to large sums of money at a lower cost and offer potential tax benefits, homeowners must remember their property serves as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold remains a popular investment, often sought as a safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty and as a hedge against inflation. As of August 4, 2025, the price of gold stood at $3,376.47 per ounce, though this value is subject to constant fluctuation. The price is influenced by a variety of factors, including global supply and demand, prevailing economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability. Additionally, movements in the U.S. dollar and the policies of central banks, which hold significant gold reserves, play a crucial role in determining the precious metal's market value.

          <p>Amid shifting global geopolitics, there is renewed diplomatic interest in reviving the trilateral forum of Russia, India, and China (RIC). For Moscow, isolated by the West, the grouping offers a platform to demonstrate non-Western solidarity and counter its growing economic dependence on Beijing. China sees the forum as a way to stabilize its continental flank, particularly its tense relationship with India, as it focuses on maritime priorities. While India has remained cautious, the potential revival of RIC is viewed by some as a pragmatic move to ensure regional stability and advance shared interests in an increasingly multipolar world.</p>

          <p>Redwood Materials, a startup founded by Tesla co-founder JB Straubel, is giving old electric vehicle batteries a second life by repurposing them for large-scale energy storage. As the AI boom drives a massive increase in energy demand, Redwood is partnering with companies like Crusoe to build microgrids that can power data centers with 24/7 renewable energy. Their first project uses repurposed batteries to store solar-generated power, offering a cost-effective and rapidly deployable solution. This innovative approach not only addresses the energy needs of the AI era but also provides a sustainable end-of-life solution for EV batteries that still retain usable capacity.</p>

          <p>Following the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, global health leaders are being called upon to support Bangladesh's public health system to preserve decades of remarkable progress. The country has seen significant improvements in life expectancy and reductions in mortality rates, achieved through innovative community-based care and international cooperation. As an interim government takes over, there are concerns that this political transition could jeopardize hard-won gains. Experts are urging organizations like the WHO and World Bank to provide strategic assistance, ensuring that essential health services and crucial initiatives, such as improving primary care, continue without interruption during this critical period.</p>

          <p>The U.S. trade deficit narrowed significantly in June to its lowest level since September 2023, falling 16% to $60.2 billion. The decrease was driven by a sharp drop in consumer goods imports, reflecting the impact of President Donald Trump's widespread tariffs on global commerce. While exports also saw a slight decline, the overall reduction in the trade gap provided a substantial boost to the U.S. gross domestic product in the second quarter. This economic data comes as the Trump administration prepares to implement another round of tariff hikes, which are expected to raise the average U.S. tariff rate to its highest point since 1934.

In an interview, Trump stated that Bessent expressed a desire to remain in his current role. The selection process is gaining attention following the recent resignation of Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, which gives Trump another opportunity to appoint a member to the board. Among those thought to be in the running are former Governor Kevin Warsh and National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett, both of whom have advocated for lower interest rates.</p>

The Seattle-Reykjavik route will be a seasonal service operated by a 737 Max 8. This expansion follows the airline's acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines and signals a strategic push into long-haul international markets, which have shown more resilient demand than the domestic U.S. market.
