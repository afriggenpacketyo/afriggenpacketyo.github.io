          <p>Alphabet, Google's parent company, has become the fourth U.S. company to achieve a $3 trillion market capitalization, joining Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. The company's stock value surged following a more lenient than expected antitrust ruling from Judge Amit Mehta, which did not force the divestment of its Chrome browser as the Department of Justice had sought. This milestone arrives as CEO Sundar Pichai navigates increased competition from AI and regulatory scrutiny in both the U.S. and Europe, with the company's future AI prospects resting heavily on its Gemini models.

The agreement's commercial terms have been settled, and the final details will be discussed by President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. This development comes as TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, faces a deadline to divest its U.S. business or be banned, a situation stemming from a law passed by Congress over national security concerns. The framework suggests a potential shift to U.S.-controlled ownership for the popular social media platform.</p>

          <p>Despite geopolitical tensions and other challenges, there is a growing interest among younger Europeans in pursuing professional opportunities in China. Many in this demographic are drawn to the country's rapid growth in technology and infrastructure, particularly in cities like Shenzhen and Shanghai. This perspective contrasts with that of older generations, with younger people viewing China as a dynamic environment for career development and a place to be part of significant, fast-paced change. The appeal persists even with hurdles like visa issues and restricted internet access, highlighting a generational divide in global outlook.</p>

          <p>The England women's rugby team, known as the Red Roses, has set a new record for the longest winning streak in international rugby history, for both men's and women's teams. Their 40-8 victory over Scotland in the World Cup quarter-final marked their 31st consecutive win. This new streak began after their narrow defeat to New Zealand in the 2022 World Cup final, which had ended a previous record run of 30 wins. The team has not lost to any nation other than New Zealand since 2018 and aims to extend the streak to 33 wins by capturing the World Cup title.</p>

          <p>With a potential Federal Reserve rate cut on the horizon, mortgage experts are offering guidance to prospective homebuyers on how to navigate the changing market. Key recommendations include getting a fresh pre-approval to reflect increased buying power, comparing offers from multiple lenders, and strategically locking in a favorable rate quickly. Conversely, experts caution against assuming rates will continue to fall, sticking with a current lender without shopping around, or overextending one's budget based on new borrowing capacity. Disciplined and prompt action is advised to capitalize on the improved conditions without taking on undue financial risk. (not investment advice)</p>

This move comes as the company's shares have been weighed down by slumping sales and concerns over Musk's political activities.

          <p>A recent survey by Natixis Investment Managers found that 21% of Americans believe it will take a "miracle" for them to retire securely, citing concerns about insufficient savings, inflation, and potential cuts to government benefits.

Creating and consistently reviewing a comprehensive financial plan helps individuals clarify goals, make informed decisions about savings and investments, and avoid emotional, short-term reactions to market news.

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested a significant change to corporate financial reporting standards, proposing that U.S. companies should report their earnings every six months instead of quarterly. In a post on his social media platform, Trump argued that this shift would save money and allow corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term results. This idea has been debated in the financial community for years, with proponents believing it would reduce market volatility and corporate short-sightedness. The change would require approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which was empowered to mandate quarterly reports by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

          <p>While a majority of job seekers now use AI tools in their application process, career experts caution against placing "blind faith" in them. Over-reliance on AI can lead to fabricated information, as these tools may exaggerate experience to match a job description, and can produce generic, uniform applications that fail to stand out. Recruiters report seeing multiple applications with identical structures and even accidental inclusions of AI prompts. To avoid these pitfalls, experts recommend that candidates write their own initial drafts and use AI only for polishing language, ensuring they can personally speak to every detail on their resume.</p>

These include basic supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability.

          <p>Manchester City's decisive 3-0 victory over Manchester United was a result of superior tactical execution, particularly in exploiting United's defensive system. City manager Pep Guardiola focused attacks down the left flank, using clever positioning to create a midfield overload and disrupt United's man-to-man pressing scheme. By "pinning" United's wing-back wide, City's attackers found space centrally, leading to communication breakdowns and defensive errors from their rivals. The analysis highlights how United's rigid philosophy was systematically unpicked by City's adaptable and fluid tactical approach, raising questions about manager Ruben Amorim's system.</p>
