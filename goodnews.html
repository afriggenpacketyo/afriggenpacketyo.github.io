          <p>The Catholic Church has officially canonized Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at the age of 15, making him the first millennial to be declared a saint. Known as "God's influencer," Acutis was recognized for his devout faith and his use of the internet to document miracles and spread Catholic teachings. The canonization ceremony, led by Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican, drew tens of thousands of pilgrims and highlights the church's effort to connect with younger generations by recognizing a modern figure who combined technology with deep religious devotion.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured a dominant victory for Red Bull at the Italian Grand Prix, but the race was marked by a contentious decision within the McLaren team. McLaren instructed Oscar Piastri to allow his teammate Lando Norris to pass for second place, despite Norris falling behind Piastri due to a slow pit stop caused by a wheel gun fault. The team justified the order by referencing a past race where Norris had similarly aided Piastri, but the decision has sparked debate about fairness in the context of a tight championship battle, ultimately narrowing Piastri's lead over Norris.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health experts are observing a rise in knee pain among adults in their 30s and 40s, a trend attributed primarily to higher rates of obesity and increased participation in high-intensity sports during youth. A recent study found that early structural damage in the knee is common by age 30, often without symptoms, with higher body mass index (BMI) being a key factor. Orthopedic surgeons recommend maintaining a healthy weight, strengthening surrounding leg muscles, and using proper footwear as key preventative measures to avoid long-term issues like osteoarthritis and the potential need for future knee replacement surgery.</p>

          <p>After years of sporadic sightings, police in the Czech Republic have arrested a 51-year-old man who was repeatedly seen driving a red, Ferrari-liveried racing car on a public motorway. The driver, who had evaded identification since 2019 by wearing a full racing helmet, was tracked to his home after new video of the car surfaced. The vehicle, identified as a Dallara GP2 racing car rather than an actual F1 car, is not street legal. The owner now faces fines for operating a vehicle on the motorway without essential features like headlights, indicators, or number plates.</p>

          <p>Annalena Baerbock, Germany's former foreign minister from the Green Party, has commenced her one-year term as the President of the United Nations General Assembly. Her election was conducted via a secret ballot requested by Russia, a move seen as a response to her outspoken criticism of the war in Ukraine. Baerbock's nomination by the previous German government was controversial, with some critics arguing a career diplomat was more suitable for the role. In her new position, she will chair UN meetings and play a key role in preparing for next year's election of a new UN Secretary-General.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her new memoir, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett details the difficult personal decision to accept her nomination to the high court in 2020. She describes the intense public scrutiny and loss of privacy she and her family experienced during a previous consideration, including being followed by camera crews. Barrett reveals that she and her husband agreed to the nomination only on the condition that they would "burn the boats," a commitment to forge ahead without second-guessing their choice to leave their life in South Bend, Indiana, for the demands of public service in Washington, D.C.</p>

          <p>Comedian Nate Bargatze, known for his family-friendly and observational humor, has become the highest-grossing stand-up comic in the U.S., selling out arenas nationwide. Despite his success, he remains grounded in his Nashville roots, having moved back from New York to provide a more normal upbringing for his daughter. Bargatze, who will host the upcoming Emmy Awards, attributes his clean-comedy style to a sense of mission and a desire to maintain the trust of his broad audience.

This voyage marks the longest open-water trip in such a vessel, aiming to promote fungal materials, or AquaFung, as a biodegradable alternative to plastics used in marine equipment. The project, supported by the arts organization Fulcrum Arts, highlights a nascent field where artists and scientists are exploring innovative, environmentally friendly materials derived from fungi for applications ranging from boats to surfboards.</p>

          <p>An economic analysis suggests that while the recent elimination of the "de minimis" tariff exemption by the Trump administration will affect some small businesses, widespread panic may be misdirected. The article posits that the majority of small businesses are service-based and won't be directly impacted by the change in import duties. The author argues that the larger economic picture, including consumer income and wealth, is more critical for absorbing price increases, and that as long as the labor market remains strong, the economy can likely withstand the effects of the tariffs.

          <p>The US Eagles have been eliminated from the Rugby World Cup despite a decisive 60-0 victory over Samoa, as Australia's narrower loss to England secured the final quarter-final spot on points differential. While disappointed, the team's performance throughout the tournament has stoked optimism for the future of American women's rugby. The emergence of young, powerful stars like 22-year-old flanker Freda Tafuna, who scored six tries in the tournament, points to a growing talent pipeline from the US college system. The team's spirit and the rise of this new generation suggest a promising outlook for the next World Cup cycle.</p>

          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleep habits, or "sleep hygiene," in infancy is one of the most crucial things parents can do to support their child's long-term health and success. These habits are foundational for a baby's physical, mental, and cognitive development, and they influence a child's ability to learn and regulate emotions later in life. Dr. Golshevsky advises creating a soothing environment that mimics the womb, involving both parents in settling routines, and maintaining flexibility rather than adhering to rigid schedules. This approach helps teach babies to self-soothe, a skill that benefits them throughout their lives.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece makes the case that right-wing survivalists, or "preppers," should embrace solar power as the ideal energy source for off-grid self-sufficiency. The author contrasts the complexity and failure points of fossil fuel systems—requiring drilling, refining, and constant refueling—with the simplicity and resilience of solar panels and batteries. Solar energy is framed not as an environmental choice but as a practical one for hyper-individualists, providing a reliable, long-term power source independent of complex supply chains. This perspective suggests a potential, if unexpected, common ground between typically opposed political ideologies on the issue of renewable energy.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick earned his first win as the head coach of the University of North Carolina with a 20-3 victory over Charlotte. Following the game, Belichick addressed recent reports by confirming that he has banned scouts from the New England Patriots, his former team, from attending UNC practices. He stated bluntly that since he feels unwelcome at the Patriots' facility, their personnel are not welcome at his, signaling a clear deterioration in the relationship since his departure from the NFL team. The win provided a needed boost for the Tar Heels after a difficult debut loss earlier in the week.</p>

          <p>The second-hand fashion app Vinted originated from a simple problem: co-founder Milda Mitkutė had too many clothes when moving to a smaller apartment in 2008. After discussing the idea of an online marketplace with a friend, they quickly launched a basic website in Lithuania that allowed users to buy and sell pre-owned clothing. The concept gained traction through word of mouth and expanded internationally, eventually becoming Lithuania's first tech "unicorn." Despite nearly failing in 2016 after introducing a commission fee, the company recovered and became profitable by focusing on user growth and television advertising.</p>
