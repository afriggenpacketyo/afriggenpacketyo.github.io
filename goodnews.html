          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will continue approving updated COVID-19 vaccines for high-risk groups like seniors and those with underlying conditions, but will require vaccine makers to conduct randomized, placebo-controlled trials before approving them for wider use. This decision, outlined by Dr. Vinay Prasad and FDA Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary, means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall. The FDA is urging vaccine makers to run new randomized studies in adults between the ages of 50 and 64, where they believe the balance of benefits and risks is uncertain. The agency aims to strike a balance between rapid access for vulnerable populations and evidence-based approval for average-risk individuals.</p>

          <p>NFL owners are set to discuss a proposal to ban the Philadelphia Eagles' signature 'Tush Push' play, with the Packers citing "player safety" and "pace of play" as reasons for the potential ban. While some coaches have expressed safety concerns, NFL executive Jeff Miller has stated that the data does not support the claim that the play is inherently unsafe. The 'Tush Push' involves a quarterback sneak with additional pushing assistance from behind, and some critics argue that it doesn't belong in football, calling it a "cheapo play."</p>

          <p>While some states like South Carolina are beginning to cover GLP-1 drugs for obesity treatment through Medicaid, access remains limited for millions of patients due to high costs and stringent prerequisites. The Trump administration will not finalize a rule proposed by the Biden administration that would have allowed an estimated 7.4 million people covered by Medicare and Medicaid to access GLP-1s for weight loss. Even in states that offer coverage, beneficiaries must often meet strict requirements, such as documented attempts at weight loss through diet and exercise.

Flights through Newark will be capped at 28 departures and 28 arrivals per hour until June 15, and every weekend from September through December, while runway construction is ongoing, according to the new plan, which the F.A.A. released after meeting with representatives of major airlines. The hourly limits will restrict operations every day, typically during the busy morning and afternoon hours, according to a New York Times analysis of Newark flight schedules provided by Cirium, an aviation data firm.</p>
