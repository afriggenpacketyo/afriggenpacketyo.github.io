          <p>The first group of White South Africans, known as Afrikaners, who were granted refugee status by the U.S., departed from Johannesburg en route to Washington, D.C., and Texas. President Trump issued an executive order to resettle Afrikaners, claiming they faced government-sponsored race-based discrimination due to land expropriation laws. The South African government has denied any such discrimination. This article highlights the contrast between this initiative and the Trump administration's ban on most other refugees, noting the unusually fast processing of Afrikaner refugee applications. Relations between South Africa and the U.S. have deteriorated over various policy issues.</p>
