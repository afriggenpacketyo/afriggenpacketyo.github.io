          <p>Stocks in the clean energy sector saw significant gains after a proposed tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the Senate's version of a major spending bill. The tax, which targeted projects using components from foreign entities like China, would have imposed a multi-billion dollar burden on the industry. While the removal provided immediate relief, boosting shares for companies like NextEra Energy and Array Technologies, industry associations still view the overall legislation as detrimental to renewable energy. They warn that the bill's phase-out of key tax credits undermines America's progress in clean energy manufacturing and leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The TSB brand may vanish from UK high streets following its acquisition by rival bank Santander for ¬£2.65 billion, a deal pending shareholder approval from TSB's current Spanish owner, Sabadell. Santander plans to fully integrate TSB into its UK operations, a move that would create the nation's third-largest bank by personal current accounts. While promising business as usual for now, Santander has not ruled out future branch closures and has indicated that job cuts are likely due to role duplication. The takeover marks another chapter for TSB, which has a history of ownership changes and a major IT failure in 2018. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Design software giant Figma has officially filed for an initial public offering, planning to trade on the NYSE under the ticker "FIG."

The company has demonstrated strong growth, with a 46% revenue increase in the first quarter and a private valuation of $12.5 billion last year.

          <p>The new film "40 Acres" is a post-apocalyptic thriller starring Danielle Deadwyler as a military veteran fiercely protecting her family on an isolated farmstead in a world ravaged by pandemic and famine. The review praises Deadwyler's performance, which grounds the character's brutal survivalist mentality in deep-seated generational trauma and fear. While the film is noted for its heavy-handed symbolism and sometimes confusing allusions, it succeeds as a resolute portrait of a family's desperate self-reliance. The movie is described as a grim but gripping story, highlighted by a tense score and strong supporting performances.</p>

          <p>Internet infrastructure company Cloudflare announced it will now block AI crawlers from scraping website data by default, a significant move to protect content creators. Website owners using Cloudflare's services will now have to opt-in to allow AI bots from companies like OpenAI and Google to access their data for training large language models. This change aims to shift power back to publishers, who have seen their content used to train AI systems without permission or compensation, often losing traffic as a result. The company is also introducing a "pay per crawl" model, allowing publishers to charge AI firms for access.</p>

          <p>French tennis player Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard made Wimbledon history by hitting the fastest serve ever recorded at the tournament, a 153 mph thunderbolt. The 21-year-old's record-breaking serve surpassed the previous best of 148 mph set by Taylor Dent. Despite this incredible feat and hitting 37 aces, Mpetshi Perricard ultimately lost a dramatic five-set match to the fifth seed, American Taylor Fritz. The match showcased the young Frenchman's raw power, but Fritz's consistency prevailed. Afterward, Mpetshi Perricard suggested that serves could potentially reach speeds of 167 mph in the future.</p>

The company has hired researchers from competitors like OpenAI and Google, with Bank of America estimating the effort could add $1 billion in annual expenses. Investors seem willing to overlook the high cost due to the immense potential of AI to enhance user engagement, improve ad targeting, and create new revenue streams. While Meta's current AI model, Llama, lags behind competitors, the new talent is expected to accelerate progress and help monetize these significant investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With rising home values, many homeowners have significant tappable equity, and this article outlines five smart ways to use a $100,000 loan. One primary strategy is to consolidate high-interest debt, such as credit card balances, into a lower-rate home equity loan or HELOC. Other effective uses include funding strategic home renovations that boost resale value, investing in a diversified portfolio, or providing capital to start or expand a small business. Finally, financing education or professional development can yield long-term returns by increasing earning potential, making it a worthwhile investment of home equity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, blocking the Department of Health and Human Services from proceeding with mass layoffs and a major restructuring plan. The judge found "no rational basis" for the plan, which was challenged by 19 Democratic attorneys general who warned of "devastating consequences" to public health services. The plan, championed by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., involved laying off some 10,000 employees and merging several agencies. This ruling temporarily halts the administration's efforts to overhaul the nation's health agencies, protecting critical services from interruption while the legal battle continues.</p>
