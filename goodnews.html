          <p>Eric Schmidt and Selina Xu highlight China's rapid technological advancements, particularly in artificial intelligence, challenging the long-held belief that America is always ahead. China's AI firms are expanding influence by freely distributing their models, making them more accessible to researchers and developers worldwide. Chinese apps like Shein, Temu, and TikTok are gaining global popularity, posing a potential threat to Western dominance in the digital economy. The article urges the United States to openly share more of its AI technologies and research, innovate faster, and double down on diffusing AI throughout the economy to maintain its competitive edge. Optimism is tempered by the recognition of China's advancements and the need for the US to adapt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking fell to fourth among OECD members in 2024, behind the United States, Germany, and Britain. The decline was attributed to the yen's depreciation and a contrast to sharp increases in previous years due to resumed development projects after COVID-19 suspensions. Despite the decrease, Japan views ODA as a crucial diplomatic tool for pursuing a "free and open" Indo-Pacific. The article also notes an overall decline in ODA by Development Assistance Committee members due to reduced contributions to international organizations and aid for Ukraine.</p>

In the past two years, Beijing has targeted multiple members of its Central Military Commission (CMC), indicating a strong commitment to rooting out corruption within the military.</p>
