          <p>An opinion piece argues against viewing China's advancements in green technology as a threatening "China Shock 2.0." Instead, it posits that China is acting as a builder of new global systems, particularly in the clean energy sector. The article highlights that in 2023, China installed more solar capacity than the rest of the world combined and is drastically driving down the cost of solar panels. This leadership is framed not as a destabilizing force but as a crucial contribution to underwriting the world's green transition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The inspiration for the world-famous Barbie doll was a German character named Lilli, who first appeared in a 1952 comic strip in the Bild tabloid. Originally designed to appeal to male readers, Lilli was a risqué, pin-up style character who was later turned into a doll sold in bars and tobacco shops as an adult novelty gift. Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler discovered the Lilli doll in Switzerland in 1956, bought the rights, and redesigned it into Barbie, which launched in 1959 and became a global phenomenon.</p>

The team hit six home runs in their 13-5 victory, prompting a message on the videoboard apologizing to fans for the lack of pyro. During the game, Pete Alonso hit two home runs, making him the franchise's all-time leader with 254, surpassing Darryl Strawberry.

          <p>A slight drop in the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate to 6.67% has triggered a significant 23% weekly jump in refinancing applications, the strongest week since last April. The data from the Mortgage Bankers Association also shows a notable 25% increase in demand for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), as their rates are comparatively lower. Despite the surge in refinancing, applications for home purchases saw only a minor 1% increase, indicating that high home prices continue to challenge potential buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists from the University of Science and Technology of China has developed the world's largest array of atoms for quantum computing. They successfully arranged over 2,000 rubidium atoms, each acting as a qubit, into precise patterns using an AI-controlled system of laser beams known as optical tweezers. This achievement represents a significant advance for atom-based quantum computers, which are considered a promising approach but were previously limited to arrays of only a few hundred atoms. The breakthrough could accelerate the development of powerful quantum machines.</p>

          <p>In a panel discussion, entrepreneurs emphasized the importance of balancing creative passion with business pragmatism, especially when starting with limited funds. One speaker noted that while they create some products for pure artistic joy, they must also produce items that are commercially viable to pay the bills. The discussion also touched on the value of authentic, behind-the-scenes social media content in building a customer base that wants to support real people over large corporations. Ultimately, the panelists advised new founders to stay true to their vision and be confident in their products.</p>

          <p>Zach Cregger's new horror film, "Weapons," is analyzed for its use of the long-standing trope that portrays unmarried women as inherently suspicious and dangerous. The movie centers on a single schoolteacher, played by Julia Garner, who becomes the prime suspect after 17 of her students mysteriously disappear. The review explores how the film taps into cultural anxieties about women who exist outside traditional family structures, making them easy scapegoats. However, the film also positions its protagonist as a resilient heroine, subverting expectations as she investigates the truth.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Australia have identified a new species of prehistoric whale that lived 26 million years ago, based on a well-preserved skull found on Victoria's Surf Coast. Named Janjucetus dullardi after the local who discovered it, the creature was a small, dolphin-sized predator with sharp, slicing teeth. It belongs to the mammalodontid group, which are distant, smaller relatives of modern baleen whales. The discovery provides new insights into early whale evolution in a region that researchers are calling a cradle for some of history's most unusual whales.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The reboot of the animated series "King of the Hill" is reviewed as a comforting, almost fantastical portrayal of neighborly connection in an era of social fragmentation. The show returns with protagonist Hank Hill valuing community obligations, such as helping his isolated friend Bill, over a more comfortable life. While the series lightly touches on modern issues like ride-share apps and social media paranoia, it largely avoids the deep political and cultural divisions of contemporary America. This creates a vision of coexistence that feels both appealing and distant from reality.</p>

          <p>For the first time since the market turmoil caused by the Truss government's mini-budget in September 2022, the average rate for a two-year fixed mortgage in the UK has fallen below 5%. According to data from Moneyfacts, the rate has dropped to 4.99%, a development described as a "symbolic turning point" for homebuyers. This reflects more aggressive competition among lenders, although rates remain significantly higher than pre-2022 levels. With 1.6 million fixed-rate deals expiring this year, the change will affect hundreds of thousands of borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>
