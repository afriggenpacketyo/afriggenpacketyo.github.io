          <p>Renowned painter Alex Katz, celebrated for his distinctive figurative art over a 75-year career, is now focusing on promoting the work of other artists. At 98, Katz has gifted a collection of over one hundred paintings to the Portland Museum of Art in Maine for an exhibition titled "Painting Energy." This act of philanthropy is rooted in his own early struggles for recognition in an art world dominated by abstract and pop art. By collecting and showcasing pieces from emerging and established artists, Katz aims to provide the support and belief that was crucial to his own journey.</p>

          <h2>Psychologist Offers Six Key Phrases to Foster Cooperation in Children</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Child psychology expert Reem Raouda suggests that building long-term cooperation with children hinges on creating a sense of connection and emotional safety, rather than demanding immediate obedience. Based on studies of over 200 parent-child relationships, she identifies six "magic phrases" designed to calm a child's nervous system and encourage listening. Phrases like "I believe you" and "Let's figure this out together" shift the dynamic from adversarial to collaborative, validating a child's feelings while still maintaining boundaries. This approach aims to make cooperation a natural outcome of a secure and respectful parent-child bond.</p>

          <p>The Premier League's summer transfer window is heading towards a frantic finale, with several high-profile deals expected before Monday's deadline. Newcastle United's Alexander Isak is reportedly attempting to force a move to Liverpool, a saga that could conclude with a near-record fee. Meanwhile, Arsenal has seemingly hijacked Tottenham's deal for Eberechi Eze. Other potential moves include goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma's exit from PSG, with Manchester clubs interested, and Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi being linked to Liverpool, highlighting a period of intense last-minute negotiations across the league.</p>

          <p>The UK has finalized a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates, marking Britain's largest-ever warship export deal by value. The deal is expected to support 4,000 jobs in the UK, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be constructed. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 British and Norwegian anti-submarine frigates. The decision represents a significant victory for the UK's defense industry over international competitors from France, Germany, and the United States.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 09:15:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Artificial intelligence is increasingly disrupting the labor market, with a notable impact on entry-level positions and recent graduates. According to data from Indeed, overall job postings have declined by 6.7% year-over-year, with tech jobs seeing a 36% drop compared to pre-pandemic levels. While AI can automate tasks in fields like coding, accounting, and copywriting, it is less likely to replace jobs requiring empathy or physicality, such as healthcare and skilled trades.

          <p>In a personal essay, the author challenges the common liberal disdain for hunting, arguing it can be a more honest and sustainable way to consume meat than relying on factory-farmed products. Recounting her own journey from a non-hunter to participating in the activity in Montana, she describes the profound connection to nature and the food cycle it fosters. The article posits that responsible hunters are deeply invested in conservation, with licensing fees and taxes on firearms directly funding wildlife management, and that the practice promotes a deeper understanding of ecosystems that is often shared by vegetarians and vegans.</p>

          <p>Actor Jeremy Allen White is portraying Bruce Springsteen in the film "Deliver Me From Nowhere," which focuses on the creation of the 1982 album "Nebraska." White describes the challenge of playing the rock icon during a time when Springsteen was battling depression and feeling fraudulent as a person, despite his artistic success. He drew parallels between Springsteen's internal struggles and his Emmy-winning role as Carmy in "The Bear," noting both characters grapple with generational trauma. White worked closely with Springsteen, who approved of the film's focused, "antibiopic" approach to this pivotal and vulnerable moment in his life.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," neurosurgeon Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores innovative approaches to understanding and treating chronic pain. He highlights the shift towards "reverse translational research," which starts with a patient's real-world experience rather than a laboratory setting. This method has enabled scientists to map the unique neural signatures of individual pain for the first time, creating objective biomarkers for a subjective experience. These breakthroughs are leading to advanced treatments like deep brain stimulation (DBS) that can predict and intercept pain signals in the brain, offering new hope for millions.</p>

After a safe deposit box goes unpaid for eight years, its contents are turned over to the state.

          <p>Researchers have resolved a long-standing debate by identifying the comb jelly as the first animal to branch off from the common ancestor of all animals, a split that occurred around 600 million years ago. For years, scientists debated whether sea sponges or comb jellies held this distinction. Using new chromosomal analysis techniques, the study compared the gene arrangements of both creatures to their closest non-animal relatives. The comb jelly's chromosomes showed the least amount of genetic rearrangement, indicating it diverged earlier, making it the evolutionary "sister" to all other animals on Earth.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History explores the little-known origins of surfing in the mainland United States, crediting three teenage Hawaiian princes in 1885. The royal brothers, sent to a military school near Santa Cruz, fashioned surfboards from local redwood and demonstrated the sport, then known as "surfboard swimming," at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River. Their feats were documented in a local newspaper and inspired locals to take up the activity. This historical event predates the more famous popularization of surfing by Duke Kahanamoku in the early 20th century.</p>

These iconic, single-use plastic items are a staple in many takeaway restaurants but are difficult to recycle due to their small size. The ban is an extension of previous legislation that targeted other single-use plastics like straws and bags. Officials emphasize that while the containers are used for mere seconds, they can persist in the environment for centuries, harming marine life.</p>

While Katz's detached, stylistic approach to portraiture was initially met with criticism in a world of abstract expressionism, his focus on Ada's distinct look became his signature.

          <p>An essay by Avram Alpert addresses the common modern dilemma of feeling guilty for personal happiness while the world faces numerous crises. Drawing on ancient religious and philosophical traditions that view humanity as a single interconnected body, the author argues that feeling the pain of others is a moral response. However, this same principle suggests we should also be open to feeling their joys, a concept known as "sympathetic joy" or *mudita*. The piece concludes that embracing both the world's horrors and its delights is not a contradiction but a necessary part of being a connected human, and that feeling good can be a form of resistance.</p>
