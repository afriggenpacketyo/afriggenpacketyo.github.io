          <p>A U.S. envoy has announced that Israeli and Syrian leaders have agreed to a ceasefire, with backing from Turkey and Jordan. The agreement follows recent Israeli airstrikes in Damascus, which Israel stated were to defend the Druze minority in southern Syria. The new Syrian leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are party to the truce. The U.S. envoy also called for all factions in Syria to lay down their arms to build a new, united national identity.</p>

          <p>Following a directive from President Trump, the Department of Justice has filed a motion to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. The request cites significant public interest and a commitment to transparency, while also promising to redact victim-related and other personal identifying information. This move comes after criticism from conservatives over the administration's initial decision not to release further files. The filing asks the court to release transcripts from both the Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell cases.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has announced it will no longer use computer engineering teams based in China for work on Pentagon cloud systems and other sensitive government projects. The decision follows a ProPublica report that raised national security concerns about the practice, which involved using "digital escorts" to supervise foreign engineers. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated the Pentagon would investigate the matter, emphasizing that foreign engineers should not have access to DOD systems. Microsoft affirmed its commitment to providing secure services to the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>Shares of fintech company Block, formerly known as Square, rose more than 10% in extended trading after it was announced that it will join the S&P 500 index. Block is set to replace oil producer Hess, which was recently acquired by Chevron. This inclusion is significant as it forces index funds to purchase the stock, often leading to a rally. Despite being down 14% for the year, Block's addition reflects the growing influence of technology companies within the benchmark index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The "California Forever" project, funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, has proposed developing a 2,100-acre manufacturing hub called the "Solano Foundry" within its planned new city in Solano County. The hub aims to attract companies in defense, aerospace, robotics, and other high-tech industries, with the goal of creating over 35,000 manufacturing jobs. The project's CEO, Jan Sramek, framed the plan as a way to "bring back 'designed in California, made in California'." However, the project continues to face skepticism from local community groups who question its necessity and impact.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is experiencing a significant increase in its wasp population this summer, a trend pest control experts and entomologists attribute to a warm and dry spring. While many people dislike wasps, experts emphasize their crucial role as apex predators and natural pest controllers in the ecosystem. Unlike many other insect species facing declines, the common wasp population has remained stable. To coexist peacefully, people are advised not to swat at them and can distract them with a small offering of something sweet away from picnic areas.</p>

          <p>A new comedic stage show in Liverpool, "The Legend of Rooney's Ring," is a fantasy spoof inspired by the lives of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife, Coleen. The play, written by "Motherland" co-creator Helen Serafinowicz, merges a tabloid myth about Coleen's engagement ring with a "Lord of the Rings"-style quest. The creators insist the show is an affectionate homage rather than a malicious parody, portraying the couple as heroic figures in a medieval caper. The production reflects the local Royal Court theatre's focus on creating original, crowd-pleasing comedies relevant to its Liverpool audience.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland's health service will extend its RSV vaccination program to include premature babies starting this autumn. The new measure provides a long-acting injection, Nirsevimab, to infants born too early to benefit from the maternal RSV vaccine offered during pregnancy. RSV is a highly infectious virus that is a leading cause of hospitalization in young children. Officials highlighted that the new vaccine offers about 80% protection and will help reduce pressure on the health service during the winter months.</p>

In June 2005, the girl was kidnapped by men intending to force her into marriage and was missing for a week. According to police reports from the time, three lions chased away her captors and then stood guard over her until she was found. Wildlife experts speculated that the girl's whimpering may have resembled the sound of a lion cub, preventing the lions from attacking her.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has identified a specific interaction between gut bacteria and a genetic variant that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. Researchers found that a molecule produced by certain gut bacteria over-activates an immune protein called STING in individuals with a faulty version of the OTUD3 gene. This gene normally acts as a brake on the immune system, but when it fails, it leads to chronic inflammation in the colon. The discovery could lead to more precise, personalized therapies for the disease, moving beyond broad immune-suppressing treatments.</p>

One of the freed Americans was identified as former Navy SEAL Wilbert Joseph Castaneda.
