          <p>Alphabet, Google's parent company, will contribute $22 million towards the construction of a White House ballroom as part of a legal settlement with former President Donald Trump following his ban from YouTube after the January 6th Capitol riot. This contribution represents nearly 10% of the estimated $250 million construction cost of the 90,000 square-foot ballroom, which is causing public anger as images surface of the demolition of the East Wing to make way for the project. Trump has insisted that American taxpayers will not bear the costs, stating that he and private donors will fund the construction. The White House has dismissed the anger as "manufactured outrage", but the funding sources beyond Alphabet remain unclear. </p>

          <p>GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik has engaged in multiple conversations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman regarding the increasing power demands of AI development. These discussions centered on OpenAI's power requirements, encompassing both power generation and the necessary electrical equipment. GE Vernova has become a key power equipment provider for major hyperscalers, including OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia, Google, and XAI, with electrical equipment orders from these companies doubling from 2024 to 2025. The company faces challenges such as capacity constraints and evolving tariff policies, but remains optimistic due to strong demand for power generation equipment, mostly sold out through 2028. GE Vernova recently announced it would buy the 50% it didn't already own in transformer manufacturer Prolec GE for more than $5 billion.</p>

          <p>Former special counsel Jack Smith defended his 2023 decision to subpoena phone records of Republican senators, asserting the move was "entirely proper" and in line with Justice Department policy. Smith stated that the data, limited to the period surrounding the January 6th Capitol riots, was carefully targeted to support the investigation into President Donald Trump’s alleged subversion of the 2020 election. The targeted senators included Marsha Blackburn, Josh Hawley, and Lindsey Graham, and the records sought did not reveal call contents but rather call times and recipients. Smith's lawyers disputed accusations of hiding the subpoenas, noting they were mentioned in his final report and provided to Trump's lawyers. </p>

          <p>A west London council reversed its decision to fine a woman £150 for pouring the remnants of coffee down a road gully. Burcu Yesilyurt, who lives in Kew, said she thought she was acting responsibly when she poured out a small amount of coffee from her reusable cup down the drain rather than risk spilling it on the bus she was about to catch to work. She was stopped by three enforcement officers at the bus stop near Richmond station and issued with the fixed penalty notice (FPN). Richmond-Upon-Thames Council said it cancelled the fine as it was "likely" that Ms Yesilyurt's appeal of the FPN "would have been rescinded because it is a minor contravention which the recipient agreed not to repeat".</p>

While exceptions are possible, the decision affects a small portion of Walmart's corporate workforce, with the company having 2,390 employees on H-1B visas as of June 30. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has filed a lawsuit challenging the new H-1B visa fee, arguing it will hinder U.S. businesses' access to global talent.</p>
