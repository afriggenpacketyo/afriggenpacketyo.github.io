          <p>English amateur Tyler Weaver qualified for his US Open debut after a strong performance in Monday's qualifying event. Meanwhile, notable US PGA Tour players Rickie Fowler and Max Homa failed to secure their spots. The qualifying event, known as 'golf's longest day,' involved players completing 36 holes at various venues across the US and Canada. Weaver finished tied for third, while Matt Wallace and Erik van Rooyen were among other successful qualifiers. Homa, who recently split from his caddie, had to carry his own bag for 38 holes, adding to the challenge.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has ruled in favor of allowing nonbinary and gender-nonconforming individuals to update their birth certificates to reflect their gender identity. The decision came after a lawsuit filed by six individuals who argued that the Commonwealth's existing policy violated their right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The court stated that there was no rational basis to deny the request, allowing individuals to select "X" as their gender marker on birth certificates. This ruling aligns Puerto Rico with at least 17 other U.S. states that permit residents to include a nonbinary or gender-neutral sex on their birth certificates.</p>

          <p>Opposition party leader Lee Jae-myung is projected to win South Korea's snap presidential election, according to a Gallup poll cited by Yonhap. Lee, from the Democratic Party, holds a significant lead over his rival, Kim Moon Soo of the People's Power Party. The election was triggered by the impeachment and removal of former president Yoon Suk Yeol. Analysts predict that if elected, Lee will face challenges in reviving the economy and negotiating trade agreements with the U.S., potentially seeking more favorable terms compared to other countries. The South Korean won is expected to appreciate against the U.S. dollar following the election.</p>
