          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 19:10:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to construct the Sizewell C nuclear plant in Suffolk, projecting the creation of 10,000 direct jobs and enough energy to power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed it as a "landmark decision" to stimulate economic growth and the "biggest nuclear building programme in a generation". Energy Secretary Ed Miliband emphasized nuclear energy's role in achieving clean energy abundance and bolstering UK energy security. However, critics like Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C, condemned the investment, fearing it would increase consumer bills and that the government will regret the decision. The final investment decision is expected later this summer, but the project has faced both local and national opposition due to concerns over its cost and potential impact on consumer bills. Optimism is tempered by the project's long timeline and the history of delays and cost overruns with similar projects. This investment is part of a series of announcements leading up to the government's Spending Review. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 19:04:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese electric car manufacturers are rapidly expanding into global markets, offering cheaper and technologically advanced vehicles, which has prompted concerns about security risks and the potential impact on established European manufacturers. BYD, the biggest player in China, has overtaken Tesla as the world's best-selling EV maker and is aggressively expanding in Europe. While consumers may benefit from more affordable EVs, some experts worry about potential security risks from hacking and surveillance. The US has already imposed high tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, while the EU is also taking steps to protect its market. European manufacturers are racing to develop their own affordable electric cars, but face challenges in matching the cost advantages of Chinese firms. </p>

          <p>Marines and National Guard personnel deployed to Los Angeles amid protests will operate under specific rules of force, primarily tasked with protecting federal buildings and personnel. According to officials, the troops will not engage crowds unless necessary, and their weapons will not be loaded with ammunition, although they will carry ammunition for self-defense. They are instructed to de-escalate situations and will not use rubber bullets or pepper spray. These rules would change if President Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, which he has not done. LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell emphasized the need for clear communication and coordination between agencies to ensure a lawful and orderly response. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Rodon Group, a plastics injection molding company in Pennsylvania, is experiencing a surge in demand due to the uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs. The company, which produces K'nex toys, has seen demand increase by nearly 50% as consumers navigate the changing tariff landscape. Despite a U.S.-China agreement that would reduce tariffs, uncertainty remains, and the company has avoided tariff chaos by using automation to keep production stateside. The company has invested heavily in robotics, enabling it to compete with offshore manufacturers with lower labor costs, however, the company believes that domestic production will only work if the United States invests in its workforce. If tariffs are put into effect, this may impact the supply of toys this holiday season. (not investment advice)</p>
