          <p>Joby Aviation is partnering with defense firm L3Harris to develop a military aircraft capable of both piloted and autonomous flight. The new hybrid vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) vehicle will be based on Joby's commercial S4 air taxi but will utilize a gas turbine. This collaboration aims to create a smaller, more adaptable, and cost-effective craft for low-altitude military operations, reflecting a strategic shift influenced by modern conflicts. Testing is scheduled to begin this fall, with operational demonstrations anticipated by 2026 as the companies move quickly toward deployability.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that the "Happy Gilmore" film series, including the new sequel, transcends simple comedy to deliver a conservative message about the primacy of family. In the original film, Happy's motivation for playing golf was to save his grandmother's house. In the sequel, a retired and struggling Happy returns to the sport to fund his daughter's dream of attending a prestigious ballet school in Paris. The author argues that both narratives champion altruism and familial obligation over self-interest, portraying a life of purpose as one lived in service to older and younger generations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newcastle United has turned down an opening offer from Liverpool for their 25-year-old striker, Alexander Isak. The Swedish international is reportedly valued by Newcastle at around £150 million, with Liverpool's bid, said to be £110 million plus add-ons, falling short of this figure. Isak has expressed a desire to explore a move and was left out of Newcastle's pre-season tour, currently training alone. Despite Newcastle's public stance that he is not for sale, Liverpool manager Arne Slot is keen to add the striker to his squad ahead of the new season.</p>

          <p>Startup Trunk Tools has secured $40 million in Series B funding to expand its AI platform designed to tackle inefficiency in the construction industry. Founded by former construction contractor Sarah Buchner, the company uses generative AI to structure and analyze the vast amounts of documentation involved in large projects, such as blueprints and schedules. By identifying discrepancies and project risks, the technology aims to prevent costly errors, reduce rework, and minimize material waste. This innovation addresses a sector that has been slow to digitize, which contributes to nearly $1 trillion in lost productivity annually.</p>

          <p>This article reviews Stephen Starring Grant's memoir, "Mailman: My Wild Ride Delivering the Mail in Appalachia and Finally Finding Home." The book chronicles Grant's experience taking a job as a rural mail carrier in Virginia after being laid off from a corporate marketing position during the COVID-19 pandemic. The review praises the book as an empathetic ethnography of the U.S. Postal Service and a lament for the declining ideal of public service. It highlights Grant's observations on the dignity of manual labor, the surprising complexity of the job, and the inexcusable working conditions postal workers face.</p>

          <p>Pewabic Pottery, a Detroit institution founded in 1903, continues to thrive by focusing on handcrafted products, in contrast to the city's history of mass production. A proponent of the Arts and Crafts movement, the studio is renowned for its unique, iridescent glazes and hand-pressed tiles, which adorn buildings across the country. Despite Detroit's economic turmoil over the decades, Pewabic has survived by maintaining its traditional methods and operating as a nonprofit since 1981. The company had its best year ever in 2024, demonstrating a renewed public appreciation for handmade goods in an age of automation.</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil reported a 23% decline in second-quarter net income to $7.1 billion, but still surpassed Wall Street expectations due to record production. The company's output reached 4.6 million barrels per day, its highest second-quarter level since the Mobil merger, driven by strong performance in the Permian Basin and Guyana. This production growth helped mitigate the impact of lower oil prices compared to the previous year. Exxon also returned $9.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, and is on track to repurchase $20 billion in shares this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has introduced a new anti-money-laundering regulation targeting the trade of precious metals and gems to close a significant loophole. Under the new rule, dealers must report any cash transactions totaling 100,000 yuan (about $13,870) or more within a single day to the nation's financial crime watchdog. The regulation also mandates reporting any transaction, regardless of amount, if there are reasonable grounds to suspect money laundering. This marks the first time China's anti-money-laundering supervision has expanded beyond traditional financial institutions to a specific non-financial sector, aiming to curb illicit financial flows.</p>

          <p>Family offices, the private investment firms for the ultra-wealthy, are increasingly using structured, long-term incentive plans to attract and retain top talent. According to a new report, nearly two-thirds of investment-focused family offices now use these plans, moving away from informal "handshake agreements." This trend is boosting executive pay, with median total compensation for CEOs at larger firms exceeding $1.2 million. Popular incentives include co-investment opportunities, carried interest, and phantom equity, which align executive pay more closely with investment performance and long-term success.</p>

          <p>Strict limits on liquids in airline hand luggage may soon be relaxed across the European Union, as new CT scanners capable of detecting liquid explosives have been approved. The technology provides high-resolution 3D images, allowing security to thoroughly inspect bag contents without requiring liquids to be removed. While the EU Commission now permits airports to lift the 100ml rule, the change will be gradual, as each airport must decide when to implement the expensive new scanners. Some German airports may soon allow up to two liters, but a full rollout will take time.</p>
