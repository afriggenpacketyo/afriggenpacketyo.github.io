        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study reveals that a vast majority of American workers feel they have been victims of "career catfishing," where a job's reality differs significantly from what was described during the hiring process. This phenomenon involves employers misrepresenting company culture, workload, or career growth opportunities to attract candidates. To avoid this, experts advise job seekers to ask specific, example-based questions during interviews about daily operations, management style, and team dynamics. Paying attention to red-flag phrases like "we're like a family" can also help applicants vet potential employers.</p>

          <p>A federal felony charge against David Huerta, a prominent Southern California labor union president, has been reduced to a misdemeanor. Huerta was arrested during a protest of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid in Los Angeles, where he was accused of obstructing federal officers. His arrest drew condemnation from labor advocates and Democratic leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom, who framed the charges as a politically motivated act of retaliation by the Trump administration. Huerta's attorneys stated the reduction in charges makes it clear there were no grounds for the initial felony.</p>

He then hosts free giveaway events where families can choose a costume, providing a sense of normalcy and joy amid financial pressures. Waggoner's initiative, which he has run for nine years, has been especially busy this year as families face an 11% increase in costume prices compared to 2024.</p>

          <p>Amid increasing market volatility, an Invesco senior portfolio manager suggests that income funds using options-based strategies can offer investors more stability and protection. These funds are not as reliant on traditional stock and asset correlations and can provide income that is less sensitive to interest rate changes from the Federal Reserve. This approach is gaining traction as it provides a form of downside protection against equity drawdowns. For investors considering this space, it is advised to seek ETFs managed by institutional-grade professionals and to be wary of unsustainable yields. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Contrary to the common stereotype that women are more eager to settle down, a recent study from the Kinsey Institute indicates that men are more likely to want to speed up relationship milestones like moving in together or getting married. Researchers suggest this trend is driven by both financial incentives and the fact that heterosexual men often rely on romantic relationships as their primary source of social and emotional support. Experts note that traditional masculinity often restricts men's ability to form close, intimate platonic friendships, making a romantic partner uniquely important for their psychological well-being.</p>

          <p>In an increasingly competitive job market, many applicants are using artificial intelligence to create professional headshots, bypassing the high cost of traditional photography. Services like Canva and HeadshotPro allow users to upload selfies and receive polished, studio-quality images for a fraction of the price, which some users report has led to increased recruiter outreach. However, the trend raises questions about authenticity, with career experts warning that poorly done AI photos can appear fake and hurt a candidate's chances.

          <p>A Gen X mother's social media post has gone viral after she apologized to her children's generation for pushing them toward four-year degrees, calling it a "HUGE disservice." She argued that while her generation was taught that college was the only path to success, there is now a significant shortage and high demand for skilled trade workers like electricians and welders. With many college graduates facing substantial debt and underwhelming salaries, she urged parents to consider the high earning potential in trades. The sentiment reflects a growing national conversation about the value of vocational training.</p>

The tournament features over 40 professional wrestlers, known as rikishi, competing in 100 bouts over five days, bringing the highly traditional and ritualistic Japanese national sport to a Western audience.

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has acquired a stake in Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) and is engaging with its management. The move comes after KDP's stock fell 25% following the announcement of a complex, debt-financed merger with JDE Peet's, a deal seen as highly favorable to majority owner JAB Holdings. Shareholders were surprised by the structure, which bypasses a shareholder vote and saddles the new company with significant leverage.

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge advises parents to delay giving children smartphones and social media access for as long as possible to promote better mental health and future success. She recommends two critical steps: starting conversations about responsible technology use at least six years in advance, and establishing firm, clear rules once devices are introduced. These rules should include no phones in bedrooms overnight or during the school day, and starting with a basic, non-internet-connected phone first. By teaching moderation and setting boundaries early, parents can help children develop a healthier relationship with technology.</p>
