          <p>Airlines faced a surge in customer complaints in 2024, reaching a record 66,675, according to a U.S. PIRG Education Fund report. The increase is attributed to issues such as flight cancellations, delays, and mishandled luggage, which have worsened since the pandemic. The report also highlights that airlines mishandled fewer bags and wheelchairs compared to the previous year, though millions were still lost or damaged. Frontier Airlines had the highest rate of complaints per passenger, while Southwest, Alaska, and Hawaiian Airlines performed best in overall customer satisfaction.</p>

          <p>President Trump's Middle East visit resulted in multibillion-dollar technology investments from Saudi and Emirati customers, including sales of advanced chips from Nvidia and AMD. These deals have sparked security concerns, as the previous administration had placed limits on exports to the region due to fears the technology might reach China. Investors, however, seem unconcerned, with shares in Nvidia and AMD soaring after the announcements, giving a lift to the Magnificent 7 group of A.I.-focused stocks.

          <p>A rare clue at a Minneapolis crime scene, bloody bare footprints, led to the arrest of Jerry Westrom in the 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs. The footprints, left by the killer stepping in Childs' blood, were documented and compared to multiple suspects, initially clearing Childs' roommate. Decades later, DNA testing revealed an unknown profile that matched Westrom, who denied knowing Childs. Forensic analysis confirmed that the footprints at the scene matched Westrom's, leading to his arrest and trial.</p>

The Mediterranean chain said its same-store sales grew 10.8% in the three months that ended April 20, lifted by traffic growth of 7.5%. The article adds that diners have been trading up from fast food and down from casual-dining restaurants into Cava's bowls and pitas, a trend the company has seen for several quarters.

          <p>The Japanese government pledged to allocate a quota of its stockpiled rice for supermarkets and other retailers to accelerate distribution and help consumers benefit from lower prices more quickly. Of the 300,000 tons of reserve rice to be released over three months through July, 60 percent will be allocated to retailers. The government has already auctioned 312,000 tons of rice in three tranches between March and April. Distributors will be required to coordinate with retailers to ensure the rice is sold in stores within around a month.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is considering whether a single lower-court judge should be able to block the president's policies across the entire country. The administration argues that universal injunctions make it too easy for random jurists to block their agenda. The administration wants to limit the judicial branch‚Äôs ability to check the president, even beyond immigration. The article goes on to detail how such a move would place a huge burden on the public and the courts.</p>
