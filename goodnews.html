          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 10:17:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reem Raouda, a conscious parenting expert, suggests alternative phrases to traditional parenting that foster cooperation rather than defiance in children. Instead of using commands or threats, she recommends explaining decisions respectfully and acknowledging children's feelings. Raouda emphasizes creating an environment where children feel respected, emotionally safe, and involved, which reduces power struggles and promotes emotional resilience. By shifting from control and criticism to empathy and leadership, parents can build stronger, more trusting relationships with their children, ultimately raising emotionally resilient adults.</p>

The article recounts their initial gigs at the London Fog and Whisky a Go Go, highlighting the improvisational nature of their music and Jim Morrison's initial shyness. Despite Morrison's struggles with substance abuse, which Densmore sensed early on, the band achieved immense success with hits like "Light My Fire."

          <p>Despite facing challenges such as tariffs, inflation, and labor shortages, small business owners in the US remain cautiously optimistic about the future. Multiple surveys indicate that while many businesses are experiencing growth and maintaining employment levels, concerns about the economy persist. Optimism is tempered by a weakening outlook on future economic growth, with many reporting declines in their business's financial health. Despite these headwinds, small businesses are generally maintaining employment levels and reporting average financial results, indicating resilience in the face of economic uncertainty.

This method involves categorizing specific aspects of professional success and highlighting accomplishments that demonstrate value to a new company. Machado argues that a brag doc can be more effective than a traditional resume or cover letter, as it allows candidates to showcase their achievements and prepare for interviews.
