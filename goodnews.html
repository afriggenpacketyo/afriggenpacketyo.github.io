          <p>Seven Democratic candidates vying for New York City's mayor clashed in their final debate, with former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani leading the attacks. Cuomo, attempting a political comeback, dismissed Mamdani as inexperienced, while Mamdani criticized Cuomo's past scandals and mispronunciation of his name. The debate covered topics such as the Trump administration's immigration raids in Los Angeles, housing, and public safety. Mamdani pledged to block NYPD cooperation with federal immigration agents, while Cuomo defended New York City's sanctuary city status. Candidates also addressed concerns from Jewish New Yorkers and accusations of Islamophobia related to campaign materials.</p>

          <p>Researchers have found evidence of cancer in a dinosaur fossil, suggesting that ancient soft tissue preserved in bones could offer insights into modern cancer research. The team examined a Telmatosaurus transsylvanicus dinosaur and discovered structures resembling red blood cells linked to a tumor in its jaw. This discovery indicates that soft tissue may be preserved in fossils more often than previously thought, providing valuable molecular information about diseases. Understanding how dinosaurs protected themselves against cancer could inform new approaches to cancer prevention or treatment in humans, as large animals like whales and elephants have evolved similar defenses. The dinosaur in the study had an ameloblastoma tumor, a type also found in humans today.</p>

          <p>Dan Wang, a keen observer of China, has termed the country the ‚Äúengineering state‚Äù due to its focus on building large public works and technological advancements. China's integrated transport system, including subway trains and high-speed rail, showcases the nation's engineering prowess. The country has built more dams, bridges, and high-rises than any other nation, with a strong emphasis on STEM fields. China's STEM graduates significantly outnumber those in the US, and many top officials are engineers. This contrasts with the US, which Wang calls the ‚Äúlawyerly state,‚Äù highlighting the different priorities and expertise of the two countries.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Pigs Were Domesticated in China Earlier Than Previously Thought</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 21:00:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research by archaeologists from Chinese and US institutes suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago. The team analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region, finding that pigs were eating humans‚Äô cooked foods and waste. This indicates that the domestication of Sus scrofa, the wild boar, occurred alongside the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles in ancient society. The conventional view is that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East, but this study challenges that notion. The findings were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).</p>

          <p>Patrick Reed achieved a rare albatross during the first round of the US Open, making a 2 on the par-5 fourth hole. Reed hit a 3-wood from 286 yards, with the ball bouncing three times before rolling into the cup. This marks just the fourth albatross at the US Open since records began in 1983. Despite the albatross, Reed finished the round at 3-over 73 after a triple bogey on the 18th hole. Reed mentioned that he has witnessed only one other albatross in person, which occurred during his childhood at Dominion Country Club in San Antonio.</p>

          <p>Official campaigning for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election has commenced, drawing attention as a prelude to this summer's House of Councillors race. With no party holding a majority in the 127-member assembly, the focus is on whether Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) can retain its seats. Parties are using social media to appeal to voters, particularly unaffiliated ones. Key issues include support for households facing rising living costs, political funding scandals involving the LDP, and regional concerns such as child-rearing and measures against heat. Around 300 candidates are running in the election, surpassing the 271 in the previous race.</p>
