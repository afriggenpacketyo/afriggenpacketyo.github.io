          <p>With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady, savers have an opportunity to secure high returns through long-term certificates of deposit (CDs). This article suggests that while current rates are slightly lower than last year, they still offer a valuable, fixed-rate investment. It advises savers to carefully determine the maximum amount they can deposit for an extended period without impacting their daily finances, to avoid early withdrawal penalties. The article also recommends using this period to shop around, particularly at online banks, for the most competitive rates available. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Supreme Court has narrowed the grounds for compensation claims related to hidden commissions in car finance deals, a decision that could save lenders billions. The court rejected the argument that car dealers have a fiduciary duty to buyers, which would have classified undisclosed commissions as illegal secret payments. However, the ruling did uphold one claim under the Consumer Credit Act, deeming an agreement with a very large commission unfair, which may set a precedent for similar cases. The Financial Conduct Authority is still considering a separate redress scheme for discretionary commission agreements, which could still result in substantial payouts.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has blocked the Trump administration from using expedited removal processes on migrants who entered the country legally under humanitarian parole. The ruling could curtail a controversial practice where Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrest migrants at courthouses immediately after their cases are dismissed to fast-track their deportation. Judge Jia Cobb found the administration's policy illegal, stating it unfairly targets individuals who have followed legal procedures and entered with government permission. The decision provides a temporary reprieve for hundreds of thousands of migrants, though the Justice Department is expected to appeal.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a significant rally, the price of gold may see a period of stagnation in August due to a combination of economic factors. The Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates on hold is unlikely to be a major catalyst for price movement in either direction. Furthermore, uncertainty surrounding the next inflation report and evolving demand for portfolio diversification could lead to muted activity in the gold market. While the long-term outlook for gold as a hedge against inflation remains, investors are advised to focus on its role as a stable, long-term asset rather than short-term price fluctuations.

          <p>An Ohio couple has welcomed a baby boy who developed from an embryo that was cryopreserved for more than 30 years, likely setting a new record for the longest storage time before a live birth. The embryo, donated in 1994, was adopted by Linda and Tim Pierce after their struggle with infertility. This event highlights the practice of embryo adoption, which is gaining attention, particularly among groups that oppose the discarding of unused embryos. The doctor who performed the transfer confirmed the nearly 31-year-old embryo surpasses the previous record, raising both scientific and ethical considerations about long-term embryo storage.</p>

          <p>Indian fast bowler Prasidh Krishna stated that a heated on-field exchange with England's Joe Root during the fifth Test was a deliberate, competitive tactic to disrupt the batsman. The confrontation occurred early in Root's innings, and while the exact words were not audible, Root's animated reaction was unusual. Krishna, who took four wickets in the innings, downplayed the incident as competitive banter between two players who are friends off the field. The moment is part of a series marked by high tensions, with India currently holding an advantage heading into the third day of the match.</p>
