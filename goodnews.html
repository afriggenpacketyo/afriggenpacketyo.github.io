          <p>China's upcoming military parade, commemorating 80 years since the end of World War II, will showcase the nation's modernized military forces. However, some of the People's Liberation Army's most advanced and potent weapon systems will not be displayed. Key assets, such as the developmental sixth-generation J-36 and J-50 stealth fighters and strategic missile defense systems, will be kept from public view. The decision to exclude these technologies is due to their ongoing development, strategic sensitivity, or logistical challenges related to their inclusion in the parade.</p>

          <p>Defending champion Aryna Sabalenka has advanced to the US Open semifinals after her opponent, Markéta Vondroušová, withdrew due to injury shortly before their scheduled quarter-final match. This walkover sets up a highly anticipated rematch of last year's final against American Jessica Pegula. Pegula secured her spot by defeating Barbora Krejčíková in straight sets, 6-3 6-3. Vondroušová, the 2023 Wimbledon champion, has had a career marked by injuries and was seen with heavy strapping on her leg after cutting a practice session short.</p>

Initially, the vehicles will be operated manually by human safety drivers to validate the technology and operations in these new environments. This expansion is part of Waymo's broader strategy to roll out its driverless ride-hailing service nationwide, which is already commercially available in cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, and Austin. The test fleets in the new cities will consist of Jaguar I-Pace and Geely Zeekr electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>The government in England is planning to introduce a new law banning the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to individuals under the age of 16. The proposed ban would apply to all retail points, including shops, vending machines, and online sales. Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting cited concerns from parents and teachers about the health impacts of these drinks, some of which contain more caffeine than two cups of coffee. Excessive consumption in children has been linked to headaches, sleep problems, and heart issues, prompting public health experts to support the measure.</p>

          <p>In a significant antitrust ruling, a federal judge has ordered Google to end exclusive deals that make it the default search engine on devices but stopped short of forcing the company to sell its Chrome browser. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta's decision aims to restore competition by requiring Google to share some search data with rivals and establishing an oversight committee. The Department of Justice had argued for the divestiture of Chrome to dismantle what it called an illegal monopoly. This ruling marks a major development in the government's efforts to regulate big tech, though Google is expected to appeal.</p>

          <p>Aircraft leasing firm Air Lease Corp. has agreed to be taken private in a $7.4 billion deal led by a consortium of investors including Japan's Sumitomo, SMBC Aviation Capital, Apollo, and Brookfield. The acquisition, valued at approximately $28.2 billion including debt, reflects ongoing consolidation within the aircraft leasing industry. This sector has seen significant growth, owning over half of the world's passenger jets, as airlines increasingly rent planes to conserve cash. The deal comes as high rental rates are driven by a shortage of new aircraft due to recent supply chain disruptions.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of workers at two of California's most prominent national parks, Yosemite and Sequoia & Kings Canyon, have voted overwhelmingly to form a union. The move comes amid significant turmoil within the National Park Service, which has faced unprecedented staff and budget cuts under the Trump administration. The new union, affiliated with the National Federation of Federal Employees, will represent 600 park rangers, scientists, fee collectors, and other staff. Organizers stated the unionization effort gained momentum this year as employees faced threats to workplace protections and reduced agency resources.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin demonstrated resilience on Tuesday, rising over 1% to surpass the $110,000 mark even as traditional stock markets experienced a sell-off. The cryptocurrency's gain contrasted with a broader market downturn triggered by concerns over the legality of U.S. tariffs and a corresponding jump in bond yields. Meanwhile, gold surged to a new record high of over $3,500, reaffirming its status as a traditional safe-haven asset. Market analysts suggest that while Bitcoin benefits from similar economic uncertainty, its performance has also been influenced by a significant rotation of capital into Ethereum.

          <p>Howard Webb, chief of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), has publicly acknowledged that a significant error was made in disallowing a goal for Fulham during their recent match against Chelsea. A goal scored by Fulham's Josh King was overturned after a lengthy VAR review identified a foul in the build-up, a decision Fulham's manager called "unbelievable." Webb stated that the intervention was a "misjudgement" and did not meet the high threshold required for VAR to overturn an on-field decision. The official who acted as the VAR for the match was subsequently stood down from his next assignment.</p>

His betting history in tennis includes a significant loss when he wagered on Taylor Fritz against Sinner in a previous final.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals facing significant credit card debt, such as a $20,000 balance, several effective strategies can be employed to regain financial control. Options include working with a debt relief company for a management or settlement plan, or consolidating multiple debts into a single loan with a potentially lower interest rate. Personal payment strategies like the "debt avalanche" (paying highest interest first) or "debt snowball" (paying smallest balance first) methods are also viable. Additionally, increasing income through a side hustle or taking out a home equity loan can provide the necessary funds to accelerate repayment. (not investment advice)</p>
