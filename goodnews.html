          <p>The New York Knicks are reportedly considering Jason Kidd to fill their head coaching vacancy after parting ways with Tom Thibodeau. The Knicks would need to request permission from the Dallas Mavericks, as Kidd is currently under contract with them. Kidd was previously interviewed for the Knicks' head coaching job in 2020, which ultimately went to Thibodeau, who led the team to their first Eastern Conference finals berth since 2000. Kidd, who spent the final season of his NBA career with the Knicks, has prior coaching experience with the Nets and the Bucks, as well as serving as an assistant coach for the Lakers. </p>

          <p>A previously unreleased studio recording of "Me nace del coraz√≥n" by the late Mexican superstar Juan Gabriel has been made available on digital platforms. The song, originally composed in the 1970s, was famously recorded by Spanish singer Roc√≠o D√∫rcal in 1978. This version features Juan Gabriel's vocals recorded shortly before his death in 2016 and includes a new musical arrangement by Guillermo Hern√°ndez Galicia, who served as the musical director for Juan Gabriel's mariachi band for over two decades. The new single is accompanied by performances from musicians who are currently part of El Mariachi del Divo Alma de Ju√°rez, a group dedicated to preserving the legacy of the Latin American icon.</p>

The eaglet's initial attempt was brief, but Gizmo soon soared off into the air, joining its sister Sunny, who took her first flight earlier in the week. The eaglets, born in March, have been practicing for several days by flapping their wings and jumping between branches. Although their future whereabouts are uncertain, young eagles typically return to the nest shortly after their first flight.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Edwards' tenure as head coach of the England women's cricket team began with a clean sweep over the West Indies in both T20 and ODI series. While the victories were comprehensive, it is important to note that England has historically dominated home bilateral series. The real tests lie ahead, with India's arrival and the upcoming 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. The question remains whether this "new" England can perform under pressure when it truly matters, given their past struggles on the big stage.</p>

          <p>Cardiologists are raising concerns about the potential harm of excessive phone scrolling on heart health. Doomscrolling, especially when starting the day or before bed, can increase anxiety, disrupt sleep, and promote sedentary behavior.

Cardiologists recommend setting time limits, avoiding scrolling in bed, and replacing the habit with healthier alternatives.</p>
