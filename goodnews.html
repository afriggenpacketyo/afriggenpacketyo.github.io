CEO Mike Creedon has stated that the company is actively seeking to mitigate the impact of these inflationary cost pressures, including tariffs, but acknowledges the volatility of the current operating environment.

          <p>Capture6, a startup based in Berkeley, California, is developing a technology that aims to clean water and remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at a reduced cost. The company's process involves repurposing industrial and water treatment waste, specifically brine, to generate clean water and capture CO2 from the air. The technology separates salt into sodium and chlorine, turning the sodium into lye, which bonds with CO2 when exposed to air. This process is particularly attractive in drought-affected areas, with Capture6 already working in Western Australia, South Korea, and California. The company's technology will create a circular economy that benefits the environment.</p>

While HELOC rates had previously decreased, they have recently seen a slight increase, and the likelihood of a rate cut at the June meeting is currently low. However, any indications from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell suggesting an imminent rate reduction could prompt lenders to preemptively lower HELOC rates. For those considering a HELOC, rates are changing independently, payments will decline if the Fed takes rate-cutting action. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 5-year rule is an IRS regulation that affects how non-spouse beneficiaries must take distributions from an inherited annuity when the original contract owner dies. It essentially requires that the entire value of the annuity be distributed, either all at once or in multiple withdrawals, within five years of the original owner's death. This rule applies to non-qualified annuities funded with after-tax dollars and comes into play when the beneficiary is not a spouse. Understanding this rule can help beneficiaries avoid costly mistakes and ensure the money is distributed in a way that aligns with their financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>
