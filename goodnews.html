          <h2>Report Estimates Over 4,000 Assisted Deaths Annually if Law Changes in England and Wales</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new impact assessment, reported by the BBC, estimates that assisted deaths in England and Wales could exceed 4,000 per year within a decade if the law is changed to allow it. The report, created to inform MPs, provides financial analysis, projecting potential NHS savings from reduced end-of-life care costs ranging from ¬£5.84m to ¬£59.6m annually after ten years. However, it also highlights significant costs associated with staffing and training for an assisted dying service. The bill, returning to the House of Commons, faces a crucial vote to determine its passage into law.</p>

          <p>Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong is navigating his first major election amidst rising global trade tensions and domestic concerns, according to DW. The People's Action Party (PAP), which has ruled for 50 years, faces a challenge from a rejuvenated opposition, particularly regarding the cost of living and housing availability. With the US imposing tariffs on Singapore-made goods and potential recession looming due to the US-China trade war, Wong emphasizes the need for a strong mandate to steer the country through economic uncertainty. The opposition argues for more scrutiny and alternative voices in Parliament.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 02:29:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC reports on a US man, Tim Friede, whose deliberate self-injection of snake venom for nearly two decades has resulted in an "unparalleled" antivenom. Antibodies found in Friede's blood have shown protection against fatal doses from various deadly snakes in animal tests. This could be a significant step toward a universal antivenom, as current therapies need to match the specific venomous snake. Researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies that target neurotoxins and, in experiments on mice, protected against fatal doses from 13 of 19 species of venomous snake.</p>
