          <p>After a 16-year hiatus, the iconic British rock band Oasis has officially launched its reunion tour, with the first show taking place at Cardiff's Principality Stadium. The tour, which sold around 900,000 tickets, generated immense global excitement but also faced scrutiny over Ticketmaster's 'dynamic pricing' practices. Brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher, along with other former members, are performing a setlist rumored to include major hits like "Wonderwall" and "Champagne Supernova." The reunion marks a significant moment for fans, concluding years of speculation following the band's acrimonious split in 2009.</p>

          <p>Meta's newly announced advanced AI research lab, MSL, is notable for its high concentration of top-tier talent from China. Of the eleven publicly listed researchers hired to develop next-generation AI models, seven are graduates of prestigious Chinese universities who later pursued careers in the United States. This aggressive recruitment has reportedly heightened tensions with competitors like OpenAI, whose CEO Sam Altman has criticized Meta's lucrative offers to poach talent. The formation of the lab underscores Meta's ambition to lead in the development of "personal superintelligence" and its focus on acquiring elite global researchers.</p>

          <p>Rio de Janeiro is deploying one of its largest-ever peacetime security operations ahead of this week's BRICS summit, which will host leaders from 28 countries. Approximately 20,000 military personnel will be mobilized to secure the event, with armed fighter jets patrolling a strictly controlled no-fly zone over the summit venue. The city's main domestic airport, Santos Dumont, will be closed to commercial traffic during the meetings for security reasons. This level of security, including the authority to shoot down threatening aircraft, was last seen during the 2016 Olympics, highlighting the event's significance.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 18:02:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Fourth of July approaches, experts from Canine Companions offer advice for keeping dogs safe and calm amidst loud fireworks, which can cause significant fear and anxiety for pets. The primary recommendation is to avoid taking dogs to fireworks shows and to exercise them earlier in the day to help them relax. For noise-sensitive dogs, creating a safe, comfortable space at home, using white noise or calming music, and offering engaging toys like a frozen Kong can help mitigate stress. These proactive measures are crucial for ensuring the holiday is not a traumatic experience for canine family members.</p>

          <p>A prominent Beijing-based think tank has proposed that China issue 30 trillion yuan (US$4.2 trillion) in special treasury bonds to swap the hidden debts of local governments. The report from Tsinghua University's ACCEPT argues this measure is crucial for revitalizing economic growth and mitigating systemic financial risks. Researchers suggest that tackling the high levels of local debt, which have hampered economic operations, requires a comprehensive and proactive fiscal policy package.

          <p>NASA has announced the discovery of a new interstellar comet, named 3I/ATLAS, which is currently traveling through our solar system. This is the third confirmed object from another star system to be observed, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The comet is located about 420 million miles from Earth and poses no threat, traveling at a high speed of 37 miles per second. Astronomers are now monitoring the object to determine its size and composition as it makes its closest approach to the sun in late October, offering a rare glimpse of a visitor from deep space.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This contributor article proposes a new model to make popular GLP-1 anti-obesity drugs more affordable for Americans with employer-sponsored health insurance. The author suggests eliminating the complex system of rebates and coupons, allowing insurers to purchase the drugs at the direct-to-consumer price of around $500 per month. Employers could then cover a portion of this cost, significantly lowering the out-of-pocket expense for employees. This approach would simplify the opaque pricing system, improve public health by increasing access, and align U.S. prices more closely with those in other nations. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key provision in President Trump's newly passed legislative package introduces a significant, though temporary, tax change for tipped workers. The law will allow workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips from their annual taxable income, a measure that would cover the majority of tipped employees in the U.S. The tax exemption, which phases out in 2028 unless extended, was a major campaign promise. While proponents celebrate it as a win for working-class Americans, some tax experts note it will primarily benefit middle-to-upper-income earners and will not affect the lowest-income workers.

She explains that while her salary would be considered poverty-level in the U.S., it allows her to live large in China, save $1,000 a month, and enjoy numerous hobbies. Her story highlights the stark contrast in cost of living and work-life balance between the two countries.</p>
