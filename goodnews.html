          <p>Tennis star Novak Djokovic began his US Open campaign with a resilient first-round victory against American teenager Learner Tien, marking his pursuit of a record 25th major title. The 38-year-old Serb displayed his characteristic grand slam tenacity, navigating through physical issues and a time violation to secure a 6-1, 7-6 (3), 6-2 win under the Arthur Ashe Stadium lights. This triumph was his first singles match since the Wimbledon semi-finals, highlighting his determination as he embarks on another significant tournament. The challenging match against the 19-year-old Tien tested Djokovic's resolve, especially in the draining second set, before he ultimately asserted his dominance, overcoming a foot blister and a heated debate with the chair umpire to advance.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer offers his market analysis following a significant stock market rally, which he attributes to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's signals of impending interest rate cuts. Cramer delves into various market sectors, including Big Tech, housing, industrials, and software, providing his perspectives on their potential performance and vulnerabilities. He emphasizes that the Fed's shift was driven by a dramatic deceleration in hiring, counteracting earlier market expectations. The article also discusses the gradual impact of tariffs on inflation and the non-monolithic nature of "Magnificent Seven" stocks. Cramer concludes by anticipating September will bring both price increases and rising joblessness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two young brothers, a 10-year-old and a toddler, who had vanished from their Los Angeles foster home early Thursday morning, have been safely located by the LAPD. Authorities had initially expressed concerns for their imminent danger, prompting an Amber Alert for the children, Derek Rodriguez-Hernandez (2) and Jaden Hernandez (10), and their biological mother, Jackeline Hernandez-Torres. The alert was canceled Sunday afternoon, with officials confirming the boys were found in good health. This positive resolution brings relief following a period of intense searching and public concern for their well-being.</p>

Despite ethical concerns from international bodies, Luckey asserts that "smart weapons" are preferable to "dumb weapons" and ultimately promote peace by deterring adversaries.</p>

          <p>Lourdes, a revered site in southern France, has seen over 70 medical miracles officially recognized by the Catholic Church across 163 years, attracting millions of pilgrims annually. The Lourdes Office of Medical Observations, under Dr. Alessandro de Franciscis, meticulously investigates thousands of reported cures, often over decades. This rigorous process involves world-renowned doctors and researchers who ascertain if recoveries are sudden, complete, lasting, and defy current medical explanation. While some skeptics question the historical scientific rigor, no one has successfully disproven the office's findings, with recent analyses, including one from the University of Arizona, affirming the credibility of their conclusions.</p>

          <p>A homeowner's association (HOA) issued a warning to a resident for charging a Tesla in their driveway using the vehicle's standard Level 1 cable, not due to the electric vehicle itself, but because of the perceived "ugly" appearance of the extension cord. The HOA's letter cited a rule against "Electrical chords running along the ground," which many online commenters, including an energy engineer, contended was a misinterpretation of the National Electrical Code (NEC 625). This peculiar incident underscores the often-micromanaging tendencies of HOAs and their emphasis on aesthetics, sometimes resulting in questionable enforcement against otherwise compliant and common practices.</p>
