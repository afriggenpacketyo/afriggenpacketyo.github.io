          <p>England's Ben Stokes played a crucial role after Harry Brook's impressive 99 runs during the first Test's third day at Headingley. Stokes dismissed Sai Sudharsan, slowing India's progress and leaving them at 90-2, holding a narrow lead. Brook's innings, marked by aggressive strokes and dropped catches, ended just shy of a century, while Jasprit Bumrah's bowling stood out for India, claiming 5-83. The match remains finely balanced as the threat of drizzle loomed, concluding with India at 96-2, with KL Rahul nearing his half-century, setting the stage for a tense continuation. The article highlights the competitive nature of the game and the significant contributions from both sides. </p>

          <p>Middle Eastern markets largely closed higher on Sunday following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, with Tel Aviv stocks reaching an all-time high amid hopes that Washington's involvement would expedite the conflict's resolution. Saudi Arabia's Tadawul experienced a slight decline, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains, with Bahrain issuing a "work from home mandate" to ensure public safety. Egypt's EGX30 was the region's top performer, closing significantly higher, as analysts suggest the Gulf's call for peaceful resolutions has shielded it from major market turmoil. The article suggests that the market might be pricing in the removal of the Iranian threat.  (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces a delicate diplomatic situation regarding Iran following recent U.S. airstrikes, despite his earlier confidence that President Trump would not intervene. While the UK has not directly endorsed the U.S. action, ministers suggest the outcome aligns with the UK's national interest of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Advanced warning of the U.S. action was given to the UK, but no request for participation was made, raising questions about potential future requests for military support. The legality of any UK involvement has been debated, adding complexity to Starmer's position. </p>

          <h2>Phrases to Avoid and Use for Better Communication with Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 13:03:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to research, using certain phrases can hinder communication with children and trigger defiance. Instead of saying "Because I said so," explaining the decision briefly helps children feel respected, and instead of threats, framing requests positively encourages cooperation. Acknowledging a child's emotions rather than dismissing them fosters trust, and addressing the root cause of difficulty instead of blaming promotes problem-solving. Shifting from punishment to partnership encourages self-reflection and strengthens the parent-child bond. </p>
