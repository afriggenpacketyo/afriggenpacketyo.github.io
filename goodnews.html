          <p>A JetBlue flight arriving from Chicago O'Hare International Airport experienced a minor incident upon landing at Boston Logan International Airport, rolling onto a grassy area adjacent to the runway. No injuries were reported among the passengers or crew, according to the Massachusetts Port Authority. The incident prompted the temporary closure of the runway as officials assessed the aircraft and arranged for passengers to be transported to the terminal by bus. This event is currently under investigation to determine the cause of the aircraft's deviation from the runway during landing.</p>

          <p>The Democratic governors of Illinois, Minnesota, and New York, JB Pritzker, Tim Walz, and Kathy Hochul, respectively, testified before a Republican-led House Oversight Committee to defend their states' immigration policies amidst ongoing protests in Los Angeles over immigration enforcement. The governors criticized President Trump's decision to deploy troops to Los Angeles, with Hochul calling it an "overreach of epic proportions." Republicans on the committee accused the governors of prioritizing undocumented immigrants over the safety of U.S. citizens, while the governors countered that immigration is a federal responsibility. The hearing underscored the deep partisan divide on immigration policy and enforcement.</p>

          <p>Chime, an online banking services provider, successfully priced its initial public offering (IPO) at $27 per share, exceeding expectations and valuing the company at $11.6 billion. The IPO raised approximately $700 million for the company, with existing investors selling an additional $165 million worth of shares. This offering signals a potential revitalization of the fintech IPO market, which has been stagnant due to rising interest rates and valuation adjustments. Chime's stock is set to commence trading under the ticker symbol CHYM, marking a significant milestone for the company and the broader fintech industry (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A new study by LendingTree analyzes tipping habits across the United States, finding that New Hampshire residents tip the most, averaging 16.07% of their spending on food away from home, while Utah residents tip the least, at 4.09%. The study suggests that tipping rates are influenced by how frequently people dine out in each state. Washington D.C. residents spend the most on dining out, at $10,291 per capita in 2023, while nationally, dining out accounted for 56% of Americans' food budgets. The research also touches on the federal minimum wage for tipped workers and the potential impact of the "No Tax on Tips" provision.</p>

          <p>Miriam Haley, a victim of Harvey Weinstein, discussed her decision to testify again in his New York retrial, after his previous sexual assault conviction was overturned. Despite the emotional toll, Haley felt compelled to stand up for herself and the truth after learning about a podcast series aimed at "exonerating" Weinstein. The jury found Weinstein guilty of sexually assaulting Haley, offering her hope that awareness of sexual violence is growing and the myth of the perfect victim is fading. She described the cross-examination by Weinstein's attorney as "offensive" and emphasized that the assault still happened, regardless of the verdict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The presence of the Mexican flag at protests in Los Angeles has sparked debate about allegiance and identity, with some Republicans using it to fuel fears of an "invasion." The author argues that in the American context, the Mexican flag is not solely a nationalist symbol but a reminder of roots and a shared experience between Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants. It serves as a symbol of double-consciousness and a bold articulation of solidarity, especially in the face of immigration enforcement and potential authoritarian violence. The author questions why the protesters' allegiances are held to higher standards than those of an American president.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously ruled in favor of a Georgia family whose home was wrongly raided by the FBI, allowing them to sue for damages under an exception to law enforcement immunity. The court's decision reverses a lower court ruling that had prevented the family from seeking legal recourse. Justice Neil Gorsuch delivered the opinion, setting the stage for the family's case to proceed under the established legal exception.</p>
