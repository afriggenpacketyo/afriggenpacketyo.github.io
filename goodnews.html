          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order creating a new White House task force dedicated to preparing for the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. The group, which includes several cabinet members and senior White House staff, will coordinate security, transportation, and visa processing for the international event. LA28's chair, Casey Wasserman, praised the move as a significant step in planning for what is expected to be the largest Olympic and Paralympic Games ever hosted in the United States.

          <p>A new report from Realtor.com indicates that U.S. home prices are experiencing modest declines in certain regions, creating a divided national market. Cities in the South and West, such as Austin and Miami, are seeing the most significant price drops, driven by an increase in housing inventory from new construction and homes staying on the market longer. Conversely, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to face tight inventory and rising prices. This regional variation highlights how housing supply is the primary factor influencing affordability and market dynamics for potential homebuyers across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Residents of the small Northern California city of Yreka were briefly ordered to shelter in place on Tuesday morning after an industrial accident at a local cement plant released a large dust cloud. The Siskiyou County Sheriff’s Office issued the alert out of an abundance of caution due to the potential hazard of airborne cement particles. The order, which advised residents to stay indoors and turn off air conditioning units, was lifted in less than an hour after the cloud dissipated. Officials have since advised that any settled dust on outdoor surfaces is safe to wash away.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent comments about potential candidates for the next Federal Reserve chair have influenced prediction markets, with Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh emerging as front-runners. In a CNBC interview, Trump spoke favorably of both men, who are known to advocate for lower interest rates, while noting that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is no longer in contention. Wagers on the Kalshi prediction market shifted to give both Hassett and Warsh an equal chance of replacing current chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May 2026. The speculation comes as a vacancy on the Fed's Board of Governors opens up. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Comparing Interest Earnings: A $10,000 3-Month CD vs. a High-Yield Savings Account</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 16:15:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes whether a $10,000 deposit earns more interest in a 3-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account in the current economic climate. While a top high-yield savings account might currently earn slightly more over three months, the difference is negligible. The key distinction is that a CD's rate is fixed and guaranteed, providing certainty in a period where interest rates are expected to fall. A savings account's rate is variable and could decrease, but it offers the crucial benefit of liquidity, as funds are locked away. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article outlines crucial questions for homeowners thinking about taking out a $100,000 Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) in the current financial environment. With high interest rates on other forms of credit, using home equity can be an attractive option. Homeowners should consider the timing and impact of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, as a HELOC's variable rate could make borrowing cheaper over time, though this is not guaranteed. It's also important to compare the flexibility of a HELOC with the rate stability of a fixed-rate home equity loan to determine the best fit for their financial needs. (not investment advice)</p>
