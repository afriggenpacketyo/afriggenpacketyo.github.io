          <p>Princess Catherine Hilda Duleep Singh, daughter of the last Maharaja of the Sikh Empire, defied social norms by living openly in a same-sex relationship in 1900s Germany and using her privilege to help Jewish families escape Nazism. Despite facing danger as a brown-skinned, queer woman during Hitler's rise, she remained in Germany and provided financial support, letters of recommendation, and immigration guarantees to those seeking refuge in Britain. Her efforts, largely undocumented during her lifetime, have been recognized posthumously, with her actions saving numerous families from persecution. A Kensington Palace exhibition titled "Princesses of Resistance" will showcase Catherine and her sisters' contributions in March 2026. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book, *The Family Dynamic* by Susan Dominus, explores how sibling relationships, including birth order and achievements, influence a person's life trajectory. Studies suggest that eldest children may perform better on cognitive tests, potentially due to increased parental attention early in life, while siblings often spur each other to pursue different fields. Age gaps between siblings can also impact their relationships, as younger siblings may model their interests on a mix of their older siblings' influences. Siblings serve as vivid mirrors, reflecting both positive and negative traits, and challenging each other's flaws, which ultimately fosters a deeper understanding and acceptance. </p>

          <p>Former German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock is nominated to become the next president of the United Nations General Assembly for a one-year term starting in September. Baerbock's nomination, while unopposed, caused some internal friction, as Germany had initially intended to nominate diplomat Helga Schmid for the position. During her tenure as Foreign Minister, Baerbock advocated for a "value-based foreign policy," often taking assertive stances on human rights and democratic freedoms, which sometimes led to diplomatic challenges. Despite these challenges, she remained a strong supporter of military aid to Ukraine and attempted to enact a more "feminist" foreign policy. </p>

          <p>Richie Mo'unga, the man-of-the-match in the Japan Rugby League One final, credited teammate Michael Leitch for helping him adjust to life in Japan, leading to Brave Lupus Tokyo's victory over Kubota Spears. Mo'unga, visibly emotional, likened Leitch, Brave Lupus's captain and Japan's 2019 Rugby World Cup skipper, to a "big brother" whose influence was felt throughout the club. Coach Todd Blackadder highlighted the joint leadership of Mo'unga and Leitch as the foundation for Brave Lupus's success, making them the first two-time champions in the League One era. Leitch praised Mo'unga for embracing life in Fuchu and showing his love for the club through his performance. </p>

          <p>The government is set to announce the creation of the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) to remodel the UK's flight paths, many of which were established around 70 years ago. This modernization effort aims to fast-track the redesign of these routes, potentially leading to quicker flights and fewer delays for passengers. The initial focus of the shake-up will be on modernizing the complex airspace in and around London. However, the plans have raised concerns from community aviation groups, such as Cagne, which warns that new flight paths could affect previously unaffected residential areas. </p>

          <p>An Indian man was arrested at Mumbai airport for attempting to smuggle 47 venomous vipers, along with other rare reptiles, into the country from Thailand. The reptiles, including spider-tailed horned vipers, Asian leaf turtles, and Indonesian pit vipers, were found concealed in the man's checked-in luggage. While importing animals is not illegal, India's wildlife protection law bans the import of certain species, particularly those classified as endangered or protected. The passenger did not have the required permits and licenses, leading to his arrest and the seizure of the reptiles. </p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are spearheading a decade-long collaboration with 34 Southeast Asian research teams to create the first comprehensive genomic atlas of the region, the SEA3K data set. The project aims to rectify the historical oversight of Southeast Asia's genetic diversity in the Human Genome Project, which largely overlooked the region despite its large indigenous population. The study revealed unique genetic adaptations to tropical challenges and distinct Denisovan ancestry linked to Russia's far east. Researchers collected samples from populations covering six countries, five language families, and 30 ethnic languages, completing genome sequencing for over 3,000 cases. </p>
