          <p>European Union foreign ministers are considering several new measures to increase support for Ukraine and pressure Russia, as the conflict continues with no clear end in sight. Key proposals being discussed include imposing secondary sanctions on Russia's trading partners and establishing facilities for Ukrainian arms production on EU soil to create a 'safe haven' from attacks. Additionally, there are renewed debates about seizing frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Ukraine's reconstruction and potentially moving EU military training missions onto Ukrainian territory after a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys icon Michael Irvin has publicly condemned the team's decision to trade star pass rusher Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers. Irvin expressed his shock and called the move a significant gamble, suggesting that a personal issue must have prompted owner Jerry Jones to approve the deal. The trade, which sent Parsons to Green Bay for two first-round picks and a defensive lineman, concluded a period of tense contract negotiations that failed to result in an extension for the highly effective player.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>One of the world's largest kelp restoration projects has achieved remarkable success off the coast of Southern California by systematically removing millions of kelp-devouring purple sea urchins. Led by The Bay Foundation, divers armed with hammers have cleared over 80 acres of seafloor, allowing the vital underwater forests to rebound rapidly. This effort has helped restore a critical marine habitat that supports hundreds of species, stores carbon, and protects the coastline, demonstrating a viable method for reversing ecological damage caused by ecosystem imbalances.</p>

          <p>The Powerball grand prize has climbed to an estimated $1.1 billion, marking the fifth-largest jackpot in the game's history, after no ticket matched all six numbers in Saturday night's drawing. While no one claimed the top prize, nine tickets won $1 million each by matching the five white balls, and three other tickets won $2 million with the Power Play option. The next drawing on Monday night offers a winner the choice of an annuity paid over 30 years or a lump-sum cash payment of approximately $498.4 million before taxes.</p>

          <p>Musician John Fogerty is releasing "John's Version" of his iconic Creedence Clearwater Revival songs after a long and painful legal battle to regain control of his own music.

          <p>This week marks the tenth anniversary of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel's famous declaration, "wir schaffen das" ("we can do it"), as she opened the country's borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees. The policy, prompted by conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq, led to profound and lasting changes in German society and politics. A decade later, the nation is taking stock of both the successes in integration, with many refugees now employed, and the persistent challenges that continue to fuel political debate.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a self-described liberal author makes the case for hunting as a morally complex but more honest and sustainable way to eat meat compared to industrial agriculture. The writer recounts her journey to becoming a hunter, emphasizing the deep connection to the natural world and the immense responsibility that comes with taking an animal's life. The article suggests that the reflexive disdain for hunting from some on the left is misplaced, arguing that hunters are often deeply invested in conservation and wildlife management.</p>
