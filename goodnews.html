          <h2>Study Suggests Pigs May Have Been Domesticated in China as Early as Neolithic Period</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 21:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research by archaeologists from Chinese and US institutes suggests that pigs were already domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago. The team analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region, finding that pigs were eating humans' cooked foods and waste. The findings suggest the domestication process of Sus scrofa occurred alongside the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles. This challenges the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East, adding a new perspective to the history of animal domestication. The optimism score is high, reflecting the positive contribution to historical knowledge.</p>

          <p>Patrick Reed made an albatross, a rare score in golf, during the first round of the US Open by holing his second shot on the par-5 fourth hole. This marks just the fourth albatross at the US Open since record-keeping began in 1983. Despite the albatross, Reed finished the round at 3-over 73 after a triple bogey on the final hole. The shot provided a moment of excitement and historical significance in the tournament, but his overall performance was mixed. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the excitement of the rare feat tempered by the challenges of the tournament.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are proceeding with overseas expansion to ensure survival amid Trump's tariffs, as production abroad is key to their long-term viability. Despite a US-China truce in the tariff war, solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the US remain subject to high tariffs. Chinese firms are diversifying their production base, with nearly 80% of their planned overseas capacity expansion in the Middle East and Africa. This shift reflects the industry's need to localize production abroad to overcome trade barriers. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the adaptability of businesses despite trade tensions.

Spaun had four birdies in his opening eight holes, achieving the only bogey-free round. The notoriously difficult Pennsylvania course is hosting a record-extending 10th US Open, with dry weather forecast to make it even tougher. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the competitive nature of the sport and the challenges faced by top players. </p>

          <p>A "Trojan horse" therapy that sneaks toxic drugs inside cancer cells is being made available on the NHS in England in a world first. The therapy, called belantamab mafodotin, can halt the blood cancer myeloma for nearly three times longer than current therapies. The drug is an advanced form of chemotherapy that hits cancer with a bigger dose, while reducing side-effects. Clinical trials showed the therapy halted the cancer for three years, compared to 13 months with current therapies. The optimism score is high, reflecting the potential for improved cancer treatment and patient outcomes.</p>
