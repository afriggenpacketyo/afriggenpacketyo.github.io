        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple has introduced a significant architectural change with its new A19 Pro chip, integrating neural accelerators into each GPU core to enhance on-device AI processing. This move, featured in the new iPhone Air, gives Apple control over all core chips in its phones, including its first custom wireless chip (N1) and a new modem (C1X). Company executives state this vertical integration allows for greater efficiency, responsiveness, and privacy by keeping more AI workloads on the device rather than in the cloud. The new design aims to make the iPhone the premier platform for developers running AI applications. (not investment advice)</p>

In a Fox News interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as probable partners in the deal, describing them as "American patriots." The sale is mandated by a 2024 law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. arm over national security concerns regarding user data. The White House has suggested a deal could be finalized in the coming days. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After catching Mike Trout's 400th career home run ball, a fan named Alberto received a memorable experience in addition to signed memorabilia. In exchange for the milestone ball, Alberto was given three signed bats and two signed baseballs from the Los Angeles Angels superstar. He then made a unique request to play catch with Trout on the field, which the three-time MVP happily obliged. The home run made Trout the 59th player in MLB history to reach the 400-homer milestone.</p>

          <p>Washington Nationals center fielder Jacob Young made two spectacular defensive plays to help defeat the New York Mets in a crucial game for the NL wild-card race. In the fifth inning, Young made a juggling, "hacky-sack" style catch at the wall, kicking the ball back into the air with his foot to secure the out. He followed this in the ninth inning with a leaping grab to rob Francisco Álvarez of a potential game-tying home run. The 3-2 victory for the Nationals created a tie with the Cincinnati Reds for the final National League wildcard spot.</p>

          <p>South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung has indicated he would accept a deal where North Korea agrees to freeze its nuclear weapons program as a realistic interim step. In an interview with the BBC, Lee described a freeze as a "feasible, realistic alternative" to the stalled long-term goal of complete denuclearization, noting that Pyongyang is producing numerous new weapons annually. He expressed hope that former President Trump could resume talks with Kim Jong Un, suggesting the two leaders share a "degree of mutual trust" that could be beneficial for regional and global security.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a £2.2 billion project to build a second runway at London Gatwick Airport, a move the government views as a "no-brainer for growth." The plan involves converting the airport's existing northern runway for regular use, which could increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000. While the airport projects a boost in jobs and the local economy, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental campaigners and local groups concerned about increased noise, traffic, and climate emissions.</p>

          <p>A security camera at a high school in Summersville, West Virginia, captured the startling moment the school principal, James Marsh, discovered a black bear inside a locked dumpster. As Marsh went to unlock the bin, the bear's snout emerged from under the lid, causing him to quickly retreat while the bear climbed out and ran off. The incident serves as a public safety reminder about securing food and trash to prevent attracting wildlife into urban areas, as shrinking habitats can lead to more frequent and potentially dangerous human-animal encounters.</p>

          <p>A 93rd-minute goal from Gabriel Martinelli allowed Arsenal to salvage a 1-1 draw against Manchester City in a crucial Premier League match. Manchester City had taken an early lead through Erling Haaland and adopted an unusually defensive 5-5-0 formation in the second half to protect their advantage. City manager Pep Guardiola's tactical gamble almost succeeded, but Martinelli's late goal denied them the victory. The result benefits league leaders Liverpool, who now hold a five-point advantage at the top of the table.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris managed to gain only six points on his McLaren teammate and championship rival Oscar Piastri at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, a weekend where Piastri had an uncharacteristically poor performance.

Despite the small gain, Norris denied it was a missed opportunity, blaming his qualifying result on track conditions. The results allowed Red Bull's Max Verstappen to close the gap in the championship standings with a dominant victory.</p>
