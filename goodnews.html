          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris made her Met Gala debut, emphasizing the intersection of art and politics in an interview with Vogue. Harris wore a black-and-white Off-White gown designed by IB Kamara, aligning with the gala's theme, "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style." This appearance follows Harris's first major public speech since her 2024 presidential defeat, where she criticized President Trump's economic agenda.

          <p>The New York Knicks mounted a stunning comeback, overcoming a 20-point deficit to defeat the Boston Celtics 108-105 in overtime in Game 1 of their NBA Playoffs series.

The Celtics struggled with their three-point shooting, missing a playoff-record 45 attempts, and Kristaps Porzingis' absence in the second half due to illness further hampered their efforts. The game was a back-and-forth affair, with the Knicks using their fourth-quarter momentum to secure the win in overtime, setting the stage for a competitive series.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed a $7.5 billion federal film tax credit in response to President Trump's call for tariffs on movies produced overseas. The proposal aims to support the entertainment industry and retain film and television production in the United States. This initiative follows Trump's social media post advocating for a 100 percent tariff on films produced outside the country, causing confusion and concern in Hollywood. Senator Adam Schiff is also working on a federal film incentive proposal, reflecting bipartisan efforts to address the challenges faced by the industry due to international competition.</p>

The ruling favors Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs, stating that not counting challenged ballots would violate voters' due process rights. The case, which has been ongoing for months, tested the boundaries of post-election litigation and raised concerns about future attempts to overturn election results. The judge's decision allows for a seven-day appeal period, but if it stands, it will bring closure to the drawn-out election dispute.</p>
