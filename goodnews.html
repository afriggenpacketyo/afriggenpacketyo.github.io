          <p>In a pivotal election viewed as a choice between closer ties with the European Union or Russia, Moldova's pro-Western Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) has won a decisive parliamentary majority. With most votes counted, the PAS secured over 50% of the vote, defeating pro-Russian challengers and ensuring it can govern without forming a coalition. This outcome is a significant victory for President Maia Sandu, who founded the party, and strengthens the nation's path toward EU integration. The election took place amid allegations of extensive Russian interference, including cyberattacks and vote-buying schemes aimed at destabilizing the country.</p>

          <p>Shares of Sony Financial Group jumped nearly 16% on their first day of trading following the unit's spin-off from parent company Sony Group. The successful debut valued the financial arm, which includes insurance and banking services, at over $6.7 billion, allowing it to raise its own capital independently. This development occurred as broader Asian markets showed mixed results, with Japan's Nikkei 225 declining while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 and South Korea's Kospi both posted gains. The spin-off reflects Sony's strategy to focus on its core entertainment and semiconductor businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing number of young Americans are choosing careers in skilled trades like plumbing and electrical work over pursuing a college degree, driven by high tuition costs and the increasing threat of artificial intelligence to entry-level white-collar jobs. A recent survey found that 42% of Gen Zers are either working in or considering a blue-collar career, a path that offers job security and entrepreneurial opportunities. Experts note that the stigma associated with trade jobs is diminishing as recent college graduates face higher unemployment rates, partly due to AI automating tasks previously done by junior employees.</p>

          <p>Hunan has become the latest Chinese province to reform its regulations on non-tax revenue, aiming to reduce the financial burden on private businesses and boost market confidence. The new rules, effective November 1, explicitly forbid local officials from using fines as a tool to generate revenue and require proceeds from confiscated goods to be sent to the state treasury. This move is part of a broader effort by Beijing to crack down on arbitrary fees and penalties, which have been increasing as some local governments seek alternative income sources amid a decline in land sales and a slowing economy.</p>

          <p>Advanced medical technologies and new surgical protocols are saving the lives and limbs of hundreds of Israeli soldiers who have sustained severe injuries during the war in Gaza. Innovations include drones that deliver whole blood directly to the battlefield and portable devices that generate oxygen, significantly improving emergency care. Surgeons have also developed novel techniques, such as immediately operating on mangled limbs alongside life-threatening internal injuries, a departure from traditional protocols. These wartime medical advances, which are being shared with institutions like the Mayo Clinic, are credited with saving soldiers who would not have survived in previous conflicts.</p>

          <h2>Experts Recommend Starting Light Therapy in Autumn to Combat Seasonal Depression</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-29 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals who experience seasonal affective disorder (SAD) or the milder "winter blues," experts suggest beginning bright light therapy in the fall to preempt symptoms. Using a 10,000-lux light box for about 30 minutes each morning helps reset the body's internal clock, which can be disrupted by diminishing daylight. Research indicates that this therapy can be as effective as antidepressant medications in alleviating symptoms of seasonal depression and shows benefits within a week of starting. Psychiatrists note that light therapy is an underrecognized treatment option that can improve mood and energy levels as the darker months approach.</p>

          <p>In a story from the "My Unsung Hero" series, a woman named Tanya Eby recounts a difficult period in sixth grade when she felt abandoned by her friends and family. After her brother was sent to live with her father and her stepfather left, her friend group also ostracized her, leaving her feeling completely alone. Overwhelmed with grief, she broke down in class, and her teacher, Mrs. Welch, pulled her aside, listened to her story, and gave her a comforting hug. Eby recalls that this small, empathetic gesture rooted her and made her feel that she would be okay, a lesson in kindness that has influenced her own career as a college teacher.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international team of researchers is advocating for official recognition of a distinct form of diabetes, proposing the name "Type 5 diabetes." First observed in Jamaica in the 1950s, this type primarily affects thin, undernourished individuals in impoverished regions who do not fit the typical profiles of Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. These patients produce some insulin but not enough, and standard insulin treatments can be lethal due to the risk of dangerously low blood sugar. By formally naming and classifying the disease, which could affect millions, researchers hope to galvanize further study and develop appropriate diagnostic and treatment guidelines.</p>

Under the plan, young people who have been out of work or education for 18 months will be offered a guaranteed paid work placement. Those who refuse the offer without a valid reason could face sanctions, including the loss of their benefits. The scheme, which will be detailed in the November budget, builds on a previous "youth guarantee" and will be funded from existing budgets, with the government expecting private companies to help cover wages for the placements.</p>

          <p>New research on the ancient Sanxingdui ruins in southwestern China indicates that an internal conflict likely caused the destruction of the city and a mass exodus of its population. An academic director at the Sanxingdui Research Institute suggests that a war for control of the capital occurred during the civilization's later period. Evidence of this conflict includes destroyed city walls, altered water systems, and the disappearance of key religious sites. Sanxingdui, dating back about 4,500 years, is one of China's most significant archaeological finds, offering insights into the mysterious Shu kingdom and early Chinese civilization.</p>

          <p>The new Netflix series "House of Guinness," a period drama about the famous brewing family, has used Penrhyn Castle in North Wales as a stand-in for the family's 19th-century home in Ireland. Created by Steven Knight of "Peaky Blinders" fame, the show chronicles the lives of the four children of Sir Benjamin Guinness after his death in 1868. Producers chose locations in north Wales and England's North West because very little of modern Dublin resembles its 19th-century counterpart. Penrhyn Castle was selected for its architectural parallels to the original Guinness family home, Ashford Castle.</p>
