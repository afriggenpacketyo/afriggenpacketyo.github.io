          <p>A Colorado nonprofit, The Women's Foundation of Colorado, is working to empower women graduates and close the gender wage gap. According to Zip Recruiter, women earn an average of 93% of what men earn upon graduating. The Women's Foundation of Colorado emphasizes transparency in pay ranges and job descriptions to improve pay equity. The Equal Pay for Equal Work Act in Colorado, passed in 2019, has helped increase women's earnings by nearly $3,000 a year since going into effect in 2021. The article emphasizes the importance of transparency and open communication about pay among workers to identify and address unequal payments. </p>

          <p>A review of the film *Ballerina*, a spin-off from the *John Wick* franchise, argues that the movie succeeds when it expands the *Wick* universe rather than focusing solely on its protagonist. The film follows Eve Macarro, played by Ana de Armas, as she seeks revenge for her father's murder. While the initial acts of the film feel like a clone of *John Wick*, the movie improves when Eve's journey leads her to a cultish village in the Austrian Alps, showcasing the bizarre world-building that is characteristic of the *John Wick* series. The article also notes the film's inventive stunts and action sequences. </p>
