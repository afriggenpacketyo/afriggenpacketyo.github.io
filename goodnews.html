          <p>Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has announced his intention to nominate Donald Trump for a second Nobel Peace Prize, citing Trump's role in brokering a ceasefire and hostage agreement between Israel and Hamas. This follows a previous nomination from Pakistan for Trump's efforts in de-escalating tensions with India. Speaking in Egypt, Sharif praised Trump's leadership as essential for global peace, particularly highlighting his contributions to saving lives in both South Asia and the Middle East. The announcement was made at a summit where world leaders gathered to sign the Gaza peace deal documents.</p>

          <p>Alma Cocina Latina, a restaurant in Baltimore, is introducing diners to the unique flavors of Venezuelan cuisine through a concept its founder, Irena Stein, calls "culinary diplomacy." The restaurant's distinctive taste is rooted in specific Venezuelan peppers, such as ají dulce, which are difficult to source in the U.S. and are now being grown locally by a Maryland farmer. The chefs emphasize that these fragrant, fruity peppers are the essential base of their food, creating an authentic cultural and culinary experience. The goal is to share the rich, diverse history of Venezuelan migrations and flavors with the city.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite significant losses in the last general election and a period of leadership instability, the Scottish National Party (SNP) is showing signs of a political recovery. Under the stabilizing leadership of John Swinney, the party's support has improved while its rivals, particularly Labour, have seen their backing splinter. Recent polling analysis suggests the SNP could be close to winning a majority in the Scottish Parliament, a key goal for their strategy to push for another independence referendum. The party's resilience is partly attributed to the near 50/50 split on the constitutional question in Scotland, providing a consistent base of potential support.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-13 18:02:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a new law designed to simplify the insurance claims process for residents who lose their homes in catastrophic wildfires. Under the legislation, victims can now receive up to $350,000, or 60% of their personal property coverage, without having to create a detailed, itemized list of their lost possessions. The law also extends the deadline for submitting such lists, aiming to reduce the burden on survivors dealing with the trauma of a total loss. This change addresses a major inefficiency that often delayed urgently needed financial support for fire victims in declared states of emergency.</p>

          <p>As Beijing prepares its 15th five-year plan, the economic relationship between mainland China and Taiwan is evolving, with a focus on high-tech industrial collaboration. A recent delegation of Taiwanese executives, including from major firms like Delta Electronics, visited mainland electric vehicle manufacturers to explore potential partnerships. This highlights a shift from Taiwan's traditional investment in the mainland to a more specialized role, supplying advanced components to leading Chinese industries. The new five-year plan is expected to further shape these cross-strait economic dynamics, creating new opportunities and implications for both economies.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump, alongside leaders from Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey, has signed a declaration aimed at bringing peace to Gaza, calling it the "dawn of a new Middle East." The signing, which took place at a summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, coincided with the first phase of the peace plan: the release of all living Israeli hostages by Hamas in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. In an earlier address to the Israeli Knesset, Trump declared that the "long and painful nightmare is finally over." The next phase of the plan will focus on negotiations for the rebuilding of Gaza.</p>

The company stated these positions will pay an average of over $19 an hour. Amazon's large-scale hiring contrasts with projections for the overall retail sector, which is expected to see its lowest level of seasonal hiring since 2009 due to higher costs and increased automation.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's role in brokering a ceasefire in Gaza has culminated in a major diplomatic summit in Egypt, serving as a victory lap for his administration. The event, attended by numerous world leaders, celebrated the end of two years of war and was framed by Trump as achieving the "impossible." This success builds on the Abraham Accords from his first term and shifts focus to the challenging next phase: the disarmament of Hamas and the reconstruction of Gaza. While the deal is a significant achievement, analysts note that long-term peace depends on sustained international engagement and resolving the underlying Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks recovered on Monday following a sharp decline last Friday, after President Trump adopted a more conciliatory tone regarding trade tensions with China.

However, over the weekend, Trump suggested on social media that "all will be fine," easing investor fears of an escalating trade war. The rebound erased some of Friday's losses, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both seeing significant gains as market focus shifts towards the upcoming earnings season.

          <p>A U.S. Air Force A-10C Warthog has been photographed with kill markings indicating it has successfully shot down two Shahed-type drones. The aircraft, part of a squadron returning from a deployment in the Middle East, likely used laser-guided rockets in an air-to-air capacity, a recently developed capability for the platform. This new role leverages the A-10's ability to fly low and slow, making it effective against certain types of unmanned aerial systems. The development represents a new mission for the aging attack jet, which is scheduled to be retired from service by 2026.</p>
