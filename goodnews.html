          <p>The World Athletics Championships have commenced in Tokyo, marking a return to large-scale sporting events in the city four years after the pandemic-affected Olympics. However, the event is accompanied by significant controversy surrounding the reintroduction of mandatory genetic testing for female athletes. World Athletics requires athletes in the female category to undergo an SRY gene test to detect a Y chromosome, a policy critics argue is unreliable and discriminatory. The federation defends the rule as necessary to protect the integrity of women's sports, but it has sparked debate and criticism.</p>

During a meeting chaired by Premier Li Qiang, the government emphasized creating a fair and competitive market environment where private enterprises can invest with confidence. The plan includes expanding investment opportunities in key sectors like new infrastructure and emerging services. The government also intends to increase financial support through central budget allocations and reserve a portion of government procurement contracts for small and medium-sized enterprises.

          <p>Artificial intelligence startup OpenAI has become a major driver of growth in the tech industry, with its massive spending on cloud computing and hardware benefiting several large companies. Oracle recently saw a historic stock surge after revealing a multi-billion dollar contract with OpenAI, which is reportedly committing to spend $300 billion on computing power over five years. This spending spree has also significantly boosted companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Broadcom. However, some analysts express concern over the market's heavy reliance on a single, cash-burning startup. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Obtaining the latest COVID-19 vaccine has become more complex, as the FDA has narrowed approval to specific high-risk groups, including individuals 65 and older and those with certain medical conditions. This change from previous universal eligibility means many younger, healthy individuals may be turned away at pharmacies. To get a shot, people may need to "self-attest" to having a risk factor, which includes a broad range of conditions like asthma, diabetes, and even depression. The CDC is expected to issue further recommendations soon, which could clarify insurance coverage and accessibility for the public.</p>

          <p>Energy Secretary Chris Wright has officially dissolved the department's Climate Working Group, a panel of scientists known for questioning the consensus on climate change. The group produced a report that was heavily criticized by independent scientists for containing errors and misrepresenting climate science. The disbandment follows a lawsuit filed by environmental organizations, which alleged the group was formed in secret and violated federal law. The controversial report had been used by the Trump administration to support efforts to roll back regulations on climate pollution.</p>

          <h2>Financial Guidance Offered for Managing a Sudden Large Inheritance</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals receiving a significant inheritance, financial experts recommend a structured approach to managing the windfall. The first steps should be to pay off all existing debts and establish a substantial emergency fund for financial security. Following that, the remaining capital should be invested in a diversified portfolio to limit risk and minimize costs. A common strategy, endorsed by Warren Buffett, is to allocate a large portion to a broad market index fund like the S&P 500, with the remainder in safer assets like short-term government bonds.

          <p>California lawmakers have approved a bill that would permit state colleges and universities to offer preferential admission to applicants who can prove they are descended from individuals enslaved in the U.S. The legislation is part of a broader package of bills aimed at addressing the legacy of slavery and systemic racism. Supporters argue the bill is narrowly tailored to focus on lineage, not race, to comply with California's ban on affirmative action. If signed, it would establish a process for verifying lineage and could set a precedent for reparations-related policies.</p>

          <p>The German language is experiencing a surge in popularity in Turkey, second only to English, as more young people see it as a pathway to better opportunities.

Education experts note a significant trend of top high school graduates choosing to attend German universities over Turkish ones.

          <p>A strong earthquake with a magnitude of 7.4 struck off the east coast of Russia's Kamchatka region early Saturday. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake's epicenter was located about 112 kilometers east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky at a relatively shallow depth. There were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries from the sparsely populated region. The Pacific Tsunami Warning System initially issued a threat advisory but later canceled it, though Japan's meteorological agency noted the possibility of minor sea level changes along its coasts.</p>

          <p>As generative AI tools like ChatGPT become widely used by teenagers for everything from homework to personal advice, child development experts are urging parents to engage in open conversations about the technology. They recommend that parents learn about AI themselves and explore it alongside their children to discuss its benefits and limitations. While AI can be a helpful learning aid, it also poses risks, such as providing inaccurate information or unsafe responses to mental health queries. Establishing household rules and setting limits are key strategies for navigating this new technological landscape.</p>

          <p>A growing number of smaller colleges are adding or reviving football programs as a strategy to increase overall enrollment, particularly among male students. With women now outnumbering men at four-year colleges nationwide, administrators hope that the sport and its associated campus spirit will attract more men. For example, Roanoke College in Virginia brought back its team after an 82-year hiatus and saw its incoming freshman class become majority male. While research suggests these enrollment gains may be temporary, schools see it as a viable tool to address declining student populations.</p>

The court found that the company removed her account, which had over five million followers, without clear justification and applied its content moderation policies inconsistently compared to similar accounts. The ruling states that social media posts are protected under the Colombian constitution. Meta has been ordered to review its policies to provide clearer mechanisms for users to challenge moderation decisions and to better define its rules.</p>
