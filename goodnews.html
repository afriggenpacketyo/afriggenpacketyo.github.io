          <p>Ethan Mbappe, 18, is determined to forge his own distinct path in professional football with Lille, striving to emerge from the significant shadow of his globally renowned brother, Kylian Mbappe. Both previously played for Paris St-Germain, but Ethan's contract was not renewed following Kylian's high-profile move to Real Madrid, a decision Kylian controversially linked to his own departure. Despite the immense pressure associated with his famous surname, Ethan is widely praised for his innate football intelligence, composure on the ball, and precise passing ability. He made five appearances for PSG and is now focused on making a significant impact with Lille, particularly as he prepares to play against his former club, marking a pivotal moment in his burgeoning career.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United has undergone a significant transformation since its 2021 Saudi-led takeover, evolving from a club battling relegation to one that has won a major domestic trophy and qualified for the Champions League. Despite being labeled the richest club, financial regulations, specifically Profit and Sustainability Rules, have necessitated a more strategic and gradual build-up of the team, rather than immediate, unchecked spending. The article highlights substantial improvements to the training facilities and team performance under manager Eddie Howe, though challenges like missed transfer targets and the absence of a sporting director persist. This period marks a complex evolution for the club, balancing on-field success and commercial growth with persistent scrutiny over its Saudi ownership and related human rights concerns.</p>

          <p>China is strategically deploying a new digital public diplomacy initiative in Africa, specifically targeting Gen Z and Millennials through social media influencers and content creators. The Chinese embassy in Kenya is sponsoring prominent local influencers to embark on extensive tours of China, allowing them to document and promote the country's striking scenery, rich culture, diverse history, and unique cuisine. This innovative approach represents a significant evolution in Beijing's "soft power" efforts, moving beyond traditional state-led communication to foster direct engagement and cultural exchange with younger African audiences. Experts believe this strategy is poised to have a greater impact, effectively reshaping China's public image and offering perspectives often absent in conventional news reports.</p>

          <p>The German government, under Chancellor Friedrich Merz, is rapidly advancing its integration of artificial intelligence into public administration to streamline bureaucracy and expand online services. Notable projects include an AI-powered platform for export businesses and the use of AI to accelerate visa processing. Digitalization Minister Karsten Wildberger stresses that AI is crucial for future economic growth, warning Germany risks being left behind without swift adoption. While innovations like the "Weimatar" AI avatar aim to enhance public communication, experts like Holger Hoos advise prioritizing science-guided, problem-specific AI solutions over generative AI hype. Concerns persist regarding data protection, ethical oversight, and potential dependency on non-EU technology, despite the strong push for digital modernization.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Trump's attempt to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland, ruling that his justification for the deployment was "untethered to the facts." U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut issued a 14-day restraining order, stating that protests in Portland were not violent enough to warrant such military intervention without the governor's approval. The judge emphasized the foundational tradition of resistance to military intrusion into civil affairs, warning against blurring the lines between civil and military rule. Oregon officials, including Governor Tina Kotek and Attorney General Dan Rayfield, celebrated the ruling as a victory for state sovereignty and a "wake-up call" for the President.</p>
