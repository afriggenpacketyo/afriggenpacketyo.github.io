          <p>Shares of Block Inc. experienced a significant 7% jump after S&P Global announced the company would join the S&P 500 index, replacing Hess. The inclusion prompted a surge in buying from investors and index funds, which are expected to purchase approximately 101 million shares to align their portfolios. This development comes as Block works to rebuild investor confidence following inconsistent performance from its Cash App business, while competitor Robinhood was notably passed over for inclusion.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners needing $20,000, home equity loans and HELOCs offer lower interest rates than personal loans or credit cards. Currently, the average HELOC rate is marginally cheaper at 8.27% compared to a home equity loan's 8.28%, resulting in nearly identical monthly payments. However, HELOC rates are variable and subject to change with market conditions, while home equity loan rates are fixed, offering more stability for borrowers concerned about potential rate hikes.

          <p>Trump Media and Technology Group announced it has accumulated approximately $2 billion in bitcoin and related digital assets, which now constitute about two-thirds of the company's liquid assets. This pivot to cryptocurrency has significantly increased President Donald Trump's personal net worth, with his stake in the company valued at nearly $2.3 billion. The move aligns with his administration's goal to make the U.S. a crypto capital, though critics raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest and corruption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, short-term CDs are offering higher interest rates than long-term ones, making them an attractive option for parking significant sums like $20,000. These CDs can provide protection against market fluctuations amid concerns over inflation and economic policy, allowing savers to earn a fixed rate while gauging the future outlook. However, investors should recognize that long-term CDs may yield more interest over time and that the best rates are often found at online banks rather than traditional institutions.

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the withdrawal of approximately 700 active-duty Marines who were deployed to Los Angeles earlier in the summer in response to protests over immigration policies. The deployment, intended to protect federal property, was a rare use of active-duty troops within a U.S. city and was contested by California's governor. With the protests having largely subsided, the Marines will return home, though about 2,000 federalized National Guard members will remain in the area for now.</p>

          <p>For homeowners aged 62 and older, a reverse mortgage can be a particularly useful financial tool in the current economic climate. This option allows seniors to receive payments from their home equity without the burden of immediate repayment, providing a steady income stream to supplement Social Security or cover rising costs due to inflation. Unlike other loans, it doesn't require monthly repayments in today's high-interest-rate environment, and qualification can be simpler than for other large-scale funding sources.

To qualify, individuals generally must meet three key requirements. They need a steady, sufficient income to make consistent monthly payments, have a manageable amount of unsecured debt (like credit cards or personal loans) within the program's limits, and demonstrate a willingness to commit to the program's rules, which often includes closing credit accounts and participating in financial counseling.
