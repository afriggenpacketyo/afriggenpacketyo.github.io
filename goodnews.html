          <p>Former President Joe Biden has chosen his home state of Delaware as the location for his presidential library and museum. A newly formed foundation, governed by a board of former aides and political allies, will oversee the project's planning and fundraising. The decision affirms Biden's deep political roots in Delaware, where he served as a senator for 36 years. The foundation now faces the significant challenge of raising hundreds of millions of dollars for the legacy project, which aims to be a center for civic leadership and historical reflection.</p>

          <p>A new chapter is beginning at California's Point Reyes national seashore after a landmark deal resulted in the buyout of 12 organic dairy and cattle operations, opening over 16,000 acres for conservation. The Nature Conservancy is leading a five-year restoration effort, which will controversially use new herds of cattle for targeted grazing to remove invasive plants and help native species recover. While the transition is seen as a major environmental victory by some, it has created tension within the local community over the loss of multigenerational ranches and the region's organic dairy supply.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics and their families participated in an official Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome, marking a significant shift toward acceptance within the Catholic Church. A senior Italian bishop celebrated a Mass for the group, emphasizing that the Jubilee is a time to restore dignity to all, especially those who have been denied it. Pilgrims credited the late Pope Francis with fostering this more welcoming environment, contrasting it with the feeling of being shunned during the last Holy Year 25 years ago, and expressed hope that Pope Leo will continue this legacy.</p>

          <p>In response to new state mandates and growing concerns over classroom distractions, school districts across the U.S. are implementing systems like Yondr pouches to ban cellphone use during school hours. These magnetic pouches are locked at the school entrance and unlocked upon exit, requiring students to keep their phones inaccessible throughout the day. While educators report an increase in student engagement and conversation, the policy has received mixed reactions from students, some of whom have tried to find ways to circumvent the system.</p>

          <p>China is extending its long-running anti-corruption campaign into the financial and stock market sectors, a move that an analyst suggests could foster a cleaner governance path over the long term. While the crackdown may not immediately improve investor confidence amid current economic uncertainties, it aligns with the demands of international institutions for transparent government. This sustained effort could ultimately help attract more overseas investment by creating a more predictable and trustworthy financial environment. (not investment advice)</p>
