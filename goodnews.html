          <p>Meta and Microsoft both reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, causing their stock prices to jump significantly and pushing Microsoft's market capitalization past $4 trillion. The strong performance is largely attributed to their massive investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure, with both companies planning to increase capital expenditures further. This spending is seen as a major benefit for chipmakers like AMD and Broadcom, though some analysts express caution about the sheer scale of Meta's aggressive AI spending and hiring blitz.

          <p>Comcast reported second-quarter revenue and earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates, leading to a rise in its stock price. Despite this positive financial performance, the company continued to lose broadband customers due to intense competition from alternative providers like 5G fixed wireless services. To counter this trend, Comcast is successfully leaning on its mobile business, which saw record customer additions, and is encouraged by the early results from a new broadband pricing and marketing strategy. The company's theme parks and film studio divisions also posted strong revenue growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, former Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif advocates for the creation of a peaceful nuclear cooperation network to de-escalate tensions in the Middle East. He proposes an organization, which he calls Menara, that would be open to all regional states that formally reject nuclear weapons. The goal is to foster collaboration on peaceful applications like energy, medicine, and science, thereby building trust and providing an alternative to nuclear brinkmanship. Zarif argues this is essential for regional stability, given the long-standing failure to establish a WMD-free zone.</p>

The book, scheduled for a September release, is being promoted as a candid, behind-the-scenes account of her historic run for the nation's highest office. Harris became the Democratic Party's nominee after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race but was ultimately defeated in the general election by Donald Trump. This will be her second major memoir, following the 2019 publication of "The Truths We Hold."</p>

          <p>Meta's stock surged after the company reported second-quarter revenue of $47.52 billion, a 22% year-over-year increase that comfortably beat analyst expectations. The company's advertising revenue was particularly robust, with performance boosted by new efficiencies gained from its artificial intelligence systems. CEO Mark Zuckerberg also outlined a bold vision for "personal superintelligence" and confirmed a significant investment and hiring push in the AI sector. Despite continued losses in its Reality Labs division, the overall strong financial results and optimistic forecast were very well-received by investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent U.S. legislation, including a major tax package signed by President Trump, will significantly enhance tax-advantaged ABLE savings accounts for individuals with disabilities. A key change, effective in 2026, raises the age of disability onset for eligibility from 26 to 46, opening the program to millions more people, including many veterans. The new laws also make several tax benefits permanent, such as allowing rollovers from 529 college savings plans. These accounts are designed to help people save money without jeopardizing their eligibility for crucial government benefits like Medicaid or SSI.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a trade agreement with South Korea, one of the U.S.'s largest trading partners, just ahead of a major tariff deadline. According to the deal, South Korean goods will face a 15% tariff, which is lower than a previously threatened 25% rate, while U.S. exports to South Korea will be tariff-free. The agreement also includes a commitment from South Korea to invest $350 billion in the U.S. and purchase $100 billion in American energy products.

          <p>An Ohio couple has welcomed a baby boy who was born from an embryo that had been cryopreserved for more than 30 years, which is believed to be a new world record. The embryo was created via IVF in 1994 and was later adopted by Lindsey and Tim Pierce through a Christian embryo adoption agency. The biological donor had used a sibling embryo to have her own daughter three decades ago and chose the recipient couple herself. The previous record was held by twins born in 2022 from embryos that had been frozen for 29 years.</p>

          <p>Survivors of the destructive January wildfires in Los Angeles County are increasingly turning to modular, factory-built homes as a way to rebuild their lives more quickly. This approach allows families who lost everything to bypass some of the lengthy delays and complex paperwork associated with traditional on-site construction. The article highlights the story of a couple who lost their house in the Eaton Fire and chose a prefabricated accessory dwelling unit (ADU) from a local startup. With over 16,000 buildings destroyed, this innovative method offers a faster path to recovery for many displaced residents.</p>

          <p>Figma, the popular collaborative design software company, has priced its initial public offering at $33 per share, valuing the firm at an impressive $19.3 billion. This successful public debut comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was called off in 2023 due to objections from regulators. The IPO, which raised $1.2 billion, is another strong signal for the recovering tech IPO market. Figma has demonstrated significant momentum, with its revenue growing 40% year-over-year in the most recent quarter, according to its prospectus. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Contrary to global trends of declining religious affiliation, young people in India are increasingly connecting with spirituality, but on their own modern terms. India's Gen Z is reportedly less focused on strict religious rituals and more on using spiritual practices, from temple visits to meditation apps, as a tool for mental well-being and finding peace. This trend is amplified by social media, where spiritual content is highly popular, and is also influenced by a political climate that actively promotes Hindu traditions. Experts view it as a key coping mechanism for navigating a chaotic world.</p>

          <p>A new safety index focusing on popular Caribbean destinations has ranked Puerto Rico as one of the safest islands for tourists, placing it at number six overall. The analysis, conducted by a team of travel experts, considered metrics such as crime rates, healthcare quality, and hurricane risk. Puerto Rico received a top score for its U.S.-quality healthcare system. A significant advantage for American travelers is that a passport is not required to visit the island, as it is a U.S. territory. The report named Aruba, Barbados, and Grenada as the top three safest destinations.</p>
