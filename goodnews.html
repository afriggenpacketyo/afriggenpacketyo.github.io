          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer expressed continued confidence in Apple, advising investors not to abandon the company despite its stock lagging behind market averages. He acknowledged current challenges, including tariff impacts from China and a lack of groundbreaking AI announcements, which have dampened investor enthusiasm. However, Cramer emphasized his faith in CEO Tim Cook and pointed to Apple's history of rebounding from tough periods, suggesting such times have historically been excellent buying opportunities. He argued the company's strong earnings growth potential justifies a higher valuation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA has announced that two research aircraft, a P-3 Orion and a King Air B200, will be flying at unusually low altitudes over Southern California for scientific purposes. The flights, part of the Student Airborne Research Program (SARP), will occur between 1,000 and 10,000 feet over the Los Angeles Basin, Salton Sea, and Central Valley. The planes will perform unique maneuvers, such as vertical spirals and simulated missed landings, to sample atmospheric gases and measure land and water surfaces. Officials have advised the public not to be alarmed by the low-flying planes, as they are part of a mission to provide students with real-world research experience.</p>

          <p>Australia claimed a commanding 159-run victory over the West Indies in the first Test match, driven by a powerful performance from bowler Josh Hazlewood. The West Indies team collapsed dramatically in the final session of the third day, losing all ten of their wickets after initially showing promise in their chase of 301 runs. Hazlewood was the key architect of the collapse, taking five wickets for 43 runs and dismantling the hosts' top order. Despite some late resistance, Australia's bowlers wrapped up the match with two full days to spare, showcasing their clinical efficiency.</p>

          <p>Authorities have recaptured Antoine Massey, one of the final two inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in a major jailbreak last month. Massey, 33, was found and arrested in a New Orleans residence after being on the run for six weeks. At the time of his escape, he was incarcerated for domestic abuse battery and other charges. The escape of ten inmates in May prompted a massive manhunt and raised serious questions about the jail's security. One escapee, convicted murderer Derrick Groves, remains at large, with a $50,000 reward offered for information leading to his arrest.</p>

          <p>A team of specialized divers has successfully completed the first human exploration of the SS Nemesis, a steamship that sank during a storm in 1904 off the coast of Sydney, Australia. The wreck, which lies at a depth of 525 feet, was only discovered in 2022, and all 32 people aboard were lost in the disaster. The divers navigated pitch-black conditions to survey and film the ship's remains, documenting its crumbled bow and other features during a brief nine-minute window at the site. The complex and dangerous dive required a six-hour ascent for safe decompression, with future missions planned to create a more detailed scan of the historic wreck.</p>

          <p>A Corona, California man has been sentenced to just over a year in federal prison for tax fraud related to the sale of memorabilia signed by comic book legend Stan Lee. Mac Martin Anderson, 59, admitted to earning over $1.2 million between 2015 and 2018 by selling autographed Marvel items, which he failed to report to the IRS. As part of his sentence, Anderson must also pay $482,833 in restitution for the unpaid taxes. The case highlights the lucrative market for collectibles associated with iconic figures like Lee, the co-creator of beloved characters such as Spider-Man, and the legal consequences of evading tax obligations on such income.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be reached "within the next week," suggesting that negotiations are close to a resolution. The administration has been actively pushing for a pause in the conflict, which began after Hamas's attack on Israel in October 2023 and has led to a devastating humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Previous efforts for a sustained truce have been unsuccessful, with both sides unable to agree on terms for hostage releases and the cessation of hostilities.

The Nasdaq Composite also set an all-time high, driven by a strong rebound in technology stocks.

The order was part of a broader campaign targeting several major law firms perceived as political adversaries, aiming to sanction them by restricting access to federal buildings and affecting their clients. The judge's decision stated the order violated the First and Fifth Amendments and threatened the independence of the legal profession.

Edelman attributes this shift to the maturation of the crypto industry, with major questions about government regulation and institutional adoption now largely resolved. He also argues that the traditional 60/40 stock-and-bond model is obsolete due to increased human longevity, making assets with higher growth potential like Bitcoin essential for long-term financial planning.

          <p>On July 1, minimum wage rates are set to increase in two states, Alaska and Oregon, as well as in Washington, D.C., and twelve other cities and counties. According to the Economic Policy Institute, these hikes will benefit over 800,000 workers, with annual pay for full-time employees rising by an average of $420 in Oregon to $925 in Alaska. These state and local increases stand in contrast to the federal minimum wage, which has remained unchanged at $7.25 per hour since 2009. The adjustments are the result of voter-approved ballot measures and automatic inflation-based formulas designed to keep pace with the rising cost of living.</p>

Manchester United is seeking to bolster its attack, having already signed another forward this summer. Sources suggest Brentford is holding out for a higher upfront fee for Mbeumo, who scored 20 goals last season and has attracted interest from other top clubs.
