          <p>Japan and the United States are planning a summit between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump during the Group of Seven leaders' meeting in Canada in mid-June, with the aim of resolving trade differences. Prior to the summit, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, will visit Washington for further negotiations on Trump's tariffs, seeking to bridge the gap on trade policy. Japan has been pushing for the removal of U.S. tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, but is considering accepting reduced tariff rates as a compromise. Both countries aim to reach a deal swiftly, focusing on boosting investment and creating jobs in the United States while addressing Trump's concerns about the trade deficit.</p>

          <p>A recall on Dr Pepper Zero Sugar has been upgraded by the FDA to Class II due to mislabeling, posing a potential health risk to consumers. Cans labeled as "zero sugar" were found to contain the full amount of sugar present in regular Dr Pepper, approximately 39 grams. The affected cans, produced by Pepsi Beverages Company, were distributed to retailers in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, and have a "best by" date of February 16, 2026. Customers who purchased the mislabeled product are advised to return it for a full refund or discard it, ensuring those who need to avoid sugar are protected.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers, aiming to lower the elevated prices of the country's staple food. The released rice, consisting of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, is expected to be sold at around 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to approximately 100,000 tons, addressing public frustration over soaring rice prices that have doubled compared to the previous year. The government hopes this intervention will alleviate distribution shortages and stabilize the market.</p>

          <p>Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit in bankruptcy court to prevent the sale of personal genetic data by 23andMe without customer consent. The lawsuit arises as a biotechnology company seeks court approval to purchase the financially troubled 23andMe. The states argue that biological samples, DNA data, and medical records are too sensitive to be sold without explicit, informed consent from each individual. This legal action underscores the growing concern over the privacy and control of personal genetic information in the face of corporate acquisitions and bankruptcies.</p>

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have seen a significant decline, particularly due to a decrease in fentanyl-related fatalities. Data from the CDC shows a massive reduction in fatal overdose risk among Gen Z, with ages 20 to 29 experiencing a 47% decrease. This shift is attributed to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less deadly fentanyl being sold, and increased caution among young people regarding drug use. While the trend is promising, experts caution that sustaining progress may be difficult, especially as the Trump administration seeks to cut funding for addiction services.</p>
