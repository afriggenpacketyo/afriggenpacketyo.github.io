          <h2>The Critical Minerals Needed for the Clean Energy Transition</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 15:12:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global transition to clean energy is driving increased demand for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, and copper, which are essential for producing batteries, solar panels, and electric motors. While these minerals are not necessarily rare, their supply chains are vulnerable to disruptions, and their extraction can have significant environmental impacts. The United States is heavily reliant on imports of critical minerals, particularly from China, prompting efforts to increase domestic production and explore alternative materials. Innovation in battery technology and mining practices, along with recycling efforts, may help alleviate some of the constraints on critical mineral supplies in the future. </p>

          <p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned of the perils facing the world's oceans, including predatory mining, plastic waste, and rising sea temperatures, at the UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France. The conference aimed to ratify the High Seas Treaty, which would allow countries to establish protected marine areas in international waters. Guterres cautioned against allowing the ocean floor to become a "wild west" due to deep-sea mining, while French President Emmanuel Macron advocated for a moratorium on the practice. The conference also highlighted the need for increased investment in ocean health and the disproportionate impact of ocean degradation on small island nations. </p>

          <p>Following a major policy U-turn, more than three-quarters of pensioners in England and Wales will now receive the winter fuel payment this year. The decision from Chancellor Rachel Reeves means nine million pensioners with an annual income of ¬£35,000 or less will now be eligible. Reactions vary, with some expressing relief and others feeling the money should be allocated elsewhere, such as to younger people or the NHS. The change highlights the ongoing debate about how best to support vulnerable populations during the winter months. </p>
