        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating releasing approximately 600,000 tons of stockpiled rice to stabilize prices that have surged due to supply shortages, considering an additional release of 300,000 tons over three months through July. This measure follows an earlier auction of 321,000 tons between March and April, aiming to address record-high rice prices and concerns about hoarding by wholesalers and farmers anticipating further price increases. The proposed release would significantly reduce the government's rice reserves, potentially raising concerns about future responses to natural disasters or poor harvests. Lawmakers are also considering relaxing buyback requirements for rice distributors to encourage greater participation in auctions and alleviate supply pressures.</p>

          <p>The UK economy experienced stronger-than-anticipated growth in the first three months of the year, expanding by 0.7%, driven primarily by the services sector, according to official figures. This growth rate surpassed analyst forecasts and marked a significant improvement from the previous quarter, although analysts cautioned that this momentum may not persist due to upcoming import tariffs and increased employer taxes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves emphasized the strength and potential of the UK economy, highlighting its faster growth compared to other major economies, while opposition figures raised concerns about downgraded growth forecasts and the impact of rising employer taxes.</p>

The discovery, made by chance while a professor was researching Harvard Law School's digital images, has been authenticated through ultraviolet photography and spectral imaging.

          <p>Denmark's economic growth, largely attributed to a surge in pharmaceutical exports, is expected to moderate this year, but potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry are not anticipated to be a major contributing factor. The IMF reports that Denmark's economy grew 3.7% in 2024 but forecasts a slowdown to 2.9% in 2025 and 1.8% in 2026 due to anticipated weakness in export growth. However, Denmark's reliance on a "merchanting and processing" system, where most of the value of medicines is in intellectual property and production is contracted to other countries, shields it from direct impacts of U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>A version of the Magna Carta held by Harvard University has been identified as an original from 1300, rather than a copy as previously believed, according to British experts. The "Great Charter," originally dating from 1215, is a key document in the history of legal systems and constitutions. Experts from King's College London and the University of East Anglia based their conclusion on an analysis of the document's size and handwriting.

          <p>Singapore's Changi Airport has commenced construction on its fifth terminal, which is expected to be operational by the mid-2030s, in anticipation of a travel boom in Asia. The new terminal will almost double the airport's existing area, increasing its capacity to handle 140 million passengers per year. This expansion is part of a broader trend in the Asia-Pacific and Middle East regions, where airports are undergoing extensive development to cope with projected air travel growth. The aviation ecosystem now contributes 5% of Singapore's GDP, highlighting the importance of airport expansion for the country's economy.</p>
