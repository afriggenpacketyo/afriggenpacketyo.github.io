          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has significantly increased its 2025 financial outlook after reporting second-quarter results that surpassed analyst expectations. The strong performance is driven by soaring demand for its popular diabetes drug, Mounjaro, and weight loss treatment, Zepbound, which generated a combined revenue of over $8.5 billion. The company raised its full-year sales guidance to between $60 billion and $62 billion. This optimistic forecast already accounts for existing U.S. tariffs but does not include potential new levies on imported pharmaceuticals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite significant economic headwinds like a pandemic, high inflation, and rising interest rates, the U.S. stock market has continued to surge, confounding traditional explanations. The article explores the shortcomings of various theories, from economic fundamentals to Federal Reserve liquidity, which have failed to fully account for the market's resilience. A prevailing new theory credits the boom to a speculative bubble around Artificial Intelligence, concentrated in a few tech giants. An alternative view suggests the structural shift toward passive investing, where funds automatically buy stocks regardless of market conditions, is creating a self-perpetuating upward trend.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an economy with persistent inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a way for savers to earn a return that can outpace the loss of buying power. This article explains that while national average CD yields are modest, top rates from online banks are significantly higher, with some one-year CDs offering APYs around 4.40%. It suggests that savers consider online banks, which have lower overhead, and short-term CDs, as the current inverted yield curve means they often have higher rates than long-term options. Laddering CDs is also proposed as a strategy to balance high short-term rates with long-term savings goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides a snapshot of current mortgage and mortgage refinance interest rates for prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing. As of early August 2025, the national average for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.75%, while a 15-year loan averages 5.99%. To secure the best possible rates in the current high-rate environment, it is recommended that borrowers strengthen their credit profiles, with scores in the mid-to-high 700s being ideal. It also advises shopping around and comparing different lenders to find the most favorable terms and overall costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is reportedly set to visit China at the end of August for a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, marking his first trip to the country in seven years. The visit signals a potential thaw in relations between the two Asian powers, which have been strained since a deadly border clash in 2020. This diplomatic development occurs as India's relationship with the United States faces increasing pressure due to trade tensions, including newly announced U.S. tariffs. The meeting could pave the way for direct talks between Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Fred Walecki, the owner of Westwood Music, a Los Angeles instrument shop that became the central hub for the iconic California Sound of the 1960s and 70s. Though not a famous musician himself, Walecki was a crucial confidant, innovator, and supplier for rock legends like the Eagles, Jackson Browne, Linda Ronstadt, and Joni Mitchell. His shop was more than a store; it was a clubhouse where connections were made and collaborations were born. Walecki's expertise in instruments and his genuine care for the artists made him an indispensable, though behind-the-scenes, figure in one of music history's most creative eras.</p>

          <p>Restaurant Brands International, parent company of Burger King, Tim Hortons, and Popeyes, reported mixed second-quarter financial results. While overall revenue surpassed expectations at $2.41 billion, adjusted earnings per share of 94 cents fell short of analysts' forecasts. The company's performance was bolstered by strong same-store sales growth internationally and at Tim Hortons. However, Popeyes was a weak spot, reporting a 1.4% decline in same-store sales, though this was an improvement from the previous quarter. Burger King's U.S. turnaround showed modest progress with a 1.5% increase in same-store sales.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee voted by a narrow 5-4 margin to cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points, from 4.25% to 4%. The decision reflects a difficult balancing act for policymakers, who are weighing persistent inflation against a cooling labor market and stagnant economic growth. The close vote, which required two rounds to reach a majority, highlights the uncertainty surrounding the UK's economic path. While the bank described its approach as "gradual and careful," the move was welcomed by the UK government as relief for mortgage and loan costs. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite high overall office vacancy rates, more companies expect to expand their office footprint than contract it over the next three years.
