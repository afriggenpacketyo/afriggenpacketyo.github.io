          <h2>Analysis Shows Significant Shift in Latino Electorate Towards Trump in 2024 Election</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 20:26:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Pew Research Center study reveals that Donald Trump secured 48% of the Latino vote in the 2024 presidential election, a significant increase from his 36% share in 2020. This near-even split with Kamala Harris's 51% has prompted political experts to analyze the causes behind the rightward shift. Some analysts, like Mike Madrid, attribute the change to economic populism and a feeling that the Democratic party has failed the working-class Latino community by focusing on other cultural issues. Others, such as Paola Ramos, point to disillusionment with the Democratic party's immigration policies and a psychosocial desire among some naturalized citizens to distance themselves from newer immigrants.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has struck down the Trump administration's order that suspended access to asylum for individuals crossing the southern border. In a 128-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Randolph D. Moss stated that the president does not have the authority to create an alternative immigration system that supplants laws enacted by Congress. The policy, issued on President Trump's first day in office, was challenged by several immigrant rights groups, including the ACLU, who argued it was an unprecedented and unlawful ban that endangered thousands of people fleeing persecution. The ruling effectively halts the administration's attempt to deny entry to all asylum seekers at the border.</p>

          <p>Rock icon Ozzy Osbourne is set to perform a final farewell show with his original Black Sabbath bandmates in his hometown of Birmingham. The 76-year-old frontman, whose career has been defined by both pioneering heavy metal music and notorious off-stage antics, has faced increasing health challenges, including Parkinson's disease and spinal injuries. The concert, titled "Back to the Beginning," is being billed as the greatest heavy metal show ever, featuring influential bands like Metallica and Slayer. Despite previous retirement teases, this performance at Villa Park is widely seen as his definitive swansong, celebrating a life that shaped the image of a wild rock star.</p>

          <p>South America's Mercosur trade bloc has signed a free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which includes Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. The deal, a decade in the making, will create a free trade area covering nearly 300 million people and aims to boost bilateral trade by improving market access for over 97% of exports. The comprehensive agreement covers goods, services, investment, and intellectual property, and includes the removal of customs duties. The pact still requires ratification by the parliaments of all member countries, a process that has stalled a similar deal between Mercosur and the European Union.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers will have three players in the National League's starting lineup for the 2025 MLB All-Star Game, falling short of a potential record. Catcher Will Smith and first baseman Freddie Freeman were voted in by fans, joining designated hitter Shohei Ohtani, who had already secured his spot as the league's top vote-getter. Despite having eight finalists, the other five Dodgers candidates were outvoted in the final phase. The record of five starting players from a single team remains intact. The full 32-man rosters, including pitchers and reserves, will be determined by player votes and the commissioner's office and announced on Sunday.</p>

          <p>Switzerland, the host nation for the Women's Euro 2025 tournament, began their campaign with a 2-1 defeat to Norway in Basel. After taking an early lead through Nadine Riesen, the Swiss team conceded two late goals, including an unfortunate own goal, making them the first host nation to lose their opening match in the tournament's history. Despite the loss in front of a sold-out home crowd of over 34,000, coach Pia Sundhage remains optimistic about reaching the quarter-finals. The event is seen as a pivotal moment to boost the growth of women's football in Switzerland, where the domestic league is not yet professional.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has finalized a new trade agreement with Vietnam, establishing a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports and averting a planned 46% levy. As part of the deal, Vietnam will impose no tariffs on U.S. products, giving American goods full market access. The agreement also includes a steeper 40% tariff on goods that are trans-shipped through Vietnam from other countries, a practice the Trump administration claims is used to circumvent tariffs on Chinese products. The deal provides some stability for major brands like Nike and Apple that have manufacturing hubs in Vietnam, though the 20% tariff will still present a cost challenge.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer identified two major trends influencing the stock market: global trade developments and the weakening U.S. dollar. He pointed to the new trade deal between the U.S. and Vietnam, which established a lower-than-expected tariff, causing stocks of companies with manufacturing in Vietnam, like Nike and Williams-Sonoma, to rise. Additionally, Cramer noted that the dollar's decline to a four-year low is beneficial for U.S.-based consumer packaged goods companies such as Procter & Gamble, as it makes their exports more competitive on the global market, potentially leading to better-than-expected earnings for those firms.

Despite struggling on mediocre teams in Portland, Ayton has maintained career averages of 16.4 points and 10.5 rebounds while shooting 59%.

          <p>An essay adapted from a new book reflects on the legacy of Ritchie Valens, a founding father of rock 'n' roll who died tragically at age 17 in a 1959 plane crash. The article highlights how Valens, a Chicano teenager from Pacoima, transformed traditional sounds into something new, most famously with his rock version of the Mexican folk song "La Bamba." His music, a blend of Mexican, Black doo-wop, and hillbilly influences, cleared a path for future Chicano artists. The piece also discusses the making of the 1987 biopic "La Bamba," noting how the re-recorded soundtrack by Los Lobos introduced his music to a new generation.</p>
