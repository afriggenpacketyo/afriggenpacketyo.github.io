          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, decreased to 3.1% in July, a slight cooling from the previous month but still higher than economists' forecasts. This marks the lowest inflation level since November 2024, largely attributed to the easing of significantly high rice prices that had previously more than doubled. Despite this moderation, the Bank of Japan has recently upgraded its inflation forecasts for the upcoming fiscal year, signaling expectations of sustained price pressures. The data presents a mixed economic picture, as it follows better-than-expected GDP growth but also sluggish trade numbers. (not investment advice)</p>

This agreement marks a major win for Google Cloud as it competes with larger rivals Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.

Despite being competitors in the online advertising market, Meta's extensive infrastructure needs have led it to utilize services from all major cloud providers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fourth-generation Texas cotton farmer, facing persistent financial losses, has successfully pivoted his family's business to solar grazing. Instead of traditional farming, he now rents out his flock of sheep to graze on vegetation at large-scale solar farms, effectively acting as natural lawnmowers that keep the areas around solar panels clear. This innovative approach has proven highly profitable, turning a potential six-figure loss from cotton farming into a significant profit. The trend of solar grazing is growing as it provides a steady, reliable income stream for farmers struggling with the volatility of conventional agriculture.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded without a clear direction as investors awaited Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's upcoming speech for signals on future U.S. interest rate policy. While South Korea's Kospi index saw gains, Japan's Nikkei 225 experienced a slight dip at its opening. This market activity coincided with the release of Japan's latest inflation data, which showed a cooling in the core rate to 3.1%, partly due to easing rice prices. The cautious sentiment follows a five-day slide for the S&P 500 in the U.S., with futures markets largely anticipating a rate cut in September. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has introduced new guidelines for baby food manufacturers, directing them to reduce sugar and salt levels and to cease promoting snack products for infants under one year old. The guidance also aims to restrict marketing claims that imply health benefits without scientific backing, a response to findings that many products mislead parents. Companies have been given an 18-month grace period to comply with these voluntary measures, after which the government may consider further action. Health campaigners have welcomed the move, which shifts the responsibility for healthier products from parents to the industry itself.</p>

          <p>Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart U.S., expressed confusion over the company's stock dropping 4.5% despite what he described as an exceptionally strong quarterly performance. The retailer raised its full-year sales and earnings forecast, demonstrating robust topline growth and margin expansion even while absorbing tariff impacts. Simon suggested investors may have overreacted to a rare earnings miss driven by one-time expenses, rather than focusing on the company's fundamental strengths. He argued that Walmart's ability to attract and retain shoppers with low prices and convenience makes its current market position exceptionally strong. (not investment advice)</p>

Speaking at a refrigeration company, Vance highlighted provisions such as an increased child tax credit and the elimination of taxes on tips and overtime, setting the stage for the Republican midterm election messaging. The event also served as a platform to attack Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff, who voted against the bill. Vance's appearance signals the administration's strategy to use the tax cuts as a key campaign issue in swing states.</p>

          <p>China is seeking to amend its 1998 pricing law in an effort to curb the destructive, cutthroat price wars plaguing industries like solar panel manufacturing. The proposed revision targets "involution," a term for hyper-competition that often leads to companies selling products at a loss simply to maintain market share. A draft of the amendment is currently open for public feedback, with business leaders in affected sectors expressing support for tighter regulations. The move reflects a broader effort by Chinese authorities to establish a more sustainable and less chaotic competitive equilibrium in the economy.</p>
