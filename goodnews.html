          <p>This column pays tribute to Jewel Thais-Williams, the founder of the iconic Los Angeles nightclub Jewel’s Catch One, who passed away at 86. Thais-Williams was a trailblazer, opening her club in 1973 as a safe haven for Black and LGBTQ+ individuals at a time of widespread discrimination. Beyond nightlife, she was a dedicated activist and healer, founding a health clinic and providing crucial support to people with AIDS when many were abandoned. Her legacy is remembered by figures like Rep. Maxine Waters as that of a warrior who tirelessly helped marginalized communities.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Backlash Against New 'Superman' Film as 'Superwoke' is Exaggerated</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new 'Superman' film has faced preemptive criticism from some commentators for being 'superwoke,' largely due to director James Gunn's acknowledgment of the character's immigrant origins. This article argues that the backlash is overblown, as Superman's story has always been that of an immigrant, a point reinforced by his creators, who were children of Jewish immigrants. The film itself reportedly emphasizes themes of kindness and the importance of one's upbringing and choices in shaping identity. The debate highlights how cultural products can become battlegrounds in political discourse, even when their content is traditionally mainstream.</p>

The deal comes as Warsaw increases its defense spending in response to Russia's war in Ukraine, which borders Poland. The new tanks will help replace Soviet-era equipment that Poland has donated to Kyiv, bolstering its defensive capabilities on NATO's eastern flank.</p>
