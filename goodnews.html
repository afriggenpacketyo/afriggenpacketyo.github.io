          <p>The British government is set to pass a new law that will make climbing on the Winston Churchill statue in Parliament Square a criminal offense, punishable by up to three months in prison and a ¬£1,000 fine. This measure is part of a broader effort to protect war memorials across the UK from desecration, as the Churchill statue has become a frequent target for demonstrators. The statue was sprayed with paint and graffiti during protests, prompting the government to take action to ensure it is treated with respect.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is facing a dispute with his neighbors in West Lake Hills, Texas, over the construction of a 16-foot chain-link fence and a metal gate at his $6 million mansion, which he made without obtaining the proper permits. Musk's team unsuccessfully lobbied city officials to keep the details of the property and security operations private, citing his work with the Trump administration as a reason for exemption from public records laws. The city attorney ruled against a closed meeting, and Musk lost his appeal to keep the fence and gate at a Zoning and Planning Commission meeting.</p>

          <p>A Canadian CEO, Luke Therrien, is cutting out US middlemen and establishing direct ties with Chinese suppliers due to trade tensions, stock shortages, and tariffs. This shift, prompted by the US-China trade war, aims to create a more sustainable and cost-efficient supply chain for his retail business. Therrien is now sourcing goods directly from Yiwu's small-commodities market in China, navigating logistical hurdles to bypass the uncertainties and costs associated with trading through the United States.</p>
