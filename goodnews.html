          <p>Across Africa, particularly in commercial hubs like Nairobi and Lagos, traders are shifting away from the US dollar and adopting China‚Äôs yuan for international transactions. Logistics companies are playing a key role by providing Shilling-yuan conversion services, enabling traders to pay in local currency while handling yuan payments to Chinese sellers. This localized system streamlines trade with China, the world‚Äôs second-largest economy, benefiting both African traders and Chinese businesses, as Kenyan traders can now easily purchase goods from Guangzhou and Yiwu through local agents who manage payments and deliveries.
