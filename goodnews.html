          <p>TeleMessage, a messaging app similar to Signal and used by former Trump National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, has temporarily suspended its services due to a potential security incident. Smarsh, the parent company of TeleMessage, is investigating the possible hack and has engaged a cybersecurity firm. The breach reportedly compromised messages sent through TeleMessage's versions of Signal, WhatsApp, Telegram, and WeChat. However, the article specifies that the hacker did not obtain messages from Mike Waltz during his tenure as National Security Advisor.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is restructuring as a public benefit corporation, ensuring that the nonprofit organization controlling it will remain its largest shareholder. This decision reverses a previous plan to shift control to investors and is seen as a victory for critics like Elon Musk, who argued the company was prioritizing profits over safety. CEO Sam Altman stated that this new structure provides a more understandable framework for the company's operations, as OpenAI continues negotiating the nonprofit's stake in the new corporation, and the nonprofit will choose the board members. SoftBank's $40 billion funding round is contingent on this restructuring being completed by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Georgia Governor Brian Kemp has announced he will not run for Senate in 2026, depriving Republicans of a strong challenger against Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff. Kemp, a popular two-term governor, made his decision despite being heavily recruited by top Republicans. He cited family reasons and conveyed his commitment to helping the party find a strong nominee. Ossoff, who narrowly won election in 2020, has already raised $11 million for his re-election campaign and has been critical of President Trump, setting the stage for a potentially tough race.</p>

          <p>President Trump falsely claimed that gasoline prices have fallen below $2 per gallon, citing $1.98 a gallon in a Truth Social post while urging the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. According to AAA, the average U.S. gas price is actually $3.165 per gallon, about $1.18 more than Trump's claim. While RBOB gasoline futures did briefly touch $1.98 per gallon, this contract represents wholesale, unfinished gasoline prices and does not include taxes, transportation costs, or other fees paid by consumers. Patrick De Haan of GasBuddy emphasizes that RBOB prices are irrelevant to consumers.</p>

          <h2>Social Security Reduces Overpayment Clawbacks to 50% After Concerns Arise</h2>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is reducing its overpayment clawback rate to 50% from 100%, following concerns that the higher rate could cause financial hardship for beneficiaries. This change comes after the SSA had started recovering erroneous overpayments by taking 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check. The SSA's inspector general found that 73,000 overpayments in 2022 were due to problems with Social Security's own calculations. Last year, the Biden administration capped the clawback rate at 10% after reports that some seniors and disabled beneficiaries had been forced into financial hardship.</p>

          <p>Four days of events to commemorate 80 years since Victory in Europe Day began with a military procession through London, followed by a dramatic RAF flypast over Buckingham Palace. Proud veterans joined politicians and three generations of royals for the day's poignant and ceremonious events. The Red Arrows' trademark red, blue and white smoke added a much needed pop of colour to London's moody grey skies as part of the spectacular aerial tribute organised by the Ministry of Defence.</p>

          <p>Santa Ono, the president of the University of Michigan, is set to leave for the University of Florida, potentially becoming one of the highest-paid public university presidents. Both Michigan and Florida have faced substantial turmoil in recent years, and Dr. Ono, whose style frustrated many in Ann Arbor, is moving from one lightning rod to another. In March, the University of Michigan announced that it would shut down its primary diversity, equity and inclusion effort. Ono is planning to step into a Florida presidency that Ben Sasse, a Republican who had represented Nebraska in the U.S. Senate, abruptly left last summer.</p>
