          <p>Dominik Mysterio successfully defended his Intercontinental Championship against A.J. Styles at the SummerSlam event. In a move reminiscent of Eddie Guerrero, Mysterio used a distraction involving the referee to strike Styles with his boot before executing a frog splash for the pinfall victory. This win continues Mysterio's championship reign, which began at WrestleMania. The article notes the loss leaves the future for veteran wrestler A.J. Styles uncertain.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotech companies Innovent and BeOne are projected to reach profitability in 2025, marking a significant milestone for the country's burgeoning biotech sector. According to analysts, Innovent is expected to post its first full-year profit, largely driven by strong sales of its new weight-loss drug, mazdutide. This shift to profitability demonstrates the maturation of China's biotech industry, which has historically relied on investor funding. The success of these firms indicates they are creating substantial value for both patients and government payers within the Chinese healthcare market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A widely circulated social media claim stating that the average starting salary for a NASA astronaut is $66,026 is false. The article clarifies that this figure was based on the lowest possible pay grade from an outdated 2019 scale, and even then, most astronauts started at higher rates. As of 2025, the actual starting salary for all NASA astronaut candidates is $152,258, with pay increasing upon completion of training. The pay structure was changed in 2021 to a single starting rate, as all candidates begin training without prior experience as an astronaut.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine, Chinese aerospace engineers have proposed a novel upgrade to enhance the survivability of combat drones. The concept involves equipping small or medium-sized drones with side-mounted rocket boosters for "terminal evasion." These boosters would allow a drone to perform sudden, high-G maneuvers in the final moments before an anti-aircraft missile impact, making it extremely difficult to track. According to a research paper, digital simulations showed this system could dramatically increase a drone's survival rate to nearly 90 percent, a significant improvement over current battlefield statistics.</p>

          <p>An international team of researchers has begun a mission to save the endangered Polymita tree snails of Eastern Cuba, renowned for their vibrant and beautifully patterned shells. This beauty is also their curse, as the illegal shell trade for collectors is driving them toward extinction. Biologists in Cuba and at the University of Nottingham in the UK are collaborating on the project, which involves captive breeding programs and genetic research. By studying the snails' genomes, scientists hope to understand the basis for their unique coloration and provide crucial information to aid in their conservation.</p>

          <p>Share markets in Asia saw a supportive start to the week as the prospect of lower U.S. borrowing costs eased concerns about the American economy. A weak U.S. payrolls report on Friday increased market expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut, with futures implying an 85% chance of a cut in September. This outlook led to a rebound in Wall Street futures and stabilized the dollar after its recent decline. While the drop in global yields helped equities, concerns remain over the credibility of U.S. economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a world-first public health initiative, the UK has started a nationwide rollout of a gonorrhoea vaccine, available through sexual health clinics. The program will initially target those at the highest risk, such as gay and bisexual men with a history of multiple sexual partners, in an effort to combat record-high infection rates. The vaccine, originally developed for meningitis B, is 30-40% effective against gonorrhoea and is expected to prevent up to 100,000 cases over the next decade. Health officials hope this will also help slow the spread of antibiotic-resistant strains of the infection.</p>

          <h2>Dave Ramsey Argues Financial Struggles Stem from Debt, Not Insufficient Income</h2>

          <p>Personal finance personality Dave Ramsey recently asserted that many people are broke not because they earn too little, but because their income is consumed by debt payments. He identified credit cards, car payments, and student loans as the primary culprits that prevent individuals from building wealth. Ramsey's advice is to take control of one's income, which he calls the most powerful financial tool, by creating a zero-based budget and aggressively paying down debt. He emphasizes that avoiding financing and paying with cash are key strategies employed by many self-made millionaires. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>May Davis Mailman, a longtime Trump insider who served as deputy assistant to the president and senior policy strategist, has left her White House position. Her departure is notable as she is the highest-ranking official to leave during the second term without being forced out. Mailman, who worked throughout the entire first term, was considered a key figure in the administration's policy operations and is known to be close to Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller. She reportedly plans to start a government affairs firm but will continue as a special government employee to conclude some ongoing policy work.</p>

          <p>A recent report explores the significant financial burden of egg freezing, a medical procedure growing in popularity among women seeking to preserve their fertility. The all-in cost for a single cycle, including retrieval, freezing, and storage, averages between $12,000 and $13,000, and many women undergo multiple cycles to improve their chances of a future successful pregnancy. While some employers are beginning to offer coverage, the majority of women must pay out-of-pocket for the expensive procedure. Doctors caution that despite the high cost, egg freezing does not guarantee a future pregnancy, as there are success-rate drop-offs at each stage.</p>

          <p>Google DeepMind has demonstrated a significant advancement in artificial intelligence with Genie 2, a model that can generate entire interactive 3D worlds from a single image or text prompt. CEO Demis Hassabis explained that the technology can convert a static photograph into a game-like environment that an AI agent or human can explore. This world-building capability has major implications not only for entertainment and gaming but also for training more capable AI. The simulated environments can be used to teach AI agents and robots complex tasks in a safe, controlled setting before they are applied in the real world.</p>
