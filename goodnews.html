        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The first New York City mayoral debate saw Democratic candidates clashing over critical issues such as housing, affordability, crime, and their approach to the Trump administration. Former Governor Andrew Cuomo, a frontrunner, faced attacks from rivals like Zohran Mamdani, who accused Cuomo of prioritizing wealthy donors over working-class New Yorkers. Cuomo dismissed Mamdani as inexperienced, while other candidates criticized Cuomo's record on nursing home deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic and sexual harassment allegations. The debate also featured criticisms of current Mayor Eric Adams, who is running for re-election as an independent, and highlighted the diverse perspectives and policy proposals of the Democratic candidates vying for the city's top job.</p>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's new travel ban affecting numerous countries, certain individuals will be exempt from the restrictions. World Cup players, dual citizens, and individuals holding existing visas will still be permitted to enter the United States. This exception acknowledges the importance of international events and pre-existing legal permissions in the context of broader travel restrictions. The move highlights the complexities of implementing wide-ranging travel bans while attempting to balance national security concerns with international commitments and individual rights.</p>

          <p>The Washington Department of Natural Resources used a firefighting helicopter to remove abandoned boats from Squaxin Island, an uninhabited island in Puget Sound. The operation, funded by a federal grant, removed 14 vessels to prevent damage to the marine environment. The agency opts for airlift removals when towing would disrupt sensitive areas like kelp beds. Since 2002, the program has removed over 1,200 derelict vessels, addressing the challenge of boat dumping and its impact on the Puget Sound.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found in Burmese amber has provided new insights into the evolution of flight feathers, which played a crucial role in the ability of early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in flight. Researchers conducted a detailed structural study of feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period. The study, published in Science Bulletin, highlights the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift as an essential feature of bird evolution. Scientists believe that most feathered dinosaurs did not possess the same flight capabilities as modern birds.</p>

          <p>Research indicates that the first bacteria infants encounter may play a crucial role in their immune system development and overall health. A UK study found that the presence of Bifidobacterium longum in newborns was associated with a significantly reduced risk of hospitalization for lung infections in the first two years of life. The protective bacteria were more commonly found in babies born via vaginal delivery rather than caesarean section. Researchers suggest that these early microbial interactions influence the maturation of the immune system, potentially reducing susceptibility to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other infections.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Colorado has temporarily blocked the deportation of the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, who is charged in the Boulder attack. The judge issued the order to preserve the court's jurisdiction over the case, citing the potential for irreparable harm if the family is deported without due process. Soliman, an Egyptian national, is accused of using Molotov cocktails in an attack that injured more than a dozen people, and his family is currently being held at a federal detention center in Texas. The family first came to the U.S. in August 2022, and Soliman filed for asylum that September.</p>

          <p>Pregnant women are being advised to avoid using weight-loss injections, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, due to potential harm to the unborn baby. UK drug safety experts have expressed concerns about the safety of these medicines during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The advice is already included in patient information leaflets, but there are concerns that the increasing popularity of these injections means many women are not using them safely or receiving adequate advice. The UK drugs regulator and medical professionals are worried about the unsafe use of GLP-1 medicines, which are often purchased online without medical supervision.</p>
