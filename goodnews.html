          <p>The WE League, Japan's professional women's football competition, concluded its fourth season with a new total attendance record, surpassing 337,000 spectators.

Although his workload is still being carefully managed following Tommy John surgery, the outing demonstrated his dominant potential.

Speaking at a summit, Shum noted that the AI race hinges on chips, algorithms, and applications, with the U.S. maintaining a clear lead in hardware. However, he highlighted Chinese start-ups like DeepSeek, which have achieved competitive results with top Western models using far less computing power. This suggests China is making strategic breakthroughs in algorithm engineering to overcome its hardware constraints. (not investment advice)</p>

Investor focus also shifted back to potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, with markets now pricing in a higher likelihood of three cuts by year-end.

          <p>New genetic research from the ancient city of √áatalh√∂y√ºk in Turkey suggests it may have been a matriarchal society over 9,000 years ago. After analyzing DNA from more than 130 skeletons buried under the city's houses, researchers found that genetic connections were primarily traced through the female line. This indicates that upon marriage, men likely moved into their wives' households, and female offspring remained in their birth homes. The findings, which also show females received significantly more grave goods, challenge traditional assumptions about patrilineal structures in ancient societies.</p>
