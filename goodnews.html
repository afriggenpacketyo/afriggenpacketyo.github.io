          <p>The Port of Los Angeles processed a record-breaking volume of containers in July, driven by a surge of imports as shippers rushed to get ahead of tariff deadlines. This front-loading of goods, particularly from China, resulted in over one million twenty-foot equivalent units being handled, an unprecedented level in the port's 117-year history. However, industry experts note that this early peak season is now slowing, and the high tariff levels are hurting the margins of many small and medium-sized importers. (not investment advice)</p>

These tax-advantaged accounts can now be used for vocational programs, required continuing education courses, and costs associated with professional licensing exams. This expansion broadens the appeal of 529 plans, addressing parental concerns that the funds might go unused if a child does not pursue a four-year degree. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of the institutional-focused cryptocurrency exchange Bullish surged dramatically in their New York Stock Exchange debut, opening at $90, which was 143% above its initial public offering price. The company, led by former NYSE President Tom Farley, raised approximately $1.1 billion after pricing its IPO well above the expected range. The successful launch is seen as a sign of growing institutional investor interest in the crypto market, capitalizing on a more favorable regulatory attitude. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers with a significant sum like $50,000, both high-yield savings accounts and money market accounts offer attractive, flexible options with high interest rates and without market volatility. Based on current top rates, a money market account at 4.40% APY would slightly outperform a high-yield savings account at 4.35% APY over one year, earning approximately $2,200 versus $2,175. While the difference is minimal, both provide substantial returns compared to traditional savings accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new analysis of an Incan khipu, a complex record-keeping device made of knotted cords, suggests its use was not limited to the empire's ruling elite. Researchers discovered that a khipu from around 1498 was made primarily of human hair, and a dietary analysis of the hair indicated its owner was a commoner, not a noble. This finding challenges long-held assumptions based on Spanish colonial accounts and suggests that literacy through khipus may have been more widespread throughout Incan society.</p>

          <p>A recent Siena poll indicates that progressive Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani has widened his lead in the New York City mayoral race. The poll shows Mamdani with a 19-point lead over his nearest rival, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, with incumbent Mayor Eric Adams trailing significantly. As the frontrunner, Mamdani is facing increased scrutiny from opponents over his residency in a rent-stabilized apartment while campaigning on housing affordability and higher taxes for the wealthy.</p>

          <p>A Certificate of Deposit (CD) remains an attractive option for savers due to its fixed, competitive interest rates and FDIC insurance. For a $75,000 deposit, the potential earnings are substantial; for example, a one-year CD at a 4.40% APY could generate $3,300 in interest. Longer-term CDs offer even greater returns, with a five-year CD at 4.15% APY potentially earning over $16,900, making it a powerful tool for those who can lock their money away.

          <p>Walmart announced it is expanding its 10% employee discount to cover nearly all grocery items, including milk and meat, for its 1.6 million U.S. workers. The move comes as rising tariffs fuel concerns about higher consumer prices, which Walmart's CFO has acknowledged the company cannot fully absorb. The expanded benefit is one of the most requested by employees and could also serve to boost Walmart's own sales and help with worker retention in a competitive market.</p>

          <p>Premier League chief executive Richard Masters has stated there are no current plans to stage regular season matches abroad, dismissing the idea as "not anywhere near my in-tray." His comments come as Spain's La Liga and Italy's Serie A seek permission to play fixtures in the U.S. and Australia. Masters noted that while the league "flirted" with the concept over a decade ago, its international growth has since been achieved through broadcasting and digital means, dissipating the necessity for such a move.</p>
