          <p>Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi announced he would cover the educational expenses for 22 children from Jammu and Kashmir, orphaned by the May military conflict between India and Pakistan. These children are from the Poonch district, a border area heavily affected by shelling and drone attacks that resulted in 28 deaths. The initiative, led by Gandhi's Congress party, aims to support the children's education through graduation. This humanitarian effort comes as India's parliament debates "Operation Sindoor," the military strikes that sparked the conflict.</p>

          <p>India's Home Minister Amit Shah confirmed that three suspected militants involved in the April Pahalgam attack in India-administered Kashmir were killed in a gunfight. The operation, conducted in the mountainous Dachigam area, comes over three months after the attack killed 26 people, mostly Hindu men. Shah stated forensic evidence linked the recovered rifles to the attack, identifying the militants as Pakistani nationals and members of Lashkar-e-Taiba. This marks the second major gunfight since April, following a conflict that saw intense military strikes between India and Pakistan.</p>

          <p>South Korean AI chip startup Rebellions, which merged with Sapeon, has secured investment from Samsung and aims to raise up to $200 million in funding before its public listing. The company focuses on AI inferencing chips, a market it hopes to challenge Nvidia and AMD in. Samsung's foundry business will mass-produce Rebellions' second-generation chip, Rebel, later this year, using its advanced 4 nanometer process. This collaboration could be a strategic win for Samsung, boosting its chipmaking division. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's Shenzhen Baoan and Guangzhou Baiyun airports have achieved record passenger volumes, surpassing their pre-Covid highs in the first half of 2025. Guangzhou handled 40.04 million passengers, up 9.2% year-on-year, while Shenzhen served 32.55 million, a 10.8% increase. This rapid growth reflects vibrant business activity and strong domestic tourism demand in these cities. In contrast, Hong Kong International Airport, despite a 16.5% increase, remains below its 2019 levels, indicating a shift in regional aviation competitiveness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain its benchmark short-term interest rate, keeping it unchanged for 2025. This stability has led to minimal movement in consumer borrowing rates, with credit card rates hovering around 20.1% and 30-year fixed mortgages between 6.6% and 7.1%. While some variable-rate loans directly link to the Fed's benchmark, others, like mortgages, are more tied to Treasury yields and the broader economy. Experts caution that a rate cut doesn't guarantee lower borrowing costs, as increased inflation could even push mortgage rates up. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Experts suggest the UK could be an unexpected beneficiary of the new EU-U.S. trade agreement, despite its focus on EU goods. With the EU facing a 15% tariff on U.S. imports compared to the UK's 10% levy, British exports become relatively cheaper, potentially boosting trade and attracting EU manufacturers to relocate. Additionally, the EU's avoidance of a more severe 30% tariff regime averts a major downturn that would have impacted UK exports to the bloc. While both the UK and EU face a tougher trade environment, the UK's lower tariff rate offers a competitive edge. (not investment advice)</p>
