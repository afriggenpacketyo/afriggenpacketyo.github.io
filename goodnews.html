          <p>Google Cloud experienced a significant global outage, causing disruptions for several major internet services. The outage, which began at 10:51 a.m. PT, affected multiple Google Cloud Platform (GCP) products, with customers experiencing varying degrees of impact. E-commerce software vendor Shopify and OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, both reported issues related to the outage. Google engineers worked to restore service, and Thomas Kurian, head of Google Cloud, later announced that all services were back up and running, expressing regret for the disruption caused to customers. The incident is a setback for Google as it seeks to compete with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure in the cloud infrastructure market.</p>

          <p>The average age of women giving birth in the United States has increased to nearly 30 years old in 2023, according to a recent report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The average age of all mothers rose from 28.7 in 2016 to 29.6 in 2023, while the average age of first-time mothers increased from 26.6 to 27.5 during the same period. Experts attribute this shift to various factors, including changing social expectations, advancements in fertility technology, and the rising cost of raising children. The report also noted a continuing decline in teen pregnancies, which have decreased from 11.8% of first births in 2016 to 8.7% in 2023.</p>

          <p>Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang announced his departure to Meta as part of a $14.3 billion deal, where Meta will acquire a 49% stake in the artificial intelligence startup without voting power. Wang expressed his gratitude for his time as CEO and confirmed that Jason Droege, the chief strategy officer, will take over the role. A small number of Scale AI employees will also join Meta as part of the agreement, with Meta planning to deepen its work in producing data for AI models. This move aligns with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's focus on bolstering the company's AI efforts amid competition from OpenAI and Google, and Scale AI assures that this will not impact existing customer relationships.</p>

          <p>The FIFA Club World Cup is underway in stadiums across the United States, featuring 32 teams competing for a new trophy and substantial prize money. This revamped tournament represents a significant expansion of the previous format, with FIFA aiming to create a more global club competition. However, the new format has faced criticism from players concerned about an already congested schedule and sluggish ticket sales, despite a $1 billion prize pool. The tournament will consist of 63 games played across 11 U.S. cities, with the final scheduled for July 13 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.</p>

          <p>North Korea announced the successful repair and relaunch of a 5,000-ton destroyer that was damaged during a failed launch attempt last month. Leader Kim Jong Un attended a ceremony at the Rajin shipyard to mark the achievement, revealing plans to build two more destroyers of the same type annually. The vessel had tipped over during the initial launch attempt, causing damage to lower sections, and Kim ordered its repair before a plenary meeting of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea. The newly launched warship is scheduled to be handed over to the navy around mid-2026.</p>
