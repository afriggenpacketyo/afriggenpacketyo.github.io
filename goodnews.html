          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant increase after Israel launched airstrikes against Iran, raising concerns about potential disruptions to oil supplies in the Middle East. The U.S. West Texas Intermediate contract rose by 7.61% to $73.22 per barrel, while the global benchmark Brent futures contract increased by 7.22% to $74.37 per barrel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the operation, targeting Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile program, would continue until the threat is removed. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio clarified that the U.S. was not involved in the strikes but warned Iran against targeting U.S. interests in the region. Optimism surrounding global economic stability remains tempered by geopolitical uncertainties.</p>

          <p>Users of Meta's AI app are unknowingly sharing prompts publicly, raising privacy concerns. Meta AI chats are private by default but can be shared publicly through a four-step process.

They can also manage their information to make all public prompts visible only to themselves and delete their prompt history, as Meta has invested heavily in AI to compete with Google and OpenAI.</p>

          <p>Melissa Febos' new memoir, "The Dry Season," explores the benefits of refusal and abstinence, focusing on a year she spent voluntarily celibate. Febos examines six books that celebrate refusal, revealing how it can lead to unexpected delights and open one's eyes to new possibilities. She argues that saying no to one thing allows one to say yes to something else, widening the aperture of one's heart. Febos' book suggests that spirituality can be found in smaller phenomena and stiller moments, encouraging readers to consider what narrow portals they might be looking through in their own lives.</p>
