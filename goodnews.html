          <p>A segment on "CBS Sunday Morning" reflected on the historic Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka case, which legally dismantled the doctrine of "separate but equal" in American public schools. The report highlighted Thurgood Marshall's powerful 1953 argument before the Supreme Court, where he asserted that racial segregation was a deliberate system designed to perpetuate subjugation. This landmark decision marked a pivotal victory in the Civil Rights Movement, fundamentally reshaping the legal framework of equality and education in the United States.</p>

          <p>Gary Cohn, former director of the National Economic Council, discussed the Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut, noting that the central bank's projections indicate two more cuts are likely this year. He explained that the Fed's decision was influenced by a "really cooling off" labor market, as job creation has slowed significantly in recent months. Cohn observed that companies, facing rising input costs, are reducing their labor force to maintain profit margins, a trend that is now clearly appearing in economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

Hocker was in 11th place at the bell but unleashed a devastating kick to overtake the field, finishing in 12 minutes and 58.30 seconds. The victory offered redemption for Hocker, who had been controversially disqualified from the 1500m semifinals earlier in the week for jostling. He stated he felt "robbed" in the earlier race and was determined to end the championships on his own terms.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has suggested that the famously boisterous New York crowd at Bethpage Black could turn against the American team if they underperform. Donald pointed to the controversial decision for U.S. players to each receive a $500,000 payment for participating, a first in the event's history, while European players continue to compete for free. He speculated that with high ticket prices, fans might voice their displeasure if the paid American team fails to deliver, potentially creating intense gallery pressure on the home side.</p>

          <p>To enhance production quality and avoid errors like missing bolts, the assembly line for China's C919 passenger jet has been upgraded into a futuristic smart factory. The system integrates 5G wireless technology with a time-sensitive network, creating a unified communication loop connecting all sensors, robots, tools, and workers. This advanced manufacturing approach, detailed in a recent academic journal, combines data collection, communication, and control into a single intelligent system. The goal is to eliminate manual oversight errors that have plagued other aeronautical manufacturers in recent years.</p>

          <p>Kenya is advancing its commitment to renewable energy by beginning construction on a 50-mile transmission line to carry geothermal power from the Olkaria complex to the country's western regions. This project aims to enhance grid stability, reduce reliance on expensive gas turbines, and provide reliable, clean electricity. Geothermal energy, which harnesses heat from the Earth's core, offers a virtually unlimited and pollution-free power source. The expansion is part of a larger government focus on green energy to lower costs, curb climate threats, and foster economic growth.</p>

          <p>Rail travel is becoming increasingly popular in the United States, with national carrier Amtrak seeing a significant boom in ridership. The government-owned corporation has been actively promoting its services, including through popular social media channels like TikTok, to attract a new generation of travelers. This growing interest is highlighted by the recent launch of the new Acela trains for the busy Boston to Washington, D.C. corridor. The modern, European-style train sets are part of a broader effort to upgrade and expand America's passenger rail infrastructure.</p>

          <p>For the first time in almost 100 years, hundreds of swimmers plunged into the Chicago River, marking a major milestone in the waterway's transformation from a polluted sewer to a recreational hub. The event, long championed by organizers, highlights decades of environmental progress since the passage of the Clean Water Act in the 1970s. Once known as "the stinking river," cleanup efforts have led to the return of dozens of fish species and other wildlife. The swim symbolizes a renewed connection between Chicagoans and their once-spurned river.</p>

          <p>Neath Port Talbot council in Wales has implemented a voluntary ban on plastic flying rings at its beaches to prevent harm to seals. The toys pose a significant danger to the marine mammals, as young, curious seals can get the hoops stuck around their necks, leading to severe injury, infection, and death. The move follows similar actions by other coastal councils and retailers like Tesco and Sainsbury's. The council is also backing a campaign for a UK-wide legislative ban on the sale of these hazardous toys.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has upended the long-held theory about the origin of Stonehenge's Altar Stone, suggesting it came from Scotland, not Wales. By creating a chemical fingerprint of the six-ton sandstone block, researchers found its mineral composition matches rocks from the Orcadian Basin in northeast Scotland, over 460 miles away. This finding challenges previous research that pointed to a source in southeast Wales. The discovery raises new questions about the advanced transport methods and complex trade networks that must have existed during the Neolithic period to move such a massive stone.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen secured a dominant victory at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, showcasing a resurgent pace that could pose a late-season challenge to the McLaren team. The race was disastrous for championship leader Oscar Piastri of McLaren, who crashed out on the first lap after an ambitious overtaking attempt. His teammate and main rival, Lando Norris, was unable to fully capitalize, finishing seventh after getting stuck in traffic. The results mean Piastri's championship lead over Norris narrows to 25 points with seven races remaining in the season.</p>

          <p>The Seabed 2030 project, a UN-backed initiative to map the entire ocean floor by the end of the decade, is struggling to meet its ambitious goal. While only 20% of the seabed has been surveyed, completing the map could reveal undiscovered ecosystems and provide vital data on climate change. However, the project faces challenges including high costs, a lack of ships and equipment, and waning political will in a more fractured geopolitical landscape. There are also concerns that a complete map could accelerate resource exploitation in largely unregulated international waters.</p>
