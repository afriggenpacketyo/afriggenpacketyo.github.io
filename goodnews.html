          <p>Actor Dwayne Johnson is embracing a new phase in his career by taking on the complex role of mixed martial arts champion Mark Kerr in the film "The Smashing Machine." Johnson explains that after years of focusing on box office success with action and family films, he felt unfulfilled and sought a dramatic part he could deeply immerse himself in, even if it meant confronting his own fears. To portray Kerr's struggles with addiction and depression, Johnson drew upon his own traumatic experiences, including being evicted as a teenager, describing the process as one that allowed him to metaphorically "rip myself open" and find a new love for acting.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 09:34:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a child development expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, children with exceptional social skills are often raised by parents who model specific behaviors from an early age. These practices focus on creating an environment of emotional safety and authentic connection rather than simply memorizing polite phrases. Key behaviors include openly discussing feelings to build emotional vocabulary, modeling empathy in daily interactions, and fostering genuine confidence by allowing children to try and fail. Other crucial habits involve teaching conflict resolution, validating a child's feelings, and actively listening more than lecturing, which together build a strong foundation for emotional intelligence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The landmark 1954 Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, which declared state-sponsored school segregation unconstitutional, was the culmination of a decades-long legal battle led by the NAACP. The decision overturned the "separate but equal" doctrine established by the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson case, which had legally sanctioned racial segregation across the United States. Spearheaded by attorney Thurgood Marshall, the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund systematically challenged segregation case by case, arguing it was a system designed to maintain racial hierarchy. While the ruling did not immediately end segregation, it was a monumental step toward racial equality and propelled Marshall to later become the first African American Supreme Court Justice.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed a dominant victory at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, reinforcing concerns for McLaren that he could become a late-season title contender. The win was made more significant by a major mistake from championship leader Oscar Piastri of McLaren, who crashed out on the first lap. Fortunately for Piastri, his main rival and teammate, Lando Norris, was unable to capitalize significantly, finishing in seventh place after getting stuck in traffic. The race also saw an excellent performance from Mercedes' George Russell, who finished second, and a notable third-place finish for Carlos Sainz, securing Williams' first podium since 2021.</p>

          <h2>The Race to Map the World's Oceans Sparks Debate Over Discovery and Exploitation</h2>

          <p>A global initiative named Seabed 2030 aims to map the entire ocean floor by the end of the decade, a monumental task given that approximately 80% of it remains uncharted. Environmental journalist Laura Trethewey explains that this underwater realm, less explored than Mars, holds vast potential for scientific discovery, including new species and insights into past sea-level rise. However, this ambitious project also raises significant concerns, as a complete map could accelerate the exploitation of deep-sea resources like minerals. There is an ongoing debate about whether this new knowledge will be used primarily for science and conservation or will lead to unregulated resource extraction in international waters.</p>

          <p>New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral has unveiled its first major new artwork in 75 years, a large-scale mural by artist Adam Cvijanovic that reinterprets a traditional Catholic vision to celebrate the immigrant experience. Commissioned by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the mural, titled "What's So Funny About Peace, Love and Understanding," depicts the Apparition at Knock alongside scenes of 19th-century immigrants arriving in New York and modern-day first responders. The artwork also prominently features contemporary asylum seekers, a detail Cardinal Dolan acknowledges could be seen as a political statement, affirming the Church's message of welcoming newcomers in the face of contentious national debates on immigration.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has fully divested from its highly successful investment in the Chinese electric vehicle company BYD. The firm began selling its shares in August 2022, after the initial $230 million stake purchased in 2008 had grown to a value of $9 billion. The investment was originally championed by the late Charlie Munger, who saw immense potential in the company and its CEO. While Buffett has praised BYD as an "extraordinary company," the sale aligns with a broader reduction in investments with geopolitical risks tied to China, including a near-total sale of its Taiwan Semiconductor stake.</p>

          <p>In response to inconsistent and shifting guidance from national health agencies like the CDC, several U.S. states are forming regional collaboratives to coordinate public health policy. The new Northeast Public Health Collaborative includes seven states and New York City, aiming to strengthen regional strategies on issues like vaccine purchasing and emergency preparedness. This trend reflects a growing state-level effort to create reliable health recommendations as federal authority becomes more fractured, leading to a potential patchwork of policies on vaccination and other health matters across the country. Experts warn that while these alliances are a positive step, infectious diseases do not respect state borders.</p>

          <p>The United States recently held a significant trilateral military exercise, Freedom Edge, with allies Japan and South Korea, notably without deploying an aircraft carrier. This departure from previous drills has prompted speculation among analysts about its strategic meaning for relations with China. Some experts suggest the move could be an attempt to de-escalate tensions and foster dialogue with Beijing and North Korea. Others interpret it as a reflection of the Trump administration's strategy to push Asian allies toward greater self-reliance in regional defense and containment efforts within the first island chain.</p>

          <p>Many women express that they were underinformed about their own reproductive biology, leading fertility doctors and health experts to call for more comprehensive sex education that includes lessons on fertility. They argue that curriculums often focus exclusively on pregnancy prevention, leaving many unaware of key factors like the decline of fertility with age, the impact of lifestyle on sperm quality, and the limited effectiveness of treatments like IVF. This knowledge gap can lead to misconceptions and delayed family planning. Proponents believe that teaching topics like ovulation and fertility cycles in middle and high school could empower individuals to make more informed decisions about their reproductive health later in life.</p>

Beyond the outfits, the trend reveals a system that emphasizes social connections, regional belonging, and the cloistering of young white women, largely excluding nonwhite participants.
