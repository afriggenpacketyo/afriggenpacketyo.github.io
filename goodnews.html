          <p>The tennis world anticipates a thrilling Wimbledon men's final between world No. 1 Jannik Sinner and No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz, rekindling a captivating rivalry that has seen them win the last six Grand Slams. Their contrasting personalities—Sinner's calm demeanor versus Alcaraz's expressive flair—add another layer of intrigue to their on-court battles. This renewal comes just 35 days after Alcaraz defeated Sinner in an all-time classic French Open final, pushing both players to new heights. Despite Sinner's recent elbow injury, he assures it won't be an issue, setting the stage for another potential five-hour epic, with Alcaraz holding a slight edge as the favorite.</p>

          <p>Rising British boxing star Hamzah Sheeraz made a resounding entry into the super middleweight division by stopping Edgar Berlanga in the fifth round at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. This destructive performance, which saw Sheeraz drop Berlanga twice in the fourth round, instantly propelled him from prospect to contender in a weight class dominated by Saul 'Canelo' Álvarez. The event marked a historic first for professional boxing at the US Open grounds, drawing a large and energetic crowd. Sheeraz, who had a disappointing draw earlier, showcased his improved skill and poise, setting him up for lucrative matchups.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: China's Private Space Sector Poised for Significant Growth</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 01:25:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article highlights the projected rapid growth of China's private space economy, which is forecast to rise from 12% of aggregate investment in 2020 to 45% by 2025. This boom is fueled by technological advancements, lower manufacturing costs, and robust state support for the private sector. Stellar examples include Beijing-based i-Space, the first private Chinese company to successfully put a rocket into orbit, and LandSpace, maker of the Zhuque-2 rocket, the first methane-liquid oxygen fueled launch vehicle to reach orbit. This expansion signifies China's increasing prominence and innovation in the global space race. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bronny James delivered a solid performance for the Lakers in an NBA Summer League game, contributing 14 points on five-for-eleven shooting, along with three assists and two steals, all under the direct guidance of his father, LeBron James. LeBron, seated courtside, actively coached his son, urging him to drive more and take pull-up shots, which Bronny successfully executed. Despite nursing a sore hip, Bronny's defensive prowess and improved offensive decision-making were praised by assistant coach Lindsey Harding. This outing highlighted his potential and the unique, high-profile developmental support he receives.</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests China's Tibet Dam May Not Cause Water Crisis for India</h2>

          <p>A new study offers a reassuring perspective on the potential impact of China's mega dam project in Tibet on India's water supply. Analyzing data from two large dams already operating upstream, Zangmu and Jiacha, since 2014, the research reveals a surprising trend: dry seasons downstream have actually become wetter. Specifically, low water flows were up by over 50 percent in February, with significant increases observed throughout the entire dry season. This evidence suggests that, contrary to initial fears of drought, the dams have so far contributed to more water availability for India.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed mathematician Hong Wang, an associate professor at New York University and soon a permanent professor in Paris, has been targeted by Chinese cyber nationalists for delivering her recent seminars in China in English. Wang is a leading contender for the prestigious Fields Medal, often regarded as the Nobel Prize of mathematics, and her lectures at top Chinese universities were reportedly full and bustling. This criticism from nationalists highlights a growing tension between international academic engagement and nationalistic sentiments within China, even as her work makes significant contributions to fields like imaging, data processing, and cryptography.</p>

          <p>China is strategically pushing boundaries in its pursuit of a new growth model, firmly centered on technological breakthroughs and industrial upgrades, by defining and prioritizing "future industries." First introduced by President Xi Jinping in 2020, this term refers to sectors with foundational technologies still in their infancy but possessing enormous potential for future economic impact. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has expanded this list to include cutting-edge areas such as humanoid robots, 6G network equipment, brain-computer interfaces, large-scale AI data centers, and next-generation large aircraft. This focused approach aims to solidify China's competitive edge in the global technology race. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British startup Better Dairy is among several global companies preparing to bring lab-grown cheese, produced without animal udders, to market in the coming years. Utilizing "precision fermentation" with genetically modified yeast to create casein, then mixing it with plant-based fats, these firms aim to replicate traditional cheese. Despite a recent decline in plant-based cheese sales, companies are targeting niche markets like frozen pizza to gain traction, hoping to improve taste and reduce costs to compete with dairy. Challenges remain regarding consumer acceptance, health perceptions, and the "ultra-processed" food debate, as they seek to revolutionize the dairy industry.</p>
