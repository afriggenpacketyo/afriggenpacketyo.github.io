          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen from a Japanese temple in 2012 and taken to South Korea, has been returned, resolving a dispute that strained relations between the two countries. The statue, owned by Kannon Temple in Tsushima, Nagasaki Prefecture, was handed over to temple representatives in South Korea after South Korea's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership. The artifact, designated as a cultural asset, is expected to be stored at a museum following a ceremony at the temple. The statue's return marks the end of a legal battle that began when a South Korean temple claimed it had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago.</p>

          <p>During President Trump's visit to Gulf states, a key objective is to secure substantial new investments in the US economy, particularly from sovereign wealth funds. The push comes amid economic challenges, including disruptions to global trade caused by new import tariffs. Trump aims to showcase his "America First" agenda by highlighting these investments and their potential for job creation and domestic manufacturing. Discussions are expected to focus on attracting greater Gulf investment into US tech firms and boosting the region's access to cutting-edge American semiconductors. While Trump courts Gulf capital, Saudi Arabia also seeks American investment in its Vision 2030 program.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering accepting a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from Qatar's royal family for use as Air Force One, with ownership transferring to the Trump presidential library foundation near the end of his term. Legal analyses from the White House counsel's office and the Department of Justice suggest the gift is permissible, as it is not conditioned on any official act and is ultimately given to the U.S. Air Force and the foundation. The aircraft, valued at approximately $400 million, would require modifications to meet U.S. military specifications. The article also notes the ongoing delays and cost overruns in the Air Force's contract with Boeing to replace the current Air Force One fleet.</p>
