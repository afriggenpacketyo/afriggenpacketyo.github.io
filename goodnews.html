The surgery involves transplanting 70% of Johnston's liver into Register, with both livers expected to regenerate.

          <p>Amid parliamentary deadlock in France, there's been a surge in remembrance policy initiatives. These initiatives aim to recognize and symbolically heal historical injustices, including posthumously promoting Alfred Dreyfus, recognizing returnees from Indochina, and addressing Haiti's "double debt." While these symbolic gestures have gained momentum, they contrast with the ongoing failure to address structural reforms. Some experts see this willingness to take historical responsibility as social maturity, while others view it as easier than passing structural reforms.</p>

          <p>Slate Auto, an electric vehicle startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is building what it hopes will be America's newest automaker. The company is producing more than 70 vehicles for internal testing and certification. The vehicles are two-seat, two-door electric pickup trucks that can be converted to different body styles of SUVs. The vehicles feature simplified manufacturing and lower costs, two areas where other EV startups have failed. The company expects to begin deliveries by the end of next year.</p>
