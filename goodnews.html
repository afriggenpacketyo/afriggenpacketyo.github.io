          <p>AirBnB owners recounted their surprise upon discovering shirtless footage of Bill Belichick on their doorbell camera. The video, which went viral in November 2023, resurfaced amidst rumors of Belichick's relationship with Jordon Hudson. The owners initially mistook Belichick for a 'creepy old guy' or a drug dealer due to the age discrepancy between him and Hudson, who had booked the stay. Hudson later criticized the reporting on their relationship as factually incorrect and defamatory, while the university has denied reports that she was banned from the UNC football complex.</p>

          <p>Five years after the murder of George Floyd, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara is working to implement police reform and improve community relations. O'Hara acknowledges that Floyd's death remains an 'open wound' in the city, which has struggled with rising crime rates and officer shortages. He is focused on 'getting back to the basics,' reducing crime, and earning community trust by changing the department's culture, adjusting arrest tactics, and improving officer training. Despite the end of federal oversight, O'Hara is determined to continue reform efforts and restore pride in the profession.</p>

          <p>A major power outage struck the Cannes region, disrupting traffic and briefly halting events at the Cannes Film Festival on its final day.

          <p>Swiss brand On is rapidly emerging as a global competitor in the sportswear market, reporting a 40% increase in net sales for the first quarter. Analysts attribute the brand's success to its innovative designs and strategic timing, capitalizing on market shifts within Nike and Adidas. While Nike and Adidas still dominate with a combined 58% market share, On's earnings growth rate has surpassed both companies in recent quarters. The company faces potential challenges from Nike's turnaround plan and uncertainty regarding tariffs, as 90% of On's sneakers are manufactured in Vietnam.</p>

NHS England aims to provide appropriate care in a calm environment, reducing long waits in A&E. While some centers will be new units, others will be integrated into existing A&Es, but concerns have been raised about the effectiveness and funding of the scheme.</p>

Immigration lawyers report an increase in inquiries from US nationals seeking to relocate, though most settlement applications are from individuals eligible through spousal or family links.

          <p>President Trump is set to address the 2025 graduating class at West Point, marking his first military commencement address since returning to office. This visit comes five years after his previous speech, delivered amid nationwide protests following George Floyd's death. Notably, West Point is now complying with the Trump administration's executive order banning diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, sparking controversy and resignations. Trump's address is expected to emphasize his administration's shift in foreign policy and commitment to a merit-based military system.</p>

          <p>Violent crime rates in the US have experienced a significant decline, reversing the spike observed during the pandemic. The FBI's 2023 crime report showed a nearly 12% decrease in murders year over year, with further reductions in 2024, bringing murder rates in line with pre-pandemic levels. Early data for 2025 suggests a potential record low in murder rates. Despite these positive trends, public perception lags behind, with many Americans still believing that crime is on the rise. The article explores the factors driving this decrease and the reasons for the disconnect between reality and public perception.</p>

          <p>Conductor John Mauceri experienced a rapid 40-pound weight gain due to a rare condition called pericardial constriction, a thickening of the sac around the heart that prevented it from fully opening. After contracting COVID-19 in December 2024, Mauceri developed severe swelling and shortness of breath, leading to extensive testing and eventual open-heart surgery. The surgery, performed by Dr. Eugene Grossi, involved removing a thick shell of scarring from Mauceri's heart, relieving the pressure and restoring normal function. Mauceri has since recovered and returned to conducting, expressing gratitude for the added time in his life.</p>
