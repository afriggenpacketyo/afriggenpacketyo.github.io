          <p>Chinese smartphone and car manufacturer Xiaomi has expedited the launch of its latest electric vehicle, the YU7, due to high consumer interest. The YU7, an SUV seen as a competitor to Tesla's Model Y, will now be available at the end of June instead of July. This decision comes as Xiaomi ramps up production to meet the demand, after experiencing significant pre-sale inquiries that surpassed those of its first model, the SU7. The SU7 sedan, a rival to Tesla's Model 3, achieved over 70,000 orders within a month of its launch. </p>

The goal is to accelerate U.S. decoupling from Chinese high-tech while enhancing Vietnam's industrial capabilities. Vietnam is organizing meetings with local businesses to boost the supply of Vietnamese parts, but firms have warned that they need time and technology to make the transition. </p>

          <p>Hospice staff at Rowcroft Hospice in Torquay, Devon, share their perspectives on the assisted dying bill, which would allow terminally ill adults with six months or less to live the right to medically end their lives in England and Wales. While some support the bill to give terminal patients autonomy, others worry about the impact on palliative care and potential pressure on patients. Concerns are also raised about funding shortages for hospices, which rely heavily on charitable donations. The hospice aims to respect patients' rights to choose, weighing various factors before deciding whether to offer assisted dying if it becomes legal. </p>
