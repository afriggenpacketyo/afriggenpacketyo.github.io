          <p>The European Commission has put forward an ambitious new climate goal, proposing a 90% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 compared to 1990 levels. This plan builds upon the existing 2030 target and introduces more flexibility, allowing member states to use some carbon credits from non-EU countries. While intended to balance economic competitiveness with environmental action, the proposal now heads to the European Parliament and Council for debate, where it faces concerns from some nations about the potential economic impact on heavy industry.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is launching a major rebranding initiative to consolidate the logos of all its offices, embassies, and programs under a single design centered on the American flag. The move, part of a broader 'America First' overhaul of the agency, aims to create consistent branding so that U.S. contributions abroad are more clearly recognized. This visual change aligns with a significant restructuring of the department, which includes absorbing the foreign aid agency USAID and reducing domestic personnel.</p>

          <p>A Beijing-based think tank, the China Finance 40 Forum, is challenging the consensus view that China's consumption is underdeveloped. In a new report, researchers argue that mainstream metrics significantly underestimate the country's actual spending power. After adjusting for purchasing power parity and other factors, they contend that China's per capita consumption is much higher than official data suggests, potentially reaching 40 to 50 percent of levels in developed nations like Japan and Germany.

          <p>A recent drop in mortgage rates to their lowest point since April has spurred a significant increase in homeowner refinancing activity. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, applications to refinance a home loan jumped 7% last week and were 40% higher than the same period last year. While existing homeowners are taking advantage of the lower rates to save money, the market for new home purchases remained largely flat, indicating that overall uncertainty continues to affect prospective buyers.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that Israel has agreed to the 'necessary conditions' for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, urging Hamas to accept the proposal.

A Hamas official stated the group is ready to agree if the deal leads to a complete end to the war, a long-standing demand that may clash with Israel's goal of 'complete victory' over Hamas.</p>

The initiative began after faith leaders learned that many asylum seekers were being detained by ICE agents immediately following routine court appearances.
