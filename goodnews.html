          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has officially endorsed Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race, providing a crucial boost just ahead of early voting. Jeffries highlighted Mamdani's dedication to tackling the city's affordability crisis and his pledge to represent all residents, regardless of their political alignment. This high-profile endorsement follows previous support from figures like Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, solidifying Mamdani's position as a frontrunner. However, the campaign has also faced challenges, including strong criticism from Republicans regarding Mamdani's 'radically extreme' policies and a cease-and-desist letter from the New York Knicks over unauthorized use of their logo in an advertisement.</p>

          <p>Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have commenced a new round of critical trade talks in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. This high-level engagement is seen as a significant precursor to a possible summit between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, aiming to de-escalate ongoing trade tensions. The discussions focus on pivotal economic and trade relations, particularly as a temporary trade truce approaches its expiration next month. President Trump had previously threatened additional 100% tariffs on Chinese goods, underscoring the importance of these negotiations in shaping future global economic stability and bilateral relations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to South Korea, coinciding with the APEC summit, is being interpreted by experts as a 'symbolic restart' for the often-strained relationship between the two nations. Although expectations for immediate, major breakthroughs are tempered, the trip is seen as a deliberate effort to recalibrate and improve diplomatic ties. The article recalls Xi's previous visit in 2014, which culminated in a free-trade agreement, contrasting it with more recent periods of tension. Analysts suggest that this visit is a strategic step toward rebuilding trust and exploring new avenues for cooperation, particularly in the complex geopolitical landscape of the Korean peninsula, despite past disagreements on critical issues like denuclearization.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Portland, Oregon, Karin Immergut, has rejected the Trump administration's request to immediately lift her order that blocks the deployment of federalized National Guard troops to the city. The judge's decision cited two main reasons: the appeals court did not fully address a key aspect of her second order, which was issued after the government's attempt to circumvent her initial ruling, and the ongoing consideration by the ninth circuit court of appeals to rehear the case. This article is one of several legal battles across various Democratic-run cities, where President Trump's attempts to deploy military forces have faced significant opposition from mayors and governors, highlighting a broader constitutional debate over presidential authority.</p>

          <p>With the onset of longer winter nights, particularly pronounced in northern UK regions, over a million individuals in the UK experience symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), a recurring seasonal depression linked to reduced daylight. This article outlines practical strategies to mitigate its effects, including a new initiative in Orkney where therapeutic lamps are being distributed from libraries. Experts advocate for developing 'light routines,' embracing outdoor activities regardless of weather, and enhancing interior spaces with natural light, candles, and comforting elements.

          <p>The Treasury Select Committee of MPs has issued a strong recommendation against Chancellor Rachel Reeves cutting the cash ISA tax-free allowance in the forthcoming Budget. The committee argues that such a reduction is improbable to effectively foster an investment culture within the UK. Facing an estimated £22 billion budget shortfall, Reeves had reportedly considered reducing the cash ISA limit from £20,000 to £10,000 to incentivize investments in stocks and shares. This article highlights the broad opposition to this potential change from financial institutions and consumer advocates, who emphasize the widespread use and importance of cash ISAs for savers, urging the Chancellor to reconsider any such proposals.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is experiencing a subtle but significant shift in driving preferences, with automatic cars now constituting one-third of vehicles on the road and a quarter of driving tests taken in automatics last year. This growing trend is largely influenced by the upcoming 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars, given that electric vehicles are exclusively automatic. New drivers face a dilemma: learning manual offers greater versatility, but automatic tests are often perceived as quicker to pass. This article explores the challenges, including the scarcity and higher expense of automatic instructors, and the lingering social stigma associated with an automatic-only license, even as the long-term trajectory points towards automatics becoming the prevailing standard.</p>

          <p>Counting of votes is scheduled to commence on Saturday for the Irish presidential election, where citizens cast their ballots to select the 10th Irish president, who will succeed the current head of state, Michael D Higgins. The race featured two primary contenders, Catherine Connolly, an independent politician backed by left-wing parties, and Heather Humphreys, the Fine Gael candidate. A third candidate, Jim Gavin, had withdrawn from the race but his name remained on the ballot due to legal timelines. Early unofficial reports indicate that voter turnout might be notably low, potentially struggling to surpass the record low of just under 40% recorded in the 2018 presidential election.

          <p>Magnesium, often touted as the 'miracle mineral' of the moment, is experiencing a surge in popularity as a supplement for various health benefits, driving a booming global market. While social media influencers promote its efficacy for improving sleep, digestion, and mental well-being, dietitians caution that robust scientific evidence supporting these claims for healthy individuals is often insufficient. Although magnesium is crucial for over 300 bodily processes, detecting a deficiency is challenging. This article explores personal testimonials of improved sleep, yet emphasizes that dietary intake should be prioritized. It also warns that excessive supplementation can lead to adverse effects like diarrhea, or, critically for individuals with kidney disease, a potentially life-threatening condition called hypermagnesemia.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has announced the hiring of 36 new immigration judges, including 25 temporary appointments, representing the first cohort to join the Executive Office for Immigration Review following several months of workforce reductions.

The initiative aims to bolster the integrity and capacity of the immigration court system, which has faced a backlog of millions of cases exacerbated by the Trump administration's aggressive immigration policies and previous layoffs.
