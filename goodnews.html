          <p>Former Yokozuna Hakuho is reportedly planning to retire from the Japan Sumo Association due to the ongoing uncertainty surrounding his Miyagino stable. The stable was closed in April 2024 after a wrestler was found to have physically abused junior wrestlers, leading to the transfer of its members to another stable. The future of the Miyagino stable remains unresolved, and the association's board is expected to discuss the matter at an upcoming meeting. Hakuho, a record-breaking champion, retired from competition in 2021 and became a stablemaster the following year, and his retirement as elder Miyagino is likely to be followed by a press conference.</p>

          <p>Costco reported quarterly earnings and revenue that exceeded estimates, with sales jumping 8% year-over-year, though shares dipped slightly. The company acknowledged challenges and increased costs due to tariffs, but does not provide an annual outlook. Costco is known for its competitive prices and bulk discounts, potentially benefiting from economic worries and tariff policies. About a third of Costco's U.S. sales are goods brought in from other countries, with items imported from China representing about 8% of total US sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Volkswagen plans to make a "massive" investment in the U.S. to mitigate the impact of potential tariffs. CEO Oliver Blume has been in direct talks with the Trump administration, hoping that the investment will influence the decision on auto import tariffs. The company intends to build on its partnership with Rivian with "further, massive investments." Trump‚Äôs tariffs on car imports will hit Porsche particularly hard as its cars sold in the US are almost exclusively manufactured in Germany. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Harvard University has fired a tenured professor, Francesca Gino, for data falsification, marking the first such action in approximately 80 years. The decision follows accusations that Gino manipulated data in multiple published papers, with an investigation confirming the misconduct. The case highlights the broader issue of scientific fraud in academia and the need for stronger measures to detect and punish such behavior. Harvard's action may signal a shift toward greater accountability in addressing scientific misconduct.</p>

          <p>"Mountainhead," written and directed by Jesse Armstrong, is a timely film about tech billionaires gathering for a poker weekend as AI-powered tools cause a global crisis. The film stars Steve Carell, Cory Michael Smith, Jason Schwartzman, and Ramy Youssef. Armstrong aimed to capture the power and hubris of wealthy men who try to rewire the world. The movie is a targeted strike at the myth of tech genius, albeit with a far darker tenor.</p>
