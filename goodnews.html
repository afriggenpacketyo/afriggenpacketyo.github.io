          <h2>Wharton Professor Discusses AI's Impact on the Future of Work</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 11:21:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wharton professor Ethan Mollick suggests that while artificial intelligence is not yet ready to fully replace human jobs, it poses a significant concern for the entry-level workforce. In an interview, Mollick explained that the primary challenge is not learning to use AI, but developing the expertise needed to oversee it, as traditional apprenticeship paths may disappear. He advises that jobs with multiple bundled tasks, like those of doctors, are more resilient to being replaced than single-focus roles. Mollick emphasizes that organizational leaders must articulate a clear vision for AI integration rather than expecting employees to figure it out individually.</p>

          <p>The Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has launched a program to deliver essential supplies like food and medicine to parishioners who are afraid to leave their homes due to immigration raids. This initiative responds to heightened fear within the immigrant community following a nationwide crackdown by the Trump administration that has resulted in thousands of arrests in the region. Archbishop José H. Gómez stated the fund is designed to help good, hard-working people who are anxious about being arrested and deported. The program, supported by donations, will utilize delivery systems established during the pandemic to reach those in need.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's top football clubs are driving a massive summer spending spree, with Liverpool and Chelsea leading the way by investing over £269 million and £212 million respectively. Reigning champions Liverpool have made record-breaking deals, including the signing of Florian Wirtz for a potential £116 million. Arsenal and Manchester United have also spent heavily to bolster their squads, with total expenditures for the top clubs approaching two-thirds of the league's total spending. This concentration of financial power raises questions about the Premier League's competitiveness, which had appeared more open just months ago before the traditional hierarchy reasserted itself.</p>

          <h2>Financial Strategies to Help Retirees Delay Claiming Social Security Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 10:39:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With more Americans claiming Social Security at the earliest possible age of 62, financial experts are highlighting strategies to delay benefits and secure larger monthly payments for life. To bridge the income gap, retirees can consider investing in an immediate or deferred income annuity, which can provide a steady stream of funds until they reach age 70. Another option for homeowners is a reverse mortgage, which allows them to tap into their home equity without having to make repayments until they sell or move. Finally, making catch-up contributions to tax-advantaged retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs can build a crucial financial cushion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, President Donald Trump stated he believes the central bank is prepared to start lowering interest rates. Trump characterized the meeting as positive and interpreted Powell's comments on the country's economic well-being as a signal for future rate cuts. This comes after months of the president publicly pressuring the Fed for monetary policy easing to stimulate the economy. White House officials have also continued to advocate for lower rates and a review of the Federal Reserve's operations and management. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the long and varied history of fountains, from their practical origins in ancient civilizations to their role as modern urban spectacles and cooling systems. Fountains first appeared nearly five millennia ago for practical and ritualistic purposes in Minoan Crete and ancient Egypt. During the Renaissance and Baroque periods in Europe, they evolved into grand symbols of power and artistry, such as Bernini's Fountain of the Four Rivers in Rome. Today, while some fountains are massive tourist attractions, many cities are adapting them with misting nozzles to provide relief from increasingly intense heatwaves, blending ancient purpose with modern necessity.</p>

Inspired to secure her career after her physician father was laid off, she spent $180,000 of her own money on fees, travel, and administrative costs to acquire the nationwide credentials. The investment has paid off, as she earned over $870,000 in 2024 from her Miami-based private practice and telehealth contracts across the country. Chacon uses her unique position to see patients in rural and underserved areas, including indigenous communities in Alaska and California.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mental health experts are highlighting the unique challenges of diagnosing and treating depression in older adults, who may face greater stigma and misdiagnosis compared to younger generations. Symptoms of depression are similar across age groups but often present more somatically in the elderly, leading physicians to misattribute them to the normal aging process. This can result in delayed recognition and more chronic conditions. Treatment is complicated by potential interactions between antidepressants and other medications. Experts stress the importance of professional diagnosis over self-diagnosis and encourage anyone with concerns to speak with a trusted health professional.</p>
