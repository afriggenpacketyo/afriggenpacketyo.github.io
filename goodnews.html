          <p>The AI industrial trade rebounded after market volatility and concerns about AI spending slowdowns. GE Vernova shares reached an all-time high, surpassing pre-DeepSeek levels, unlike Eaton and Vertiv.  Analysts attribute Vernova's success to its earlier stage in a potential revenue upcycle and a larger backlog of orders, indicating strong future revenue streams.  Recent deals with Saudi Arabia and a supportive executive order further boosted the stock.</p>

          <h2>Experts Suggest Considering Credit Card Debt Forgiveness in June</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts advise exploring credit card debt forgiveness this June due to high and persistent interest rates, the lengthy process involved, and its relatively less damaging effect on credit compared to default or bankruptcy.  Credit card interest rates are unlikely to drop significantly soon, making forgiveness a potentially worthwhile strategy. The process can take 24-48 months, so starting early is crucial.  Debt forgiveness demonstrates a commitment to repayment to future creditors.</p>
