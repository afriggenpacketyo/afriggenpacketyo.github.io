          <p>SoftBank Group has announced its second straight quarter of profit, exceeding market expectations with a reported 421.8 billion yen for the first fiscal quarter. The positive performance was primarily driven by a $4.8 billion gain in its technology-focused Vision Fund segment, which itself posted a profit of 451.4 billion yen. This financial upswing occurs as the Japanese conglomerate continues its significant investments in artificial intelligence, including a major funding round for OpenAI and the proposed acquisition of chip designer Ampere Computing. The report highlights a recovery for the firm, which recently posted its first annual profit in four years. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CEO of Deoleo, the world's largest olive oil producer, has expressed cautious optimism for the industry, citing a strong harvest and stabilizing market conditions. A bumper crop, particularly in Spain, has helped lower raw material prices by 50%, allowing for reduced shelf prices and stimulating consumer demand. This marks a significant turnaround from a recent crisis caused by poor yields, extreme weather, and high inflation, which led to record-high prices. The company now anticipates a more balanced market and is doubling its investment in advertising to reinforce olive oil's status as a staple. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's trade data for July revealed surprisingly strong performance, with exports growing 7.2% year-over-year, significantly beating economists' forecasts. Imports also saw their largest increase in a year, rising 4.1% and suggesting a recovery in domestic demand. This economic strength comes as a U.S. tariff truce deadline approaches, with analysts noting that businesses may be front-loading shipments to avoid potential new duties. Despite the overall positive numbers, exports to the U.S. continued to decline, a trend offset by increased trade with markets in Southeast Asia and the European Union. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore is retiring after a 25-year career, just months after returning from a challenging and prolonged mission aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. Wilmore, along with astronaut Suni Williams, piloted the vehicle's first crewed test flight, which was marred by thruster failures and gas leaks. The issues forced an extended stay on the International Space Station, lasting over nine months instead of the planned eight days, as engineers assessed the spacecraft's safety. Throughout the ordeal, both astronauts maintained they were prepared for the extended mission and pushed back against narratives that they were stranded in space.</p>

          <p>British athlete Jonathan Edwards has expressed mixed feelings about his triple jump world record of 18.29m, which has remained unbroken for 30 years since it was set in 1995. While proud of his achievement, Edwards suggests that the record's longevity may not be a positive sign for the health and evolution of athletics. He attributes the lack of new record-holders partly to financial incentives, arguing that talented young athletes are often drawn to more lucrative sports over track and field. Despite advancements in sports science and technology, only seven other men in history have managed to jump beyond the 18-meter mark.</p>

          <p>Nearly 200 days into his presidency, Donald Trump may be moving closer to his campaign promise of ending the war in Ukraine within 24 hours. Recent developments suggest a potential shift in diplomatic channels, with Trump mentioning "great progress" in talks between his envoy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. This has led to speculation about a possible meeting between the two leaders and whether Russia is now more inclined to agree to a ceasefire. While the outcome remains uncertain, the change in tone indicates that previously stalled negotiations may be gaining new momentum.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Study Suggests Genes Unique to Humans May Drive Both Intelligence and Cancer</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 01:00:08 EDT</div>

          <p>A new study from China has identified 37 young "de novo" genes, which are unique to humans and may be linked to both advanced cognitive abilities and the development of cancer. Unlike most genes that evolve from existing ones, these emerge from previously non-functional DNA. Researchers found that the expression of these novel genes was significantly higher in tumors, and that suppressing them could inhibit cancer cell growth. This finding suggests that some of the very genetic traits that contribute to human uniqueness could also function as "dormant bombs," predisposing individuals to certain diseases.</p>

          <p>This weekend, Jen Pawol is set to become the first woman to umpire a Major League Baseball regular-season game, officiating the series between the Miami Marlins and the Atlanta Braves. The 48-year-old from New Jersey has been umpiring in the minor leagues since 2016 and has worked MLB spring training games for the past two years. Her debut marks a significant milestone, following in the footsteps of other female officials who broke barriers in prominent men's professional sports leagues. These pioneers include Sarah Thomas in the NFL and Violet Palmer in the NBA.</p>

          <h2>Major Study Suggests Lithium May Protect Aging Brains from Alzheimer's Disease</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 22:58:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A groundbreaking new study from Harvard Medical School suggests that the element lithium, commonly used as a mood stabilizer, may play a crucial role in brain health and protection against Alzheimer's disease. Researchers found that lithium is naturally present in the body and essential for normal cell function. In experiments with mice, maintaining normal lithium levels protected them from brain changes associated with Alzheimer's, while depleting it accelerated the disease's hallmarks, like plaque buildup and memory loss. The findings could pave the way for new diagnostic tests and treatments for the neurodegenerative disorder.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's stock market extended its gains for a fourth consecutive day, buoyed by surprisingly strong trade data from mainland China. The Hang Seng Index rose 0.5%, with the tech index showing similar gains, as robust July export figures bolstered investor confidence in the region's economic momentum. The positive data has led some economists to predict that China is on track to meet its 5% GDP growth target for the year. Major stocks like Alibaba Group Holding and ZTO Express saw significant rallies ahead of their interim earnings reports. (not investment advice)</p>
