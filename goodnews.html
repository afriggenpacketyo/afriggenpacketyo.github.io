          <p>A research team in China is attempting to reconstruct the Houfeng Didong Yi, a nearly 2,000-year-old seismoscope invented by polymath Zhang Heng. Historical texts describe the ornate device as an urn with eight dragons, each holding a bronze ball, which would drop a ball into a toad's mouth below to indicate the direction of a distant earthquake. Despite its legendary status, some scholars have dismissed it, and it was even removed from Chinese school curricula in 2017. The new project, supported by modern science, aims to restore the ancient invention's reputation and understand its sophisticated mechanics.</p>

A partnership between Netflix, WWE, and Words + Pictures had been working on the film since the previous year, with Hogan himself contributing over 20 hours of interviews. This project provides a final opportunity for fans to gain an in-depth look at the life and career of the man born Terry Bollea. The documentary adds to Netflix's growing portfolio of sports content, capturing the story of a figure credited with bringing professional wrestling into the mainstream.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight bound for Miami was evacuated on the runway at Denver International Airport due to a landing gear issue during takeoff. The Boeing 737 MAX 8, carrying 173 passengers and six crew members, experienced a problem with a tire, which prompted a response from the Denver Fire Department. All individuals were safely deplaned and transported back to the terminal, with only one person requiring medical attention for a minor injury. The incident caused a temporary ground stop at the airport, but operations later returned to normal, and the affected passengers were rebooked on a replacement aircraft.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service is celebrating its 250th anniversary, marking the occasion with an event at the Smithsonian's National Postal Museum and the release of new commemorative stamps. Founded on July 26, 1775, the agency has been a crucial part of American infrastructure and unification. The celebration occurs amid recent discussions about the agency's future, including potential privatization, though the new Postmaster General has stated his opposition to such a move. The anniversary event highlights the Postal Service's long history, from its first Postmaster General, Benjamin Franklin, to its modern role in connecting the nation.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, but an MRI revealed no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament. The diagnosis comes as a relief, as a more severe injury could have ended his season. Judge, who leads the major leagues in batting average and OPS, received a platelet-rich plasma injection and is expected to miss 10 days to two weeks. He first felt the pain during a game against Toronto and hopes to return initially as a designated hitter once the strain has healed.</p>

          <p>Following Ozzy Osbourne's passing, this article reflects on his unexpected second wave of fame as a reality TV star in the early 2000s. The MTV show "The Osbournes," which also featured his wife Sharon and children Kelly and Jack, pioneered the "reality sitcom" genre by blending mundane family life with rock-star celebrity. Before the Kardashians, the show captivated millions by portraying the Black Sabbath frontman as a lovable, bumbling father, creating a new format that heavily influenced future celebrity-driven reality programming. Producers and critics reflect on how the show's authentic, often chaotic, family dynamic resonated with audiences and changed television.</p>

          <p>With the England women's team in the Euro 2025 final, this article explores the intense physical and emotional reactions fans experience during crucial matches.

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in several decades, with average temperatures in July running below normal. Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray weather to a misplaced high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface. While inland areas of California are facing extreme heat, the Bay Area has remained locked in a cool, drizzly pattern. Although some residents are enjoying the temperate conditions, experts caution that the region's hottest months, September and October, are still to come, and a heatwave could still be on the horizon.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to better protect pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, particularly from new residential developments. Under the proposed changes, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing, aiming to prevent closures that threaten cultural hubs. The reforms also seek to streamline the process for opening new establishments in disused shops and encourage outdoor activities like al fresco dining. While the government hopes this will revitalize struggling town centers, the opposition argues that Labour's broader tax policies have been detrimental to the hospitality industry.</p>
