          <p>Japanese golfer Mao Saigo shot a 6-under-par 65, highlighted by a rare albatross on the par-5 3rd hole, positioning her one stroke behind the leader at the ShopRite LPGA Classic.

She finished the second round tied for second with fellow Japanese player Ayaka Furue and Americans Jennifer Kupcho and Elizabeth Szokol. Saigo expressed satisfaction with her score, despite feeling her iron and tee shots could have been more accurate; her current score is promising.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have created an artificial retina using the rare mineral tellurium, restoring sight in blind animals and granting them the ability to see infrared light. The nanowire implants convert visible light and infrared radiation into electrical signals, bypassing the need for auxiliary equipment. This breakthrough holds promise for treating human blindness and potentially providing enhanced vision capabilities.

          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates, offering a new approach to addressing demographic challenges in countries like China. The research indicates that subsidies for fathers result in greater long-term fertility gains compared to solely subsidizing mothers. This proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The study highlights the need to address traditional gender roles in childcare to effectively boost birth rates.</p>

The company's Android smartphones and feature phones will no longer include the Docomo emoji set, as Google's emoji have become more globally prevalent. Introduced in 1999 with the i-mode service, Docomo's emoji gained immense popularity in Japan and were later included in the Museum of Modern Art's collection.

However, many founders and VCs argue that the '996' culture is unsustainable and clashes with European values and regulations.
