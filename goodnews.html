          <p>This article outlines what businesses and services are open or closed on Juneteenth in 2025, now a federally recognized holiday. Most businesses, including Walmart, Target, Costco, and many fast-food chains, will remain open, though hours may vary by location, so it is best to check local store hours. However, banks and the stock market will be closed, as will U.S. Postal Service retail locations, although UPS and FedEx will operate normally. The article serves as a practical guide for planning activities on this holiday. Optimism regarding the holiday stems from the general freedom to continue commerce.</p>

          <p>President Trump questioned the immigration status of workers installing new flagpoles at the White House, in what appeared to be a jesting manner. The remarks came after a reporter asked Trump about his administration's deportation efforts. Trump made the comments while standing with the construction workers who had just erected two 88-foot-tall flagpoles on the White House grounds. The incident underscores the president's focus on immigration policy, even in seemingly unrelated contexts.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has ruled out dissolving the House of Representatives for the time being, meaning elections for both parliamentary chambers will not occur simultaneously in July. The decision comes as opposition leader Yoshihiko Noda stated he will not submit a no-confidence motion against Ishiba's Cabinet, citing concerns about stalling progress on key political issues. Ishiba had previously indicated he would dissolve the lower house if such a motion was presented. The House of Councillors election is expected to proceed as planned in July, amidst ongoing challenges such as trade disputes with the United States.

The training is rigorous, requiring spatial reasoning, short-term memory, and the ability to maintain calm under pressure.

          <p>A gold-plated iron knife and fragments of armor, believed to have been made using advanced 5th-century techniques, have been confirmed as originating from Japan's largest ancient keyhole-shaped tomb mound. The Daisen Kofun, controlled by the Imperial Household Agency, is thought to be the mausoleum of Emperor Nintoku, though academic debate continues about the actual occupant. The artifacts were acquired by Kokugakuin University from an art dealer and had previously been held by a collector who participated in a survey of the tomb in 1872.

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda are scheduled to sign a US-brokered peace agreement on June 27 in Washington, aimed at ending fighting in eastern Congo. The agreement includes provisions on respect for territorial integrity, a prohibition of hostilities, and the disengagement, disarmament, and conditional integration of non-state armed groups. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will witness the signing ceremony. The deal builds on a declaration of principles signed in April and aims to attract Western investment to the mineral-rich region. The deal's success hinges on the commitment of all parties, including the Congo River Alliance.</p>
