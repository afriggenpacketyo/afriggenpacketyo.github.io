          <p>Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron are co-chairing a Franco-German Ministerial Council in Toulon, the first since Germany’s government change. The meeting brings together ten ministers from each side to focus on economic and security policy, with both leaders emphasizing the importance of their partnership for Europe's future. Simultaneously, Germany's defense and foreign affairs ministers are meeting counterparts in Copenhagen to discuss military aid for Ukraine and the situation in Gaza, addressing Russia's recent airstrikes and potential EU measures. Macron stressed the renewed partnership could drive Europe forward, while Merz called it an axis within the EU. The current political crisis in France adds complexity to the discussions.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are expected to open with mixed results as investors focus on inflation data from major European economies and the United States. Price rise data is anticipated from France, Spain, Italy, and Germany, preceding the flash August reading for the euro area, while U.S. investors will monitor the personal consumption expenditures price index. Market sentiment has been influenced by French political developments, concerns over Fed independence, and earnings reports from chip giant Nvidia, but the regional Stoxx 600 index is on track for a gain of nearly 1.4% in August. Spirits maker Remy Cointreau has adjusted its expected impact from U.S. tariffs, and the EU has proposed removing tariffs on U.S. industrial goods.</p>

          <h2>China Reveals VTOL Drone Resembling UFO 'Gimbal' Spotted by US Navy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 02:21:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has unveiled a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) drone with a design strikingly similar to the unidentified flying object known as "Gimbal," which was spotted by US Navy pilots in 2015. This new aircraft features an elliptical, ringlike wing that seamlessly integrates a straight central wing section, forming a closed-loop structure. Four rotors are mounted at junctions between the elliptical wings and vertical stabilizers, serving as both lift generators and structural reinforcements. While still experimental, this drone represents a radical change in aerodynamic design that could improve endurance, stability, and multi-mission versatility in uncrewed flight.</p>

          <p>Coco Gauff expressed gratitude to gymnast Simone Biles for providing support during her challenging second-round match at the US Open against Donna Vekic. Gauff, visibly emotional due to double faults, managed to secure a 7-6 (7-5) 6-2 victory with Biles in the crowd. Gauff revealed that Biles' presence and example of handling pressure inspired her to overcome her struggles on the court, as she had recently reshuffled her team to address her serving issues. Despite the difficulties, Gauff's resilience and groundstroke performance helped her secure the win, and she will now face Magdalena Frech in the next round.</p>

          <p>DJ Admin, also known as Rick Jansen, is the DJ responsible for entertaining Max Verstappen's devoted 'Orange Army' at the Dutch Grand Prix in Zandvoort. Jansen, who sees Verstappen as a national icon, began his F1 journey in 2014 and has witnessed the sport's evolution under Liberty Media. The atmosphere in the Verstappen grandstands is known for its football-like energy, and Jansen's sets are heavily influenced by the desires of the Orange Army, though he must be cautious with certain song lyrics. With Zandvoort's departure from the F1 calendar after 2026, Jansen notes a slight decrease in attendance, influenced by rising ticket prices and the unchanging location of the Verstappen stands.</p>

          <p>Naomi Osaka has criticized Jelena Ostapenko's remarks to Taylor Townsend, stating that calling Townsend "no class" and "no education" was "one of the worst things you could say to a black tennis player." Ostapenko's comments followed her loss to Townsend at the US Open, with the Latvian player claiming Townsend had not apologized after a net cord landed in her favor. Osaka emphasized the historical context of such remarks, noting that they are particularly hurtful given the history of racial stereotypes. While Townsend did not perceive a racial undertone, Osaka believes Ostapenko will not repeat such statements.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 01:51:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>From January next year, all young children in England and Wales will be offered a free chickenpox vaccine by the NHS, administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months of age, combined with the MMR jab. This initiative aims to protect children from severe complications of chickenpox and reduce the financial burden on parents who have to take time off work to care for sick children. The Department of Health and Social Care estimates that chickenpox causes approximately £24 million in lost income and productivity annually in the UK, and the vaccine will dramatically reduce the number of chickenpox cases overall. Scotland and Northern Ireland are also expected to offer the vaccine on the NHS, though a date has not been set yet.</p>

He recounted the emotional experience of leaving Everton and the last-minute nature of the transfer, which led to him wearing his wife's cousin's jumper when signing for United. Rooney also mentioned that Chelsea was interested, but a loan deal to Middlesbrough deterred him.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit signals a potential improvement in relations between the two countries amid economic challenges. Despite lingering suspicions and border disputes, both nations face tariff pressures from Washington, prompting discussions on reluctant cooperation. While experts remain skeptical about a long-lasting friendship, the visit could signal a willingness to find common ground, particularly in addressing trade imbalances and market access issues. China's relationship with Pakistan remains a point of contention, but economic necessity may drive both countries to strengthen trade ties and address mutual needs such as rare earths and market access for Chinese companies.</p>

          <p>Kneecap, an Irish rap trio, are set to perform a home gig in South Belfast supporting Fontaines DC after a year marked by political controversy and police investigations.

The group has faced criticism for their pro-Palestinian stance, leading to calls for their US work visas to be revoked and police investigations into past performances. Despite the controversy, Kneecap has garnered international success and support from other artists, highlighting their challenge to the establishment.</p>

          <p>Russia's state space agency, Roscosmos, intends to conduct the first test launch of the Soyuz-5 rocket in December, despite facing funding shortages since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Soyuz-5, viewed as a medium-class launch vehicle, is equipped with RD-171MV engines and is expected to become fully operational in 2028, and will be able to balance a roughly 17-ton payload. The war in Ukraine has significantly impacted Russia's space sector, leading to the severing of ties with the European Space Agency and the loss of the launch pad in Kourou, French Guiana. Roscosmos is now looking to launch the Soyuz-5 from Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome, and is paying Kazakhstan $115 million annually to lease the complex until 2050.</p>
