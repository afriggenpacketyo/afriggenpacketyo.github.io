          <p>Adam Coy, a former Columbus police officer, has received a mandatory sentence of 15 years to life in prison for the 2020 murder of Andre Hill. Hill, an unarmed Black man, was holding a cellphone and keys in a garage when Coy fatally shot him. During the sentencing, Coy maintained his actions were justified and stated his intent to appeal, while Hill's family described him as a gentle man. The case, which highlighted delays in rendering medical aid, previously resulted in a $10 million settlement for Hill's family.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has discussed a new European-led peace plan for Gaza with U.S. President Donald Trump, following the breakdown of American-led negotiations. The proposal, developed in coordination with France and Germany, aims to provide immediate humanitarian relief and establish a clear path toward a two-state solution. The initiative comes amid increasing international pressure and a call from over 250 MPs for the UK to immediately recognize Palestinian statehood, a step the government has described as a matter of "when, not if."</p>

Iona is projected to strengthen into a Category 2 hurricane before gradually weakening later in the week as it moves westward.

In a discussion with Andrew Huberman, Norton explained that research indicates people with obesity who lose more weight early on are more likely to maintain their progress. This is because significant initial results can strengthen commitment, though he emphasized that such an aggressive approach is a short-term tool that must be followed by a more sustainable lifestyle change.</p>

This sale was the most expensive of the month, with LA-area properties dominating the top national sales, fueled by demand from buyers displaced by wildfires and a resurgence of interest from foreign investors.</p>
