          <p>NASCAR Xfinity Series driver Connor Zilisch, 19, sustained a broken collarbone after an accident during his victory celebration at Watkins Glen. After winning the race, Zilisch was climbing onto his car's roof when he slipped and fell headfirst onto the ground. He was transported to a hospital but later confirmed that while his head scans were clear, he did break his collarbone. The incident concluded an eventful day for the driver, who also wrecked a teammate while battling for the lead earlier in the race.</p>

          <p>In the men's Hundred cricket tournament, Southern Brave defeated Birmingham Phoenix by a decisive nine-wicket margin. The Brave's formidable bowling attack, featuring Jofra Archer and Michael Bracewell, restricted the Phoenix to a low score of just 106-7. In response, the Brave's batters, led by an unbeaten 48 from Leus du Plooy, easily chased down the target with 19 balls remaining.

          <p>Actor Tom Hanks has paid tribute to astronaut Jim Lovell, who passed away at the age of 97. Hanks, who portrayed Lovell in the 1995 film "Apollo 13," described him as a leader who dared to guide others to extraordinary places. The film depicted the perilous 1970 lunar mission where an oxygen tank explosion forced the crew to abort their moon landing and undertake a dangerous journey back to Earth. Hanks honored Lovell's life of courage and exploration, which was driven by challenge rather than fame.</p>

          <p>Wall Street is focused on upcoming inflation data, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) releases expected to heavily influence the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision. Following a weak July jobs report, traders are now largely anticipating a rate cut in September, but a surprisingly high inflation reading could shift expectations again. Economists will be closely watching for any impact from existing tariffs on prices, as the Fed weighs concerns about slowing economic growth against the risk of reaccelerating inflation.

          <h2>Japanese Practice of 'Forest Bathing' Gains Popularity for Stress Reduction and Improved Focus</h2>

          <p>The Japanese practice of "forest bathing," or shinrin-yoku, is gaining traction as a method for improving mental well-being. The mindfulness technique involves immersing oneself in nature to connect with the environment through all senses, which research shows can lower stress and enhance focus. Certified guides lead sessions that encourage quiet reflection and meditation, but experts note the benefits can be achieved even with short, 15-minute sessions in a local park or backyard. The key is to disconnect from technology and be present in the natural surroundings.</p>

          <p>In a humorous commentary, author David Sedaris reflects on the awkwardness and pressure of modern tipping practices, particularly with automated payment screens. He recounts an experience at an airport breakfast spot where he was prompted to tip 22% for a service in which he placed his own order and seated himself. Sedaris wryly observes the internal conflict of feeling like a "cheapskate" for not selecting the highest option, even when the service rendered seems minimal. He humorously questions the logic behind the transaction and the guilt associated with it.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Three cardiologists have identified licorice root as a supplement that individuals with high blood pressure should never take. The herb contains a compound called glycyrrhizin, which can dangerously elevate blood pressure by causing the body to retain sodium and lose potassium. This imbalance strains the cardiovascular system and can lead to serious complications, including headaches, fluid retention, and arrhythmias. Experts advise that even consuming black licorice candy can be risky and recommend consulting a doctor before starting any new supplement.</p>
