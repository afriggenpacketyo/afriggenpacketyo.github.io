          <h2>Germany Explores Ways to Foster a Stronger Startup Culture Among Youth</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 05:49:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant gap exists in Germany between the number of young people interested in entrepreneurship and those who actually start a company, prompting calls for better support systems. The success of startups like Knowunity, a peer-to-peer learning app founded by teenagers, highlights the potential, but many are deterred by financial insecurity and a lack of business knowledge. Researchers suggest that providing basic income security in the first year, along with mentorship, could unlock the potential for an additional 1.6 million startups. Experts advocate for integrating entrepreneurship into school curricula to cultivate a more robust startup ecosystem.</p>

          <p>In a major blow to one of Mexico's most powerful drug trafficking organizations, U.S. law enforcement has seized over $10 million in cryptocurrency linked to the Sinaloa cartel. The seizure was part of a nationwide operation that also confiscated vast quantities of fentanyl and methamphetamine. This action highlights the increasing use of digital assets by criminal enterprises for money laundering and the coordinated efforts by agencies like the DEA and FBI to counter these methods. The operation comes shortly after Ovidio Guzman Lopez, son of the infamous "El Chapo," pleaded guilty to drug charges in a U.S. court.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Goldman Sachs is set to announce its second-quarter earnings, with Wall Street analysts anticipating strong results driven by market volatility and a rebound in investment banking. According to LSEG estimates, the bank is expected to report earnings of $9.53 per share on $13.47 billion in revenue. The firm is likely to have benefited from increased trading activity spurred by President Trump's tariff policies. A recovery in asset values is also expected to boost its investment banking and asset management divisions, following positive earnings reports from rivals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has signaled a significant shift in his approach to the war in Ukraine, threatening Russia with severe tariffs and announcing a new weapons deal. Under the new arrangement, NATO allies will purchase U.S. military equipment on Ukraine's behalf, ensuring a continued flow of "massive" amounts of aid. This move appears to reverse months of speculation that Trump might cut off support entirely, potentially altering Russian President Vladimir Putin's strategic calculations. While details remain vague, Trump's frustrated tone toward Putin and praise for Ukrainian courage mark a notable change in rhetoric.</p>

          <h2>Palm Beach County GOP Aims to Overtake Democrats in Voter Registration by 2026</h2>

          <p>The Republican Party in Palm Beach County, Florida, is launching a new strategy with the goal of surpassing Democrats in voter registration by the 2026 midterm elections. The party chairman plans to aggressively target voters with no party affiliation (NPAs), who currently number over 284,000 in the county. The narrowing registration gap in President Trump's adopted home county could be pivotal for national politics, as Republicans eye two local congressional seats as potential flips. The strategy involves a "boots on the ground" effort at community events to pitch the party's platform of lower taxes and less regulation.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that American global leadership is essential for both national security and global stability. The author contends that withdrawing from the world stage creates a vacuum that adversaries like China, Iran, and Russia will fill, advancing interests contrary to those of the U.S. The piece criticizes a proposed rescission of funds for national security and international assistance, stating that such programs are smart, strategic investments that prevent crises and counter authoritarian influence. It concludes that refocusing, rather than gutting, foreign aid is crucial for projecting American strength.</p>

          <h2>American Investment in Scottish Premiership Football Grows, Reshaping the League</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 05:00:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American ownership now extends to half of the 12 clubs in the Scottish Premiership, with the San Francisco 49ers' recent purchase of Rangers being the latest example. This trend is driven by the lower cost of entry into Scottish football compared to the English Premier League, coupled with access to European competitions and multi-club ownership models. While investors see untapped potential, the influx of US money has raised concerns among fans about their clubs becoming "feeder" teams for larger counterparts. The hope is that new investment can help revitalize a league long dominated by Celtic and Rangers.</p>

          <p>As Major League Baseball pauses for its All-Star break, key storylines include the surprising dominance of the Detroit Tigers, who hold their largest division lead at this point since 1933. Widespread bullpen struggles across the league, driven by pitcher injuries and overuse, have become a major point of fan frustration. The controversial "torpedo bats" have not upended the game as some feared, while the Colorado Rockies are on pace for a historically poor season. Meanwhile, issues like competitive imbalance and the league's media rights continue to loom over the sport's second half.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Colorado, California, and Montana have enacted new privacy laws to protect "neural data"—information generated by a person's brain and nervous system. The legislation is a response to the rise of consumer wearable devices, like headphones and earbuds, that measure brain activity to monitor things like sleep and focus. Advocates worry that without regulation, this highly sensitive data could be exploited by companies or read in the future with more advanced AI. The new laws generally require express consent to collect or share brain data and give consumers the right to have their information deleted.</p>

          <p>For the first time in four years, Huawei has become the top-selling smartphone brand in mainland China, capturing an 18.1% market share in the second quarter, according to IDC. This resurgence highlights the company's strong brand appeal, even as its shipments saw a slight year-over-year decline. The overall Chinese smartphone market, however, contracted by 4%, reflecting weak consumer spending and reduced government subsidies. Apple, which ranked fifth, saw the smallest shipment decline among the top brands, benefiting from strategic price adjustments that made certain iPhone models eligible for subsidies.</p>

          <h2>Linguists Note the Rise of 'Y'all' as America's Preferred Second-Person Plural Pronoun</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The word "y'all," once a distinctly Southern American term, has become increasingly popular across the United States, especially among younger generations. Linguists attribute its rise to its utility in filling a gap in standard English for a clear second-person plural, and its inclusive, gender-neutral nature. The term's spread has been aided by long-term migration patterns and its prominent use in both country and hip-hop music. Its origins are believed to be a blend of Scots-Irish and West African linguistic influences, making it a uniquely American expression that is now gaining mainstream acceptance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a reported decline in popularity, the recorder remains a cherished gateway instrument for teaching music fundamentals to young children in many schools. Educators praise it for being inexpensive, easy for small hands to manage, and simple for beginners to produce a sound, unlike other woodwinds. Originally a prominent instrument during the Renaissance, favored by figures like King Henry VIII, it was revived in the 20th century as a teaching tool. While often seen as a simple toy, experts note that the recorder is a serious instrument that is difficult to master.</p>
