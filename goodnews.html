          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region demonstrated mixed performance, influenced by a technology-driven rally on Wall Street. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw volatility, initially hitting a record high before closing lower following the prime minister's resignation announcement, which some analysts believe could lead to new fiscal stimulus. Meanwhile, South Korea's Kospi gained, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slid, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose. Political shifts in Japan and Indonesia, where the finance minister was unexpectedly dismissed, contributed to regional uncertainty and currency fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

Following the announcement, Anglo American's London-listed shares surged 8%, while Teck Resources' shares saw a 22% increase in Frankfurt trading.

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has officially entered the contest to become the new deputy leader of the Labour Party, following the departure of Angela Rayner. She is the most senior figure to declare her candidacy so far, joining backbencher Bell Ribeiro-Addy in the race. Candidates have a tight three-day window to secure the necessary 80 nominations from fellow MPs to get on the ballot. The contest highlights different perspectives within the party, with Ribeiro-Addy calling for a discussion on "what's gone wrong" with Labour's direction, while Phillipson focuses on combating the threat from the Reform UK party.</p>

          <p>A long-standing succession battle within the Murdoch media empire has concluded with an agreement that solidifies Lachlan Murdoch's control over Fox Corp and News Corp. The deal ensures the conservative direction of outlets like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal will continue after Rupert Murdoch's death. Under the terms, siblings Prudence, Elisabeth, and James Murdoch will cease to be beneficiaries of the trust holding company shares, instead receiving approximately $1.1 billion each from the sale of their holdings. This resolution ends all litigation over the family trust and prevents the more politically moderate siblings from influencing the media conglomerate's future.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle maker Xpeng has announced plans to launch its affordable Mona series in overseas markets, including Europe, starting in 2026. This move is set to intensify competition with established automakers and other Chinese brands in the global EV space. The Mona series, which debuted in China with a starting price under $17,000, will offer more budget-friendly options compared to Xpeng's premium models. CEO He Xiaopeng also indicated the company is now open to acquiring other carmakers to navigate the competitive market, noting that Xpeng's international expansion has already exceeded its initial goals.</p>

          <p>China is pushing to finalize and sign an upgraded free-trade agreement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) by the end of the year. This "Cafta 3.0" protocol aims to broaden market access in key sectors like agriculture, digital trade, and pharmaceuticals. The initiative reflects Beijing's strategy to strengthen economic ties with its largest trading partner and diversify its exports amid shifting global supply chains and rising protectionism from the United States. The upgraded deal also includes deeper cooperation in emerging areas such as the green economy and artificial intelligence to drive industrial modernization.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New league tables ranking the performance of NHS trusts in England have been released for the first time, with specialist institutions like Moorfields Eye Hospital securing the top positions. The rankings evaluate trusts on seven key areas, including waiting times, cancer treatment, A&E performance, and financial management. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the tables are intended to increase transparency and public choice, with top-performing trusts gaining more autonomy and lower-ranked ones receiving support. However, NHS Providers, which represents the trusts, has raised concerns about whether the metrics used accurately reflect performance and could lead to unintended consequences for patient confidence.</p>

This is Baidu's second such bond issuance this year, as it takes advantage of relatively low Chinese interest rates and strong investor demand for alternatives to US dollar assets. The fundraising effort comes after the company reported a year-over-year decline in both revenue and net profit for the second quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

A recent HSBC survey confirmed this trend, with China ranking as the top target for companies looking to expand their global trade capabilities. The country's vast market, comprehensive industrial infrastructure, and talent pool continue to make it an attractive destination for international investment.</p>
