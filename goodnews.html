          <p>Chinese officials have reiterated their commitment to tackling the persistent issues of oversupply and "disorderly low-price competition" within the nation's dominant solar photovoltaic (PV) industry. During a meeting with industry leaders, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology emphasized the need for lawful governance and the phasing out of outdated production capacity to ensure healthy, sustainable development. This follows a high-level commission meeting where President Xi Jinping also called for addressing excess industrial capacity. The government is urging companies to focus on product quality to consolidate China's global advantage in the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi has expressed that the band's upcoming farewell concert in their home city of Birmingham will be a uniquely nerve-wracking experience. The show at Villa Park marks the first performance of the original lineup, including Ozzy Osbourne, in two decades, with over 40,000 fans expected to attend. Iommi acknowledged the physical toll of performing but said preparations have gone well and confirmed this will be the band's final show. He hopes the performance will end their career on a high note, viewing the band's legacy as living on through the many musicians they inspired.</p>

          <h2>California Governor Gavin Newsom's Visit to South Carolina Fuels 2028 Presidential Speculation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 22:20:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is scheduled for a two-day tour of rural South Carolina, a state with a key early presidential primary, intensifying speculation about a potential 2028 White House bid. His visit will focus on economically challenged and environmentally vulnerable counties, which the state's Democratic Party chair says is an effort to show these voters they are not forgotten. While a political advisor for Newsom denies the trip is about a presidential run, insisting the focus is on the 2026 midterms, the move follows other overtures to Southern voters. The tour will take him through several heavily Republican counties.</p>

          <p>The popular regional Mexican music group Eslabón Armado is set to perform at the Peacock Theatre in Los Angeles on July 19th, where they will present their new independent album, “Vibras de Noche II.” As children of immigrants, the band members have expressed deep concern over the current situation affecting their community, with lead singer Pedro Tovar pledging to participate in a benefit concert for affected families. In a recent interview, the group discussed their new album, which was uniquely recorded in a home studio, allowing for a more natural and less-pressured creative process. They also reflected on their strong connection with their diverse and youthful fanbase.</p>

          <p>A research team from the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health in China has announced a significant scientific development in chimera research. The scientists successfully cultivated a heart structure composed of human cells within a pig embryo, which reportedly continued to beat on its own for 21 days. To achieve this, the team genetically modified human stem cells to enhance their survival within the pig host before implanting them into early-stage pig embryos. This breakthrough follows the same team's previous success in growing human kidneys in pigs for up to 28 days, advancing the field of organ generation.</p>

          <p>South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff reported that its military has detained a person who successfully crossed the heavily fortified border from North Korea. The individual was identified and secured on Thursday in the central-west section of the Military Demarcation Line, which runs through the center of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The military confirmed the person is in custody and will be investigated by relevant authorities, but did not specify if it was a defection attempt. The crossing occurred amid recently heightened border tensions, although no unusual North Korean military activity was detected in response to the incident.</p>

She was detained in February while returning from her honeymoon in the U.S. Virgin Islands, despite having complied with ICE check-in requirements since she was a child. Born in Saudi Arabia to a family from Gaza, Sakeik has no citizenship and was in the process of obtaining a green card through her American husband. During her confinement, the government attempted to deport her twice, even after a judge barred her removal, highlighting the precarious situation of stateless individuals in the U.S. immigration system.</p>

          <p>Two new research-focused universities in China, founded by prominent business tycoons, are enrolling their first undergraduate students this summer, drawing significant national attention. Fuyao University of Science and Technology, established by glass magnate Cao Dewang, and Eastern Institute of Technology, founded by semiconductor leader Yu Renrong, represent a new trend of philanthropic efforts to advance China's goal of "scientific self-reliance." Observers predict these institutions will become highly selective and may soon compete with top public universities for students. The small initial class sizes are expected to lead to very competitive admission scores.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is expected to be out for approximately six weeks after being placed on the injured list with a bone bruise in his left knee. The injury occurred during a game against the Chicago White Sox when a runner's helmet collided with his knee during a slide into third base. While Muncy initially feared a more severe injury, an MRI revealed no structural damage, which he described as the "best-case scenario." His absence creates a significant gap in the Dodgers' lineup, as he was a top offensive performer for the team in June, leading in batting average and RBIs.</p>

While the Bank is considering moving away from historical figures, the public has proposed a wide array of themes, from classic TV characters like those from "Fawlty Towers" to famous ships, landmarks like the Angel of the North, and vintage trains. Some respondents prefer to continue honoring historical figures, while others suggest the redesign is unnecessary in an increasingly cashless society. The Bank is accepting suggestions on themes like architecture, innovation, and the arts for the next set of banknotes.</p>
