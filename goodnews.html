          <p>China's government has initiated a one-year program to subsidize interest on personal consumer loans in an effort to boost household spending and support domestic demand. The plan, announced by the Ministry of Finance and other key financial bodies, will cover one percentage point of annual interest on qualifying loans, including those for cars and education. This policy is part of a larger strategy to unlock consumer spending potential, with the central government funding 90% of the subsidy costs. The effectiveness of the program will be evaluated for potential extension or expansion after its initial run concludes next August. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Boston Red Sox third baseman Alex Bregman had a memorable return to his former home ballpark in Houston, receiving a mix of cheers and boos from Astros fans. In his first at-bat, Bregman hit a two-run home run, becoming the first MLB player in over 60 years to homer in his first road plate appearance against a team with which he won at least two World Series titles. The Astros honored him with a video tribute, which was met with a standing ovation from the crowd. Despite Bregman's historic night, the Astros ultimately won the game, continuing a tight race in the league standings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AI search startup Perplexity has made a surprise $34.5 billion bid to purchase Google's Chrome browser, a move that follows a U.S. Department of Justice proposal for Google to divest the browser. The offer, which Perplexity claims is backed by several investors, comes as the company competes in the burgeoning generative AI market. The DOJ's recommendation was part of the remedy phase of an antitrust lawsuit Google lost, with the agency arguing that a divestiture would level the playing field for search competitors. This ambitious bid highlights the aggressive strategies emerging from AI startups aiming to challenge established tech giants.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) will add questions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillator use to the car and motorcycle theory test starting in early 2026. The initiative aims to equip the roughly 2.4 million annual test-takers with basic life-saving knowledge, as drivers are often the first to arrive at emergency scenes. Learning materials have already been updated to include information on how to perform CPR and use a public access defibrillator. Officials hope this change will help prevent avoidable deaths, as immediate CPR and defibrillation can increase cardiac arrest survival rates dramatically.</p>

McConkey, who broke Allen's franchise rookie records, now learns directly from the 33-year-old on the practice field, seeking advice on route running and technique. Offensive coordinator Greg Roman highlighted the positive impact of Allen's presence, noting the flexibility he adds to the offense. The collaboration between the young standout and the seasoned veteran is seen as a significant positive for the team's versatile receiving corps heading into the season.</p>

          <h2>French President Macron Acknowledges France's Use of 'Repressive Violence' in Colonial Cameroon</h2>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has formally acknowledged that France employed "repressive violence" in Cameroon during the country's fight for independence in the 1950s. In a letter to Cameroonian President Paul Biya, Macron accepted France's role and responsibility for actions that cost tens of thousands of lives. This admission follows a 2022 report commissioned by France, which detailed mass displacements and support for brutal militias by French colonial troops, even after Cameroon's official independence in 1960. The acknowledgment is part of a broader, though sometimes criticized, effort by Macron to confront France's colonial history in Africa.</p>

          <p>Mexico has extradited 26 inmates, described as "key operatives" of powerful drug cartels like the Jalisco New Generation and Sinaloa Cartel, to the United States. The transfer is the second of its kind this year and is part of ongoing collaboration between the two nations to combat organized crime and drug trafficking. U.S. officials confirmed the individuals face charges for violent offenses and organized crime. The move comes as the White House continues to pressure Mexico to take stronger action against cartels, with the Mexican government using these extraditions to demonstrate its commitment to security cooperation.</p>

          <p>A report from the UK's Transport Committee has recommended piloting a free bus pass scheme for everyone under 22 in England to improve access to jobs and education. The report highlights that declining bus services and rising fares, which have outpaced inflation, create significant barriers for young people, particularly in rural areas. Drawing a parallel to Scotland, where under-22s already travel free, MPs argue the measure could help reverse a decade-long drop in bus usage. The proposal aims to address how limited and costly public transport can restrict opportunity and contribute to social exclusion for young people.</p>

          <p>The chief executive of Rolls-Royce, Tufan Erginbilgic, has stated that the company's plan to power AI data centers with its small modular reactors (SMRs) could make it the UK's most valuable firm. The engineering giant has already signed deals with the UK and Czech governments to provide its nuclear technology for energy-intensive AI operations. This strategic pivot into SMRs, a technology in which Rolls-Royce has unique capabilities, represents a massive potential market. This ambitious vision has contributed to a ten-fold increase in the company's share price since Erginbilgic took over in 2023. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer urged investors to remain invested in the stock market, even when political events seem tumultuous, arguing that trying to time the market is too difficult. He pointed to recent market gains following a weaker-than-expected inflation report as an example of a winning session that pessimistic sellers might have missed. Cramer acknowledged recent controversial White House actions but suggested that most are not directly related to corporate profitability, which remains strong. He advised that investors should focus on company fundamentals rather than reacting to every political headline. (not investment advice)</p>
