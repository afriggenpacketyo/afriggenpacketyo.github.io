          <p>Despite facing substantial US tariffs, China's economy displayed resilience in April, with industrial output growing by 6.1 percent year-on-year, exceeding economists' estimates. Retail sales also increased, although slightly below expectations, signaling a need to bolster domestic consumption amidst global trade uncertainties. The Politburo affirmed the importance of stabilizing employment, businesses, and markets. This economic performance occurred during a 90-day reprieve in the trade war, offering a glimpse into the impact of the tariffs before the agreement.</p>

          <p>Country music legend Alan Jackson has retired from touring after a 30-year career, citing his battle with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a degenerative nerve condition affecting his motor skills. Jackson, diagnosed in 2011, performed his final tour show in Milwaukee and plans a finale show in Nashville. He expressed gratitude for living the American dream and hinted at releasing new music, stating that songwriting is more fulfilling than touring.

          <p>The United States is considering region-based tariffs instead of individual duty rates for many countries, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The Trump administration is aiming to strike deals with key trading partners on reciprocal tariffs imposed in April. The administration paused country-specific tariffs for 90 days until early July to allow for negotiations, but his officials have struggled to make progress on so many deals in the time available. If those trading partners "do not negotiate in good faith," Trump would enforce the same tariff rates prior to the pause.</p>
