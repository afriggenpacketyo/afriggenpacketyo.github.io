        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Paramount Global is implementing a 3.5% reduction in its U.S.-based workforce, impacting several hundred employees, as part of ongoing cost-cutting measures. This decision follows previous job cuts and spending reductions outlined in a go-forward plan presented by the company's CEOs last June. The layoffs are also occurring as Paramount seeks regulatory approval for its proposed merger with Skydance Media, a move aimed at addressing the challenges posed by the decline of traditional pay-TV and macroeconomic headwinds. The company acknowledges the difficulty of these changes but emphasizes their necessity for positioning Paramount for future success, with potential impacts on the workforce outside the U.S. over time. Optimism about the company's future prospects remains cautiously optimistic amidst these restructuring efforts. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hummingbird feeders can be a valuable supplementary food source for these tiny birds, especially during migration, but dirty feeders can be deadly. Spoilage of sugar water leads to microbial growth, causing infections like candida, which swells the birds' tongues and hinders feeding. Wildlife rehabbers frequently rescue hummingbirds with feeder-related infections, emphasizing the need for regular cleaning and nectar replacement. To maintain a healthy feeder, use a 1:4 sugar-to-water ratio, avoid additives, and clean the feeder every one to three days, scrubbing with vinegar or hydrogen peroxide if mold is present. Planting native wildflowers is another way to support local hummingbird populations. </p>

          <p>TV presenter David Bull has been named the new chairman of Reform UK, succeeding Zia Yusuf, who resigned after disagreements over a burka ban. Bull, a long-time ally of Nigel Farage, will focus on providing leadership to activists, while Yusuf will lead the party's "Doge team" to cut wasteful spending in Reform-controlled councils. Farage credited Yusuf with building Reform's infrastructure and believes the party is stronger following the reshuffle. Bull has stepped down from his TalkTV role to take on the chairman position, expressing honor and paying tribute to Yusuf's contributions. </p>

          <p>Anduril, a defense technology company, has topped the 2025 CNBC Disruptor 50 list, reflecting a surge in interest and investment in the defense tech sector. This marks the first time a defense tech company has led the list in its 13-year history, with other companies like Flock Safety, Saronic Technologies, and Shield AI also featured. These four companies have a combined value exceeding $45 billion and have raised nearly $10 billion from investors, focusing on diverse areas such as security hardware, unmanned maritime vessels, and autonomous drones. The sector's growth is expected to accelerate due to increased funding and a focus on modernizing military capabilities, driven by President Trump's proposed increase in defense spending. </p>

          <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband defended the government's initial decision to cut winter fuel payments for pensioners and the subsequent partial reversal. He argued that Chancellor Rachel Reeves had to take measures to stabilize the economy, creating the "room for manoeuvre" to extend the payment to more pensioners this winter. The revised policy will provide payments to nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of ¬£35,000 or less. The Conservative shadow chancellor criticized the initial cut, while the Liberal Democrat leader highlighted the hardship faced by pensioners. </p>

Experts are exploring various explanations for this phenomenon, including rebellion against previous generations' atheism and the search for community and meaning.

The resurgence of religion among Gen Z challenges assumptions about the continued decline of faith in society. </p>

          <p>Despite a relatively quiet offseason, the San Diego Padres are holding their own in the competitive National League West, currently sitting nine games over .500 and two games out of first place. The team's success has been driven by a combination of returning talent and surprising performances from new additions, such as rookie Jackson Merrill. While the Padres did not make the splashy acquisitions of the Los Angeles Dodgers, they have remained competitive and are poised to make adjustments as the season progresses. The team's pitching depth and ability to make strategic trades will be crucial in their quest for a playoff berth. </p>
