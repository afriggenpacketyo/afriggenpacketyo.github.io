          <p>Japan has returned the remains of ten Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to Australia, marking the first such repatriation from Japan. The remains, taken during the 19th and 20th centuries for research, were held by three Japanese institutions. The handover ceremony occurred at the Australian Embassy in Tokyo, and the remains were subsequently flown to Australia. This repatriation is part of a broader global movement to return indigenous remains, addressing past injustices and facilitating healing for affected communities. The return of these remains signifies a shift in international attitudes towards recognizing and rectifying historical wrongs against First Nations people. The return of the remains to country means pathways to healing can start for all generations.</p>

          <p>The presence of a senior Taiwanese officer at a U.S. military exercise in Alaska has sparked speculation about closer defense cooperation between Taiwan and the United States. Major General Wu Chia-hsing, head of the Taiwanese air force's flight training division, observed the Red Flag Alaska 25-2 exercise, which involved 1,500 personnel and 70 aircraft from the U.S., Japan, South Korea, and other countries. Analysts suggest this move indicates the U.S. commitment to its security obligations in the region, despite potential shifts in U.S. foreign policy. The appearance of the Taiwanese commander is viewed as a positive sign for future military relations between the two nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Republican National Committee (RNC) has nearly five times more cash on hand than the Democratic National Committee (DNC), marking the widest disparity between the two parties since at least July 2020. The RNC reported having $72 million at the end of May, compared to the DNC's $15 million. This financial advantage could provide the GOP with an early boost as it prepares for the upcoming midterm elections. Some Democrats express concern that the fundraising gap reflects deeper issues within the party, while the DNC highlights a surge in grassroots support and record individual donations since February. The Republicans' financial advantage comes after a 2024 election cycle during which Tesla founder Elon Musk poured nearly $300 million into helping elect Republicans. (not investment advice)</p>

The release came as US special envoy Keith Kellogg visited Minsk and met with Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko. Tikhanovskaya expressed joy at her husband's release, while emphasizing that over 1,150 political prisoners remain incarcerated. Tikhanovsky was jailed in 2021 after a court convicted him of rallying mass protests against Lukashenko, among other charges.</p>
