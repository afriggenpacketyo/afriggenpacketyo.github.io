        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has released a model ordinance for cities to address homeless encampments and announced new funding for treatment and housing, emphasizing that there are "no more excuses" for inaction. Newsom called on cities and counties to do their part in addressing encampments, asserting the state is providing ample resources to support these efforts. The model ordinance prioritizes shelter and services while allowing local authorities to clear encampments, with Newsom stating there is "nothing compassionate about letting people die on the streets." This initiative is supported by $3.3 billion in new funding, reflecting Newsom's focus on homelessness as he nears the end of his term.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent auction at Christie's in New York revealed potential instability in the art market, as bidding on the Riggio family collection, built on the Barnes & Noble fortune, proved underwhelming. The auction house had guaranteed a minimum amount for the collection and worked to secure pre-sale bids, but the sale fell short of expectations despite a $272 million total. Experts attributed the subdued atmosphere to economic uncertainty linked to President Trump's tariffs, impacting the global art market. While some works by artists like Gerhard Richter and Vincent van Gogh sold well, the withdrawal of a major Warhol painting highlighted concerns about the Warhol market's strength.</p>

President Bola Tinubu's government has implemented economic reforms, including ending petrol subsidies and devaluing the naira currency. Despite the growth, poverty remains high, with nearly half of Nigerians living in poverty in 2024, and inflation is expected to remain above 20% throughout the year.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged by over 40% in the past year, reaching an all-time high, driven by factors like unpredictable US trade policy and geopolitical uncertainty. While gold is often seen as a safe haven asset, experts caution that it is not immune to price fluctuations and major surges have been followed by significant falls. Central banks have been net buyers of gold, seeking independence from dollar-based banking systems, and some believe that fear of missing out (FOMO) is also driving demand. Experts offer mixed opinions, with some forecasting continued upward trends and others warning of a potential market bubble. (not investment advice)</p>

Visceral fat, accumulating around the waist, can lead to inflammation and organ dysfunction, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and diabetes. While GLP-1 drugs are effective at reducing visceral fat, doctors need better ways to identify patients who would benefit most from them, as BMI has limited utility as a health metric.

          <p>The Federal Railroad Administration has engaged Elon Musk's tunneling firm, The Boring Company, to assess the costs and progress of the Frederick Douglass Tunnel program, an Amtrak project facing potential cost overruns. Transportation Department officials met with Boring Company employees, who suggested ways to build the tunnel more cheaply and efficiently. These discussions have raised concerns about Musk's conflicts of interest, given his other business ventures and his role as an advisor to President Trump. Musk has also been critical of Amtrak and large-scale rail projects.</p>

          <p>The Dallas Mavericks won the NBA draft lottery, securing the No. 1 pick and the opportunity to draft Cooper Flagg, the consensus player of the year. This comes after a season in which the Mavericks traded away Luka Donƒçiƒá, angering many fans. The Mavericks, who had only a 1.8% chance to win the lottery, bucked the odds and now have the chance to add a promising young player to their roster. Flagg averaged 19.2 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 4.2 assists while leading Duke to the Final Four in his lone college season.</p>

          <p>A museum has opened in Brnƒõnec, Czech Republic, at the site of Oskar Schindler's former textile factory, where he saved 1,200 Jews during World War II. The Museum of Survivors is dedicated to the Holocaust and the history of Jews in the region, coinciding with the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. Daniel L√∂w-Beer, whose family owned the plant before it was seized by the Nazis, spearheaded the project. The museum features exhibits on Schindler, his wife Emilie, the L√∂w-Beer family, and testimonies from Holocaust survivors, with plans for further restoration of the site.</p>

          <p>Scientists are in a race to discover why the Universe exists, with teams in the US and Japan building detectors to study neutrinos. The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune) in South Dakota and the Hyper K project in Japan aim to understand why matter prevailed over antimatter after the Big Bang. By studying the changes in neutrinos and anti-neutrinos as they travel, scientists hope to uncover the key to the Universe's existence. These international collaborations involve scientists from around the world, poised to make transformative discoveries about the origin of the Universe.</p>
