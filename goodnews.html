          <p>Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are set to compete in the Italian Open final after Sinner defeated Tommy Paul in a hard-fought match on home soil. Sinner, playing in his first tournament after a three-month doping ban, overcame a slow start to secure the victory. Alcaraz, on the other hand, beat Lorenzo Musetti, dashing hopes for an all-Italian final. The upcoming match is highly anticipated, with Sinner aiming to be the first Italian to win the home open since 1976.</p>

          <p>The World Bank announced it would resume operations in Syria after Saudi Arabia and Qatar paid off Syria's $15.5 million debt. The bank had halted operations in Syria in 2011 due to the civil war, preventing access to development loans and technical expertise. The first project in the reengagement focuses on electricity access, addressing severe shortages plaguing Syria after years of conflict. This move aims to alleviate poverty, with the UN estimating that 90% of Syrians live in poverty and receive minimal state-supplied electricity.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump received grand welcomes in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, marked by displays of wealth and promises of significant investments. Qatar pledged a $1.2 trillion "economic exchange," Saudi Arabia promised $600 billion in U.S. investments, and the UAE committed to a $1.4 trillion investment framework. These gestures underscore the Gulf states' desire to strengthen ties with the U.S. for business, military, and technological partnerships. The visit highlighted the region's eagerness to secure a prominent position in the evolving world order through strategic alliances with the U.S.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved the first blood test, Lumipulse, for detecting Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, aimed at early detection in adults over 55 exhibiting symptoms. The test identifies amyloid plaques in the brain, a key marker of Alzheimer‚Äôs, reducing the need for costly and invasive PET scans. Clinical studies showed Lumipulse accurately detected amyloid plaques in 91.7% of cognitively impaired individuals. The FDA cautioned about the risk of false positives, but emphasized the potential of this new tool to aid patients, given the increasing prevalence of Alzheimer's.</p>

          <p>A social media post by former FBI director James Comey has sparked controversy, with Republicans accusing him of inciting violence against President Trump. Comey posted a photo of seashells arranged to spell ‚Äú86 47,‚Äù which some interpreted as a reference to eliminating the 47th president. The term "86" is commonly used in the restaurant industry to mean "remove or eject," but it can also mean "to kill" in some contexts. Comey deleted the post and claims he was unaware of the violent interpretation, while Trump alleges Comey was calling for his assassination.</p>
