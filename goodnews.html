          <p>The FIA, Formula 1's governing body, has declared the Singapore Grand Prix a 'heat hazard' for the first time due to predicted high temperatures and humidity. This new rule, introduced after several drivers experienced severe heat exhaustion in the 2023 Qatar Grand Prix, allows for the use of cooling vests. While not mandatory, teams must fit the system to all cars to maintain weight parity. Drivers have had mixed reactions to the vests, citing both their cooling benefits and their relative discomfort.</p>

          <p>Two Delta Connection planes, operated by its subsidiary Endeavor Air, were involved in a low-speed collision on a taxiway at New York's LaGuardia Airport. The incident occurred when the wing of a departing aircraft made contact with the fuselage of an arriving plane. One flight attendant sustained a minor injury and was transported to a hospital, but airport operations were not significantly impacted. Passengers were deplaned and provided with accommodations, and an investigation into the cause of the collision is underway.</p>

          <p>This football analysis examines the precarious situation of Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim, whose team has a poor record, leaving them closer to relegation than the top of the table. Despite the results, the club's new ownership may be hesitant to fire him as he was their first major appointment. The article also highlights Arsenal's significant comeback win against Newcastle as a potential catalyst for their title challenge. Additionally, it praises American player Christian Pulisic's exceptional form for AC Milan, arguing he is performing at a level unmatched by any male American player in history.</p>

          <h2>Roki Sasaki's Dominant Playoff Performance Positions Him as Dodgers' New Closer</h2>

          <p>Rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki delivered a stunning performance for the Los Angeles Dodgers in their National League wild-card series against the Cincinnati Reds, solidifying his case as the team's new closer. In a perfect ninth inning, the 23-year-old from Japan threw six of seven fastballs over 100 mph and struck out two batters with a devastating forkball. After the bullpen struggled in both games of the series, Sasaki's dominant 11-pitch outing provided a much-needed vision of stability for the team's World Series ambitions, even as management remains publicly noncommittal about his official role.</p>

          <p>A consortium of lenders has put forward a new rescue plan to prevent the collapse of Thames Water, the UK's largest water company. The proposal includes writing off approximately one-third of the company's nearly £20 billion debt and injecting an initial £5.4 billion to stabilize its finances and fund improvements. The investors state the plan would not require taxpayer money but is contingent on adjusting the company's "unachievable" performance targets. The plan aims to turn around the troubled utility, which has faced years of financial instability and poor performance.</p>

          <p>A growing number of university faculty are incorporating generative AI into their work for tasks like brainstorming course materials, creating grading rubrics, and conducting research. New research from AI company Anthropic shows that curriculum development is the most common use case, but professors are also using AI for administrative tasks and even grading. This trend has sparked debate, with some educators praising AI as a time-saving collaborator while others express concern that using it for grading or student communication could devalue the educational process and student-teacher relationships.</p>

          <p>A wave of youth-led protests is sweeping across various African nations, including Madagascar, Kenya, and Morocco, as "Generation Z" takes to the streets to voice frustration over corruption and failing public services. In Madagascar, demonstrations over water and electricity shortages led the president to dissolve his government. These movements are largely organized organically through social media platforms like Facebook and TikTok, with protesters sharing symbols and tactics seen in similar youth uprisings in Asia. Analysts note these protests represent a reckoning for governments that have failed to meet the needs of the continent's young population.</p>

          <p>Recent NFL rule changes, particularly the new "Dynamic Kickoff" formation, have significantly increased the importance and excitement of special teams play. Kickoff return yardage has more than quadrupled compared to 2023, as the new rules discourage touchbacks and encourage strategic kicks into a designated "landing zone." Additionally, the use of specialized "K" balls, which teams prepare in-house, has contributed to longer field goals, with kickers now threatening to make kicks from 70 yards or more. These changes have led to more action, higher scoring, and more chaotic, game-deciding moments.</p>

          <p>Mainland China recorded zero deaths from Super Typhoon Ragasa, one of the world's biggest storms this year, a stark contrast to previous deadly typhoons. The successful outcome is attributed to extensive and timely preparations, particularly in the southern province of Guangdong. Authorities evacuated over one million people, deployed tens of thousands of rescue personnel, and opened nearly 900 temporary shelters in the city of Shenzhen alone. This proactive approach marks a significant improvement in China's disaster response capabilities compared to deadly storms and earthquakes in previous decades.</p>

Effective January 1, goods meeting the "Made in China" criteria will receive a 20% price preference in government bids. To qualify, a certain percentage of a product's components must be sourced domestically, a practice similar to those in the US and EU. The notice explicitly states that all companies, regardless of ownership or investor nationality, will be treated equally under the policy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Waking up with a sore back, neck, or shoulders can often be attributed to improper sleep posture, which creates gaps between the body and the mattress, causing muscles to tense up overnight. Medical experts recommend sleeping in a position that maintains the natural curvature of the spine, similar to good standing posture. This involves aligning the ears, shoulders, and hips. Using pillows to support gaps, such as under the knees for back sleepers or between the knees for side sleepers, can significantly reduce strain and improve sleep quality.</p>
