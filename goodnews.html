          <p>Ten years after the Zika virus outbreak in Brazil, the families of children born with congenital Zika syndrome face ongoing challenges, often with little public support. The article follows a group of mothers in Maceió, the epicenter of the outbreak, whose children suffer from severe disabilities and require constant care. Many of these mothers, abandoned by partners and struggling financially, have formed a tight-knit community, even moving into the same housing complex to support one another. Recently, they achieved a major victory when Brazil's Congress overturned a presidential veto to approve significantly higher lifetime compensation for affected families.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough's latest BBC series, "Parenthood," documents the extraordinary lengths animal parents go to in order to raise their young. The show features dramatic and emotional stories from across the globe, including African social spiders whose young consume them, and orangutan mothers who spend a decade teaching their offspring. The director, Jeff Wilson, notes the series aims to connect with universal parental experiences and highlight how animals adapt to a changing world. At 99 years old, Attenborough continues to provide his iconic narration, bringing these powerful natural history moments to a wide audience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a sequel reportedly in development, women are reflecting on the enduring cultural impact of the 2002 film "Bend It Like Beckham." The movie, about a Punjabi girl in London who defies her family's expectations to play football, was a landmark moment for South Asian representation on screen. Many women who grew up facing similar cultural and family pressures say the film made them feel "heard and seen" and inspired them to pursue their own goals. While women's football has grown immensely since the film's release, the story of balancing cultural identity with personal dreams remains highly relevant.</p>

          <p>Analysts are debating the likelihood and implications of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attending China's upcoming World War II 80th-anniversary victory parade. Some experts suggest that Modi's presence, alongside Russia, could provide a valuable opportunity to resolve ongoing border disputes and strengthen the trilateral relationship between the nations. However, most observers believe Modi is unlikely to attend, despite a recent thaw in relations between the two Asian powers. The potential visit is viewed as a significant political test with major ramifications for regional diplomacy.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the 25-year-old wife of a U.S. Marine veteran, has been released from ICE custody after being detained for two months in Louisiana. Clouatre, who was breastfeeding her newborn at the time, was arrested in May during what she believed was a routine green card interview, due to an old deportation order she was unaware of. Her husband, Adrian Clouatre, advocated tirelessly for her release, which drew public attention and support from Senator John Kennedy's office. While released on bond with an ankle monitor, she still faces a long legal process to secure her immigration status.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana are launching a new left-wing political party but are leaving its name up to their supporters. Having already registered over 600,000 supporters, the duo is asking for suggestions to define the new movement's identity before officially registering with the Electoral Commission. Naming a new party presents a significant branding challenge, as it must be distinct and resonate with voters in a digital age. This unconventional, crowd-sourced approach is part of a broader debate about what the new party will ultimately represent.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has shared that the death of his stepfather at age 54 was the catalyst for his decision to leave his career as a doctor and pursue comedy. Hill, who had qualified as a physician but felt unsuited for the profession, said his stepfather's passing made him realize he didn't want to spend his life in a job he wasn't passionate about. He recalled feeling emotionally out of his depth as a doctor, particularly when breaking bad news to patients. The move proved successful, leading to a long career in entertainment, most notably with his hit show "Harry Hill's TV Burp."</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms is reportedly becoming more cautious about its open-source approach to artificial intelligence, a shift that comes as Chinese companies aggressively push forward with their own advanced open-source models. Renowned AI expert Andrew Ng has suggested that China's competitive, "Darwinian" open-source ecosystem could be its path to surpassing the U.S. in the field. Recently, Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and Zhipu AI have released powerful new open-source models, highlighting the country's growing momentum and challenging the dominance of Western proprietary systems.</p>
