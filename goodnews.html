          <p>China is increasing efforts to encourage foreign institutions to use the yuan, aiming to challenge the U.S. dollar's dominance as international confidence in the greenback weakens. These efforts include establishing a center for digital yuan internationalization in Shanghai and promoting yuan-denominated futures trading. However, despite these initiatives, some experts note that China's strict capital controls and less transparent system may deter large-scale buying of mainland assets. While the yuan's international use has seen some growth, it still lags significantly behind the U.S. dollar in global payments. (not investment advice)</p>

This is not the first time Pettersen has included her son in her official duties, as she previously held him during a speech on the House floor.

FedEx reported its U.S. daily package volume was up 6% year over year, and U.S. ground home delivery volume was up 10% year over year.
