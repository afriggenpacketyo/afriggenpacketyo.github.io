          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting has announced a national inquiry into maternity care in England, prompted by a series of maternity scandals at NHS trusts. The inquiry aims to address failings in maternity and neonatal services across the country, including in Leeds, Sussex, Gloucester, and Mid and South Essex. Streeting apologized on behalf of the NHS to families who have suffered avoidable harm and stated the review will involve victims, giving families a voice into how the inquiry is run. The inquiry is set to begin this summer and report back by December 2025, with the goal of ensuring no parent or baby is ever let down again.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 07:26:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has proposed a plan allowing non-domiciles in the UK to avoid many UK taxes by paying a ¬£250,000 fee for a "Britannia Card." This card would exempt them from taxes on wealth, income, and capital gains earned abroad, as well as inheritance tax. Farage claims this initiative would attract "tens of thousands" of talented individuals to the UK, generating between ¬£1.5bn to ¬£2.5bn annually, which would then be distributed to the lowest-paid 10% of full-time workers. Critics, including Labour Chancellor Rachel Reeves, argue that this policy amounts to a "tax cut for foreign billionaires" that would necessitate either raising taxes or cutting public services.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average price of rice in Japan has fallen below 4,000 yen per 5 kilograms for the first time since March, reaching 3,920 yen, according to the government. This decrease is attributed to increased distribution of rice stockpiles, helping to drive down prices at supermarkets across the nation. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi stated that the release of additional rice reserves has proven effective in lowering prices. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba aims to reduce the average retail price of 5 kg of rice to the 3,000 yen range by the end of June, addressing concerns about rising consumer prices.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has expressed support for the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, viewing them as a demonstration of Washington's resolve to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya stated that de-escalating the situation regarding Iran's nuclear activities is of utmost importance. However, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has decided to cancel his planned trip to a NATO summit in the Netherlands due to heightened tensions in the Middle East. Japan is also introducing mandatory pre-arrival tuberculosis screening for foreigners planning to stay over three months, starting with those from the Philippines and Nepal.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated mandatory pre-arrival tuberculosis screening for individuals planning to stay in the country for over three months, starting with citizens from the Philippines and Nepal. This measure aims to address the rising number of foreign nationals diagnosed with tuberculosis while in Japan, primarily from six specific countries. The screening requirement mandates that individuals provide evidence of being tuberculosis-free before arrival, or they will be denied entry. This initiative reflects Japan's commitment to public health and aligns with WHO guidelines for countries with low tuberculosis incidence.</p>

          <p>The UK government has outlined a 10-year industrial strategy that includes plans to lower energy costs for businesses by exempting them from some green energy levies. These measures could reduce energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 UK businesses, with the aim of boosting economic growth. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer stated the strategy intends to "stabilize" and help "mitigate" challenges to the UK from abroad, particularly regarding energy prices. The plan also includes improving workers' skills, attracting global talent, streamlining planning processes, and boosting research and development spending.</p>
