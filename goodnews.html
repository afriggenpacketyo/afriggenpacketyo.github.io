          <p>A treacherous three-mile section of California's Highway 101, known as Last Chance Grade, is set for a major overhaul after decades of dangerous landslides. This coastal road is the sole lifeline for the remote town of Crescent City, and its frequent closures have severe economic and social impacts. The California Department of Transportation has proposed a $2.1 billion, 6,000-foot tunnel to bypass the unstable cliffs, a project that could begin by 2030. While funding remains a challenge, local officials and residents see the tunnel as a long-overdue permanent solution to a problem that has plagued the region for over half a century.</p>

These gatherings, held in local parks, combine a short hike and trail cleanup with a session of yoga and a sound bath under the stars. Founded by William Vazquez, the group aims to make nature accessible to everyone, hosting up to 14 substance-free events a month for all ages and experience levels. The initiative has successfully built a "tribe" for many Angelenos, providing a safe and welcoming space for beginners and those seeking community outside of typical social settings.</p>

          <p>California has a long history of rejecting extremely wealthy, politically inexperienced candidates for its highest offices, such as governor and U.S. senator. Despite spending vast personal fortunes, figures like Meg Whitman and Carly Fiorina have failed to win over voters. Political analysts suggest this trend may be due to an "empathy gap," where voters suspect that mega-rich candidates cannot understand the lives of average citizens. This historical context is relevant as billionaire developer Rick Caruso considers a run for governor, facing the challenge of convincing a skeptical electorate that he offers more than just money and a sense of entitlement.</p>

          <p>Pop icon Debbie Gibson discusses her new memoir, "Eternally Electric," which delves into her trailblazing career as a teenage singer-songwriter-producer in the 1980s. She credits her late mother and manager, Diane, for fiercely advocating for her artistic control at a time when young female artists were rarely given such autonomy. Gibson reflects on how her mother's efforts paved the way for future generations of artists like Taylor Swift. The book covers her journey from recording in her garage to achieving global fame, dealing with panic attacks, and her recent career resurgence, offering a candid look at her life.</p>

          <p>Greg Gutfeld, host of "Gutfeld!" on Fox News, has become a dominant force in late-night television, drawing over 3 million nightly viewers and outperforming competitors like Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon. In an interview, Gutfeld attributes his success to offering a fun, unpredictable, and teasing atmosphere that he believes was missing from other late-night shows, which he feels became too focused on sending viewers to bed angry. He compares the sensibility of "Gutfeld!" to his earlier, more niche show "Red Eye," but adapted for a broader primetime audience. Gutfeld asserts that his show's popularity proves that mainstream media no longer owns the culture.</p>

          <p>The late Venezuelan-born painter Luchita Hurtado, who gained mainstream recognition late in her nearly 100-year life, expressed her artistic practice not only on canvas but also through a unique, self-made wardrobe. For about 80 years, she wore a utilitarian "uniform" she designed herself, centered on a boxy, four-pocket smock shirt, which she adapted with various fabrics and details. This personal collection, now being shared with the public for the first time, reveals her intentional lifestyle and rejection of conformity. Hurtado began sewing her own clothes out of necessity while pregnant, and this practice became a lifelong extension of her creative expression.</p>

          <p>The prospect of human travel to Mars highlights a major hurdle: the significant health risks posed by space, including radiation exposure, muscle loss, and psychological stress. The field of space medicine is working to address these challenges, which currently disqualify many people from becoming astronauts. Research, such as NASA's twin study, is revealing how spaceflight alters human physiology, from DNA to cardiovascular health. Experts argue that solving these problems is not only essential for interplanetary settlement but also yields significant medical benefits on Earth, accelerating breakthroughs in areas like cancer research, remote health monitoring, and personalized medicine.</p>

          <p>As global water scarcity increases, desalination technology is becoming more common, but its environmental impact, particularly the disposal of highly salty brine, remains a concern. The article explores methods to make the process more sustainable, such as advanced dilution techniques used at the Carlsbad Desalination Plant in California. Another promising approach treats brine as a resource by mining it for valuable minerals like lithium and magnesium, a process being tested by the EU-funded Sea4Value project. Experts suggest that combining these innovations with renewable energy sources and strategic plant placement can make desalination an environmentally defensible solution to the world's growing water needs.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge ruled against the Department of Justice's most severe proposals in its antitrust case against Google, allowing the company to avoid divesting its Chrome browser. The decision permits Google to continue paying companies like Apple billions to be the default search engine on devices, though it prohibits exclusive contracts. This outcome was viewed as a major victory for both tech giants, causing shares of Alphabet and Apple to rise significantly. While some new restrictions will be imposed, the ruling removes a major overhang for Google's core search business and preserves a critical revenue stream for Apple's services division.

          <p>A financial opinion article highlights three companies—Carnival, Uber Technologies, and PayPal—as potentially undervalued stocks for investors. The author argues that cruise operator Carnival is effectively managing its post-pandemic debt while seeing record customer deposits. Ride-hailing company Uber is positioned to benefit from a long-term cultural shift away from car ownership, and its delivery arm is also growing rapidly. Finally, the piece suggests that digital payment firm PayPal is poised for a rebound with new initiatives after a period of intense competition, making its current valuation attractive.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The filler word "um" serves multiple important functions in conversation, despite sometimes being viewed negatively. Linguists explain that it acts as a placeholder while a speaker thinks, helps to soften tone, and signals that a person is not finished speaking. The sound is easy to produce, and similar filler words exist across many languages. While rare in formal writing, "um" is increasingly used in informal digital text to convey humor or confusion. Its usage in speech is part of an unspoken social contract, indicating continued engagement in a conversation and preventing awkward silences.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has initiated a new seasonal shipping route to Europe, dubbed the "Arctic Express," which utilizes the melting ice of the Northern Sea Route. This path significantly cuts travel time compared to traditional routes through the Suez Canal or around Africa, connecting Chinese ports with key European hubs in just 18 days. The new route bypasses Russian ports and is seen as a strategic move by Beijing to establish a faster, more efficient trade corridor. This development not only offers economic advantages by reducing shipping times and costs but also represents a geopolitical ambition to increase China's influence in the increasingly accessible Arctic region.</p>
