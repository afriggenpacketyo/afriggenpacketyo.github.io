          <p>Despite escalating trade tensions, China and the U.S. have agreed to continue communication, as indicated by a recent call between Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau. The two sides exchanged thoughts on critical issues without providing specific details. This development follows previous tariff de-escalation efforts after a meeting in Switzerland. However, China has criticized a U.S. decision warning companies against using Chinese-made AI chips, particularly from Huawei, labeling it "unilateral bullying" and blaming the U.S. for undermining trade talks.</p>

Extreme weather events in China, which caused significant economic damage, highlight the importance of addressing climate change. Tariffs and protectionism contribute to division, but the green transition can foster progress across political and economic divides, presenting economic opportunities through clean energy and climate-smart investments. China is already leading in domestic renewable energy deployment and can further advance international investment in this sector.</p>

          <p>Amanda Johnson, a Marine spouse and homeschooling mother of five, is fighting back after her family's upcoming move abroad was put on hold due to a vaccine dispute. Despite the Navy's policy stating that family members are not required to be immunized, their children were deemed unsuitable solely based on their vaccination status. Johnson says that the Navy Medical Jacksonville denied their package and falsely claimed it had been sent to Naval Medical Atlantic Region for final review. The family has filed a congressional inquiry and is seeking accountability and reform in the Navy's policy enforcement.</p>

Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has indicated his intention to raise rates based on price trends but also noted the need to monitor the effects of U.S. tariffs.
