          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans for the "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, an ambitious project aimed at expanding the country's air defense system, with a predicted completion by the end of his term. The project, a priority for Trump since taking office, intends to create a defense system against foreign threats similar to Israel‚Äôs Iron Dome. Experts, however, cite logistical and financial hurdles, with cost estimates ranging from $175 billion to $542 billion. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the project a "game changer" and a "generational investment in the security of America."</p>

          <p>Chengdu, an inland city in southwestern China, is experiencing a surge in population and a booming real estate market as young workers seek a more relaxed lifestyle compared to the hypercompetitive environment of coastal cities. The city's population has increased by 30% in the last five years, with housing prices rising faster than in any other major Chinese city. This shift reflects a growing disillusionment among young people who are prioritizing quality of life over guaranteed career success. Chengdu's appeal lies in its vibrant culture, lower cost of living, and thriving entertainment sector, making it an attractive alternative to the crowded and expensive megacities on the coast.</p>

          <p>Veterinary students are in high demand due to a nationwide shortage of veterinary professionals, driven by high turnover rates, rising student debt, and increased pet ownership. The article highlights the challenges faced by veterinary students, including the high cost of tuition and the alarming suicide rate within the profession. The increasing willingness of pet owners to spend on pet care has led to corporate investments in veterinary medicine, but it has also caused prices for visits to increase.

This marks the first time Japan has created lanes exclusively for a specific nationality, and visitors who have traveled between the two countries within the past year are eligible, contingent upon completing pre-boarding procedures.
