          <p>Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg announced that airplane deliveries to China will resume next month after a pause due to trade tensions, dismissing concerns about tariffs. China has indicated they will accept deliveries, with the first shipments planned for June. Boeing has been paying tariffs on imported components from Italy and Japan for its Dreamliner planes, which are manufactured in South Carolina, but the company expects to recoup most of these costs when the planes are exported. The duties would only affect deliveries to U.S. airlines, according to Ortberg. Optimism is shown through the continued resumption of airplane deliveries.</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court Decision Limits Environmental Impact Studies to Expedite Construction</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 14:10:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has placed new limits on federal environmental impact studies for major projects, potentially speeding up infrastructure development. The case, Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, involved a proposed railroad line in Utah. Justice Kavanaugh's opinion emphasizes deference to agency decisions and restricts consideration of indirect environmental impacts, which mirrors the arguments of those who advocate for increased infrastructure development. This decision is expected to weaken the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), a law often used to challenge development projects, and aligns with a bipartisan push to streamline environmental reviews.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell met with President Trump at the White House to discuss economic growth, the central bank announced. Powell emphasized that the Fed would base its decisions on objective and nonpolitical analysis, and that policy would depend on incoming economic data. He reiterated the Fed's commitment to supporting maximum employment and stable prices, amidst ongoing tariff uncertainty. This meeting occurs after Trump has repeatedly urged Powell to lower interest rates and criticized the Fed's actions, while Powell has maintained the Fed's political independence.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled to limit the scope of federally mandated environmental impact statements for major projects, potentially accelerating approvals for transportation and energy initiatives. The decision in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v.

Justice Kavanaugh emphasized the need to curtail the use of NEPA to hinder energy and infrastructure programs, arguing it has become overly burdensome.

          <p>Non-alcoholic beer is projected to overtake ale as the second-largest beer category worldwide this year, according to industry tracker IWSR. While overall beer volume declined in 2024, non-alcoholic beer volume grew by 9% globally, fueled by consumers reducing alcohol consumption. IWSR forecasts an 8% annual growth for no-alcohol beer through 2029, while ale's volume is expected to decrease by 2% annually. This trend is driven by younger generations adopting "sober curious" and "damp lifestyle" approaches, along with improvements in the taste of non-alcoholic alternatives.</p>
