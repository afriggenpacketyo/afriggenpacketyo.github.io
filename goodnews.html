          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 22:20:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump defended his administration's plan to accept a luxury jumbo jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One, citing the U.S.'s support for Qatar's security. The potential gift has raised legal and ethical concerns due to the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which restricts gifts from foreign governments. Critics from both the left and right have questioned the deal, while the White House maintains that any gift would be accepted in compliance with applicable laws. The Qatari jet is reported to be worth around $400 million and would require retrofitting and security clearance before use, as Boeing has been contracted to provide the White House with two 747-8s directly, but Trump has complained that the firm was behind schedule.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom released a model ordinance for cities to address homeless encampments, accompanied by new funding for treatment and housing. Newsom emphasized that cities must take action and utilize available resources to provide alternatives to encampments. The model ordinance includes principles that prioritize shelter and services while allowing local authorities to clear encampments. This initiative is supported by $3.3 billion in new Prop 1 funding, as Newsom approaches the end of his term amidst speculation about his political future, and as many California cities have already been implementing stiffer policies against homeless encampments since the Supreme Court ruling in favor of anti-camping ordinances.</p>

          <p>An auction of the Riggio family art collection at Christie‚Äôs in New York revealed a cautious art market, with many items presold and quiet bidding. Experts attributed the subdued atmosphere to economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump‚Äôs tariffs. The auction house had guaranteed an undisclosed minimum amount for the collection, but the sale fell short of pre-sale expectations. While some paintings by artists like Gerhard Richter and Claude Monet performed well, a Warhol painting was withdrawn, signaling weakness in that market, and some successful transactions demonstrated how far the market had fallen for certain artworks.</p>

          <p>Sussan Ley has been named the first female leader of Australia's Liberal Party, succeeding Peter Dutton after the party's historic election loss. Ley, a moderate, aims to rebuild the party's relationship with Australians, particularly women and younger voters who feel neglected. Her appointment follows a landslide election win for the Labor Party, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese sworn in and announcing his new cabinet. The junior coalition partner, the Nationals, re-elected David Littleproud as leader. Ley previously served as the party deputy under Dutton and has held the massive regional New South Wales seat of Farrer since 2001 and has served as a senior minister in a variety of portfolios - making her one of the Liberal Party's most experienced hands.</p>

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy attributed the problems to the previous administration's handling of air traffic control relocation. The task force will include experts from the FAA, Verizon, and L3Harris. The FAA is also working to replace copper lines with fiber lines and will meet with airlines to discuss potential flight reductions at the airport.

However, poverty remains high, and inflation is expected to remain over 20% through the year.

The drugs are remarkably effective at reducing visceral fat, a type of fat linked to cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and other chronic illnesses. Physicians should rely on metrics like waist size and blood-lipid patterns, not just BMI, to determine appropriate candidates for GLP-1 treatment.</p>

          <p>The United States and China said Monday they have agreed to slash most of their recent new tariffs on each other's imports and suspend part of the so-called reciprocal duties for 90 days, in a surprise move that appears to be an about-face from their bitter trade war, prompting a surge in stock prices. The agreement reached during high-level trade talks in Geneva over the weekend means that the United States will cut its recent tariffs on China, imposed since Donald Trump's second presidency started in January, to 30 percent from 145 percent. China, meanwhile, will lower its retaliatory tariffs on the United States to 10 percent from 125 percent.</p>

          <p>The Federal Railroad Administration has consulted with Elon Musk's The Boring Company regarding the Frederick Douglass Tunnel program, an Amtrak project connecting Baltimore to Washington and Virginia. The goal is to assess costs and improve efficiency, as the project's estimated cost has increased to $8.5 billion. The Department of Transportation confirmed the consultation, raising concerns about Musk's potential conflicts of interest due to his leadership roles in multiple companies and his advisory role to President Trump. Musk has previously criticized Amtrak and other large-scale rail projects.</p>
