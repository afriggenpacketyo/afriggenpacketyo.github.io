          <p>Michael Saylor's bitcoin treasury strategy, which significantly boosted Strategy's market capitalization, is now being adopted by various companies, including meme stock firms and media conglomerates. Despite this growing trend, Wall Street remains skeptical, with shares of Trump Media and GameStop declining after their bitcoin-related announcements. Saylor, however, views this as a long-term shift in corporate finance, noting increasing interest in bitcoin treasury companies globally. The Trump administration has also taken steps to treat bitcoin as a long-term store of value, further legitimizing its role in the financial landscape (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Consumers are taking a more cautious approach to summer vacations this year due to trade tensions and recession fears, leading to scaled-back spending plans, according to a Deloitte report. While more people plan to travel compared to last year, they are opting for more budget-conscious choices, such as cutting back on in-destination spending and choosing cheaper lodging options. Travel costs, including hotel rates and airfares, have generally declined, providing some relief to travelers seeking to stretch their budgets. Despite lower prices, inflation continues to impact spending habits, prompting travelers to seek flexibility in their plans to save money.</p>

          <p>In a move signaling improved relations, Afghanistan and Pakistan have agreed to elevate their diplomatic ties by appointing ambassadors in each other's capitals. This decision follows a trilateral meeting in Beijing, where Chinese officials expressed their willingness to assist in improving relations between the two countries. Relations have been strained due to accusations that Kabul harbors the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Pakistan's deportation of Afghan refugees. Despite this upgrade, no country has officially recognized the Taliban administration since they took control in 2021, though a handful of countries have agreed to host Taliban government ambassadors.</p>

The bowler immediately left the field for treatment, though he later returned to bowl and take three wickets, but will be replaced in the squad by Matthew Potts. Due to the injury, Overton is expected to be out for about a month, causing him to miss the T20s against the West Indies.</p>

Construction machinery has been deployed to control the run-off of accumulated water, and residents are on alert due to forecast rain, which could lead to further landslides.

          <p>Denmark's decision to raise its retirement age to 70 has sparked discussion among experts about whether the U.S. may follow suit. While some see it as a potential solution to Social Security's looming funding challenges, others argue that it may not be suitable for the U.S. due to income inequality and disparities in life expectancy. Raising the retirement age could disproportionately affect lower-income individuals who already receive benefits for a shorter period. Experts also note that phasing in such a change would take time, making it less effective in addressing immediate funding needs (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman and other prosecutors visited San Quentin prison to learn about the California Model, which focuses on rehabilitation. The program, based on the idea that most prisoners will eventually be released, aims to improve public safety by helping inmates change their behavior. The DAs interacted with inmates, including those serving long sentences for violent crimes, discussing the need for accountability and rehabilitation. The shift from progressive criminal justice advances includes the perspective of incarcerated people, and their insights on what they need to make rehabilitation work.</p>

          <h2>Lawmakers Criticize Newsom and Waste Agency Over Plastic Legislation</h2>

          <p>California lawmakers are challenging proposed regulations to implement Senate Bill 54, a state law designed to reduce plastic waste, arguing that the draft rules undermine the law's intent. The lawmakers claim that CalRecycle exceeded its authority by proposing regulations that contradict the statute, specifically regarding polluting recycling technologies and exemptions for products under USDA and FDA purview. They fear that these regulations could increase costs and allow producers to unilaterally determine which products are subject to the law. The lawmakers have urged Governor Newsom and agency heads to ensure that the regulations align with the legislative intent of SB 54.</p>

          <p>After 23 years of roadworks and congestion, the A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened following a ¬£2bn upgrade project. The 28-mile improvement is designed to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and cut journey times. The project, initially drawn up in 1990, faced enormous overspends, major delays, and a global pandemic. Despite criticism of the cost and delays, Welsh ministers said the upgrade would generate jobs and opportunities, better connecting communities across the region.</p>
