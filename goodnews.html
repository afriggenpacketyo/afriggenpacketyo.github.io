          <h2>Justice Department Sues Colorado and Denver Over Sanctuary Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 00:24:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the state of Colorado, the city of Denver, and several local leaders, challenging their "sanctuary" policies. The suit argues that these policies, which limit local law enforcement's cooperation with federal immigration authorities, interfere with the Trump Administration's efforts to deport undocumented immigrants. The lawsuit specifically mentions an apartment complex in Aurora, Colorado, that President Trump claimed was controlled by a Venezuelan gang, alleging that Colorado's policies allowed this to happen. The suit seeks a court ruling that the state and city laws violate the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, but officials from Colorado have stated that they are not a 'sanctuary state' and will comply with any court rulings. Optimism Score: 60</p>

          <p>The elimination of the tariff exemption for inexpensive goods entering the U.S. is impacting digital advertising revenue for platforms like Meta and Alphabet, according to the article. The expansion of this loophole previously allowed companies like Temu and Shein to thrive by offering goods directly from Chinese factories, fueled by billions in digital advertising. President Trump eliminated the exemption, subjecting these companies to tariffs up to 145%. Temu has reportedly stopped direct shipments from China, shifting to a local fulfillment model, and both Temu and Shein have reduced advertising spending on platforms like Google, Facebook, and Instagram.</p>

          <p>The Riverside County Sheriff's Department has stated that there is no indication of foul play in the death of Jeff Sperbeck, a close friend and business partner of John Elway, following a golf cart accident. Sperbeck fell from a moving golf cart and hit his head, and the investigation suggests it was a tragic accident. While there were five people on the cart, which was designed for two or four, the driver does not appear to be at fault, and alcohol was not a factor. Elway expressed his devastation and heartbreak over Sperbeck's sudden passing.</p>

          <p>According to a Kyodo News survey, 58% of Japanese citizens believe that the spread of unverified information on social media during elections should be regulated by law. This comes amid increasing criticism of partisan online posts influencing elections, particularly the reelection of Hyogo Governor Motohiko Saito. Additionally, the survey revealed divided opinions on revising Article 9 of the Constitution, which renounces war, with 48% supporting a change and 48% opposing it. The survey also indicated that a majority of respondents favor allowing married couples to keep separate surnames and recognizing same-sex marriage.</p>
