          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 18:42:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After two decades of disuse, NASA scientists have successfully revived roll thrusters on the Voyager 1 spacecraft. These thrusters, dormant since 2004, are crucial for maintaining Voyager's antenna alignment with Earth, enabling continued communication. The reactivation addresses concerns about the primary thrusters potentially failing due to residue buildup, which scientists estimate could happen as early as Fall 2025. This achievement ensures the continuation of Voyager 1's mission exploring interstellar space, nearly 15 billion miles from Earth, while a key antenna used for communicating with the probe undergoes necessary upgrades until February 2026.</p>

          <p>Jussie Smollett, the former "Empire" actor, has settled a lawsuit with the city of Chicago by agreeing to donate $50,000 to a local charity, Building Brighter Futures Center for the Arts. The settlement resolves the city's claim for reimbursement of over $130,000 spent investigating Smollett's alleged hate crime, which police determined to be a hoax. While Smollett maintains the attack was real and had filed a countersuit, the city believes the settlement provides a fair resolution, allowing all parties to move forward from the six-year-old case. The Illinois Supreme Court had previously overturned Smollett's conviction on double jeopardy grounds.</p>

O'Connor's victory has rekindled memories of his father, Bob, who also served as mayor. Voters chose O'Connor, a county controller, for his managerial skills and promise of a smoothly run city, rather than a grand vision. His win reflects a desire for pragmatic governance over ideological leadership, even as Gainey's support remained strong in Black neighborhoods.</p>

The order also prohibits the transfer of federal student loan management to the Small Business Administration.
