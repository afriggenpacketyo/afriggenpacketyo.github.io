          <h2>Opinion: Encouraging Midday EV Charging at Workplaces Could Maximize Clean Energy Use</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that California, a leader in electric vehicle adoption, is missing a key opportunity by not promoting daytime charging at workplaces. Charging EVs midday aligns with peak solar energy production, making it the cheapest and cleanest time to power vehicles, which can significantly cut emissions further than overnight charging. The author, part of a UC San Diego research team, suggests that stronger incentives and better public charging infrastructure are needed to shift driver behavior and fully leverage the state's renewable energy resources.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece contends that as artificial intelligence automates technical skills, the most valuable human traits will be moral and interpersonal ones like empathy, judgment, and critical thinking. The author argues against a sole focus on STEM, suggesting that a liberal arts education is the best preparation for the future, as it cultivates deep reading, discussion, and engagement with complex questions. This type of education, centered on human connection and wisdom, is uniquely resistant to AI shortcuts and fosters the "intellectual fearlessness" needed to navigate a technology-driven world.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that the current political attacks on higher education are a symptom of a deeper problem: a dramatic decline in public confidence in universities across the political spectrum. The author suggests that instead of blaming political opponents, academic institutions must take proactive steps to rebuild this trust. This includes fostering genuine free speech and intellectual diversity on campus, addressing major societal problems like polarization, and adapting education to protect human cognition in the age of AI, thereby proving their value to the common good.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the anxiety and social dynamics of sharing a favorite movie or book with a friend, exploring why a negative reaction can feel like a personal rejection. It discusses the psychology of friendship, noting that we often seek validation and similarity in our friends' tastes, and a difference can reveal a perceived gap in the relationship. The piece uses the author's experience of showing "The Big Lebowski" to a friend to illustrate the vulnerability involved, ultimately concluding that true friendships can withstand such minor differences in cultural preferences.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ScotRail, the government-owned train operator in Scotland, has officially scrapped peak-time fares, making weekday travel significantly cheaper for passengers. The move, which follows a pilot program, aims to incentivize commuters to switch from cars to trains, with some key routes like Edinburgh to Glasgow seeing prices drop by nearly 50%. First Minister John Swinney announced the change as a financially sustainable investment that will provide massive savings for people struggling with the cost of living, with the government covering the estimated £40-45 million annual cost.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese leader William Lai has appointed two younger figures, Lii Wen and Chao Yi-hsiang, both in their thirties, as deputy secretaries general of the National Security Council. This move is seen as an effort to blend veteran experience with a new generation more adept at navigating the rapidly changing global landscape. The appointments follow a drop in approval ratings for Lai and his party, particularly among young voters, and come as Taiwan seeks to strengthen its security apparatus in the face of ongoing pressure from Beijing.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has initiated a significant reorganization of his Downing Street team one year into his premiership, creating new roles and clarifying leadership structures. The shake-up, which includes the new position of Chief Secretary to the Prime Minister, is seen as an admission that his first year has not gone as planned and an attempt to gain firmer command of the government. The changes emphasize economic expertise and are aimed at improving "delivery," though critics suggest the core issue is a lack of clear vision.</p>

          <p>A state judge has thrown out Utah's congressional map, ruling it an illegal partisan gerrymander and giving the Republican-led legislature until September 24 to draw a new one. The decision could create a competitive Democratic district in the deeply conservative state by consolidating parts of Salt Lake City, which is currently split across four districts. This ruling inserts Utah into a burgeoning national battle over mid-decade redistricting, as both parties seek to redraw maps in various states to gain an advantage ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

          <p>In a move aimed at de-escalating tensions on the peninsula, South Korea's defense ministry has suspended its "Voice of Freedom" radio broadcast into North Korea. The psychological warfare program, which has been on and off the air since 1962, transmitted outside information and K-pop music into the highly isolated state. This is the latest conciliatory step taken by the new administration of President Lee Jae Myung, which has also dismantled some propaganda loudspeakers along the border, though Pyongyang has so far shown little interest in improving relations.</p>
