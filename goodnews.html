          <p>The Philadelphia Phillies baseball team appeared to reference a recent viral controversy involving the CEO of the tech company Astronomer during a game's 'kiss cam' segment. The jumbotron played a Coldplay song, alluding to a video where the CEO and the company's HR chief were awkwardly caught on camera at a Coldplay concert. The crowd reacted with laughter and applause to the inside joke, which has also been referenced by other sports teams and brands online. The company has since launched a formal investigation into the matter.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that ten more hostages are expected to be released from Gaza "very shortly" as his administration continues to push for a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Speaking at a White House dinner, Trump expressed hope that the process would be completed quickly, noting progress in returning most hostages. The current ceasefire proposal reportedly involves the release of these ten living hostages and the remains of eighteen others in exchange for an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement comes as Mossad's director reportedly visited Washington to discuss relocating Palestinians from Gaza.</p>

          <p>Retired Marine Corporal Scott Harrison, who endured the Vietnam War, found solace in a music box that inspired visions of a peaceful carousel. After struggling with PTSD for years, he decided to make that vision a reality to help himself heal. In 1986, he bought a broken-down carousel and spent the next 26 years hand-carving new animals for it. Today, the Carousel of Happiness operates as a nonprofit in Nederland, Colorado, bringing joy to over a million visitors and providing Harrison with daily medicine for his trauma by allowing him to serve others.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major regulatory framework for cryptocurrency in the United States. The bipartisan legislation specifically targets stablecoins, creating consumer protections and clear rules for their issuance by banks and other financial institutions. At the signing ceremony, Trump hailed the bill as a step toward an "exciting new frontier" and a potential revolution in financial technology. The act aims to strengthen the U.S. dollar by ensuring stablecoins are backed one-for-one with real assets, bringing digital currency further into the mainstream financial system.

          <p>Shares of Block, the fintech company founded by Jack Dorsey, surged more than 10% in extended trading after it was announced that the firm will join the S&P 500 index. Block is set to replace oil producer Hess, which was recently acquired by Chevron. Inclusion in a major index like the S&P 500 often leads to a stock rally as index funds must purchase the shares to rebalance their portfolios. Despite being down 14% for the year amid a challenging macroeconomic environment, Block's addition reflects the growing influence of technology companies within the benchmark index.

          <p>The "California Forever" project, backed by Silicon Valley billionaires to build a new city on farmland, has announced plans for a 2,100-acre manufacturing hub within the proposed community. CEO Jan Sramek revealed the "Solano Foundry" proposal, which aims to attract defense, aerospace, robotics, and energy companies, bringing high-tech manufacturing back to the state. The project's proponents claim it will create tens of thousands of jobs and rebuild the middle class.

          <p>Microsoft has announced it will no longer use engineers based in China to provide technical support for its U.S. defense and government cloud clients. The policy change follows a ProPublica report that raised national security and cybersecurity concerns about the practice. The report detailed how Chinese engineers, supervised by U.S.-based "digital escorts," had access to sensitive systems, creating potential vulnerabilities. In response, Microsoft affirmed its commitment to security, stating the move ensures no China-based teams will assist with Department of Defense cloud services.</p>

          <p>Pest control experts and entomologists in the United Kingdom are predicting a "good year for wasps" following an unusually warm and dry spring. The British Pest Control Association reports being busier than usual with calls about large nests appearing early in the season. While many dislike the insects, experts note that social wasps are vital predators that provide natural pest control for gardens and farms. The article suggests that the common wasp population appears to be stable, bucking the trend of widespread decline seen in many other global insect populations.</p>

          <p>A new theatrical production in Liverpool, 'The Legend of Rooney's Ring,' reimagines the lives of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen as a fantasy saga inspired by 'The Lord of the Rings.' The comedy, written by 'Motherland' co-creator Helen Serafinowicz, is loosely based on a 2004 tabloid story about Coleen allegedly throwing away her engagement ring. The writer and cast insist the show is an affectionate homage, not a targeted attack, celebrating the couple as heroic figures who have endured immense public scrutiny. The play is presented as a silly, medieval caper with jokes and songs.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland's public health service will extend its RSV vaccination program to cover premature babies, offering them crucial protection against the common respiratory virus. Starting this autumn, a long-acting injection, Nirsevimab, will be available for eligible infants who were born too early to benefit from the maternal vaccine. RSV is a leading cause of hospitalization in a child's first year, and this new single-injection vaccine offers about 80% protection. Health officials stated the move will strengthen the health service's winter preparedness and protect some of the most vulnerable children.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the astonishing story from 2005 when a 12-year-old girl in Ethiopia was rescued from her kidnappers by a pride of lions. The girl had been taken by men intending to force her into marriage and was missing for a week. According to reports, three lions chased the men away and then stood guard over the girl until she was found by police. A wildlife expert at the time suggested the girl's whimpering may have been mistaken for a lion cub's mewing, which could explain why the lions protected her instead of attacking.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has identified a specific interaction between gut bacteria and a genetic variant that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. Researchers found that in people with a faulty version of the OTUD3 gene, the immune system overreacts to a molecule produced by certain gut bacteria, leading to chronic inflammation. This discovery helps explain why the disease behaves differently among patients and why treatments can be inconsistent. The findings open the door to developing more precise, personalized therapies that target this specific pathway rather than suppressing the entire immune system.</p>

          <p>The governments of the U.S. and El Salvador have announced a three-way prisoner exchange involving Venezuela. El Salvador has repatriated approximately 250 Venezuelan nationals, who were previously deported from the U.S. and held in a high-security prison, in exchange for the release of 10 U.S. citizens held by Venezuela. A senior U.S. official confirmed that with this exchange, no American nationals remain in Venezuelan custody. The deal highlights the warming relationship between President Trump and Salvadoran leader Nayib Bukele, who agreed to incarcerate the U.S.-deported migrants.</p>
