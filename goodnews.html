        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has declared President Trump's executive order aimed at limiting birthright citizenship to be unconstitutional. The policy, which sought to deny automatic citizenship to U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants or temporary visa holders, is currently on hold. The court's panel ruled that the order directly contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants citizenship to 'all persons born in the United States.' The administration had argued for a narrower interpretation of the amendment's 'subject to the jurisdiction thereof' clause, but the court found this interpretation to be unsupported by historical legal principles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, surpassing expectations and successfully avoiding a technical recession following a contraction in the first quarter. The growth was primarily driven by a strong 4.2% increase in exports, particularly in semiconductors and chemical products, as companies reportedly expedited shipments ahead of potential U.S. trade policy changes. While domestic consumption also saw a modest rebound, economists remain cautious about the future, citing concerns over softening global trade and the potential impact of U.S. tariffs. The positive data may influence the Bank of Korea's future decisions on interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron met in Berlin to reaffirm their commitment to strengthening Franco-German cooperation. The leaders discussed pressing issues, including the ongoing trade dispute with the United States, support for Ukraine, and joint European defense projects. Both expressed a desire to present a united front as the EU navigates significant geopolitical and economic challenges. The talks also aimed to resolve disagreements over key bilateral projects, such as the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) fighter jet, with both sides agreeing to find a solution by the end of August.</p>

          <p>The United States has established new trade deals with Indonesia and the Philippines, imposing a 19% tariff on imports from the two nations while ensuring American exports face no duties. Analysts suggest these agreements are an indirect strategy to counter China's economic influence by reshaping regional supply chains and securing access to resources like rare earth minerals. However, some experts note that Chinese manufacturing has become less dependent on transshipments and is increasingly localizing production within Southeast Asia. This move represents a shift in U.S. trade tactics after direct tariff confrontations with Beijing proved challenging.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ), the UN's highest court, has issued a unanimous advisory opinion stating that countries have a legal duty to prevent environmental harm from greenhouse gas emissions. The ruling, prompted by a campaign led by the island nation of Vanuatu, affirms that existing international laws and treaties compel states to prevent significant harm to the climate system. While not legally binding, the opinion establishes a powerful legal precedent that can be used in climate litigation worldwide. It asserts that wrongful acts require 'full reparations,' offering a potential lifeline for vulnerable nations disproportionately affected by climate change.</p>

          <p>NASA has successfully launched two identical satellites, known as TRACERS, to investigate the interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. This phenomenon creates 'space weather,' which can disrupt and damage critical infrastructure like satellites, GPS signals, and power grids. The twin spacecraft will fly in tandem, allowing scientists to take precise measurements of how energy from the sun couples with our planet's magnetosphere. The mission aims to improve understanding and prediction of these events, ultimately helping to safeguard technological systems and astronauts in space from potentially hazardous solar activity.</p>

          <p>As the Los Angeles Rams begin their training camp, several key concerns are being monitored for the team, which is otherwise considered a Super Bowl contender. A primary issue is the health of 37-year-old quarterback Matthew Stafford, who is sitting out initial drills due to back soreness. Other areas of focus include the stability of the offensive line, which is dealing with blood-clot issues for left tackle Alaric Jackson and recovery from injury for other key players. The team's depth at the cornerback position and the ongoing contract negotiations for star running back Kyren Williams are also significant issues to watch.</p>
