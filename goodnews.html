          <p>The median home sale price in the U.S. reached a record high of $396,500, but buyers are paying less than the median asking price. High mortgage rates and low inventory of affordable homes have made it difficult for Americans to enter the housing market, with first-time homebuyers decreasing significantly since 2010. Redfin data indicates sellers may be flexible on pricing due to increased inventory and economic uncertainty, but homes in desirable locations still sell at or above asking price. The real estate market is still shifting, with pricing strategies becoming more important for sellers.</p>

Khalil's arrest was widely condemned as an attack on free speech, and his release follows similar rulings for other detained students.

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with ICE in order to receive transportation funding. The ruling sided with 20 states that sued, arguing the administration lacked the authority to tie transportation dollars to immigration enforcement.

California's Attorney General lauded the decision, calling it a check on President Trump's attempt to coerce state and local governments.</p>

          <p>Comparing a $10,000 CD and a money market account reveals similar interest-earning potential, but with key differences.

Currently, money market account rates top out around 4.32%, while the highest rates on CDs are topping out around 4.49% for 6-month CDs, while declining slightly for longer terms. Savers should weigh the guaranteed interest of a CD against the potential for higher, but variable, returns from a money market account to determine the most profitable option.

While protein can be beneficial for muscle building and satiety, experts question the necessity of excessive protein consumption for the average person. Food companies use protein as a marketing tactic to make their products more attractive, but consumers should be wary of the health claims associated with these products.</p>
