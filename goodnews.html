        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia's central bank has lowered interest rates from 21% to 20%, marking the first cut since September 2022. This decision indicates that inflation pressures, previously described as "alarming" by President Putin, are beginning to subside. The inflation rate in April was reported at 6.2%, a decrease from the 8.2% average in the first quarter of 2025. While domestic demand still exceeds the capacity to expand the supply of goods and services, the central bank believes the Russian economy is gradually returning to a balanced growth path and monetary policy will remain tight for a long period to return inflation to its 4% target. </p>

          <p>Tesla shares experienced a rise in premarket trading following a period of tension between CEO Elon Musk and President Trump, which had previously led to a significant drop in the stock's value. Analysts suggested that a potential truce between Musk and Trump, possibly brokered through a phone call, could alleviate concerns. However, Trump's Chief of Staff indicated that there were no immediate plans for such a call. The market's reaction highlights the sensitivity of Tesla's stock to the relationship between its CEO and influential political figures. </p>

          <p>Roads, railways, and bridges are being tested by rising temperatures, necessitating adaptations to prevent failures. Extreme heat reduces road traction, deforms rail tracks, and stresses bridge joints, increasing maintenance needs. Solutions include heat-reflective coatings for roads, white paint for rails, and improved bridge designs with flexible joints. Adapting infrastructure is vital to ensure transport systems remain functional in a hotter world. </p>

          <p>Meteorologists have confirmed that a microburst caused the destructive hailstorm in Austin, with winds reaching up to 85 mph. The storm rapidly intensified, shattering windows, toppling trees, and knocking out power. A new analysis maps the damage and shows how cold air from melting hail fueled violent downbursts. The microburst formed as atmospheric systems collided, with the rapid cooling from hail making the storm especially dangerous. </p>

          <p>Beijing's police authority plans to liquidate cryptocurrencies confiscated in criminal cases by selling them through licensed exchanges in Hong Kong. This move could support Hong Kong's ambition to become a virtual asset hub. The Beijing Public Security Bureau has partnered with the China Beijing Equity Exchange (CBEX) to manage the sales. This marks the first time a mainland agency has detailed a process for disposing of confiscated cryptoassets through Hong Kong's virtual asset regime. </p>
