          <p>The film *Ballerina*, a spin-off "From the World of John Wick," expands the Wick canon rather than deepening its titular protagonist. The story follows Eve Macarro (Ana de Armas), who trains to be a killer after seeing her father gunned down by assassins. While initially appearing to be a *Wick* clone without the stylistic flair, the film succeeds by expanding the Wick universe, such as when Eve's journey leads her to a cultish mountain town in the Austrian Alps where every single inhabitant is out to kill her. The grim violence has a sense of humor and improvisation, harkening back to the Buster Keaton‚Äì and Looney Tunes‚Äìinspired mayhem at the core of *John Wick*.</p>
