          <h2>Consumer Sentiment Surges as Tariff Concerns Ease</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 10:27:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumer sentiment has rebounded significantly in early June, exceeding expectations as concerns over tariffs and inflation subside, according to a University of Michigan survey. The headline index of consumer sentiment rose to 60.5, a 15.9% increase from the previous month, with both current conditions and future expectations showing substantial gains. This improvement coincides with a softening in rhetoric surrounding President Trump's tariffs, leading to a more optimistic outlook on the economy. Despite the rebound, sentiment indexes remain below year-ago levels, reflecting ongoing worries about the impact of trade policies and geopolitical issues. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former England captain Owen Farrell is reportedly close to finalizing a return to Saracens after a challenging season with French side Racing 92. While the deal is yet to be signed, it is expected that Saracens and Racing will reach an agreement to facilitate Farrell's move this summer. Farrell, who spent 16 seasons with Saracens previously, is seen as a valuable asset both on and off the pitch, providing cover for injured players and sharing his expertise with younger talents. Although reports suggested a player-coach role, sources indicate it will initially be a two-year deal as a player only.</p>

          <p>Senator Josh Hawley has announced that the Senate's version of the "One Big Beautiful Bill" includes reauthorization and expansion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA). This expansion would allow individuals in regions of Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alaska, along with existing "downwinders," to receive compensation for exposure to toxic nuclear waste. The proposal also includes claims for increased levels of atmospheric testing and extends eligibility to uranium mine workers from 1971-1990. Hawley believes this marks a significant victory and a sign that the country stands with those affected by nuclear exposure.</p>

          <p>JBS, a Brazilian meat giant, commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $13.65 per share, valuing the company at approximately $30 billion. This launch occurred despite the company's history of corruption allegations, including bribery charges and fines for buying cattle illegally raised in protected Amazon land. The company's U.S. listing faced opposition from lawmakers due to its past scandals. JBS operates globally, with significant divisions in Brazil, the U.S., and Australia, and owns over 80% of Pilgrim's Pride, a U.S. poultry giant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked additional provisions of President Trump's executive order related to voting, affirming a pause on the requirement for documentary proof of citizenship when registering to vote using the national form. The judge also blocked a provision aimed at barring states from counting mail ballots postmarked by Election Day but received after, citing that states have the power to set election rules. The decision also blocked provisions adding new requirements for U.S. citizens abroad, including military members, to register and vote, deeming them contrary to Congress's intent.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Atlanta has blocked President Trump‚Äôs election executive order, siding with Democratic state attorneys who challenged it as unconstitutional. The order sought to compel officials to require documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration and accept only mailed ballots received by Election Day. The attorneys general argued that the directive ‚Äúusurps the States‚Äô constitutional power and seeks to amend election law by fiat.‚Äù The White House defended the order as ‚Äústanding up for free, fair and honest elections‚Äù and called proof of citizenship a ‚Äúcommonsense‚Äù requirement.</p>
