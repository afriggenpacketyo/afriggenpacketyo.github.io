          <p>The tech IPO market is showing signs of life after a prolonged drought dating back to early 2022, with shares of stock brokerage platform eToro jumping nearly 29% in its Nasdaq debut and artificial intelligence infrastructure provider CoreWeave reporting significant revenue growth. However, earlier optimism was tempered by President Trump's tariff policy in April, causing some companies to delay their offerings. Despite Klarna and StubHub remaining on hold, eToro's successful debut could encourage other companies to follow suit and revitalize the IPO market, despite some remaining economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Since his father's election, Donald Trump Jr. has transitioned into a prominent figure in Washington, joining corporate boards and advisory committees, and launching the exclusive "Executive Branch" private club. Critics fear this mingling of private business interests and government policy promotes a pay-to-play culture, while allies argue Trump Jr. is a skilled entrepreneur capitalizing on his position. Trump Jr. disputes suggestions that he is cashing in on his father's name, asserting he is a private citizen who has been a businessman his entire life. His activities include expanding the family's crypto profile and pursuing real estate investments, solidifying his role as a key figure in the MAGA movement.</p>

Pirelli's decision to bring the softest three tire compounds to this race could influence strategy, potentially shifting the race away from a standard one-stop approach. The first practice session was prematurely ended due to a crash by Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto, while Isack Hadjar spun into the barriers during the second session, causing a red flag.

This heat wave could be more persistent than previous warmups and may foreshadow a notably hot and potentially fiery summer for much of the West, including California.

          <p>The Federal Reserve will reduce its headcount by 10% over the next couple of years, including offering deferred resignation to some older employees, according to a memo from central bank chair Jerome Powell. The move aims to consolidate functions, modernize business practices, and ensure the Fed is right-sized. The planned staff cuts come as the Trump administration has pushed for cost cuts across civil service agencies. One method for shrinking the staff will be to offer a voluntary deferred resignation program to employees of the Federal Reserve Board who would be fully eligible to retire at the end of 2027.</p>
