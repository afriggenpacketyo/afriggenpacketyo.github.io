The Fever, despite being significantly shorthanded with six players on the injured list, showcased remarkable resilience and aggression throughout the game. This unexpected win spoiled A'ja Wilson's celebration of becoming the WNBA's first four-time MVP.

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets largely traded higher on Monday, tracking positive movements on Wall Street, as investors absorbed China's decision to maintain its benchmark loan prime rates (LPR) for the fourth consecutive month. Despite the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent rate cut, the People's Bank of China kept its one-year LPR at 3.0% and the five-year LPR at 3.5%. While Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose significantly, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index saw a slight decline, indicating varied regional reactions. The overall market performance reflects a complex interplay of global and local economic factors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities in the Dominican Republic announced the confiscation of 377 packages of cocaine from a speedboat that was destroyed by an aerial military strike from the U.S. Navy. This operation, described as the first of its kind, was a joint effort to intercept a vessel allegedly carrying 1,000 kilograms of drugs attempting to use the Dominican Republic as a transit point to the United States. The U.S. administration's deployment of a naval flotilla to the Caribbean has led to several such strikes, though human rights groups have raised concerns about the legality of these actions, sparking a debate in Congress.</p>

          <p>Individuals confronting terminal illnesses are increasingly turning to personalized music playlists as a source of comfort and connection during their final stages of life. This practice, highlighted by stories like that of DJ Dave Gilmore, leverages music's therapeutic benefits, which are increasingly recognized in palliative care. Experts explain that music "lights up" multiple parts of the brain, offering neurological and emotional support, and can even reach individuals who are unconscious. Charities and nurses emphasize the importance of music in reducing anxiety, preserving memories, and fostering shared experiences, providing solace for both patients and their grieving loved ones.</p>

          <p>Pat McFadden, the UK Work and Pensions Secretary, has declared that comprehensive welfare system reform is essential to effectively support individuals and manage the escalating costs of benefits. Despite the recent abandonment of a key policy aimed at cutting disability benefits, McFadden affirmed that reforms are continuously underway, including initiatives to offer employment support to individuals on sickness benefits. The government seeks to move beyond a rigid "binary divide" in assessing work capability, aiming instead for tailored assistance. The daunting challenge includes health and disability benefits projected to reach £100 billion by 2030, necessitating strategic and sustained policy adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists on Nantucket are pioneering an innovative project to combat Lyme disease transmission by genetically engineering wild white-footed mice to be immune to the disease-causing bacteria. This "Mice Against Ticks" initiative, led by MIT associate professor Kevin Esvelt, aims to interrupt the infection cycle, as these mice are the primary hosts for Lyme. The controversial plan involves releasing immune mice to pass on this immunity generationally, a significant acceleration of natural evolution. While promising for public health, the project requires extensive community buy-in and rigorous testing to address potential ecological impacts and ethical concerns about altering wild species.</p>
