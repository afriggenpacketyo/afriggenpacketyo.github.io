          <p>President Trump announced a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Japan-based Nippon Steel, stating that U.S. Steel will remain in America and keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh. The president claims this partnership will create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. Former President Joe Biden had previously blocked Nippon Steel's bid to buy U.S. Steel, citing national security concerns, but Trump ordered a new review in April. Trump has also levied tariffs on foreign steel imports to keep industry players in the U.S.</p>
