          <p>This article is a personal, photographic reflection from a journalist on their favorite place in Taiwan: the ancient red cypress forests of Alishan. Described as a stunning region of misty mountains and high-altitude tea, the forests offered the author a profound sense of timelessness and inner calm after years of stressful reporting. The author shares a moment when the sun's rays broke through the trees, an image another hiker aptly described as "god's smile," illustrating the area's deep natural beauty.</p>

          <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court has issued a significant 4-3 ruling stating that a pre-Civil War law from 1849 does not constitute a ban on abortion. The decision by the court's liberal majority clarifies that the old statute was effectively superseded by comprehensive legislation passed over the last 50 years to regulate the procedure. This ruling resolves a major legal gray area that emerged after the overturning of Roe v. Wade, allowing abortions to continue in the state.</p>
