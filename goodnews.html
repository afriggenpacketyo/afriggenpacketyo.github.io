          <p>The 2025 Met Gala, themed "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style," saw celebrities showcasing interpretations of Black dandyism. Co-chairs Colman Domingo, Lewis Hamilton, and Anna Wintour led the red carpet, followed by stars like Zendaya, Diana Ross, and Shakira. The dress code, "Tailored for You," nodded to the exhibition's focus on menswear. This year's theme was intended to take the Black dandy as its subject, examining the importance of clothing and style to the formation of Black identities in the Atlantic diaspora, according to Vogue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A newly declassified memo from U.S. intelligence agencies contradicts President Trump's claim that the Maduro regime in Venezuela controls the Tren de Aragua criminal gang. This claim was used to justify invoking the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador. The memo states that while Venezuela's environment enables the gang to operate, the Maduro regime likely does not cooperate with or direct the gang's activities in the United States. The release of this memo further undermines the Trump administration's rationale for using the Alien Enemies Act and calls into question its criticism of news coverage on the matter.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used for qualifying students to attend private schools. The bill provides most students attending accredited private schools with $10,000 per year, students with disabilities with up to $30,000 per year, and home-schooled students with $2,000 a year. Democrats argue the legislation will hurt public schools by siphoning funds to benefit wealthier students already in private schools. The bill signing marks a significant victory for school choice advocates in Texas.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket facility in South Texas, known as Starbase, is on its way to becoming an official city after a vote approved its incorporation. The vote was largely supported by Musk's employees at SpaceX, who make up the majority of the 283 eligible voters in the area. The creation of Starbase as a city has drawn criticism from those concerned about Musk's increasing control over the area, including the potential to close a popular beach and state park for launches. SpaceX officials have stated the need to grow Starbase as a community, managing roads, utilities, schooling, and medical care.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the North Carolina Board of Elections to certify the results of a contentious State Supreme Court race, rejecting efforts from the Republican challenger to throw out thousands of votes. Judge Richard E. Myers II ruled that all challenged ballots should be counted, as not doing so would violate the constitutional due process rights of those voters. The ruling is a significant legal victory for the Democratic incumbent, Justice Allison Riggs, who won in November by 734 votes after two recounts. The case has been ping-ponging through state and federal courts and tested the boundaries of post-election litigation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that disputed ballots in the unresolved 2024 race for a North Carolina Supreme Court seat must remain in the final count, potentially securing an electoral victory for Democratic incumbent Allison Riggs.

The decision has been delayed for seven days to allow the Republican challenger, Jefferson Griffin, to appeal. Democrats and voting rights groups have praised the ruling, while Republicans have stated Griffin was seeking to ensure only legal votes are counted.</p>

The shutdown comes just days after Congress passed the "Take It Down Act," which makes it a federal crime to post nonconsensual sexual imagery, including explicit deepfakes.
