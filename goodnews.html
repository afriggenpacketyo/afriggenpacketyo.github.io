          <p>A new study suggests that endangered sharks, rays, and native oysters could thrive in UK waters as rising ocean temperatures cause species to shift habitats. Researchers mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change, predicting that the North Sea could become a biodiversity hotspot. While some species, like the ocean quahog, may struggle, mobile species are expected to adapt better to the changing environment. The article highlights both the potential benefits and disruptions to the marine ecosystem caused by climate change, focusing on the impact on specific species and the need for adaptive conservation strategies.</p>
