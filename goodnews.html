        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage interest rates, which have been steadily declining and recently hit a near one-year low, may fall further this week due to an expected rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Lenders might preemptively lower their rates to remain competitive, especially with a rate reduction seen as a near certainty. The magnitude of the drop could be influenced by whether the Fed opts for a 25 or a more aggressive 50-basis-point cut. Prospective homebuyers are advised to monitor the market closely, as these lower rates may not last long, and to ensure their credit score is strong to qualify for the best offers.

          <p>Shares of Tesla surged over 5% after CEO Elon Musk disclosed he had purchased approximately $1 billion worth of the company's stock. The acquisition of more than 2.5 million shares is seen by the market as a strong signal of Musk's confidence in the electric vehicle maker's future. This move comes as Tesla faces challenges, including a sales decline and increased competition, and ahead of a shareholder vote on a new pay package that could make Musk the world's first trillionaire. The purchase may help to reassure investors who have been concerned about the company's recent performance. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis by CBS News examining the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) concludes that renewable sources like onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the cheapest forms of energy to produce, even before considering government subsidies. The report from investment bank Lazard shows that fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas, along with nuclear power, are significantly more expensive to generate. While the Trump administration is phasing out clean energy incentives and promoting fossil fuels, experts note that the high upfront capital costs of renewables are offset by extremely low long-term operating expenses, as the "fuel" is free.

          <h2>Experts Outline Seven Strategic Methods for Accessing Funds from Annuities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 14:06:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With annuity sales rising, many retirees are using them for guaranteed income, but accessing the funds early can be complex. This article outlines seven strategic ways to withdraw money from an annuity, each with different financial implications. The simplest method is waiting for scheduled payments to begin, but other options include partial withdrawals (often up to 10% annually without penalty), taking a loan against the annuity's value, or surrendering the contract for a lump sum, which may incur steep fees. Other strategies involve using a 1035 exchange to move funds to a new contract, invoking hardship provisions, or selling future payments to a third party.</p>

          <h2>AI Cloud Provider CoreWeave's Stock Surges on $6.3 Billion Nvidia Order Disclosure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 13:59:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of CoreWeave, a cloud infrastructure provider for AI, jumped as much as 8% after revealing a purchase agreement with Nvidia valued at a minimum of $6.3 billion. The deal obligates Nvidia to buy any of CoreWeave's unsold capacity through April 2032, highlighting the immense demand for AI computing power. CoreWeave, which is backed by Nvidia and went public in March, already relies heavily on Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) to service its clients, including major tech companies like Google and Microsoft. This agreement further solidifies the symbiotic relationship between the two companies at the center of the AI boom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Trump Proposes Replacing Quarterly Corporate Earnings Reports with a Biannual System</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 13:55:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has revived a proposal to eliminate the 55-year-old requirement for public companies to issue quarterly earnings reports, suggesting a switch to a six-month cycle instead. He argues that this change would save companies money and encourage executives to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits. The idea aligns with the administration's goal of reducing regulatory burdens and has been supported by some in the business community, including the Long-Term Stock Exchange. Critics, however, warn that less frequent reporting would deprive investors of timely and valuable financial information, potentially leading to less-informed investment decisions.

          <p>U.S. and Chinese trade officials have announced a framework agreement to transfer ownership of TikTok to a U.S.-controlled entity, a major breakthrough in the long-running dispute over the social media app. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the deal after high-level talks, stating that the commercial terms have been agreed upon by the private parties involved. The agreement aims to resolve national security concerns that TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, could be compelled to share American user data with Beijing or manipulate content. The final details are expected to be settled when President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping speak later in the week.</p>

          <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has reached a market capitalization of $3 trillion, joining an exclusive club that includes only Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. The company's stock rose more than 4% on Monday, pushing it past the milestone. The recent surge was partly fueled by a favorable outcome in an antitrust case, where the penalties imposed were less severe than investors had feared. This achievement comes about 20 years after Google's initial public offering and as the company navigates new challenges from AI competition and increased regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe.

          <h2>Financial Experts Warn Against Common Mistakes That Increase Credit Card Debt Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 12:02:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt exceeding $1.21 trillion and average interest rates near 22%, small mistakes can significantly increase costs for consumers. This article highlights three common errors to avoid: paying late, which incurs fees and can trigger a higher penalty APR; carrying a balance from month to month, which allows interest to compound daily; and failing to explore cost-saving strategies. Options like 0% balance transfer offers or debt consolidation loans can provide relief by lowering interest rates. Ignoring these solutions can cause debt to spiral, making it much more expensive and difficult to pay off in the long run.</p>
