        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Circle's stock price continued its upward trajectory on Friday, driven by investor enthusiasm for the Senate's passage of the GENIUS Act, a proposed stablecoin legislation. The stock experienced a significant increase, adding to gains made earlier in the week after the bill's passage. The GENIUS Act aims to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar, which have gained traction due to their potential for faster and cheaper payments. Coinbase shares also rose, benefiting from revenue generated from Circle's USDC reserves, and the bill would add substantial consumer protections, collateral requirements, and regulatory oversight. </p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Jersey ordered the release of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil from ICE detention, determining that he is not a threat to the community or a flight risk. Khalil, a green card holder, was detained by immigration agents in March, and his attorneys argued that his detention was "highly unusual." The White House announced that the administration would appeal the decision, and the Department of Homeland Security criticized the order, claiming it undermines national security. The judge stated that there was an effort to use the immigration charge to punish the petitioner for his anti-Israel speech, highlighting the controversy surrounding Khalil's detention. </p>

          <p>The median home sale price in the U.S. reached a record high of $396,500, but data indicates that buyers are paying less than the asking price. Buyers are paying approximately 6%, or $26,000, less than sellers' median asking price, suggesting potential flexibility in the market. High mortgage rates and low inventory of affordable homes have squeezed many Americans out of the housing market. Redfin suggests that sellers may be willing to negotiate on price due to high housing costs and economic uncertainty, however homes in desirable locations that are in perfect condition are still hot and typically sell at or above asking price.</p>

          <p>Meta explored a potential takeover of Perplexity AI before investing significantly in Scale AI, according to sources familiar with the matter. The two companies did not finalize a deal, with reports suggesting that Perplexity walked away from the potential acquisition. This move underscores Meta's aggressive efforts to strengthen its AI capabilities amidst intense competition from OpenAI and Google parent Alphabet. Zuckerberg has reportedly grown agitated that rivals like OpenAI appear to be ahead in both underlying AI models and consumer-facing apps, and he is going to extreme lengths to hire top AI talent. </p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with federal immigration authorities in order to receive transportation funding. The judge ruled that the administration lacks the legal authority to tie transportation dollars to immigration enforcement. The policy was deemed "arbitrary and capricious" and lacking specificity in how states are to cooperate on immigration enforcement. The Trump administration has threatened to cut off some federal funding to "sanctuary" jurisdictions, arguing that these policies hinder ICE's ability to apprehend undocumented immigrants. </p>

          <p>The potential interest earned on a $10,000 CD versus a money market account varies, especially in the current rate environment. CD rates are fixed, while money market account rates are variable and subject to change. Depending on the lender and term length, a CD may offer slightly higher rates than a money market account, but money market accounts provide greater access to funds. Savers should consider their individual needs and risk tolerance when choosing between these two options, as both offer similar interest-earning potential. (not investment advice)</p>
