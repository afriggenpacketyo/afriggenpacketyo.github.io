          <p>Air traffic controllers at Newark Liberty International Airport experienced a 90-second radar and communication outage early Friday morning, marking the second such incident in recent weeks. The FAA reported that the outage occurred around 3:55 a.m. ET, affecting communication and radar displays. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy recently unveiled a plan to modernize the country's air traffic control system, but the recent outages have increased pressure on officials and lawmakers to address the issues promptly. The controller on duty at Newark airport reported the outage to the pilot of a FedEx flight, and flights to and from Newark were delayed on Friday morning as a result of the outage.</p>

          <p>While tech giants like Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon reported strong first-quarter ad sales, executives are expressing concerns about a potential slowdown in the digital advertising market due to trade tensions. Meta's CFO noted decreased spending from Asia-based e-commerce exporters, while Alphabet and Pinterest shared similar sentiments regarding slower Asia-specific ad sales and broader macroeconomic uncertainty. Snap went as far as to pull its second-quarter guidance, citing the unpredictable economy and potential shrinking corporate ad budgets.

          <p>This article explores the monthly costs associated with a $15,000 home equity loan in 2025, considering the current average interest rates. Home equity loans are presented as a relatively inexpensive way to borrow money, with rates lower than personal loans and credit cards. The article provides example monthly payments for 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year loan terms at the average rates available in May 2025. Alternatives to home equity loans, such as HELOCs, cash-out refinances, and reverse mortgages, are also discussed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly exploring a plan to bring Greenland into America's sphere of influence through a compact of free association (Cofa). This agreement would involve the U.S. providing essential services and military protection to Greenland in exchange for military access and duty-free trade. While this falls short of Trump's previous interest in acquiring the island, it reflects ongoing U.S. interest in Greenland's mineral deposits and strategic location. The plan faces hurdles, including the need for Greenland to separate from Denmark and potential skepticism from Greenlanders.</p>

          <p>David Souter, a retired Supreme Court Justice known for his independent and often liberal stance despite being appointed by a Republican president, has died at the age of 85.

Bush in 1990, Souter often sided with the court's liberal members on key issues, including affirmative action and abortion rights.

          <p>President Trump indicated openness to reducing tariffs on China to 80% as U.S. and Chinese negotiators prepare for trade talks in Switzerland. This suggestion comes amid concerns about the impact of trade tensions on international markets and the global economy. However, the White House clarified that any tariff reduction would be contingent on concessions from China. Experts warn that an 80% tariff may still be too high to revive trade across the Pacific, and economists continue to raise concerns about a potential recession due to Trump's tariffs.</p>

          <p>FIFA has announced that the Women's World Cup will expand from 32 to 48 teams starting with the 2031 tournament. The FIFA Council unanimously approved the changes, which will result in a 12-group format and an additional 40 matches, extending the tournament by a week. FIFA President Gianni Infantino stated that the expansion will give more nations the opportunity to develop their women's football structures. The United Kingdom is seen as the only "valid" bidder for the 2035 edition.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the immediate release of R√ºmeysa √ñzt√ºrk, a Tufts University doctoral student, from immigration detention. Judge William K. Sessions ruled that her arrest and detention appeared to be retaliation for an op-ed she wrote criticizing her school's response to the Israel-Hamas war. The Trump administration accused √ñzt√ºrk of engaging in activities in support of Hamas, but the judge found no evidence to support this claim other than the op-ed. Ozt√ºrk still faces possible deportation, but will not be detained while she fights the government's attempt to revoke her legal status.</p>

          <p>Margot Friedl√§nder, a Holocaust survivor and activist, has died at the age of 103. Friedl√§nder survived the Theresienstadt concentration camp and emigrated to the United States before returning to Germany in 2010. After returning to Germany, Friedl√§nder shared her experiences with young people and advocated for remembrance. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier expressed his condolences, stating that Friedl√§nder "gifted our country reconciliation." Friedl√§nder's story serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of remembering the Holocaust and fighting against antisemitism.</p>
