          <p>Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese downplayed a heated exchange following a flagrant foul during the Indiana Fever's season-opening win against the Chicago Sky. Clark was called for the foul after a hard contact on Reese, leading to a tense moment between the two players. Both Clark and Reese characterized the incident as a normal "basketball play," despite their history of rivalry dating back to their college days. The game saw Clark achieve a triple-double, while Reese led in rebounds, and the Fever secured a decisive victory.</p>

Liu, who had voluntarily signed up and been assigned to an armed police force, repeatedly requested to leave after joining the army. As a result, he is now banned from civil service, state-owned enterprises, overseas travel for two years, and faces a fine of 38,000 yuan (US$5,300). The penalties are intended to emphasize the importance of military service and deter others from dodging their obligations.</p>

          <p>The UK's Eurovision entry, Remember Monday, finished in 19th place despite strong vocals and staging. The article suggests that the song itself, a mix of musical styles, may have been the reason for the poor result. While the professional juries recognized the clever British touches, the song may have been too busy for viewers. The staging was well-executed but lacked the scale of other performances. The article concludes that the UK laid good foundations and should not be too down on its chances at Eurovision in the future.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Walmart for blaming tariffs on imported goods for its increased prices, urging the company to "eat the tariffs" instead of passing the costs on to consumers. Walmart had warned that prices on various items, including bananas and car seats, could increase despite softened tariffs on China. Trump insisted that foreign producers and retailers should absorb the additional expenses to maintain his economic agenda, which aims to create more domestic manufacturing jobs. Walmart responded that it would continue to keep prices as low as possible despite the challenges.</p>

          <p>Former Conservative minister Michael Gove stated that a second Scottish independence referendum could be considered if there is overwhelming public support for it. While Gove does not believe another referendum is currently necessary, he cautioned against complacency and emphasized the importance of demonstrating that the UK union is working. Gove's comments align with SNP leader John Swinney's call for "demonstrable support" for independence, akin to the 1997 referendum for a Scottish parliament. The article also discusses past disagreements between Gove and the Scottish government, including the UK government's veto of Holyrood's Gender Recognition Reform bill.</p>

          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey reveals that 81% of people in Japan feel "more uneasy than hopeful" about U.S. President Donald Trump's second term, primarily due to concerns about the impact of tariffs. The survey, conducted between March and April, indicates that 42% of respondents cited the threat tariffs pose to free trade as a reason for their unease. Despite this, some respondents praised Trump's leadership and his stance against China. The survey also shows a slight decrease in the proportion of people prioritizing relations with the United States over China.</p>

          <p>China is investing heavily in digitalizing museums and cultural heritage sites to engage new generations and promote national pride. This includes using 3D scanning, AI, and VR to bring ancient history to life, such as the digital Tangut princess Yun Zhuo in Zhangye.

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer indicated that a youth mobility scheme could be included in a new deal with the EU. He insisted that the scheme would not be a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement, but rather a reciprocal arrangement for young people to move abroad for up to two years. While specific details about eligibility and numbers were not provided, the proposal has drawn criticism from Conservatives who view it as "free movement through the back door."</p>
