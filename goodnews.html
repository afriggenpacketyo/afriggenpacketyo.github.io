          <p>High Noon is recalling two lots of its Beach Variety 12-packs after discovering some cans were mislabeled as Celsius energy drinks. The recall, announced via the FDA, was initiated because a shared packaging supplier mistakenly sent empty Celsius cans to High Noon, leading to the potential for unintended alcohol consumption. The affected packs were distributed to several states, and consumers are advised to dispose of the products and contact the company for a refund. No illnesses have been reported in connection with the mislabeling.</p>

          <p>Meta's shares surged after the company reported second-quarter revenue of $47.52 billion and earnings per share of $7.14, both surpassing Wall Street estimates. The strong performance was driven by a 22% year-over-year sales growth and robust advertising revenue. The company also raised its forecast for the third quarter and increased its planned capital expenditures, signaling continued heavy investment in AI and infrastructure. Despite a significant operating loss in its Reality Labs division, the overall positive results and user growth boosted investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Senate committee has advanced legislation that would prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks. Republican Senator Josh Hawley joined all Democrats on the panel in an 8-7 vote to move the bill forward, though its future in the full Senate is uncertain. The bill, now called the Honest Act, would require lawmakers to divest their holdings and certify compliance annually. The proposal has drawn mixed reactions, with some Republicans defending wealth and the use of blind trusts, while former President Trump offered a conceptually positive but later critical response.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has announced the repatriation of an American child from the al-Hol camp in northeastern Syria, which holds thousands of individuals with alleged ties to ISIS. The child, who has spent their entire life in such camps, will be reunited with family in the United States. This action underscores the U.S. government's position that repatriation by countries of origin is the only durable solution to the humanitarian and security crisis in these camps. The move comes as Washington encourages a unified Syrian government to take control of the facilities.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President and 2024 presidential candidate Kamala Harris has announced she will not run for governor of California, ending widespread speculation about her next political move.
