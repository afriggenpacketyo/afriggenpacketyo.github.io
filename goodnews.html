          <p>An increasing number of adults are seeking chiropractic treatment, yet experts urge caution regarding potential risks. Spine doctors emphasize their science-based approach and specialized medical training, while chiropractors focus on manual spinal adjustments. Chiropractic care may reduce tension, inflammation, and stress, but it is important to consult a spine specialist for radiating pain or nerve-related issues. Choosing a transparent chiropractor with a clear treatment plan and a strong relationship with a spine surgery practice is crucial for ensuring safe and effective care.</p>
