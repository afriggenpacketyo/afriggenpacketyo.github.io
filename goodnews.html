        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that parents in Europe generally find more meaning in life compared to those without children, but they experience lower life satisfaction. This disparity is particularly pronounced for mothers and varies significantly across countries, with Scandinavian countries showing less difference between parents and non-parents due to supportive family policies. Factors such as childcare availability, financial support, and gender equality play crucial roles in influencing parental satisfaction. The study emphasizes the importance of societal support for parents, viewing children as a community responsibility rather than solely a parental one.</p>
