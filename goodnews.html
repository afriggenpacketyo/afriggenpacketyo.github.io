          <p>Apple has approved Spotify's U.S. app update, enabling users to access pricing information and make purchases through various payment options within the app. This approval follows a U.S. federal judge's order for Apple to cease imposing commissions on purchases made via web links inside iPhone apps. Spotify's spokesperson Jeanne Moran stated that this milestone will allow the company to freely display clear pricing information and purchase links. The update permits users to buy subscriptions, upgrade plans, and use payment methods other than Apple's system, marking a significant win for developers seeking a level playing field.</p>

          <p>Despite worries over the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs, the U.S. labor market demonstrated resilience in April, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 177,000. The unemployment rate remained stable at 4.2%, and a broader measure of unemployment edged lower, indicating a relatively stable labor market. The report led traders to push out expectations for an interest rate cut, and sectors like health care and transportation showed significant job creation. While the federal government reported job losses, analysts suggest it is too early for the report to reflect the impacts of the tariffs.</p>

          <p>The recent Canadian federal election saw a substantial shift in the political landscape, with 17% of seats changing hands, up from just 7% in 2021. Notably, leaders from three of the five parties represented in the House of Commons failed to win their seats. The New Democratic Party (NDP) suffered significant losses, potentially impacting their parliamentary funding and influence, while the Liberal Party experienced a dramatic turnaround. All 59 seats that flipped went to either the Liberals or Conservatives, reflecting a wider shift away from Canada's smaller parties.</p>

          <p>A 7.4 magnitude earthquake in the Drake Passage triggered a tsunami warning, leading to evacuations in Chile's Magallanes region and parts of Argentina's Tierro del Fuego region.

Chilean President Gabriel Boric called for evacuation of the coastline throughout the Magallanes region, advising residents to act calmly and follow authorities' instructions.

Defensive giants in healthcare, energy, and consumer staples, supported by high dividend yields, have fueled the rally.
