          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to the construction of the Sizewell C nuclear power plant on the Suffolk coastline, aiming to boost economic growth and achieve clean energy goals. The project is expected to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed it as a "landmark decision," critics like Alison Downes from Stop Sizewell C argue that ministers are not being transparent about the project's costs and that the investment could be better spent elsewhere. The government maintains that nuclear power is crucial for eliminating fossil fuels from the UK's energy grid by 2030, despite concerns about delays and cost overruns seen with similar projects like Hinkley Point C.</p>

          <h2>Drug Overdose Deaths Among Young Americans Decline Amid Fentanyl Crisis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 00:01:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have significantly decreased, with a 47% reduction in fatal overdoses among those aged 20 to 29. This decline is attributed to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less deadly fentanyl being sold, increased addiction healthcare access, and a shift towards less risky drug use among teens. The number of teens abstaining from substance use has reached its highest level, and younger generations are reportedly turning to cannabis and psychedelics instead of opioids. Despite this positive trend, experts warn that sustaining progress may be difficult, as many individuals still struggle with addiction and the Trump administration seeks to cut funding for addiction services.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) will deploy school police to create safe zones around campuses and school events, including graduations, to protect students and families from federal immigration agents. Superintendent Alberto Carvalho announced that the district will use its police force to ensure students can access education, meals, counseling, and support without fear. This decision follows widespread immigration raids in Los Angeles and clashes between police and protesters, as the district aims to provide a secure environment for students during graduation season. The move is a response to the Trump administration's immigration policies and concerns about the impact on students and their families.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Institution has asserted its independence by stating that it retains authority over personnel decisions, including the director of the National Portrait Gallery. This statement is seen as a rejection of President Trump's announcement that he was firing the director, Kim Sajet, for being a supporter of DEI. The Smithsonian emphasized that the Board of Regents and the Secretary manage the institution, underscoring its nonpartisan stance. This move comes amid proposed budget cuts to the Smithsonian by the White House, signaling a potential conflict between the institution and the Trump administration over cultural and personnel matters.</p>

          <p>Ren Zhengfei, the founder of Huawei Technologies, stated that while the company's Ascend chips lag behind US counterparts by a generation, state-of-the-art performance can still be achieved through tactics like "stacking and clustering." Ren emphasized China's advantages in AI development, including a large youth population, sufficient electricity, and a developed information network. He also highlighted the availability of open-source software to meet societal needs. Ren's comments come as Washington increases restrictions on China and Huawei, with the US Department of Commerce potentially interpreting the use of Ascend chips as a violation of American export controls.

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to lower elevated rice prices. This decision will reduce the country's rice reserve to 100,000 tons, with the released rice going to smaller supermarket operators in addition to major retailers. Rice prices have doubled compared to the previous year, prompting the government to take this step after previous releases through auctions. The government expects the cheaper rice sold through direct contracts to bring down overall prices and alleviate the burden on consumers.</p>

          <p>The New York State Legislature has passed a bill that would allow terminally ill people to end their lives on their own terms, a practice known as medical aid in dying. The bill now heads to Governor Kathy Hochul for her signature, which would make New York the latest state to permit this practice. The legislation aims to provide individuals facing terminal illnesses with greater autonomy over their end-of-life decisions. This move reflects a growing national conversation about patient rights and the role of medical assistance in cases of severe suffering.</p>
