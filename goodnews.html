          <p>Shanghai's mayor has announced that the city will eliminate all foreign investment restrictions within its manufacturing sector, signaling a major step towards opening its market further. The move aims to grant overseas companies full access in key fields such as electric vehicles, biotechnology, and value-added telecommunications services. As part of this initiative, officials pledged that foreign-funded manufacturers will receive equal treatment in government procurement processes. The policy is designed to reinforce Shanghai's status as an open and attractive hub for international business and investment. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the ethical dilemma of engaging with the Harry Potter universe while disagreeing with the controversial views of its author, J.K. Rowling. It argues that readers can separate the art from the artist, appreciating the positive messages of anti-supremacy and acceptance in the books despite their flaws and the author's statements. The piece suggests that critically engaging with the material, similar to how religious texts are interrogated, can generate social good and transform the fandom experience. Rather than simply offsetting purchases with donations, the article advocates for active, communal discussion to grapple with the work's complexities.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese President William Lai has generated debate after stating in an interview that Taiwan wants to assist the United States in its reindustrialization and efforts to become a global AI hub. By framing this cooperation with the phrase "help make America great again," Lai linked Taiwan's technological prowess, particularly through companies like TSMC, to American economic strength. The comments were made during a discussion about the island's crucial role in the global AI supply chain and the future of U.S.-Taiwan relations amid rising cross-strait tensions. His choice of words has stirred discussion within Taiwan about the nature of its strategic alignment with the U.S.</p>

Jefferies upgraded AMD to a buy after its major partnership with OpenAI, while also reiterating a buy on Snowflake, noting its accelerating product innovation. Mizuho raised its price target for Dell following the company's increased long-term financial targets, which are heavily supported by strong demand for its AI servers.

          <h2>Chicago Marathon Proceeds with Optimism Despite Heightened Federal Immigration Enforcement</h2>

          <p>The annual Chicago Marathon is taking place amid cautious optimism from runners and organizers, despite recent aggressive Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in the city. The Trump administration's push, dubbed "Operation Midway Blitz," has created an uncertain atmosphere, particularly in the predominantly Latino neighborhoods along the race route. Community groups are on-site as a precaution, educating residents on their rights, while the mayor has encouraged participation as a form of resistance to what he calls federal intimidation. Local business owners and run clubs acknowledge the changed mood but emphasize the importance of community solidarity.</p>

          <p>This cultural article offers a starter pack of foreign-language films for audiences looking to explore cinema beyond English-language productions. Writers from The Atlantic recommend several accessible yet acclaimed movies, including the Argentinian historical drama "Argentina, 1985," which follows the real-life trial of military junta leaders. Other suggestions include the classic French musical "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg" and Zhang Yimou’s visually stunning martial-arts film "Shadow." The piece emphasizes that overcoming the "one-inch tall barrier of subtitles" opens up a world of exceptional storytelling and diverse cinematic experiences that can be deeply rewarding.</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has declared that universities must take decisive action to protect Jewish students from a recent rise in antisemitism, harassment, and discrimination on campuses. She announced government funding for training programs designed to help university staff and students identify and tackle antisemitic behavior, stating that many Jewish students currently do not feel safe. The measures include £4 million to promote interfaith understanding and teach students about misinformation, alongside a separate £2 million Holocaust education scheme for secondary schools. The move follows reports of a significant increase in antisemitic incidents at UK universities.</p>

          <p>A high-profile international peace summit is set to take place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, co-chaired by President Trump, to solidify a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. The event will be attended by numerous world leaders, including the German Chancellor, French President, and UK Prime Minister, who aim to support the plan's implementation and provide humanitarian aid. The first phase of the agreement includes the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas, which is expected to begin on Monday. However, Hamas has stated it will not attend the summit, having conducted negotiations through mediators.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have utilized an advanced AI protein language model to identify previously hidden links between species that have independently evolved similar traits. This process, known as convergent evolution, is seen in examples like echolocation in both bats and dolphins. Traditional methods focus on simple sequence similarities, but the AI model allowed scientists to analyze complex, high-order features like 3D protein structures. The study, published in PNAS, reveals an underappreciated sequence basis for how different species arrive at the same functional solution, deepening the understanding of evolutionary processes.</p>

          <p>Following a new ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, preparations are underway to significantly increase the flow of humanitarian aid into the war-torn Gaza Strip. Aid organizations are preparing to send up to 600 trucks per day, carrying essential supplies like food, fuel, and medicine, which will be inspected by Israeli forces before entry. As Israeli forces withdraw from certain areas, displaced Palestinians have begun returning to their neighborhoods, many of which have been reduced to rubble. The halt in fighting brings hope for an end to the two-year conflict that has caused widespread devastation and a severe hunger crisis.</p>

          <p>Two of China's senior officials recently conducted tours focusing on key domestic priorities at opposite ends of the country. Vice-Premier Zhang Guoqing visited the eastern province of Zhejiang, urging manufacturers to integrate advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and large language models into their production processes to create "new quality productive forces." This push for technological innovation in areas like new energy vehicles and optical instruments aims to bolster China's manufacturing power. The focus on both high technology and addressing low incomes reflects the government's dual approach to national development. (not investment advice)</p>
