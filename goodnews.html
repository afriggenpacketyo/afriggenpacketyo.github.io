          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 03:13:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>English forward Marcus Rashford hopes to make his loan spell at Barcelona permanent when his agreement from Manchester United concludes this summer. Barcelona possesses an option to sign him for £28 million, a fee significantly lower than the £40 million United would seek from other clubs. The 27-year-old, whose United contract extends to 2028, appears to have no future at Old Trafford under current head coach Ruben Amorim, prompting his desire for a change. Rashford, who has scored five goals in 12 games for Barcelona, believes he is greatly benefiting from the change of scenery and the club's rich history, finding new enjoyment in his football career.</p>

          <p>UK retail sales volumes reached their highest level since 2022 in September, with new data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showing a 0.5% monthly rise. Between July and September, sales were 0.9% higher than the previous three months, indicating a robust quarter. Favorable weather conditions significantly boosted clothing sales, while non-store retailers, primarily online shops, experienced a 3.8% increase, driven by strong tech sales coinciding with the iPhone 17 launch and demand for gold. These ONS figures are vital for government policy and Bank of England decisions, despite recent criticisms regarding data quality and budget constraints. (not investment advice)</p>

This marks a significant first for the company at the event, signaling its growing ambition to disrupt the global passenger aircraft market currently dominated by Airbus and Boeing. Following a surge in domestic orders, Comac is actively seeking to boost overseas sales, leveraging the exposure to over 148,000 attendees and China's expanding trade relations with the Middle East to achieve its international goals.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 02:49:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Caerphilly by-election yielded an extraordinary result, profoundly humbling Westminster's major parties as Labour attracted just 11% and the Conservatives a mere 2% of the vote. This left the two dominant forces with only 13% combined. Instead, the contest was a race between Plaid Cymru, whose candidate Lindsay Whittle secured a historic victory after decades of attempts, and Reform UK, which took a solid second place with 36%. This outcome signals a potential turning point for Labour in Wales, with Plaid Cymru now aiming to become the main governing party after next May's Senedd elections.</p>

          <p>China's top leaders concluded the Fourth Plenum by pledging to vigorously boost domestic consumption and strengthen self-reliance in advanced technologies, including quantum computing and hydrogen power, over the next five years. The strategy aims to balance consumption with "effective investment," indicating a focus on consumption-related sectors like urban planning, public services, and elderly care, rather than direct cash handouts. While reaffirming a 5% growth target, some experts are cautious about achieving significant consumption growth without direct income increases or fiscal commitment. This article highlights a continued push towards a strong manufacturing nation and tech independence in a perceived challenging global landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are set to hold their first in-person meeting since Trump's return to office on October 30th, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in South Korea. This highly anticipated meeting aims to de-escalate mounting trade tensions, especially as a fragile trade detente approaches its expiration and additional 100% tariffs loom. Discussions are expected to cover contentious issues including rare earths, agricultural purchases, fentanyl flows, and geopolitical flashpoints such as Taiwan. Experts believe the meeting will likely focus on resuming trade talks rather than securing a comprehensive, sweeping deal.</p>

          <p>A Chinese research team has unveiled a smart, super-tough coating for stealth aircraft, with a study published in Advanced Materials detailing its properties. This innovative material is a scalable, flexible, and ultra-thin (0.1 mm) metasurface capable of withstanding extreme temperatures up to 1,000 degrees Celsius. Its tunable impedance makes it highly suitable for aerospace electromagnetic wave absorption, significantly enhancing stealth capabilities. The research, led by scientists from Peking University and Harbin Engineering University, builds upon previous discoveries in large-scale graphene production, representing a substantial advancement in both materials science and military technology.</p>

Mayor Lurie assured the president of substantial progress in public safety, citing a nearly 30% citywide crime reduction and historic lows in violent crime and homicides. The mayor also spoke with Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, receiving assurances on tackling the fentanyl crisis. This reversal de-escalates tensions between federal and local authorities, with city leaders united behind local-driven public safety initiatives.</p>

          <p>"No Kings" rallies in Washington D.C. and Portland featured protesters in inflatable animal costumes, including frogs, lobsters, and unicorns, as a tactic to counter negative Republican narratives portraying them as "Hate America" radicals. Inspired by a viral incident in Portland, activists Jordy Lybeck and Brooks Brown organized "Operation Inflation" to undermine claims of a "war zone." A Princeton professor noted that such absurdist humor can be an effective tactic against perceived autocrats by making government responses seem farcical.
