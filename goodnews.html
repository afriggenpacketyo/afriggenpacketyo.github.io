          <p>Fair Isaac, the company behind the FICO score, saw its shares surge over 20% after announcing a new pricing model that allows mortgage lenders to license credit scores directly, bypassing traditional credit bureaus. This change offers lenders a choice in pricing and distribution, aiming to eliminate mark-ups on FICO scores. While Fair Isaac's stock rallied, shares of major credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax declined, signaling investor concerns about their diminished role. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, who previously criticized FICO's pricing, lauded the move as a step towards more competitive markets for American consumers.

          <p>A poignant BBC documentary, filmed before Ozzy Osbourne's death in July at 76, features the rock legend reflecting on his life and "humbling" farewell concert in Birmingham. Osbourne, who battled Parkinson's disease and spinal injuries, expressed that he "wouldn't change a thing" about his life despite the challenges. The film captures his determination to perform one last time, even from a seated position, and includes insights from his daughter Kelly. The documentary also touches on his memoir, which reveals a battle with sepsis earlier this year and his unique "addiction" to Pink Lady apples.</p>

Endeavor Air Flight 5047, arriving from Charlotte, struck the wing of Flight 5155, which was preparing for departure to Roanoke. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident, which resulted in one minor injury to a flight attendant. Flight recorders have been recovered, and while there was no impact on airport operations, passengers were deplaned and accommodated for new flights.</p>

This rebound follows a difficult fiscal year for Intel, which saw shares drop 60% in 2024. New leadership and major investments from Softbank and Nvidia have helped restore confidence, with the company now trading at its highest level in 18 months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers from Purdue University claim to have "very strong" evidence suggesting Amelia Earhart's long-lost plane has been located in a lagoon on Nikumaroro, a remote South Pacific island. A "visual anomaly," visible in satellite photos since 1938, will be investigated by an expedition team in November using sonar and magnetometers, with plans to dredge and identify the object. This discovery could potentially confirm the theory that Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan landed and were marooned on the island after their 1937 disappearance. If confirmed, Purdue University hopes to transport the plane back to the institution.</p>
