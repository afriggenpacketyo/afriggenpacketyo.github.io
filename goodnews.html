          <h2>Understanding Federal Student Loan Limits and Alternative Funding Options</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 12:53:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As college costs continue to escalate, federal student loans serve as a primary funding source, offering unique borrower protections. However, these loans have borrowing limits that vary based on dependency status, academic year, and student level (undergraduate or graduate). For instance, independent undergraduates have a lifetime limit of $57,500, which often falls short of the average annual costs, especially at private institutions. When federal loans are insufficient, private student loans can bridge the funding gap, allowing borrowing up to the full cost of attendance. While private loans may offer lower interest rates, they typically require a credit check and careful consideration of repayment terms, emphasizing the importance of a thoughtful financial plan to manage student debt effectively.

          <h2>Science-Backed Strategies Offered to Combat Widespread Smartphone Addiction</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 12:49:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With individuals spending an average of 4 hours and 37 minutes daily on their phones, smartphone addiction has become a prevalent global issue, impacting mental and physical health. Studies link problematic smartphone use to increased depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and physical pain. This behavioral addiction shares symptoms with gambling or video-game addiction, often serving as an escapist tool from stress. Scientists recommend a multi-faceted approach to quitting, including leaving phones out of bedrooms, reducing notifications, setting screens to black-and-white, and using self-control apps. The more methods applied simultaneously, the higher the long-term success rate, with some clinical trials showing short-term effectiveness in reducing problematic use. Understanding the root cause of addiction and seeking professional help, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, are also crucial steps.</p>

          <h2>SkyWest Pilot Performs Evasive Maneuver to Avoid B-52 Bomber Near Minot Air Force Base</h2>

          <p>A SkyWest flight pilot executed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a B-52 military aircraft during landing approach in Minot, North Dakota, on Friday night. The pilot informed passengers that air traffic control, lacking radar, did not provide a heads-up about the military plane, which was much faster and on a converging course. The SkyWest flight, operating as Delta Connection from Minneapolis, landed safely with 76 passengers and four crew members after the unexpected turn. The Air Force confirmed a B-52 from Minot Air Force Base was operating in the area after a flyover. Both SkyWest and the Federal Aviation Administration are investigating the incident, which the pilot described as "not a fun day at work."</p>

          <p>Trump Media and Technology Group, owner of Truth Social, has announced a $2 billion investment in Bitcoin and related securities as part of its new "bitcoin treasury plan," aiming to rebrand as an investment firm. CEO Devin Nunes stated the move ensures financial freedom, protects against institutional discrimination, and creates synergies with an upcoming utility token for the Truth Social ecosystem. This substantial purchase follows Trump Media's earlier plan to raise $2.5 billion for Bitcoin acquisition and comes as former President Trump increasingly focuses on cryptocurrencies. The company also allocated $300 million for an options acquisition strategy for Bitcoin-related securities, with plans for continued Bitcoin accumulation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Domino's Pizza is strategically targeting frugal consumers with discounts to gain market share, even amidst broader industry headwinds. CEO Russell Weiner noted that the company's U.S. same-store sales grew by 3.4%, exceeding estimates, partly due to the successful introduction of stuffed crust pizza and value promotions like the $9.99 "Best Deal Ever." Domino's reported sales growth across all income groups, including low-income customers, bucking the trend seen by many fast-food rivals struggling with high inflation. Weiner sees parallels with Chili's recent success, suggesting that consumers are willing to spend on perceived value. Despite missing Wall Street earnings expectations due to a charge from its China licensee, the company remains focused on cost control to boost profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Melius analyst Ben Reitzes has reiterated his recommendation for Apple to acquire AI startup Perplexity, suggesting such a "bold move" could significantly boost Apple's stock and establish it as an AI leader.

CNBC's Jim Cramer concurred, arguing that legal challenges like the DOJ's antitrust case against Google jeopardize Apple's current search agreement, making an acquisition like Perplexity essential. While Morgan Stanley anticipates a solid quarter for Apple, the ongoing antitrust scrutiny underscores the urgency for Apple to innovate and secure its position in the evolving AI landscape.

This initiative aims to "eliminate the scourge of oversized bags" that delay boarding and are unfair to the vast majority of passengers who comply with rules. O'Leary stated that while only a small minority incur these fees, the airline is determined to reduce excess baggage issues. He expressed confidence that incentivizing staff with a share of these fees will lead to a decline in oversized bags over time. The announcement comes as Ryanair reported a significant jump in profits for the April to June period, supported by fare increases and cost control.</p>

          <p>The wreckage of HMS Nottingham, a Royal Navy warship sunk during World War One, has been discovered in the North Sea, 60 miles off the coast of Scotland, 109 years after its demise. A team of ten divers from ProjectXplore identified the 492ft ship at a depth of 82 meters, confirming its identity through name stamps, dimensions, and equipment. The vessel was torpedoed three times by a German U-boat on August 19, 1916, resulting in the deaths of 38 crew members. The captain and 377 other crew were rescued. After a century of failed attempts, ProjectXplore's extensive research and sonar surveys led to this significant historical find, documenting the site this month.</p>
