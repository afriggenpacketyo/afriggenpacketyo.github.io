This visit occurred just as China was beginning its era of 'reform and opening up,' which sparked decades of rapid economic and technological growth.

          <p>Lieutenant Colonel George Hardy, a distinguished member of the Tuskegee Airmen, has passed away at the age of 100. As one of the last surviving pilots from America's first Black military aviation unit, he flew 21 combat missions over Europe during World War II. His extensive military career also included service in the Korean and Vietnam Wars, flying a total of 136 combat missions across three conflicts. After retiring, Hardy became a dedicated advocate for preserving the legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen, who were collectively awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 2007.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has committed to starting construction on three new towns in England before the next general election as part of its economic growth strategy. A taskforce has identified Tempsford, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill as the most promising initial sites from a list of twelve proposed locations. This initiative is central to Labour's pledge to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029, addressing the nation's housing crisis. The plan aims for at least 40% of the new homes to be classified as affordable housing, with development corporations overseeing the projects.</p>

          <p>Colorado-based modular homebuilder Fading West is positioning itself as a solution to the nationwide housing shortage and affordability crisis. By constructing homes in a factory setting, the company claims it can reduce costs by up to 20% and cut delivery time in half compared to traditional on-site construction. This innovative approach was recently used to provide 82 homes for residents displaced by the Maui wildfires, marking a new strategy for FEMA disaster relief. The company's model addresses key industry challenges like labor shortages and weather delays, offering a scalable path toward more attainable homeownership.</p>

          <p>Rudy Giuliani has reached a confidential settlement with Dominion Voting Systems, ending the company's $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit against him. Dominion sued the former Trump lawyer for repeatedly making baseless claims that its voting machines were used to rig the 2020 presidential election. This settlement marks another resolution for Dominion, which previously secured a nearly $800 million settlement from Fox News over similar false allegations. The agreement adds to a series of legal and financial troubles for Giuliani stemming from his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.</p>

After facing personal and financial struggles in the U.S., including the 2008 financial crisis and a demotion in the military, he found a sense of peace and purpose abroad. His income is sourced from VA disability, the GI Bill, and teaching English, which affords him a comfortable lifestyle. Ryan contrasts the high-pressure, 'survival mode' environment in America with Vietnam's calmer pace, which he says allows him to focus on happiness and personal growth.</p>

In a veiled reference to China, he also emphasized the need for 'de-risking' supply chains for critical minerals.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has directed his administration to declassify all federal records related to the 1937 disappearance of aviator Amelia Earhart. Earhart and her navigator vanished over the Pacific Ocean during an attempt to circumnavigate the globe, a mystery that has captivated the public for nearly 90 years. While the prevailing theory is that her plane ran out of fuel and crashed, other hypotheses, including that she was on a spy mission and captured, have persisted. It remains unclear what classified information, if any, the government possesses regarding her fate.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace defeated Liverpool with a dramatic 97th-minute winner from substitute Eddie Nketiah, ending the league leaders' unbeaten start to the season. Palace delivered a dominant first-half performance but only led 1-0, with Liverpool equalizing late in the game through Federico Chiesa. The victory extends Palace's own unbeaten streak to 18 games in all competitions and moves them to second place in the Premier League table. The result exposed defensive frailties for Liverpool, which had previously relied on late goals to secure victories this season.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 14:10:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has found that chimpanzees in the wild regularly consume fruit containing naturally fermented alcohol, ingesting a daily amount equivalent to about one small bottle of beer for a human. Researchers analyzing fruit varieties in Uganda and the Ivory Coast found an average alcohol content of 0.3% in the ripe pulp. This finding suggests that alcohol consumption may have deep evolutionary roots in primates rather than being a purely human cultural phenomenon. The observation supports the theory that an attraction to ethanol could be linked to our shared ancestry with great apes.</p>
