          <p>China's top market regulator, the SAMR, summoned major e-commerce companies including Alibaba, Meituan, and JD.com to address concerns over an aggressive delivery price war. The meeting aimed to regulate promotional behaviors and encourage rational competition to foster a healthier market for consumers, merchants, and platform operators. The regulator emphasized that these companies must adhere to existing laws regarding e-commerce and unfair competition. In a separate meeting, the SAMR also addressed food safety issues related to products sold during live-streaming e-commerce sessions.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered a strong and encouraging performance, pitching six innings and allowing only one run in a 2-0 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. Although the team was shut out, Glasnow's outing was a significant step forward as he returns from an injury-plagued season. His ability to pitch deep into the game with increased velocity is a positive sign for the Dodgers, who are counting on him to be a dependable force in their starting rotation for the remainder of the season and any potential playoff run.</p>

          <p>Former Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is set to testify before a U.S. House select committee on China, focusing on strategies to counter Beijing's "economic coercion against democracies." During his tenure, relations between Australia and China soured significantly, particularly after his government called for an investigation into the origins of COVID-19, leading to Chinese tariffs on Australian goods. His appearance comes as his successor, Anthony Albanese, has been actively working to repair diplomatic and trade ties with China, highlighting a shift in approach between the two administrations.</p>

          <p>China's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection is using a failed tourism project in Guilin as a prominent example of grass-roots government mismanagement and wasteful spending. The ambitious "Yaohan Longevity City" project, intended as a major health tourism destination, was largely abandoned due to a broken capital chain and poor decisions by local officials. The high-profile failure is now being held up as a public warning to other local governments across China to avoid pursuing unrealistic and poorly planned large-scale initiatives.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Army Scientists Propose More Powerful 'X-Railgun' Design</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 23:00:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists from the People's Liberation Army Engineering University in China have proposed a new design for an electromagnetic weapon, called a super "X-railgun." The innovative concept involves cross-stacking two railguns into a single unit, a configuration they claim could nearly double the firing force of the navy's current railgun technology. This significant increase in power would enable the weapon to launch heavier, more destructive projectiles, potentially overcoming the power limitations that have hindered the practical military application of existing railguns.</p>

The support for space exploration is particularly high among younger Americans who did not live through the original Apollo era. The survey also reaffirmed that the 1969 moon landing is still widely viewed as a worthwhile national achievement that contributes significantly to feelings of pride and drives beneficial technological advancements for society.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced at the White House that an additional 10 hostages held in Gaza are expected to be released "very shortly." The statement comes as his administration continues to mediate a 60-day ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. According to reports, the current ceasefire proposal includes terms for the return of these 10 living hostages, as well as the remains of 18 others, in exchange for Israel releasing an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners from its jails.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed the "GENIUS Act" into law, establishing the first major federal regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. The bipartisan legislation provides clear rules for banks, credit unions, and nonbank financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins backed one-to-one by assets like the U.S. dollar. The administration and crypto industry supporters hailed the act as a landmark achievement that provides consumer protections, strengthens the dollar's role in digital finance, and legitimizes the broader cryptocurrency market.

He stressed that these borderless digital instruments, which act as a primary gateway to the crypto ecosystem, necessitate a new, more robust regulatory approach to manage their unique risks effectively.

          <p>According to a memo from his physician, President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after noting mild swelling in his lower legs. The White House doctor described the condition as "benign and common," especially in individuals over 70, and confirmed it with ultrasound tests and blood work. CVI occurs when leg veins have difficulty sending blood back to the heart. The physician stated that there were no signs of more serious cardiovascular issues, like blood clots, and declared the president to be in "excellent health."</p>
