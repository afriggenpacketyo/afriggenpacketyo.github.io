          <h2>Best Buy Reports Modest Sales Recovery Amid Tariff Uncertainty</h2>

          <p>Best Buy surpassed Wall Street's revenue and earnings expectations for its recent quarter, reporting a 1.6% rise in comparable sales, marking its highest growth in three years. This recovery was partly driven by strong demand for mobile phones, video gaming equipment, including the Nintendo Switch 2 launch, and computing items. Despite this positive trend, CEO Corie Barry maintained the full-year forecast, citing significant uncertainty from potential tariff impacts on both consumers and the business, which could lead to a slowdown in the third quarter. The retailer is actively launching a third-party marketplace and testing new in-store experiences to spur growth, while also planning to enhance slower categories like appliances and home theater through sharpened pricing and adjusted merchandise.

          <p>Martin Rafferty, a musician from County Armagh, Northern Ireland, has successfully broken the Guinness World Record for the longest busk, performing for over 24 hours straight. Despite enduring the challenge with a broken thumb, Rafferty continued beyond the official record, aiming for a total of 30 hours, all while raising money for a local Christmas toy appeal. The demanding feat, held at Armagh's Market Street, required adherence to strict rules, including not repeating songs within four hours and ensuring each song lasted over two and a half minutes. This impressive display of endurance and commitment highlights Rafferty's unwavering persistence and dedication to both his music and a worthy charitable cause.</p>

          <p>Christopher Barbour, an Alabama death row inmate, has been granted a new trial after 31 years following a federal judge's ruling. New DNA testing from 2021 revealed that semen on the victim's body belonged to another incarcerated individual, not Barbour or the man he initially implicated in the 1992 murder of Thelma Bishop Roberts. The judge cited prosecutorial misconduct, as bench notes from the initial forensics report excluding Barbour were not turned over, which could have cast doubt on his confession. Barbour has consistently maintained his innocence, claiming his confession was coerced, and his attorneys argue his innocence is now "patently clear."</p>

Despite missing data center revenue estimates for the second consecutive quarter, the company's guidance for the next quarter, excluding H20 shipments to China, still exceeded analyst expectations.

Mitchell emphasized that the changes were part of the team's planning to give all players game time, aiming for the new combination to build on their strong opening performance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of 3.3% in the second quarter, a stronger pace than the initial 3.0% estimate, according to the Commerce Department's revised figures. This upward revision was primarily driven by increased consumer spending, which rose by 1.6%, and a significant jump in final sales to private domestic purchasers by 1.9%. This data indicates continued resilience in consumer and business activity, even amidst tariff volatility. The unusual impact of tariffs was also reflected in trade numbers, with a sharp decline in imports contributing nearly 5 percentage points to the overall GDP increase. For the first half of the year, the economy has grown about 2.1%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues against unilateral US military action in Mexico to combat drug cartels, advocating instead for continued diplomatic cooperation with the Mexican government and a focus on demand-side solutions for the fentanyl crisis. The author highlights existing bilateral efforts, such as extraditions and drone surveillance, which come at lower diplomatic cost than military intervention. Previous supply-side strategies, even in cases like Plan Colombia, have proven ineffective in the long term, especially against synthetic drugs like fentanyl. The article suggests that encouraging signs of reduced overdose deaths in the US, potentially linked to harm reduction programs, support a policy shift towards domestic solutions.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of current Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates, highlighting their appeal as a safe investment in an inflationary economy where money can lose buying power. While national averages are modest, top high-yield CDs, often from online banks, offer significantly higher returns, with short-term CDs currently yielding more than longer terms due to an inverted yield curve. The article advises potential investors to compare rates from online banks, consider short-term options for higher returns, and explore strategies like CD laddering to maximize earnings over time. CDs are generally insured up to $250,000 by the FDIC or NCUA, offering a secure way to grow savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US corporate profits rebounded by $65.5 billion in the second quarter, following a decline in the previous period, according to the Commerce Department. This positive development occurred alongside an upward revision of the US GDP growth to an annualized rate of 3.3% for the same quarter. However, the article emphasizes that tariffs on imports are significantly raising costs for businesses, potentially limiting future profit gains and hampering economic growth. Major companies like Caterpillar and General Motors have already reported substantial financial hits due to these duties, underscoring the complex interplay between profit recovery, economic expansion, and trade policy challenges.

          <p>This article details today's average mortgage and mortgage refinance interest rates, noting that while rates are higher than a few years ago, favorable options remain available for homebuyers and those looking to refinance. Current national averages for a 30-year mortgage are around 6.62%, with refinance rates slightly higher, making affordability a challenge for some. Strategies for securing better rates include strengthening one's credit profile to achieve mid- to high-700s scores, shopping around extensively for different lenders, and carefully comparing loan terms and associated fees. The article also suggests that potential Federal Reserve rate cuts later in 2025 could offer some relief for borrowers, easing the current elevated interest rate climate. (not investment advice)</p>

This growth highlights the private sector's resilience and improved quality, profitability, and core competitiveness despite "heightened external pressures and increasing internal challenges." The report underscores the vital role of private firms in China's economy, contributing over half of the country's total tax revenue, 60% of its GDP, and 80% of urban jobs.

          <p>This article reviews "The Roses," a Jay Roach-directed remake of the 1989 film "The War of the Roses," starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman as a couple battling through a vicious divorce. The film, penned by Tony McNamara, is praised for its sharp, brutal humor and the strong, dynamic performances by the lead actors, particularly Colman, who shines in her role. It satirizes modern relationship dynamics, focusing on career pressures, childcare clashes, and petty jealousies that ultimately lead to their dissolution. Despite the dark subject matter and the characters' despicable actions, the article suggests the film successfully makes the couple relatable, offering a compelling and hilariously sad exploration of love and hate.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book, "The Origin of Language" by Madeleine Beekman, proposes a novel theory placing the challenges of early human child-rearing at the center of language evolution. Beekman argues that the need to care for vulnerable, large-brained offspring, who emerged from the womb less mature than other species, spurred the development of vocal communication. This perspective shifts focus from male-dominated evolutionary theories to emphasize familial care and cooperation. The article highlights how early humans who could verbally express needs and coordinate care for their children would have gained a significant survival advantage, shaping both language and human social structures.</p>
