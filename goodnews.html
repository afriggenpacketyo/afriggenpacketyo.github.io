          <h2>Navy Reverses Course on DEI Book Ban Following Pentagon Review</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Navy has reversed its decision to remove 381 books from its libraries after a Pentagon review using standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) titles. Almost all of the initially pulled books have been returned to the shelves, with only about 20 titles requiring further review by a Department of Defense panel. The reversal followed a Pentagon memo standardizing search terms for DEI-related content, leading the Navy to reinstate titles like "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" and "How to Be an Antiracist". The Pentagon memo was issued to bring the DOD into compliance with a Trump executive order to eliminate DEI programs.</p>

          <p>The House has passed President Trump's "one big, beautiful bill," encompassing tax cuts, Medicaid restrictions, border security funding, and new social programs. Key provisions include extending the 2017 tax cuts, eliminating taxes on tips and overtime (through 2028), and allowing tax deductions on auto loan interest for US-assembled cars. The bill also imposes work requirements for Medicaid recipients, increases the State and Local Tax Deduction (SALT) cap to $40,000 for incomes up to $500,000, and allocates significant funding for border security and defense. Additionally, it creates $1,000 "Trump accounts" for child savings and raises the upper age requirement for food stamp eligibility.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's upcoming military parade in Washington, D.C., to celebrate the Army's 250th birthday, will include a dog named Doc Holliday, an Australian Cattle Dog. Doc Holliday, part of the Army's 1st Cavalry Division Horse Cavalry Detachment, will ride in a wagon pulled by two mules, and has participated in previous parades. The parade will also showcase troops, tanks, World War II airplanes, and Vietnam War-era helicopters, with an estimated cost of up to $45 million. Trump will also administer the constitutional oath to 250 Army enlistees during the event.</p>

          <p>American Airlines' chief financial officer (CFO) stated that some travelers are opting to avoid Newark Liberty International Airport due to recent disruptions. Travelers are choosing alternative airports such as LaGuardia, JFK, and Philadelphia, although the impact is considered modest. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has ordered airlines to temporarily cut flights at Newark to alleviate congestion, which has been exacerbated by air traffic controller shortages, equipment outages, and runway construction. Bad weather has further contributed to the disruptions.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has reached a new record high near $112,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership and corporate adoption. The cryptocurrency's rise is attributed to growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation and ongoing interest from institutional buyers. Despite a drop in U.S. equities, Bitcoin's price has diverged, potentially due to investors seeking alternative stores of value. The Senate is also advancing crypto legislation to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a former bitcoin skeptic, has announced the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency.

          <p>A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that China's 2019 embargo on fentanyl exports and precursor chemicals led to a temporary spike in the drug's street price in the US, deterring its use and reducing fentanyl-related overdose deaths by up to 25%. The embargo, implemented in May 2019, added all fentanyl-related substances to China's list of controlled substances, restricting their export. The paper estimates that without China's restrictions, as many as 947 more Americans would have died from a fentanyl overdose.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in JAMA Network Open reveals that children's breakfast cereals have become sweeter, fattier, and less nutritious between 2010 and 2023. The study analyzed 1,200 cereals and found that total fat and sodium content increased significantly, while protein and dietary fiber decreased. Researchers emphasize the importance of breakfast for kids' energy and concentration and hope the findings spark conversations about creating healthier options. While some cereals can be part of a nutritious diet, the trend toward lower nutritional quality is concerning.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Some U.S. homeowners may benefit from a sizable tax break under the House-passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which raises the SALT deduction cap to $40,000. The full $40,000 deduction is available to filers with household incomes below $500,000, with a phaseout for higher earners. This change aims to ease the tax burden for middle-class families, especially in high-tax states, but high-income homeowners are most likely to qualify. The higher SALT cap would result in a loss of nearly $334 billion in tax revenue over the next decade.</p>
