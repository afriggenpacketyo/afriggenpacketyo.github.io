          <p>While school phone bans aim to improve student focus, they haven't significantly addressed the youth mental health crisis, suggesting deeper factors are at play. Family disintegration, declining religious affiliation, and a bleak worldview contribute to anxiety and depression among young people. Experts emphasize the importance of purpose, meaning, and independence, encouraging risk-taking and resilience. Shielding children from normal stresses may inadvertently hinder their ability to cope with life's challenges, thus parents and teachers need to curb their instinct to shield children from the normal stresses and disappointments in life.</p>

          <p>The US Supreme Court has rejected an attempt to revive the copyright trial over Ed Sheeran's hit song 'Thinking Out Loud,' ending a decade-long legal battle. Amy Wadge, who co-wrote the song with Sheeran, expressed relief, stating the copyright trials had "haunted" her for the last 10 years. The case involved claims that Sheeran's song copied Marvin Gaye's 'Let's Get It On,' but courts ruled that the chord progression and harmonic rhythms were too commonplace to be legally protected.
