Born in Jamaica, he moved to Sheffield as a child and became a magistrate in Sheffield in 1996, campaigning on issues including equality and inclusion in sport, mental health and tackling deprivation. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by Sheffield Hallam University in November 2023 and installed as the university's chancellor in May.

          <p>The UK government has proposed expanding the ban on bottom trawling, a destructive fishing method, from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of UK offshore protected areas. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the need for urgent action to prevent irreversible destruction of oceans. The proposal is subject to a 12-week industry consultation and comes amid warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the damaging effects of bottom trawling. The extension would cover 41 of the UK's 178 MPAs, protecting marine animals and seabed habitats, while pressure builds for more countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty at the Ocean Conference.</p>
