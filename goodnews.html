        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Facing record-high rice prices due to a poor harvest in 2023, Japanese supermarket operators are increasing sales of foreign-grown rice to provide consumers with more affordable options. Aeon Co. will begin selling California-sourced rice at a significantly lower price than domestic rice, following similar moves by Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co. The company hopes that offering consumers a choice will increase overall rice consumption, as they can no longer purchase rice as before due to higher prices. The U.S. Ambassador to Japan hailed the sale of U.S.-grown rice as "historic" for American farmers and timely for Japanese consumers concerned about food prices. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a new round of talks with U.S. officials, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that the United States is showing growing recognition of Japan's economic significance. Akazawa had "more frank and in-depth discussions" with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in Washington, and expressed his desire for a mutually beneficial agreement next month. The approval of Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel by Trump was seen as a symbolic development, and economic security issues are central to the negotiations. However, Japan's unwavering stance is to eliminate all additional tariffs, a challenging prospect given the Trump administration's firm position.</p>

          <p>Karan Kandhari's "Sister Midnight" is a gritty comedy set in Mumbai, focusing on Uma, a restless housewife, and her struggle with urban malaise. The film captures a liminal state in Uma's life, as she navigates the oppressive city and discovers hidden strength. Radhika Apte's performance as Uma is captivating, portraying a character whose middle-finger energy is offset by a silent-film-star haplessness. Though the film's episodic nature can feel disjointed, its visual curiosity and punk potential create a trippy and blackly funny experience.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has greenlit the construction of a 767-kilometer canal connecting Jiangxi province, a resource-rich inland hub, to Zhejiang, a wealthy coastal province. The Jiangxi-Zhejiang Canal is expected to be the most expensive artificial canal ever built in China, with an estimated investment of $44.4 billion. The canal aims to lower logistical costs and integrate less-developed inland regions with wealthier coastal hubs, enhancing the country's inland waterway network. Once completed, the canal will accommodate 1,000-tonne vessels and handle around 25 million tonnes of cargo annually.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers, aiming for a retail price of 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms. This initiative comes amid rising criticism of the government's failure to curb soaring rice prices, which have doubled compared to the previous year. The government plans to initially release 300,000 tons of rice and explore online sales to ensure broad distribution. While this may provide some relief, analysts remain uncertain whether it will significantly impact overall rice prices due to limited reserves.</p>
