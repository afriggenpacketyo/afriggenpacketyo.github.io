        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the use of artificial intelligence grows, researchers are uncovering more instances of potentially harmful AI responses, including hate speech and copyright infringements. The lack of regulations and insufficient testing of AI models exacerbate these issues. Red teaming, where individuals test AI systems to uncover potential harm, is one way to evaluate risks. Researchers recommend adopting standardized AI flaw reports and incentives to improve the understanding of risks posed by AI tools and users. Marrying user-centered practices with governance and policy would ensure a better understanding of the risks posed by AI tools and users.</p>

After the murders, she was sent to live with relatives and faced isolation and emotional challenges. In 2002, the case was reopened, and Jessi testified at her stepbrother's trial, leading to his conviction.

          <p>Germany has seen a doubling in the number of Turkish citizens becoming German citizens in 2024, making Turkey second only to Syria in this regard. The increase is attributed to the country's attractiveness for life, work, and study. Dual citizenship, facilitated by Germany's June 2024 reforms, is a major incentive, as is the ability to travel visa-free to more countries. Political repression and economic challenges in Turkey are also driving the trend, though many Turks still feel rooted in their culture and consider Turkey home.</p>
