          <p>The winning numbers for the estimated $700 million Powerball jackpot were drawn on Saturday night, revealing 11, 14, 34, 47, 51, and Powerball 18. This drawing marked the 36th consecutive round without a grand prize winner, pushing the jackpot to its highest point this year. Despite no top winner, the drawing produced several significant prizes, including a $2 million prize for a Tennessee player and two $1 million winners. Participants can choose between annual installments over 29 years or a lump-sum cash payment of $316.3 million before taxes. The game continues to engage players across 45 states, offering additional options like Power Play to multiply non-jackpot winnings.</p>

          <p>Taiwan AI Cloud, a subsidiary of Taiwanese laptop maker Asus, is constructing a new supercomputer in Tainan, set to launch its initial phase with 80 petaflops of capacity in December. This project, a collaboration with the National Centre for High-Performance Computing, aims to eventually reach 250 petaflops, significantly boosting Taiwan's total computing capacity by at least 50 percent. The initiative aligns with Taiwan's broader goal of becoming a "top three computing power in Asia," with government plans to expand overall capacity to approximately 1,200 petaflops by 2029. This strategic investment underscores the island's commitment to advancing its technological infrastructure and global standing.</p>

          <p>Authorities in New Orleans have arrested a 26-year-old suspect for gross littering after surveillance footage captured him illegally dumping trash along a highway. This incident highlights a rising issue of illegal dumping, particularly of tires and other waste, near the Michoud Boulevard exit on Interstate 10. The installation of cameras by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries has led to 81 citations for littering, with nearly half in New Orleans. The public has reacted positively to the arrest, expressing satisfaction that action is finally being taken against environmental disregard, which pollutes waterways, engenders wildlife, and lowers community health standards.</p>

          <h2>British Foreign Secretary Receives Warning for Fishing Without License During JD Vance Visit</h2>

          <p>Britain’s Foreign Secretary David Lammy received a written warning from the UK Environment Agency for fishing without a license during a visit with US Vice President JD Vance at his country estate. Lammy had invited Vance and his family, where they held a bilateral meeting and participated in a photo opportunity by a river. Anyone over 13 is required to have a fishing license in freshwater in the UK. Lammy belatedly purchased a license and reported himself, with a spokesperson calling the incident an "administrative error." Vance joked that while his children caught fish, the foreign secretary did not, despite receiving "Kentucky-style" fishing tips.</p>

          <p>Chinese smartphone manufacturer Vivo has unveiled the Vivo Vision, a mixed-reality headset designed to challenge Apple’s Vision Pro with its lighter weight and lower anticipated cost. Weighing 398 grams, significantly less than Apple's 600g+ device, the Vivo Vision aims to address a common concern with high-end VR headsets. The device features dual organic-light-emitting-diode displays delivering 8K resolution and is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2 Platform for enhanced visuals. Currently, the headset is compatible only with certain Vivo phones and Windows 10 computers for screen projections, positioning itself as a strong contender in the evolving VR market.</p>

          <p>A disability charity is urging all UK airports to eliminate drop-off fees for blue badge holders, highlighting inconsistencies and complexities in current policies. While many airports offer discounts or waivers, the system often requires pre-registration or specific conditions, making it difficult for disabled drivers to navigate. Disabled Motoring UK argues that people with disabilities should not be charged at all, stating that some airports prioritize "greed" over dignity. The article details varying policies across the 20 busiest UK airports, from free drop-offs to charges with extended times, or no discounts, underscoring the need for a standardized, accessible approach.</p>

          <p>Families are advocating for pea to be added to the list of 14 legally required food allergens after children experienced severe, life-threatening reactions to pea protein in unexpected products like hot cross buns and ice cream. Nine-year-old Rex suffered anaphylactic shock from pea protein in a bun, an ingredient not commonly anticipated. Parents express frustration at the increasing use of pea protein in foods and the difficulty in identifying it, likening the situation to "playing a game of roulette." Individuals with pea allergies often find their condition isn't taken as seriously as other allergies, leading to dangerous misunderstandings and calls for expanded, clearer labeling for consumer safety.</p>

However, Mater Dei went scoreless in the second half, committing numerous penalties and facing an Aquinas comeback. Despite imperfections, the defense, led by USC commits Tomuhini Topui and Shaun Scott, proved effective against the run.

          <p>The UK Parliament's e-petitions system, celebrating its 10th anniversary, continues to be a popular avenue for public engagement, though its effectiveness in driving policy change is debated. While some petitions, like "Finn's Law" for police service animals, have directly led to legislative changes, many others, even those with millions of signatures, have not. The system allows backbench MPs to debate issues that gain over 100,000 signatures, but often results in ministerial speeches without concrete action. Critics argue the system provides an "illusion of a feedback loop" and is often treated as a joke, yet its chair defends it as a "bridge between the public and Parliament" that extends democracy beyond the ballot box.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Madurai Kamaraj University in India, in collaboration with Face Lab in the UK, have digitally reconstructed the faces of two 2,500-year-old male skulls excavated from Kondagai, an ancient burial site near Keeladi. This effort aims to understand the ancestry of the region's early inhabitants, supporting the claim of an independent urban civilization in southern India dating back to 580 BC, challenging previous narratives focused solely on the north. The reconstructed faces primarily show features of Ancient Ancestral South Indians, with traces of Middle-East Eurasian and Austro-Asiatic ancestries, suggesting global migration and population mixing. This scientific endeavor offers profound insights into India's diverse past and heritage.</p>

          <p>Bayern Munich began the 2025-26 Bundesliga season with a resounding 6-0 victory over RB Leipzig, featuring a Harry Kane hat-trick, signaling their continued dominance. This strong start highlights the ongoing challenge for other German clubs to compete, as the Bundesliga faces criticism for its lack of top-level competition, which has hindered its global sporting and commercial standing. In response, the DFL is implementing a new broadcast strategy, including granting live streaming rights to YouTube content creators for the first time, aiming to attract younger, global fans who consume football non-traditionally. This bold move seeks to bridge the significant financial gap with leagues like the Premier League, though it sparks cultural clashes with traditional match-going fans.</p>
