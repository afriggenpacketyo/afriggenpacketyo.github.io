          <p>With American credit card debt reaching record highs and average interest rates around 22%, many are considering debt consolidation. This article outlines three important factors to consider before proceeding, including exploring alternatives to personal loans like 0% APR balance transfer cards. It also highlights the significant potential for interest savings even in the current rate environment and notes the limitations on the types and amounts of debt that can be consolidated. The piece advises a holistic approach that includes changing spending habits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Song Kum Hyok, a member of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau, for his role in a scheme that uses fraudulent IT workers to generate revenue. These operatives, located in China and Russia, pose as American remote workers to secure jobs at global companies, with their earnings funneled to support North Korea's weapons programs. The scheme involved stealing U.S. citizens' personal information to create fake identities and has reportedly generated hundreds of millions of dollars for the Kim regime.</p>

          <h2>Four Arguments for Pursuing Credit Card Debt Forgiveness This Month</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 14:01:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents a case for exploring credit card debt forgiveness in July, as millions of Americans struggle with high-interest debt. It argues that with Federal Reserve rate cuts unlikely this month and only minimal relief expected later, waiting is not a viable strategy while interest continues to compound. The piece suggests that high-rate debt negatively impacts overall financial health, including credit scores, making proactive solutions like debt forgiveness a potentially worthwhile option for eligible borrowers to regain financial stability.

          <p>World number one Aryna Sabalenka fought back from the brink of defeat to secure a hard-won victory against 37-year-old German veteran Laura Siegemund at Wimbledon. Sabalenka lost the first set and was twice a break down in the decider before rallying to win 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 in a grueling match lasting nearly three hours. Siegemund's unconventional style and slow pace of play visibly frustrated the top seed, but Sabalenka's resilience saw her through. She will now face American Amanda Anisimova for a place in the final.</p>

          <p>During a state visit to the UK, French President Emmanuel Macron affirmed a shared commitment with the UK to stop small boat crossings in the English Channel. Negotiations with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer are expected to focus on a new agreement, potentially including a "one in, one out" migrant returns deal and new powers for French police to intercept boats in shallow waters. Macron stressed that while bilateral cooperation is being stepped up, a lasting solution will require broader action at the European level to address irregular migration humanely and effectively.</p>

          <p>A new budget bill signed by President Trump establishes "Trump accounts," government-seeded investment vehicles for children. For those born between 2025 and 2028, the government will deposit an initial $1,000, with parents and employers able to make additional contributions. While experts see the initial grant as "free money," they note that withdrawals are taxed as regular income, unlike other options. For specific goals like education or retirement, existing vehicles like 529 plans or Roth IRAs may offer more favorable tax advantages and greater flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A monthly survey by the New York Federal Reserve indicates that consumer fears about inflation driven by President Trump's tariffs have subsided. In June, respondents anticipated an inflation rate of 3% over the next year, down from a peak of 3.6% in March and April and matching the level from before the tariff announcements. While the overall inflation outlook has eased, the survey still shows expectations for higher prices in specific categories like medical care, college education, and rent. The data suggests that, for now, consumers are not factoring in widespread price hikes from trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

Players like Diego Luna impressed, potentially earning spots on future rosters. The coach's message was that desire and pride are as crucial as talent, creating a new competitive standard for the team moving forward.</p>

Petty Officer Scott Ruskan, a 26-year-old rescue swimmer on his first mission, is credited with saving at least 165 people by triaging and evacuating children and staff.

The ICC cited restrictions on education, employment, and movement, which specifically target females based on their gender.
