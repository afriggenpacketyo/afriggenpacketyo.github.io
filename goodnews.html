          <p>A small asteroid that created a bright orange glow and a loud bang over the UK is believed to have scattered fragments across the west Highlands of Scotland. The UK Meteor Network tracked the object, which originated from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, as it descended to approximately 12 miles above the ground. While dozens of residents reported the phenomenon, experts note that finding the meteorite pieces will be challenging due to the vast and mountainous terrain. The network has asked hillwalkers to be vigilant for any potential space rocks.</p>

          <p>Following the narrow passage of his major tax-and-spending bill, President Donald Trump held a campaign-style rally in Des Moines, Iowa, to celebrate the legislative victory. He hailed the bill as a perfect birthday present for America ahead of the Fourth of July holiday. During the event, Trump also outlined plans for the nation's 250th anniversary in 2026, which include a traveling state fair and a UFC fight on the White House lawn. In a policy shift, he also indicated a willingness to allow some migrant laborers to remain in the U.S. if their farm employers vouch for them.</p>

          <p>After a strong victory against a former champion, British tennis player Emma Raducanu is set to face world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the third round of Wimbledon. Raducanu, who has climbed back into the top 40 this season, acknowledges the significant challenge posed by Sabalenka's dominant, powerful style of play. She stated that to compete with the top players, she needs to develop more weapons in her game, including a better serve and improved movement. Despite previous losses to top-ranked opponents, Raducanu feels more comfortable and confident playing on her home turf at the All England Club.</p>

          <p>The hearing implant company Cochlear has introduced its new smart hearing system in China, making it one of the first markets globally to receive the technology. The device was launched via Hainan province and Hong Kong. Unlike traditional hearing aids that amplify sound, Cochlear's implant works by bypassing damaged inner ear cells to directly stimulate the auditory nerve. According to the company's chief technology officer, this system is most effective for users with severe to profound hearing loss for whom standard hearing aids are no longer beneficial, providing a significant technological advancement for patients.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials have renewed their commitment to tackling the issues of oversupply and 'disorderly low-price competition' within the country's dominant solar photovoltaic (PV) industry. At a recent meeting, the Industry and Information Technology Minister urged companies to focus on product quality and support the phasing out of outdated production capacity to ensure sustainable development. This directive follows a similar call from President Xi Jinping to address excess industrial capacity. The move aims to stabilize a key global industry where Chinese manufacturers hold a significant advantage but face internal competitive pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is scheduled for a two-day visit to rural South Carolina, a state that holds an early spot in the Democratic presidential primary calendar, fueling speculation about a 2028 presidential bid. His tour will focus on some of the state's most economically and environmentally challenged counties, many of which are Republican strongholds. While Newsom's advisors deny the trip is about a future presidential run, stating his focus is on the 2026 midterms, the visit is seen as an effort to build connections in a politically important region. This follows several other overtures Newsom has made to Southern voters.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has achieved a significant milestone in organ cultivation by growing a beating heart structure with human cells inside a pig embryo. The research, led by the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, reported that the human-cell-derived heart structure continued to beat unaided for 21 days. To achieve this, the team reprogrammed human stem cells to improve their survival within the pig embryo before implantation. This breakthrough in chimera research follows the same team's previous success in cultivating human kidneys in pigs for up to 28 days.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has taken a person into custody after they crossed the heavily fortified border from North Korea. The individual, an unarmed man, crossed the Military Demarcation Line in the central-west section of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and was safely guided out by a military team. The Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed the person is being investigated by relevant authorities to determine their identity and reasons for crossing. This event occurs amidst recently heightened border tensions, although no unusual North Korean military activity was detected at the time of the crossing.</p>

          <p>Ward Sakeik, a 22-year-old stateless Palestinian woman, has been released from ICE detention after being held for over four months. She was detained in February while returning from her honeymoon in the U.S. Virgin Islands, a U.S. territory. Sakeik, who was born in Saudi Arabia and came to the U.S. at age eight, had been complying with ICE check-in requirements for years. During her confinement, the government attempted to deport her twice despite a judge's order barring her removal, highlighting the precarious situation of stateless individuals within the U.S. immigration system.</p>
