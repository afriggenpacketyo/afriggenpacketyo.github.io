          <p>A JetBlue flight arriving at Boston's Logan Airport from Chicago veered off the runway and onto the grass during its landing. The Airbus A220, arriving from O'Hare International Airport, experienced the incident around noon with no reported injuries to passengers or crew. Airport officials temporarily closed runway 33-L to assess the aircraft, with passengers disembarking via stairs and buses to the terminal. The FAA issued a ground stop for departures from Logan, causing delays averaging 30 minutes, while the incident undergoes further investigation. The event underscores the complexities of air travel and the rapid response required by airport personnel to ensure safety. </p>

          <p>Advancing American Freedom, a conservative organization led by former Vice President Mike Pence, is pressing Republican senators to amend key provisions of the "big, beautiful bill" to ensure its passage. The group supports the House's Medicaid reforms, rollbacks of Inflation Reduction Act provisions, Planned Parenthood funding cuts, and ending taxpayer-funded gender-affirming surgeries. They advocate for further corporate tax rate reductions, elimination of state and local tax deductions, ending Green New Deal subsidies, and removing a proposed debt limit increase. The organization aims to prevent the lapse of Trump's tax cuts, arguing failure would result in a significant tax increase for American households. </p>
