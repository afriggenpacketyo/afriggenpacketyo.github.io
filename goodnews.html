          <p>The Kennedy Center is broadening its family-friendly programming by incorporating more faith-based content, beginning with a free screening of Angel Studios' animated movie "The King of Kings," which tells the story of Jesus' life through a child's perspective.

          <p>Tesla has appointed Jack Hartung, a former Chipotle executive, to its board of directors, effective June 1, as the company faces declining EV sales, shrinking profits, and concerns over CEO Elon Musk's focus on other ventures like the Department of Government Efficiency. Hartung, known for his disciplined financial approach at Chipotle, will join Tesla's audit committee, expanding the board to nine members. Musk has indicated that his time spent running DOGE will decrease by the end of May, and this appointment comes as Tesla prepares to launch its "retro-futuristic" diner in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve plans to reduce its staff by 10% over the next few years, according to a memo from Chairman Jerome Powell, which is aimed at consolidating functions and modernizing practices. The reduction will include offering a voluntary deferred resignation program to eligible employees, with the goal of bringing the total number of employees below 22,000. This initiative follows calls for cost cuts across civil service agencies, including pressure from the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency. The memo did not explicitly mention Musk or DOGE as a direct factor in the decision.</p>

          <p>Epic Games announced that "Fortnite" will be unavailable on Apple devices because Apple blocked its recent app update, escalating the ongoing legal dispute between the two companies. This conflict arises after a judge ruled against Apple's commission practices for third-party apps, prompting Epic Games to plan a return to the App Store. However, Apple reportedly blocked Epic's submission, leading to the game's removal. Apple said it requested that Epic resubmit the app update without including the U.S. storefront to avoid impacting Fortnite in other regions.</p>

          <p>Home electricity bills are projected to reach an average of $784 this summer, marking a 12-year high due to rising temperatures and increasing electricity prices.

Low-income families, who spend a larger portion of their income on energy, may struggle to afford cooling, potentially leading to health risks, and some states lack sufficient assistance programs to address the issue.</p>
