          <p>In a strategic move within the New York City mayoral race, Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani has challenged President Trump to a debate. This comes after independent candidate Andrew Cuomo called for debates with Mamdani, amid reports that the White House is trying to consolidate the race into a two-person contest. Both incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa have stated they will not drop out of the race. The situation highlights the complex political maneuvering occurring ahead of the election.</p>

Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a significant jump, with other regional indices also posting gains. This development reflects positive sentiment regarding international trade relations and economic stability.

          <p>Tattoos have entered the mainstream, with a third of American adults now having at least one, reflecting a cultural shift towards individuality and self-expression. While many artists and enthusiasts view tattooing as a legitimate art form, studies show that some social stigma persists, potentially affecting job prospects and perceptions of trustworthiness. The practice is particularly popular among millennials, with over 40% having a tattoo. Art institutions are also beginning to recognize its artistic merit, as seen in a recent exhibit.</p>

          <p>The DeKalb County School District in Georgia is observing significant improvements after implementing a 'Disconnect to Reconnect' program that bans student cellphone use during the school day. Teachers at Lakeside High School report that the policy has created a better learning environment with fewer distractions, leading to more engaged students. Since the program's introduction, the school has seen a notable decrease in disciplinary issues. This local initiative is part of a broader national trend to regulate phone use in schools.</p>

          <p>A spokesperson for former President Joe Biden has confirmed that he recently underwent Mohs surgery to address a skin cancer issue. This procedure involves removing thin layers of skin until no cancerous tissue remains and is often used for common types of skin cancer like basal cell carcinoma. In 2023, Biden had a cancerous lesion removed from his chest, which was also identified as basal cell carcinoma. The confirmation came after Biden was seen with a wound on his head, prompting media inquiries.</p>

          <p>Notes discovered in David Bowie's locked New York study have revealed he was working on a final, secret project before his death: an 18th-century musical titled 'The Spectator.' The material, now part of the V&A Museum's collection, shows Bowie's deep interest in the art, satire, and criminal underworld of 18th-century London. The project was unknown even to his closest collaborators and would have fulfilled a lifelong ambition to write for the theatre. These archives offer a new glimpse into the iconic artist's creative process.</p>

          <p>Bryan Hooper Sr. has been released from a Minnesota prison after serving nearly 27 years for a murder he did not commit.

This proposal follows a similar law recently passed for unincorporated areas of L.A. County and comes in response to the increasing frequency of heat waves due to climate change. Proponents argue it is a critical public health issue, as extreme indoor heat is linked to increased hospitalizations and deaths, particularly among vulnerable populations.</p>
