          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 09:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A real estate agent with over a decade of experience details numerous negotiation tactics for homebuyers beyond simply lowering the purchase price. The article suggests negotiating for seller concessions to cover closing costs, rate buydowns to lower mortgage interest, and the inclusion of personal property like furniture. Other negotiable items include specific repairs, rent-back agreements for sellers, and professional cleaning services, which can collectively save buyers thousands of dollars. The expert emphasizes that as the housing market shifts, buyers have more leverage to get creative with purchase terms.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade deal, narrowly avoiding the imposition of steep U.S. tariffs that were set to begin on August 1. The agreement establishes a general tariff rate of 15% on most EU goods, a reduction from the threatened 30%. As part of the deal, the EU has agreed to invest an additional $600 billion in the U.S. and purchase $750 billion in American energy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and former President Trump both hailed the agreement, which aims to bring stability to the $2 trillion annual trade relationship.</p>

          <p>Investor Mark Cuban shares the story of his first business venture at age 24, a failed attempt to sell powdered milk that lasted only a month. With less than $20 invested, he learned a valuable lesson about market demand when he realized no one wanted his cost-effective but unappealing product. Cuban emphasizes that failure is part of the entrepreneurial journey, stating, "You only have to be right one time." He advises aspiring entrepreneurs with no capital to focus on service-based businesses that leverage their skills, citing AI consulting as a prime example in today's market.</p>

          <p>This article reports that as of July 25, 2025, average mortgage rates are 6.79% for a 30-year loan and 6.01% for a 15-year loan, contributing to a difficult market for homebuyers. While rates are high, the article suggests that borrowers with strong credit profiles can still secure favorable terms by shopping around and comparing lenders. Experts note that a potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could bring some relief and stability to mortgage rates in the near future.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Harvard associate professor Alison Wood Brooks, active listening is a powerful but underutilized tool for gaining influence and likeability at work. The strategy involves more than just hearing someone; it requires demonstrating engagement by asking thoughtful follow-up questions or paraphrasing what was said. This simple technique showcases competence, builds trust, and demonstrates empathy, which can be crucial for career success. Research co-authored by Brooks found that simply asking more questions makes a person more likeable, a trait often correlated with positive performance reviews.</p>

          <p>After years of crises, aerospace giant Boeing is reportedly stabilizing under CEO Kelly Ortberg, who took over a year ago. The company's stock is up over 30% this year, airplane deliveries have increased, and analysts expect a return to profitability in 2026. Ortberg has been credited with changing the company culture and improving relationships with airline customers who were previously frustrated with delays and quality issues. Despite progress, Boeing still faces challenges, including an FAA production cap on its 737 MAX jets and ongoing quality control scrutiny.</p>

Z.ai stated the model is smaller and can run on just eight of Nvidia's customized H20 chips designed for the Chinese market.

          <p>This article explores the psychology behind being "too sensitive," explaining that it can stem from both innate temperament and past experiences like trauma or rejection. People with heightened emotional sensitivity perceive the world more intensely and may be more reactive to perceived slights, which often signal a threat to their "relational value." Experts suggest that this trait isn't inherently bad but can disrupt relationships if not managed. Coping strategies include recognizing the tendency to assume the worst and learning to communicate hurt feelings constructively.</p>
