          <p>Former President Donald Trump publicly urged NFL team owners to draft Shedeur Sanders, son of Deion Sanders, after Sanders experienced an unexpected drop in the NFL Draft. Trump cited Deion Sanders' support for him and Shedeur's "phenomenal genes" as reasons for his endorsement. Shedeur's brother, Shilo Sanders, expressed his amazement at Trump's involvement, while Deion Sanders thanked the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for signing Shilo as an undrafted free agent. Sheduer Sanders will be joining a crowded quarterback room in Cleveland. Optimism score is 70.</p>
