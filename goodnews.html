          <p>Boeing and GE Aerospace have reached a $96 billion agreement with Qatar Airways to sell up to 210 aircraft, marking Boeing's largest-ever widebody order and 787 order, according to the White House. The deal, involving 787 Dreamliner and 777X aircraft powered by GE engines, was formalized during President Trump's state visit with the emir of Qatar. The White House estimates the agreement will support 154,000 U.S. jobs annually and over 1 million domestic jobs during production and delivery. This agreement could provide a significant boost for Boeing, which has faced financial challenges in recent years. </p>

          <p>A recent executive order by President Trump aims to lower prescription drug costs in the U.S. by tying them to prices in other countries. The U.S. consistently pays more for prescription drugs compared to other high-income countries, largely due to its complex reimbursement system and lack of national pricing control. While branded drugs are more expensive in the U.S., unbranded generic drugs are often cheaper.

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has expressed that Canadians were not "impressed" by the UK government's invitation to US President Donald Trump for a second state visit. Carney stated that the invitation did not help Canadians, who were facing repeated comments from Trump about making Canada the 51st US state. He emphasized that Canada is "not for sale, ever" and affirmed the importance of Canada's sovereignty. Carney's criticism comes as Canada prepares to welcome King Charles III and Queen Camilla for a royal visit.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement that he would lift U.S. sanctions on Syria has sparked hope for economic recovery in the war-torn country. Lifting sanctions is seen as crucial for rebuilding Syria's economy, which has been devastated by a decade of civil war. The move could facilitate financial aid from wealthy Gulf states and encourage foreign investment. Syrians expressed optimism that the changes would improve their lives, but analysts cautioned that the economic impacts may take time to materialize.</p>
