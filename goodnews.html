          <p>Sunday newspapers in the UK are dominated by coverage of the government's new immigration plans, with the Daily Mail reporting a crackdown on criminal migrants and the Sunday Express focusing on alleged abuse of human rights laws by migrants' lawyers. The Observer features a front-page photograph of Donald Trump's family and an investigation into Trump Inc. Danny Dyer's revelations about his time on EastEnders and speculation about the cast of Strictly Come Dancing also make headlines. Additionally, a retired policeman's arrest for a social media post and a story about the Duchess of Sussex's father living in the Philippines are highlighted.</p>

          <p>Ree Drummond, star of "Pioneer Woman", has recommitted to her health journey after gaining weight due to a year-long break from her previous regimen. Drummond shared that she stopped exercising and paying attention to her diet at the end of 2023, leading to weight gain. She has now returned to a plan similar to the one she successfully used in 2021, focusing on building muscle through exercises like lunges and squats, and increasing her protein intake. Drummond also mentioned that she is no longer weighing her food or counting calories, relying on the awareness she gained from her previous efforts.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece for the New York Times, Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues that mothers should embrace their flaws rather than strive for perfection. She contends that being a flawed mother is essential for children to learn to accept their own imperfections and understand the give-and-take nature of relationships. Ross criticizes the historical tendency of psychiatry to blame mothers for their children's problems and encourages mothers to stop wondering if they are good enough, asserting that they already are.</p>

          <p>South Korea's ruling People Power Party (PPP) has voted to reinstate Kim Moon-soo as its presidential candidate after an attempt to replace him with former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo failed. The party leadership had sought to replace Kim, believing Han had a better chance of winning the upcoming elections. Kim, a former labor activist, denounced the attempt as a political coup and thanked his supporters for their support. The PPP has been in turmoil since the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol, and the opposition Democratic Party's candidate, Lee Jae-myung, is currently leading in the polls.</p>

          <p>The Tokyo government has begun redeveloping a two-kilometer expressway in the Ginza district into an elevated greenway for pedestrians, set to be completed by the 2040s. The project, known as the Tokyo Sky Corridor, will replace the existing Tokyo Expressway (KK Line) and is modeled after New York City's High Line. The walkway will feature trees, flowers, benches, and public restrooms, with potential for rest areas, events, cafes, and food trucks. The project faces challenges such as heat mitigation and structural considerations, with an estimated cost of 14 billion yen ($97 million).</p>

          <p>Arizona Senator Ruben Gallego urged the Democratic party to return to its roots as a "big tent" party. He stated that the party has become too pure, kicking people out of the tent and losing elections as a result. Gallego used podcast host Joe Rogan as an example of someone who was "canceled" by the party. Gallego, representing a state with more registered Republicans than Democrats, emphasized the need for alliances with people who may not agree with the party 100% of the time.</p>

          <p>As global uncertainties increase, China is looking to diversify its food import sources, with Southeast Asian countries becoming more viable suppliers. Yunnan, a southwestern Chinese province bordering Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam, plays a crucial role in this strategy through agricultural cooperation. This involves sharing agricultural technology and promoting sustainable economic alternatives. With China's growing demand for agricultural products and limited farmland, overseas cooperation could effectively support the country's food security.</p>
