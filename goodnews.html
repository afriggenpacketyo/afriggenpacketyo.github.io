          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported a productive phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump, focusing on sanctions against Russia, ongoing military strikes, and a significant drone production agreement. Zelenskyy noted that Trump is fully informed about Russia's attacks and has set a deadline for Moscow to make peace or face more severe sanctions. The conversation also highlighted a pending U.S.-Ukraine deal to bolster Kyiv's domestic defense industry through foreign investment in drone manufacturing. Trump separately suggested that falling global energy prices could pressure Russia's economy and compel President Putin to end the conflict, a strategy that includes pressuring nations like India to reduce their purchases of Russian oil.</p>

          <p>This week, NASA is celebrating the 13th anniversary of its Curiosity rover's successful landing on Mars. Since its arrival, the rover has demonstrated remarkable longevity and scientific productivity, traversing over 22 miles of the Martian landscape. Over the course of more than 4,600 Martian days, Curiosity has conducted extensive research, making numerous discoveries about the planet's geology, atmosphere, and potential for past life. The mission continues to provide invaluable data and breathtaking images, significantly advancing our understanding of the Red Planet. Its ongoing journey across the cold, dry surface stands as a testament to the success of interplanetary exploration.</p>

          <h2>An Examination of Reverse Mortgages and the Possibility of Outliving Their Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 13:05:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Americans live longer, many retirees are considering reverse mortgages as a way to convert home equity into cash flow without monthly loan payments. This article explores the mechanics of these financial products, addressing the common concern of whether a homeowner can outlive their reverse mortgage. While the loan does not expire as long as the owner resides in the home and meets obligations like paying taxes, it is possible to exhaust the home's equity over time. The loan balance, which includes accrued interest, can eventually exceed the property's value, leaving little for heirs. The structure of the payout, such as a line of credit versus a lump sum, significantly impacts how long the funds last. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI has announced the release of two new open-weight language models, gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, marking its first such release since 2019. These models are designed to be more affordable and accessible for developers, researchers, and companies to run and customize, competing with similar offerings from Meta, Mistral AI, and DeepSeek. While not fully open-source, their publicly available parameters offer greater transparency and control. OpenAI emphasized that the models underwent extensive safety testing to prevent malicious use and will be available on platforms like Hugging Face and through cloud providers. The release aims to broaden access to powerful AI technology, potentially spurring further innovation across the industry.</p>

          <p>NASA's acting administrator has directed the agency to accelerate its plans to deploy a small nuclear reactor on the moon, aiming for a launch by late 2029. The directive positions the U.S. in a strategic race against China and Russia, who have announced a joint plan to establish a lunar reactor by the mid-2030s. The U.S. fears that the first nation to deploy such a power source could establish a prohibitive presence, hindering future American lunar missions like the Artemis program. The proposed reactor would utilize microreactor technology to generate at least 100 kilowatts of electricity, enough to power a small lunar base and support long-term exploration efforts.</p>

          <p>Pfizer raised its full-year adjusted profit guidance for 2025, citing effective cost-cutting measures and strong business performance. The pharmaceutical giant's stock rose over 4% after it also reported second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by robust revenue from its COVID-19 products and other key drugs. The company now projects a full-year adjusted profit between $2.90 and $3.10 per share, up from its previous forecast. This optimistic outlook comes as Pfizer navigates discussions with the Trump administration regarding drug pricing and potential tariffs, with the company expressing confidence in its ability to deliver strong results for shareholders.

          <p>Roku is shifting its strategy by launching 'Howdy,' a new ad-free streaming service priced at $2.99 per month. This marks a departure for the company, which has primarily been known for its free, ad-supported Roku Channel. The new service will feature 10,000 hours of content from major studios like Lionsgate and Warner Bros. Discovery, in addition to Roku's own original programming. Roku's CEO stated that Howdy is designed to complement premium services rather than compete with them directly. The move comes as ad-supported streaming services have seen significant growth, and it allows Roku to tap into the subscription-based market while maintaining its popular free offering.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>High-rated U.S. corporations are increasingly financing their mergers and acquisitions with equity and cash rather than taking on new debt. This shift in strategy is attributed to high borrowing costs and concerns about potential credit rating downgrades associated with increased leverage. With stock valuations high and corporate cash flows healthy, using equity has become a more attractive option. This trend is evident in major deals like Union Pacific's planned acquisition of Norfolk Southern, which is expected to be funded mostly with stock. This reliance on equity over debt could lead to lower-than-expected issuance volumes in the investment-grade bond market for the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The deal, which includes approximately $23 million in guarantees, ensures Williams will remain a key part of the team's offense for the foreseeable future. A fifth-round draft pick in 2022, Williams has been a standout performer, rushing for over 1,100 yards in each of the last two seasons. The extension marks the first for a Rams running back since the team signed Todd Gurley to a record deal in 2018. Negotiations had been ongoing since the end of last season, with both sides expressing confidence that an agreement would be reached.</p>

The company found that many used EV batteries still have significant usable capacity, making them ideal for large-scale energy storage. For its first project, Redwood has partnered with AI infrastructure firm Crusoe to build a microgrid that uses repurposed batteries to provide 24/7 renewable power from a solar array. This innovative solution addresses the skyrocketing energy demand of the AI boom while creating a sustainable, closed-loop system for battery recycling and reuse, offering a cost-effective alternative to new energy storage systems.</p>

          <p>Following a significant downward revision to recent U.S. jobs numbers, which prompted political controversy, experts are clarifying that such adjustments are a normal part of the data collection process. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) initially releases preliminary estimates based on incomplete survey responses to provide timely information. These figures are then revised in subsequent months as more complete payroll data becomes available from businesses. Former BLS officials emphasize that these revisions are a standard feature, not a flaw, designed to improve accuracy over time. The recent large revision was attributed to late reporting from state and local governments, reflecting the expiration of pandemic-era subsidies. (not investment advice)</p>
