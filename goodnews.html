          <p>The government is proposing new rules that could allow local councils to take unfinished housing sites from developers who fail to build homes within agreed timeframes. Housebuilders will be required to commit to delivery time frames before receiving planning permission and submit annual progress reports. Developers who repeatedly fail to meet targets could be denied future permissions or face penalties. The government aims to build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029, addressing the housing crisis and helping people get on the housing ladder.</p>

          <p>Jafar Panahi, the Iranian director who won the Palme d'Or at Cannes for "It Was Just an Accident," spoke out against the restrictions of the Iranian regime. Panahi urged Iranians to set aside differences and focus on the freedom of their country, emphasizing that no one should dictate their choices. The film, shot in secret, draws inspiration from Panahi's own experiences in prison and offers a condemnation of abusive power. This marked Panahi's first appearance at an international festival in 15 years after a long travel ban.</p>
