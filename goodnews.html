          <p>This article argues against viewing artificial intelligence (AI) development solely as a competition between the United States and China. It suggests that such a narrow narrative neglects the roles and interests of other countries, organizations, and corporations. The piece emphasizes that unbridled AI development carries immense risks and that a more collaborative, global approach is necessary to ensure AI benefits humanity as a whole. The author warns that focusing solely on winning the AI race could lead to negative consequences for everyone.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that it reached a trade deal with China after two days of negotiations in Switzerland, but no details were released. China has yet to comment on Sunday's talks. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated that the deal would help resolve the national emergency, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said "substantial progress" had been made. On Thursday, President Donald Trump announced a trade deal with the United Kingdom -- the first in what the White House said it hopes will be a flurry of agreements while the reciprocal tariff pause is in effect.</p>

Though the two governments have taken an outwardly tough position, officials in both countries have indicated they would like to find a path to bring the tariffs down. The tariffs are so punitive they are already disrupting the world‚Äôs supply chains.</p>
