          <p>Kweichow Moutai, China's premier liquor distiller, is adapting to Beijing's renewed emphasis on austerity by distancing itself from its association with extravagant lifestyles.

Chairman Zhang Deqin emphasized that the liquor should promote culture, health, and harmony, citing classic Chinese texts.

          <p>The Senate is considering changes to the House-approved "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," with potential revisions to SNAP, SALT, border funding, Medicaid, and energy tax credits. Senators aim to rein in government costs and put federal programs on a more sustainable fiscal path, with the goal of achieving the biggest spending reduction in history. Key areas of focus include modifying SNAP work requirements, lowering the SALT deduction cap, reducing border security funding, and reforming Medicaid. The Senate's changes could face challenges in the House, where centrists have threatened to withhold support if certain provisions are altered.</p>
