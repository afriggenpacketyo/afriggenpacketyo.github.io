          <p>Cognac producers in France are facing pressure from climate change, tariffs, and the loss of the Russian market, forcing them to adapt their approach. The largest markets for cognac, the United States and China, have imposed or threatened tariffs on European spirits, impacting exports. Climate change is also affecting winemakers as grapes ripen earlier and become sweeter, increasing the risk of harvest failure. Despite these challenges, family-run businesses are carrying on the tradition, tapping into new markets and exploring innovative production methods to ensure the future of cognac.</p>

          <p>Conservationists in Wales are using edible glitter to track endangered water voles, whose numbers have declined by 90% in the past 30 years. The glitter, mixed with apple, is intended to be consumed by the voles and then tracked in their droppings, allowing conservationists to monitor their movements and habitats. This innovative approach aims to provide crucial data for environmental adjustments and interventions to help the species disperse and survive. The team is testing the glitter on captive-bred water voles before wider implementation.</p>
