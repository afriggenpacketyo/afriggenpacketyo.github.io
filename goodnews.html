          <p>General Motors has issued a recall for 597,630 full-size trucks and SUVs in the U.S. due to a potential manufacturing defect in the V8 engines, specifically within the connecting rod or crankshaft components, which could lead to sudden engine failure and increase the risk of a crash. The recall affects models from 2021 to 2024, including Cadillac Escalade, Chevrolet Silverado 1500, and GMC Sierra 1500. Dealers will inspect the engines and provide necessary repairs or replacements free of charge, with owner notification letters scheduled to be mailed out on June 9, 2025, and the recall is in response to an investigation by U.S. auto safety regulators following numerous complaints of engine failure in GM vehicles.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials commenced trade talks in Geneva, marking the first face-to-face engagement since President Trump imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods. The U.S. delegation, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, met with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng at a Swiss villa, hoping to resolve a trade war that has disrupted financial markets and global commerce. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter expressed optimism that the talks could lead to a positive outcome for the world economy, but Dmitry Grozoubinski, a former diplomat, anticipates a lengthy negotiation process.

The artwork captures the moment when then-candidate Trump was pulled off stage by Secret Service agents after shots were fired near him. The sculpture, a maquette of a larger statue planned by artist Stan Watts, symbolizes Trump's resilience and bravery during the 2024 presidential election. The image of Trump shouting "Fight! Fight!

          <p>An excerpt from Barry Diller's memoir, "Who Knew," shares his perspective on the importance of instinct over data in creative and business decisions. Diller recounts his time at ABC, where he championed the "Movie of the Week," and emphasizes the limitations of relying solely on research or structured information. He highlights the success of projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker," which were greenlit based on gut feeling rather than extensive analysis. Diller argues that too much information can complicate and obscure the essence of a good idea, advocating for the value of common sense and human instinct.</p>
