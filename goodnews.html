          <p>New York City officials announced the lowest number of shootings and murders in recorded history for the first five months of the year. From January 1 through May 31, there were 264 shootings and 112 homicides, surpassing previous lows. Mayor Eric Adams attributed these achievements to precision policing, strategic resource deployment, and the dedication of the NYPD. The city has also removed approximately 22,000 illegal guns from the streets, including ghost guns, reflecting a focus on upstream solutions and investments in young people.</p>

          <p>WorldPride is being held in Washington, D.C. this year, leading to mixed emotions within the LGBTQ+ community due to concerns about the Trump administration's policies. Some community members fear for their safety and comfort, citing attacks on LGBTQ+ rights, especially those of trans people. Others plan to attend as a form of protest against the administration, with layered identities adding complexity to the decision. While the Trump administration has rolled back LGBTQ+ protections, D.C. itself remains largely Democratic, and organizers have implemented extensive safety protocols for the event.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to modernize its airspace with the creation of the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS), aiming for quicker flights and fewer delays. The redesign, the largest since the 1950s, seeks to allow planes to climb and descend more smoothly, reducing climate change impacts and paving the way for new technologies like flying taxis. Aviation Minister Mike Kane stated that modernizing airspace is a simple way to reduce pollution from flying. The changes are expected to be fully operational by the end of the year, but some groups warn of potential new flight paths over previously unaffected areas.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is set to increase its defense spending, building new nuclear-powered attack submarines and creating an army ready for European warfare. Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized the need to address the threat posed by Russia, marking the most significant changes to Britain's defenses since the end of the Cold War. The government plans to meet its defense spending target of 2.5% of national income by 2027 and aims for 3% before 2034. These changes also serve as a message to Washington, signaling that Europe is increasing its investment in defense.</p>

          <p>South Korea's opposition party leader, Lee Jae Myung, is projected to win the country's snap presidential election, according to a Gallup poll cited by Yonhap. An electoral win for the Democratic Party candidate would set him up to be the country's next leader after ousted president Yoon Suk Yeol, and determine the trajectory of South Korea's trade negotiations with the U.S., and policies on China and North Korea. While Lee has shifted his stance to the political center, he is likely to pursue a more left-leaning agenda in office, contending with reviving South Korea's economy and completing a "package" agreement with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>
