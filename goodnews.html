          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a boost following Elon Musk's announcement of a tentative robotaxi launch date in Austin, Texas, slated for June 22, with the first driverless ride scheduled for Musk's birthday. This news provided a spark of hope for Tesla's autonomous vehicle strategy, which is viewed as crucial for the company's future growth. Additionally, signs of a cooldown in the public spat between Musk and President Donald Trump contributed to the positive market sentiment, with Musk expressing regret over some of his recent social media posts about Trump, helping ease investor concerns about potential political repercussions for Tesla. The stock initially showed positive momentum before turning negative in the afternoon, though it remained up over 10% for the week.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves unveiled the government's Spending Review, outlining departmental budgets for the next three years, with the NHS receiving a 3% annual funding increase and additional funds allocated to defense and housing. Education will also see a significant boost, particularly for school repairs and training, while other departments like the Home Office and Foreign Office face budget cuts, as the NHS increase covers day-to-day spending but capital spending will remain static, raising concerns about the capacity to increase operations and procedures. The review includes substantial investments in social housing and infrastructure projects, though the benefits of these plans may not materialize until the 2030s, as business groups have expressed support for the ambitious plans, hoping it will encourage firms to invest and boost business. </p>

          <p>Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and social media platform X, publicly stated that he regrets some of his recent criticisms of President Trump, admitting that they "went too far," following a public falling-out between the two. The disagreement was sparked by Musk's criticism of Trump's spending bill, leading to a series of insults and accusations exchanged on social media, as the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Mr. Trump was "appreciative" of the public apology from Musk, while Trump had previously threatened Musk with "serious consequences" if he funded Democrats.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang addressed equity analysts at the GTC Paris event, discussing the company's AI chip business model and supply chain progress, emphasizing that increased AI use on devices will drive more demand in data centers for model training and verification. Huang noted that Nvidia is diversifying its revenue streams with "sovereign AI" projects, with Europe as a key focus, and that the company is not limited by CoWoS or HBM supply, but rather by forecasting needs, as Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank expressed cautious optimism about the U.S. consumer, citing steady spending data despite macroeconomic uncertainty and improved delinquency trends for Capital One. Fairbank's positive outlook contrasts with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's warning about a potential economic downturn, as the consumer continues to spend, that's more sales for companies and it's supportive for the U.S. economy overall.</p>

          <p>Social Security beneficiaries may see a 2.5% increase in their benefits in 2026, according to new estimates from The Senior Citizens League and policy analyst Mary Johnson, based on government inflation data, which is up from a previous forecast of 2.4%. The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) is an annual change to benefits aimed at keeping pace with inflation, and the official change is typically announced in October, as the COLA may move higher if President Donald Trump's tariff policies prompt inflation and consumer prices to increase, according to Johnson. The consumer price index rose less than expected in May, with an annual inflation rate of 2.4%, showing limited impact from Trump's tariff policies (not investment advice).</p>

Sloane Stephens, a former US Open champion, emphasized that the rule will reduce the pressure on players to return to the court too quickly, as she has used the off-season to freeze her eggs twice previously, and now players don't feel forced to come back early and risk their health again.</p>
