        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Investing experts suggest gold prices could soon reach $4,000 per ounce, driven by factors like inflation, geopolitical tensions, and central bank buying. Ben Nadelstein from Monetary Metals believes gold could hit this milestone in 2025 if it follows last year's percentage gains, while Brandon Aversano of The Alloy Market expects it within a year due to instability and conflict. Thomas Winmill at Midas Funds takes a more measured approach, suggesting it could take one to two years without major geopolitical events. The experts recommend maintaining a long-term outlook, considering leasing out gold, and investing in gold mining mutual funds as strategies for investing in the gold market.

          <p>Savings experts recommend opening certificate of deposit (CD) accounts sooner rather than later, as rates are expected to decline with potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Shopping around and comparing offers from different banks and credit unions is crucial, especially as CD rates drop. Shorter-term CDs currently offer higher rates, while longer-term CDs provide protection against future rate decreases; consider a CD ladder for a mix of both. Experts also emphasize understanding the risks, such as early withdrawal penalties, and maintaining an emergency fund. (not investment advice)</p>

She emphasized the importance of openness to scrutiny and change for those providing evidence. The government plans to follow all 12 of the report's recommendations, including ensuring adults who engage in penetrative sex with a child under 16 face the most serious charge of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>Aryna Sabalenka has apologized to Coco Gauff for her "unprofessional" comments following her loss in the French Open final. Sabalenka admitted that her remarks, where she suggested the result was due to her own errors rather than Gauff's performance, were a mistake. She wrote to Gauff to apologize and acknowledge that Gauff deserved to win the tournament, expressing her respect for the American player. Sabalenka, who lost to Gauff in both the US Open and French Open finals, said she learned a valuable lesson about treating opponents with respect.</p>

          <p>For the first time, streaming services have surpassed traditional television in overall U.S. TV viewership, according to a Nielsen report. In May, streaming services like YouTube, Netflix, and Paramount+ attracted 44.8% of all television usage, while cable and broadcast networks combined for 44.2%. YouTube was the top service with 12.5% of viewership, followed by Netflix with 7.5%. The disruption has accelerated since the COVID-19 pandemic, with free services like YouTube and ad-supported services contributing to streaming's overall success. The shift to streaming is also influenced by the NFL's embrace of streaming platforms.</p>
