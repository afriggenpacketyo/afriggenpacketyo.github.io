          <p>French President Macron's office has downplayed an incident in Hanoi where his wife, Brigitte Macron, appeared to push his face upon arrival. Video footage showed Brigitte placing her hands on Macron's face and giving it a shove as he emerged from the presidential plane. Macron's office initially denied the authenticity of the images before confirming them as genuine, and Macron later told reporters that they were just joking around. A close associate described the incident as a harmless "squabble," while another source blamed pro-Russian accounts for negative comments about the incident. </p>

          <p>Coach Deion Sanders sent a message to Colorado Buffaloes players and staff, urging them to stay safe and use good judgment during the Memorial Day holiday. Sanders' message came after he posted cryptic messages on X, calling out "false stories." He has been under scrutiny since his son, Shedeur Sanders, was drafted in the fifth round of the NFL Draft. Shedeur Sanders attributed online criticism to a negative perception of his father, while the younger generation seemed less critical in person.</p>

          <p>The Japan Sumo Association's Yokozuna Deliberation Council has unanimously recommended Onosato's promotion to yokozuna, the highest rank in sumo, after he secured his second straight championship. The move will be ratified at a JSA meeting, making the 24-year-old the second active yokozuna alongside Hoshoryu. Onosato clinched the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament title with a 14-1 record, dedicating his championship to people in his home prefecture affected by the 2024 earthquake. His promotion will be the fastest under the six-tournament calendar, and he will debut as a yokozuna in July at the Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's delay of imposing 50% tariffs on the European Union, analysts warn that the potential for a trade war remains, sparking volatility concerns. Trump agreed to push the rollout back to July 9 after a call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. European stocks rebounded following the announcement, but market watchers caution that a lot remains at stake. Experts suggest that the EU is unlikely to capitulate to Trump's negotiating tactics and that the uncertainty is bad for business and consumers. </p>

          <p>Liverpool secured their 20th title, dominating the Premier League under head coach Arne Slot, with Mohamed Salah as the inspiration and Florian Wirtz potentially joining the team. Arsenal finished second but had a disappointing season despite reaching the Champions League semi-final, lacking a proven goalscorer. Manchester City had a disappointing season by their standards, failing to win the Premier League and losing in the Champions League play-off stage. Chelsea, under Enzo Maresca, secured a Champions League spot and a Europa Conference League final, though their performance was inconsistent and they need a better goalkeeper and a reliable goalscorer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senior figures in British business report that diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives are being "rebranded" to avoid unwanted political attention. Companies are reframing DEI policies as "wellbeing," "belonging," and "culture" due to a right-wing backlash. Some US-headquartered firms have scaled back commitments and are less keen to celebrate inclusion work publicly. Experts believe a full-scale rollback is unlikely in the UK due to the Equalities Act and legal risks of discrimination cases, but some companies are disguising DEI work to promote talent and address inequalities.</p>

          <p>Five years after anti-police protests, initiatives for officer mental health are gaining traction, spurred by the killing of George Floyd. Agencies are creating wellness units, and state legislatures are mandating and funding wellness initiatives for first-responders. Research indicates that police officers experience higher rates of depression, burnout, PTSD, and substance abuse. Programs like the Georgia Public Safety Resiliency Program and facilities like Valor Station offer support, but the stigma of seeking help remains a barrier. The goal is to provide coping skills and normalize mental wellness within law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The author discusses the concept of "Agua es vida" (water is life) and explores the idea of recognizing the aliveness of what we have been taught to think of as inert matter. The current environmental crisis is not just about emissions targets but also about the human imagination. The Rights of Nature movement seeks to grant basic rights to nonhuman entities, such as rivers, to evolve our relationship with nature. By spending time and attention in nature, we can learn to recognize the aliveness of what we have been taught to think of as inert matter.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns about democratic erosion, America's democracy is more resilient than many fear, displaying traits that protect it from a Trump-led assault. These include a robust network of advocacy groups, a powerful and independent judiciary, a constitutional system that makes executive preferences hard to entrench, a diverse and free private press, a federal system of government, and a uniquely speech-protective legal tradition. These features empower resistance and provide checks on executive power, making it more difficult for a Trump-like figure to undermine democratic institutions.</p>
