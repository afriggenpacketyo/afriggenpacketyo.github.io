          <p>President Trump has announced a preliminary trade agreement with Indonesia that would establish a 19% tariff on Indonesian imports, a reduction from a previously threatened 32% rate. As part of the purported deal, Indonesia would allegedly purchase billions in U.S. energy and agricultural products, as well as dozens of Boeing jets. However, officials in Jakarta have not yet publicly confirmed the terms, creating some uncertainty around the finality of the agreement.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced the release of 2,000 California National Guard members from their federal deployment in Los Angeles, effectively cutting the controversial mission's force in half. President Trump had federalized the troops against the wishes of state officials to respond to protests over immigration enforcement actions. In response to the withdrawal, Governor Gavin Newsom, who had sued the administration over the deployment, called for the remaining troops to be sent home as well.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives is considering the GENIUS Act, a bipartisan bill designed to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins. These digital currencies are pegged to less volatile assets, like the U.S. dollar, to reduce risk. Proponents believe that clear regulations would make stablecoins safer and more viable for mainstream payments, potentially facilitating faster and lower-cost financial transactions for consumers and businesses across the country.

The retrial, long sought by his family, forces a national re-examination of a pivotal and deeply polarizing event in South Korean history.</p>
