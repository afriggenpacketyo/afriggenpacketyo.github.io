          <p>Zia Yusuf, who had resigned as Reform UK chairman, is returning to the party in a new role leading the "Doge team," modeled after Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. Yusuf had cited that working to get the party elected was no longer a good use of his time, but now regrets his actions, blaming exhaustion from 11 months of hard work. Reform leader Nigel Farage stated that Yusuf will take on a more public role and appear more frequently in the media. Before his resignation, Yusuf had criticized Sarah Pochin's stance on banning the burka, clarifying that it is not Reform party policy; his return signifies a renewed commitment to the party's goals.</p>

Ramsey advises creating a savings benchmark, aiming to save at least 15% of gross income, and investing in a diverse portfolio to ensure a comfortable retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tommy Robinson, a far-right anti-Islam activist, was asked to leave a London restaurant after staff and guests reported feeling uncomfortable with his presence. Hawksmoor steakhouse stated that the decision was not based on politics or belief but on a duty of care to ensure a comfortable environment for everyone. Robinson accused the restaurant of ‚Äúdiscriminatory behaviour‚Äù due to his political views. Tripadvisor has temporarily suspended reviews on some Hawksmoor restaurants due to an influx of reviews not based on first-hand experiences.</p>
