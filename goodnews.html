          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 14:15:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink believes the company's acquisition of Preqin, a $3.2 billion deal for the alternative asset data provider, could be the most consequential move for expanding private market access. The integration of Preqin's data into BlackRock's platforms aims to bring transparency and benchmarks to private markets, similar to what Zillow did for housing. This move could diversify BlackRock's revenue and earnings, reducing reliance on the volatility of public markets. The acquisition has already contributed to revenue growth and increased annual contract values, with the longer-term goal of creating private-market benchmarks and accessible index products.</p>

          <p>Despite recent market volatility linked to the Trump administration's tariff policies, investors have seen positive annualized returns of 1.58% during Trump's second presidency. The S&P 500 has experienced several days with significant drops, but overall, the market has remained resilient. This highlights the importance of staying calm during market fluctuations, as volatility does not necessarily predict direction. While other presidential terms have led to bigger returns, Trump's second term has outperformed some previous presidencies, reinforcing the value of long-term investment strategies.

          <p>A recent survey of CEOs reveals improving outlooks for the U.S. economy, with only 28% expecting a recession in the near term, a decrease from 46% in May. Despite ongoing economic uncertainty, CEOs are optimistic that the Trump administration will negotiate trade deals to mitigate the impact of tariffs. The nation's gross domestic product (GDP) shrank at a 0.3% annual rate, raising concerns about a potential recession or stagflation. However, more recent measures of job growth and consumer spending suggest the economy is holding up, although tariff-driven inflation could change the outlook. (not investment advice)</p>
