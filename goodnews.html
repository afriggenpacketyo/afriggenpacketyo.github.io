          <p>Son Heung-min has announced his departure from Tottenham Hotspur after a decade with the club, a tenure that saw him become a fan favorite and a Premier League star. The South Korean forward, who joined in 2015, scored 173 goals and recently captained the team to a Europa League victory, ending the club's 17-year trophy drought. Teammates and club legends praise his on-field brilliance, including a Puskas award-winning goal, and his off-field generosity and character. His departure for a potential move to the MLS is seen as the end of an era for Spurs, leaving a significant legacy both at the club and in his home country.</p>

          <p>Australian cricketer David Warner has cast doubt on English batter Joe Root's potential performance in the upcoming Ashes series in Australia. Speaking while in England for The Hundred tournament, Warner pointed out that Root has never scored a century in Australia and is often dismissed by bowler Josh Hazlewood. Warner, who retired from international cricket last year, suggested that England's success hinges on their bowlers making an impact on Australia's top-order batters. The article also touches on Warner's positive reception from English fans during his last appearance, which he found touching despite their historic rivalry.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-02 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A notable pattern has emerged in President Trump's second term, with world leaders increasingly using praise and flattery as a diplomatic tool. Examples include the UK Prime Minister presenting a rare second state visit invitation from the King and the Israeli Prime Minister nominating Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Analysts suggest this obsequious approach is a strategic shift from Trump's first term, as leaders now recognize his personal authority and believe flattery is necessary to secure favorable outcomes, such as trade deals and defense commitments. This contrasts with their previous attempts to work through his advisors, acknowledging that Trump alone is the ultimate decision-maker.</p>

          <h2>New Comic Explores the Social Awkwardness of Receiving Compliments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-02 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new informational comic explores why many people feel awkward or uncomfortable when receiving compliments. According to social psychologist Erica Boothby and behavioral scientist Xuan Zhao, a person's reaction to praise often reveals their underlying self-perception. Dismissing a compliment can not only reflect personal insecurity but also negatively affect the person offering the kind words. The researchers make a case for learning to graciously accept compliments, highlighting the social and psychological benefits of doing so. This piece aims to help readers understand the science behind this common social interaction and encourage more positive exchanges.</p>

The film, about a fictional girl band leading a double life, is Netflix's most-watched animated movie ever. Ejae, who co-wrote and performed the track, expressed her astonishment at its success, attributing its popularity to its hopeful and powerful message. The Official Charts Company notes the achievement as a sign of K-pop's current popularity, suggesting the song has the potential to become the song of the summer due to its broad appeal.</p>

These cross-border commuters endure long daily journeys, often lasting 90 minutes or more each way, involving multiple modes of transport and a border crossing. Social media platforms are filled with individuals sharing tips on navigating this lifestyle, which they see as a worthwhile trade-off for avoiding Hong Kong's notoriously high rental costs. This phenomenon highlights the economic pressures facing young professionals in the region.</p>

          <p>Two state-owned Chinese firms have signed deals worth a combined US$350 million to develop large-scale agriculture in Angola, aiming to bolster China's food security. SinoHydro Group will invest over US$100 million to create a grain base on 30,000 hectares, with 60% of the output designated for China. Separately, the conglomerate Citic has committed US$250 million to cultivate 100,000 hectares for soybean and corn production over the next five years. These significant investments reflect China's strategic efforts to secure food supplies by developing agricultural resources abroad, particularly in friendly nations like Angola.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, leader of the UK's Conservative Party, has stated that she no longer identifies as Nigerian, despite her ancestry and having grown up partially in the country. Speaking on a podcast, Badenoch, who was born in the UK, explained that she returned to England at age 16 due to Nigeria's deteriorating political and economic situation. She revealed she has not renewed her Nigerian passport since the early 2000s and considers the UK her home, where her current family resides. Her comments follow previous criticism from Nigeria's vice-president, who accused her of denigrating her country of origin.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese-led research team has discovered an ancient genetic link between the potato and a forerunner of the tomato. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, scientists traced the crop's evolution back nine million years to a hybridization event between a tomato ancestor and a tuberless, potato-like plant. This pioneering study, published in the journal Cell, concludes that this ancient cross-breeding was the key evolutionary driver for the development of tubers. The finding sheds new light on the origins of one of the world's most important staple foods, which is consumed by over a billion people globally.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld a temporary restraining order that blocks the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration enforcement patrols in Southern California. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court's ruling that found substantial evidence of unconstitutional tactics, such as using race or language as the sole basis for a stop. The lawsuit was filed by advocacy groups on behalf of immigrants and U.S. citizens who were allegedly targeted without reasonable suspicion. The ruling is a significant victory for civil rights advocates and a setback for the administration's aggressive mass deportation strategy in the region.</p>

          <p>In response to growing user fatigue with endless swiping and messaging, the online dating industry is experimenting with new app formats. Companies are launching platforms that minimize pre-date chat to encourage in-person meetings, facilitate group dates, or cater to niche communities. This shift comes as major apps like Tinder and Hinge have seen a decline in UK usage, and lawsuits have accused them of using addictive features. The article explores a personal experience with an app that books dates directly, suggesting that while the new approaches may not guarantee a romantic spark, they can offer a more human and less draining alternative to the traditional online dating model.</p>

          <p>HBO has announced that "And Just Like That...," the reboot of the popular series "Sex and the City," will end after its upcoming third season. Showrunner Michael Patrick King stated that as he wrote the final episode, it felt like a natural and wonderful place to stop the story. The series, which follows three of the original main characters navigating life in their 50s, has faced declining viewership and criticism over its attempts to diversify the cast. Star Sarah Jessica Parker shared that the role of Carrie Bradshaw has been a huge part of her life for 27 years and that this chapter is now complete.</p>
