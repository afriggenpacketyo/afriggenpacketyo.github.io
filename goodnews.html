          <p>Wise, a British money transfer firm, announced its intention to shift its primary listing to the United States, a move that poses a setback for the London Stock Exchange. The company will implement a dual listing strategy, maintaining a secondary listing in London while establishing its main hub in the U.S. This decision aims to enable Wise's shares to be traded on both a U.S. stock exchange and the LSE, potentially broadening its investor base and access to capital. The announcement led to a 7% increase in Wise's shares during early morning trading. Optimism surrounds the company's strategic move to enhance its global presence. Optimism score is 75.</p>

          <p>The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has issued a warning to women using weight-loss injections, advising them to use effective contraception due to potential risks to unborn babies. The MHRA highlights that it remains uncertain whether medications like Wegovy and Mounjaro could harm a fetus. The agency recommends contraception during the use of GLP-1 medicines and for a specific period afterward before attempting pregnancy, advising those on Mounjaro and oral contraceptives to also use condoms for four weeks after starting the drug or switch to alternative methods. Concerns have arisen that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' may lead to unsafe drug use or inadequate advice. Optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>Three unexploded U.S. bombs from World War II were successfully defused in Cologne, Germany, prompting the city's largest evacuation since the war's end. Over 20,000 residents were evacuated from the city center after the bombs were discovered during road construction preparations. Experts managed to defuse the bombs in approximately one hour. Unexploded bombs are frequently found in Germany, requiring precautionary evacuations, and the location of this discovery was notably close to Cologne's historic center. The defusal of the bombs brought a sense of relief to the residents and authorities. Optimism score is 80.</p>

          <p>Russell Martin has been named the new head coach of Rangers, signing a three-year contract to lead the club into a new era.

The Thunder's path to victory lies in their formidable defense and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's scoring prowess, while the Pacers need to maintain their fast pace and protect the ball. The writers also discuss the potential for a small-market finals, the coaching matchup between Mark Daigneault and Rick Carlisle, and unheralded players to watch like Aaron Nesmith and Andrew Nembhard.

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth expressed confidence that NATO member states will agree to President Trump's demand for increased defense spending. Trump wants NATO allies to increase their defense spending to 5% of their GDP, up from the current 2%. NATO chief Mark Rutte has proposed a compromise of 3.5% of GDP on core military spending by 2032, and 1.5% on security-related areas. While some NATO members, like Spain, have expressed reluctance, Rutte is confident that the plan will be agreed upon. Optimism score is 65.</p>
