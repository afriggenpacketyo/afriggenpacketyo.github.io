        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold is often considered a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge, making it an attractive investment during times of economic uncertainty. The price of the precious metal is subject to constant fluctuation due to a variety of factors. These include fundamental economic principles of supply and demand, broader economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability. Other significant influences are central bank policies and currency movements, particularly the strength of the U.S. dollar, in which gold is priced. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in Birmingham have withdrawn a theft charge against a man who was accused of stealing flowers from a public tribute to the late musician Ozzy Osbourne. The case against Parviz Jafari was dropped after a court heard that a security guard had given him permission to take the items. The Crown Prosecution Service determined there was no realistic prospect of conviction because it could not be proven that his actions were dishonest. The tributes were left by thousands of fans following the Black Sabbath frontman's death in July.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's shares saw a significant 6% increase after a U.S. district judge ruled against the Department of Justice's most severe proposals in its antitrust case against Google. The tech giant will not be forced to divest its Chrome browser or Android operating system, a decision viewed by investors as a major victory. While Google was found to have an illegal monopoly in internet search, the ruling allows it to continue making payments to companies like Apple to be the default search engine. This outcome removed a major source of uncertainty for the company.</p>

          <p>Four-time major champion Naomi Osaka has demonstrated a significant return to form as she prepares for the US Open quarter-finals, her first since 2021. After a period of struggle and a 14-month break for the birth of her daughter, Osaka's performance has markedly improved, which many attribute to her new coach, Tomasz Wiktorowski. Her renewed confidence is evident in her powerful and clean ball-striking, which has been reminiscent of her previous title-winning runs. This resurgence marks a positive turn in her gradual comeback to the top tier of professional tennis.</p>

          <p>The UK government is reportedly in favor of merging all of the country's steel companies into a single entity to address the sector's persistent financial instability. With four of the six UK steel firms currently receiving government financial support, ministers believe consolidation is the best path to long-term sustainability. The Department for Business and Trade is understood to prefer finding a joint buyer rather than full nationalization. This plan comes as the government actively seeks new owners for British Steel and the recently collapsed Liberty Steel UK. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OnePay, the fintech company majority-owned by Walmart, is expanding its service offerings by launching its own branded wireless plan. This move is part of the company's broader strategy to evolve into a comprehensive "super app" that provides a wide range of services to its users. The new plan, called OnePay Wireless, will operate on the AT&T network and will be available directly through the OnePay app. This addition positions OnePay to compete with other digital platforms that are integrating diverse services to create a one-stop shop for consumers.</p>

          <p>A potential overhaul of English cricket's County Championship may be postponed until 2027 or shelved entirely due to a lack of consensus among the 18 first-class counties. Discussions have been ongoing to alter the domestic structure, with proposals to reduce the number of matches from 14 to 12 or 13. While a reduction in the T20 Blast competition was agreed upon, agreement on the Championship's future has proven more difficult to achieve. The delay is being considered to ensure the best possible decision is made for the long-term health of the competition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The depiction of children in art has evolved significantly throughout history, reflecting changing societal values and norms. In early periods, children were often portrayed as religious figures like the infant Jesus or as miniature adults in noble portraits designed to secure political marriages. As society shifted, art began to capture romanticized images of peasant children and, later, the carefree, playful nature of bourgeois childhood. The advent of photography and smartphones has further transformed the portrayal of children, making it more spontaneous while raising new questions about privacy and consent.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis by Morgan Stanley suggests that China's struggling property sector is poised for a recovery in the second half of the year. The investment bank predicts that the pace of decline in sales and profitability for major developers will slow significantly. While a 10% decrease in sales is expected for the full year, the fourth quarter could see a pickup, supported by a large inventory of completed homes in major cities. This cautiously optimistic outlook contrasts with the weak first-half results reported by developers. (not investment advice)</p>
