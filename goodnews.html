          <p>A train traveling from Manchester to Cardiff collided with a tractor and trailer at a level crossing in Leominster, Herefordshire, resulting in two people being hospitalized. The incident occurred on Thursday morning, affecting 56 passengers. A male passenger was airlifted to Hereford County Hospital with injuries not considered life-threatening, while a woman was also transported to the hospital by ambulance. Fifteen others were evaluated and discharged at the scene, and the tractor driver was uninjured. The crash led to the blockage of all lines between Hereford and Craven Arms, causing significant service disruptions. An investigation is underway to determine the circumstances leading up to the collision.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate over 1,300 U.S. Department of Education employees who were previously subject to a reduction in force. The judge's preliminary injunction emphasized the importance of the Department's ability to fulfill its functions and obligations, as mandated by Congress. The staff cuts, announced on March 11, would have significantly reduced the agency's staff and led to the closure of seven out of twelve offices responsible for enforcing civil rights protections for students, safeguarding them from discrimination based on race, sex, and disability. This order marks a setback for the administration's efforts to restructure the Education Department.</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in April fell 0.5% from March, reaching an annualized rate of 4 million units, the slowest April pace since 2009, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales were down 2% from April of the previous year, falling short of economists' expectations. The decline is attributed to high interest rates and low consumer confidence, impacting the spring housing market. Inventory increased by 9% month-to-month, reaching 1.45 million homes for sale, representing a 4.4-month supply, the highest level in five years. The median price of an existing home sold in April was $414,000, a modest 1.8% year-over-year increase, indicating a cooling market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Treasury Department plans to discontinue manufacturing the penny due to its rising production costs, marking the end of one of the first coins minted by the U.S. government. The federal agency has placed its final order for penny blanks, with the United States Mint expected to cease production in early 2026. In 2024, it cost about 3.7 cents to manufacture and distribute each 1-cent coin, resulting in an annual savings of approximately $56 million for the Mint. This decision follows scrutiny from previous administrations and directives from President Trump, who cited the wasteful expense of minting pennies that cost more than their face value.</p>

This initiative follows a deal between the Trump administration and the UAE. The first data center is expected to be operational next year. G42 will also invest in OpenAI data centers in the United States, matching every dollar invested in the Emirates. This expansion is part of Sam Altman's ambitious plan, called Stargate, to construct massive data centers globally to support powerful AI systems.

          <p>Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives passed President Donald Trump's tax bill, but investors on Wall Street expressed concerns about the bill's potential impact on federal deficits and long-term fiscal health.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would decrease resources for households in the lowest income decile and increase resources for the highest decile.

The team is facing a challenging stretch of games against winning teams, and while Ohtani's arm would be valuable, his bat is deemed essential. The Dodgers' pitching staff is depleted due to injuries, making Ohtani's offensive presence even more crucial. Dave Roberts will have to manage a depleted rotation and bullpen, potentially making strategic decisions to save key relievers for games where they have a lead.

          <p>In a personal essay, a writer reflects on experiencing a tornado in St. Louis shortly after the death of his mother. He contrasts the destructive power of the storm with the fragility of human life and the enduring presence of nature. The tornado, which uprooted trees and damaged homes, prompted reflections on mortality, indifference, and the sublime. The writer contemplates the interconnectedness of loss, nature's force, and the resilience of community in the face of devastation. He finds a sense of awe in the storm's indifference, drawing parallels to the unpredictable nature of life and death.</p>
