          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, largely due to robust performance in its fixed income trading and investment banking divisions. Despite a year-over-year decline in net income, the bank's results were buoyed by market volatility. CEO Jamie Dimon praised the resilient U.S. economy but reiterated warnings about significant risks from trade policies, geopolitical conflicts, and high fiscal deficits, reflecting a cautious outlook despite the strong quarter.

          <p>Scientists at the University of South Australia have developed a long-acting injectable formulation that could transform treatment for millions of Parkinson's disease patients by replacing daily pills. A single weekly shot provides a controlled, sustained release of the key medications levodopa and carbidopa. This innovative delivery system aims to improve patient convenience, maintain consistent drug levels in the body, and reduce side effects associated with fluctuating doses, representing a major step forward in managing the neurodegenerative disorder.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced on social media that the U.S. has reached a trade agreement with Indonesia, just one week after he threatened the nation with a 32% tariff on its exports. Trump described it as a "great deal, for everybody" but did not provide any specific information, stating that details would follow. This approach mirrors a recent announcement of a deal with Vietnam, where the specific terms were also slow to emerge, leaving the substance of the agreement unclear for now.

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is poised to vote on two significant bills designed to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets, marking a potential major victory for the cryptocurrency industry.
