          <p>Alibaba's on-demand delivery service, Taobao Shangou, has reportedly overtaken its primary rival Meituan in daily orders, driven by a significant subsidy campaign. According to a report, Taobao's orders surged past Meituan's after the latter paused its promotional pricing. This aggressive strategy, which includes subsidizing customers, merchants, and delivery riders, is shifting China's instant commerce market from a near-monopoly to a duopoly. An analysis by Morgan Stanley predicts that Alibaba and Meituan could hold nearly equal shares of the on-demand delivery market by the year 2030.</p>

          <p>Cosmetics company E.l.f. Beauty has acquired Hailey Bieber's popular skincare brand, Rhode, for $1 billion, a move that will expand its presence into Sephora stores this fall. The acquisition comes as E.l.f. navigates challenges from U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, which contributed to a 30% decline in its quarterly net income. Despite the market's reaction, CEO Tarang Amin remains confident, pointing to the company's 26 consecutive quarters of net sales growth and its status as the top cosmetics brand for Gen Z, Gen Alpha, and millennial consumers.

          <p>As temperatures rise, pet owners are advised to take extra precautions to keep their animals cool and safe. The RSPCA warns that there is no universally safe temperature for dog walks and recommends the "five-second pavement test" to check if surfaces are too hot for paws. Pet owners should walk dogs during cooler parts of the day, provide ample shade and water, and never leave animals in locked vehicles. Signs of heatstroke in dogs include excessive panting, confusion, and collapse, requiring immediate cooling measures and veterinary attention.</p>

          <h2>US and China Agree to Another 90-Day Extension on Trade Truce</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 07:50:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce for an additional 90 days, postponing the reimposition of higher tariffs that were set to take effect. President Trump signed an executive order to maintain the current tariff levels until November 10, a move mirrored by Beijing. This pause keeps the U.S. levy on Chinese imports at 30% and China's tariff on American goods at 10%, providing more time for negotiations on trade imbalances and market access. The extension offers temporary relief from escalating trade turmoil, though some business owners express frustration over the prolonged uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company has announced a major strategic shift, investing billions to retool its Louisville Assembly Plant to produce more affordable electric vehicles. The company plans to build a midsize electric pickup truck with a target price of $30,000, significantly cheaper than most current electric trucks. Ford CEO Jim Farley described the initiative as a new "Model T" moment, emphasizing the need to compete with the low-cost, high-quality EVs being produced by Chinese automakers. This move marks Ford's most significant bet on the EV market to date, aiming to enhance its global competitiveness.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is fast-tracking plans to deploy a nuclear reactor on the moon by 2030 to power a future human base. A July directive from acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy outlines the ambitious goal, which aligns with U.S. efforts to return astronauts to the lunar surface. The move is also driven by geopolitical competition, as both China and Russia aim to use nuclear power on the moon within the decade. The project, estimated to cost around $3 billion over five years, faces technical challenges, such as dissipating heat in the vacuum of space.</p>

A planned 2023 rematch between the two was canceled after Whyte failed a drug test, an issue he has since been cleared of.</p>

          <p>Marine researchers have discovered a massive and previously unknown deep-sea ecosystem in the hadal zone between Russia and Alaska, spanning roughly 1,550 miles. This community of life, including unique clam and tube worm species, thrives in total darkness by using chemosynthesis, converting methane and other chemicals from seafloor vents into energy. The finding suggests that such ecosystems may be more common in deep oceanic trenches than previously thought. It also indicates that these trenches play a more significant role in the global carbon cycle, acting as recycling centers for methane.</p>

          <p>Former Las Vegas Raiders coach Jon Gruden achieved a significant legal victory as the Nevada Supreme Court ruled his lawsuit against the NFL can proceed in civil court. The 5-2 decision rejected the NFL's argument that the dispute should be handled through internal arbitration, a process where the league could appoint the arbitrator. Gruden's lawsuit alleges the NFL maliciously leaked racist, homophobic, and sexist emails he wrote before he was a league employee, leading to his resignation in 2021. This ruling allows Gruden to pursue his case for reputational damage against the league and Commissioner Roger Goodell publicly.</p>

Other unusual rules include prohibitions on building large sandcastles on some beaches to prevent erosion, a ban on mowing lawns or using power tools on Sundays, and making it an offense to run out of fuel on the Autobahn.</p>
