          <p>The team bus for the Wales women's national football team was involved in a traffic accident in Switzerland while en route to a training session for their Euro 2025 match against France. The Football Association of Wales confirmed that all players and staff on the bus were uninjured, though the driver of the other vehicle involved was hospitalized with minor injuries. As a result of the incident, the team's planned training session at the stadium was canceled, but they later trained at their base. French manager Laurent Bonadei expressed his support for the Welsh team.</p>

          <p>Top-ranked tennis player Aryna Sabalenka secured her spot in the Wimbledon semi-finals after a difficult three-set victory over German veteran Laura Siegemund. Despite being the clear favorite, Sabalenka struggled initially, losing the first set before rallying to win 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 in a match lasting nearly three hours. Siegemund's unconventional style and slower pace of play tested Sabalenka's composure and resilience. This victory keeps Sabalenka on track for a potential first Wimbledon title, having reached the finals in the last three major tournaments.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the deadly Texas floods, conspiracy theories suggesting that "cloud seeding" caused or exacerbated the disaster have spread on social media, amplified by some political figures. This fact-check article dismisses these claims as false, citing multiple meteorological and atmospheric science experts. Scientists explain that cloud seeding cannot create massive storm systems and that any particles from recent operations would have dispersed long before the flood. Experts affirm that the flooding was caused by a combination of natural weather phenomena over a flood-prone region, warning that climate change will likely make such extreme events more common.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Black Americans are moving to other countries and reporting a more fulfilling and less stressful life outside the United States. Many expats state they experience fewer instances of racial discrimination abroad, where they are often perceived as American first rather than being defined by their race. In addition to a more inclusive social environment, these individuals often find better work-life balance and economic opportunities in countries like Mexico, Ghana, and Greece. This article highlights personal stories of Black expats who feel they have achieved a safer, richer life by leaving the U.S.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Taylor Fritz has advanced to the Wimbledon semi-finals for the first time in his career after a 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (4) victory over Karen Khachanov. Fritz dominated the first two sets but experienced a sudden dip in the third, allowing Khachanov to force a fourth set. Despite a malfunction in the electronic line-calling system and falling behind early in the fourth, Fritz regained his composure to win a decisive tie-break. He will now face either defending champion Carlos Alcaraz or Britain's Cam Norrie for a place in the final.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is ending its long-standing policy that requires airline passengers to remove their shoes during security screening. According to an internal memo, the new procedure will be rolled out at many major U.S. airports, allowing all travelers, not just those in PreCheck, to keep their shoes on. The policy, which has been in place since 2006 following a failed shoe-bomb attempt, is being changed to help expedite the screening process. Passengers who trigger an alarm at the security scanners will still be required to remove their shoes for additional screening.</p>

This landmark cultural exchange, a symbol of shared Anglo-French history, will also see British treasures like the Sutton Hoo artifacts travel to Normandy.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey from the New York Federal Reserve indicates that consumer expectations for inflation have fallen back to levels seen before the Trump administration's tariff announcements. In June, respondents anticipated an inflation rate of 3% for the upcoming year, down from a peak of 3.6% in March and April, suggesting that fears of a tariff-driven price spike have subsided. While the overall outlook has eased, consumers still expect significant price increases in specific areas like medical care, college education, and rent. The survey also showed improved optimism regarding employment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Boeing delivered 60 aircraft in the last month, its highest total since December 2023, signaling a ramp-up in production following a period of intense scrutiny over manufacturing and safety. The increase, which included 42 of its bestselling 737 Max jets, is the company's best performance since a door plug blowout on a flight in January 2024 triggered a new crisis and slowed operations. For the second quarter, Boeing handed over 150 airplanes, its strongest Q2 result since 2018. The progress comes as the company works to improve quality control and regain trust under new leadership.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the successful Democratic primary campaign of Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor, highlighting his strategic coalition-building as a lesson for the American left. Mamdani, a vocal advocate for Palestinian rights, secured a decisive victory partly through a cross-endorsement with Brad Lander, a self-identified progressive Zionist. This alliance demonstrates a political model that prioritizes shared local goals, such as housing and transportation, over rigid ideological purity on divisive foreign policy issues. The author suggests this approach of building broad coalitions, rather than enforcing purity tests, is crucial for the future success of progressive politics.</p>

          <p>Downing Street has indicated that it is making "good progress" with France on a new agreement to tackle small boat crossings in the English Channel, a key topic during President Emmanuel Macron's state visit. The UK government expects new French police powers to intervene with boats in shallow water to become operational soon, a tactical shift from previous policy. While details of a potential "one in, one out" migrant returns deal remain unconfirmed, the UK Prime Minister's office stated that months of negotiations are now "bearing fruit." The discussions come as 2025 has already set a record for small boat arrivals.</p>
