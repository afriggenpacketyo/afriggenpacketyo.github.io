          <p>A group of 59 white South Africans, claiming racial discrimination, have arrived in the US under an expedited refugee program, prompting criticism from immigrant rights activists and debate over the validity of their claims. President Trump stated that their applications were fast-tracked due to a "genocide" targeting white farmers, a claim disputed by the South African government, which denies any persecution. The US has also criticized South Africa's land reform policies, which aim to address racial inequality. This initiative has strained bilateral relations between the US and South Africa, raising questions about fairness and historical context.</p>

Authorities are treating all three fires as suspicious, including a car fire, and inquiries are ongoing. Starmer has thanked the emergency services for their work but has declined to comment further due to the live investigation.</p>

          <p>Harvard University President Alan Garber responded to Education Secretary Linda McMahon's letter criticizing the university's handling of antisemitism, asserting that Harvard shares common ground in combating bigotry but refutes claims of partisanship. Garber defended Harvard's actions to address campus issues, including installing new deans and clarifying disciplinary procedures. He emphasized that Harvard will not surrender its legally protected principles out of fear of retaliation from the federal government, which has frozen $2.2 billion in funding and threatened to revoke the university's tax-exempt status.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to impose triple-digit tariffs on Chinese products brought trade between the countries to a standstill but proved unsustainable. After trade talks in Geneva, the US and China agreed to reduce levies, lowering US tariffs to 30% and Chinese tariffs to 10%. While the agreement provides relief for businesses, it remains uncertain whether future negotiations will yield further concessions. Some experts view the agreement as a retreat that vindicates China's retaliatory strategy, questioning the worth of the trade disruptions.</p>

          <p>The US and China have agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs for 90 days, leading to a surge in stock markets. Both countries will lower tariffs by 115%, bringing the US tariff on Chinese imports down to 30% and China's rate on American goods down to 10%. Investors remain cautiously optimistic, warning that the market rally could falter as the end of the tariff pause approaches.

          <p>A new software update prevented a third radar outage at Newark airport when a telecommunications line failed, according to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. Duffy criticized the Biden administration for not better equipping the air traffic control facility in Philadelphia, leading to the recent problems.

          <p>Donald Trump‚Äôs Hollywood ambassadors, including Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone, joined labor unions and major studios in asking the US president to expand and extend tax incentives for film and television productions. In a letter addressed to Trump, the studios and unions thanked him for supporting the industry through their ‚Äúshared goal‚Äù of domestic production. The letter calls for Trump to back three tax provisions in the upcoming budget reconciliation bill being drafted by Congress that it argues would ‚Äúimmediately make America more competitive, expand the American media industry, brings jobs back to America, and support the independent spirit of American business‚Äù.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials, influencers, and state-run media are portraying the initial trade agreement and 90-day tariff pause with the U.S. as a victory for Beijing. They argue that their defiant public posture worked and was a major reason they were able to strike a deal with U.S. officials with relatively few concessions. The Chinese public believes negotiators from Beijing convinced President Donald Trump's administration to roll back most of the 145% tariff rate that Trump imposed, and slash them to 30%.</p>

          <p>Receipts from U.S. tariffs hit a record level of $16.3 billion in April, contributing to a surplus for the month and reducing the overall budget deficit. Customs duties were 86% above March and more than double the amount from a year ago, driven by President Trump's trade war. The influx in tariffs helped to cut the fiscal year-to-date deficit to $1.05 trillion, though high interest rates continue to pose a budgetary burden. While the US is still running a massive budget deficit, the influx in tariffs helped shave some of the imbalance for April, a month in which the Treasury generally runs a surplus because of the income tax filing deadline hitting mid-month.</p>
