        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece explores the concept of peace, contrasting the world's conditional tranquility with a deeper, faith-based sense of calm. The author uses the metaphor of being on a large, secure ship in a shark-infested sea to illustrate the safety found in religious faith. An anecdote about a peaceful, nursing baby in a chaotic airport during a flight cancellation serves as a central example of how proximity to a source of comfort—in this case, God—can provide profound peace regardless of tumultuous external circumstances.</p>

          <p>Air Canada plans to resume flight operations after the Canadian government intervened to end a strike by 10,000 of its flight attendants, ordering both parties into binding arbitration to resolve their contract dispute. The strike, which began on Saturday, caused widespread travel chaos, stranding more than 100,000 passengers globally. While the airline works to stabilize its schedule, the union has condemned the government's action as a violation of workers' rights that undermines their leverage in negotiations for better pay and conditions.</p>

Brink adopted this mental tool during her 13-month rehabilitation to help visualize her goals, maintain a positive outlook, and combat the doubts that arose during the lengthy process. This focus on manifestation and mental rehearsal is credited with helping her manage the pressures of returning to the WNBA, allowing her to make an immediate and meaningful impact for her team.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was successfully rescued in a dramatic helicopter operation after becoming trapped behind a powerful waterfall in California's Tulare County for two days. The experienced rappeller was reportedly pushed off his lines by the river's intense hydraulics, leaving him stranded in a small cave behind the cascade. A multi-agency search effort using aircraft and drones eventually located him, and a highway patrol crew hoisted him to safety. He was treated for dehydration and minor injuries before a reunion with his family.</p>

          <p>The Washington, D.C. area known as NoMa (North of Massachusetts Avenue), once a disused industrial zone, has been successfully transformed into a dense, transit-adjacent neighborhood. Over the last two decades, a focused redevelopment effort has turned the area into a leading example of "YIMBY" (Yes In My Backyard) urban planning principles. By embracing density, the project has added a significant amount of new housing and commercial space near a major transportation hub, showcasing a modern approach to city revitalization.</p>
