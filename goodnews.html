The Senate is working to reconcile divisions over Medicaid cuts and state and local tax deductions. While the House passed the bill, the Senate intends to leave its mark on the legislation.

          <p>A judge extended a temporary restraining order on President Trump's ban prohibiting foreign Harvard University students from entering the U.S. until next Monday. Harvard's lawyers argue the ban violates First Amendment rights and exceeds executive authority, citing retaliation and viewpoint discrimination. The government argues it doesn't "trust" Harvard to monitor foreigners and raised concerns about foreign entanglements with China. The judge questioned the government's concerns, asking why the issues weren't specific to Harvard. This article details the legal arguments and the judge's skepticism.</p>

Personal lines of credit may also offer lower interest rates than credit cards.
