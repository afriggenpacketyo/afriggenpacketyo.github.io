        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Philadelphia Eagles star Saquon Barkley voiced his opposition to the proposed ban on the 'tush push' play, calling the efforts to eliminate it "soft." Barkley argued that any team can execute the play, and the Eagles' success is due to their strong offensive line and quarterback Jalen Hurts' strength. He also disputed claims that the play poses a risk to player safety, highlighting that other teams with athletic quarterbacks have not been as successful with it. The NFL owners ultimately voted against the proposal, allowing the play to remain legal for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>An All Nippon Airways flight from Tokyo to Houston was diverted to Seattle after a passenger attempted to open the plane's exit doors mid-flight. The passenger was restrained by fellow passengers and crew members before the plane landed at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, where he was evaluated and transported to a local hospital for a medical crisis. A second, unrelated incident involved another unruly passenger who was removed from the plane while on the tarmac in Seattle, and the flight eventually continued to Houston after a delay.

          <p>Lando Norris secured his first victory since the season-opener in Australia at the Monaco Grand Prix, converting his pole position into a lead at the first corner and maintaining it throughout the race. The race was relatively straightforward for the front-runners, with the only safety car intervention being an early virtual one after a crash for Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto. Norris, Charles Leclerc, and Oscar Piastri all followed the same strategy of starting on the medium tire followed by two stints on the hard tire, splitting the race more or less into thirds, while Verstappen finished fourth after Red Bull ran him on an inverted strategy starting on the hards and switching to the mediums and delayed his final pit stop as late as possible.</p>
