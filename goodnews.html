        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Northern Lights were visible across the UK on Monday night due to a strong solar storm. The aurora's bright colors were spotted from northern Scotland to Norfolk and Kent after a coronal mass ejection was detected by satellites. The increased solar energy interacted with oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere, creating the vibrant colors. Space weather forecasters predict a potentially stronger geomagnetic storm, possibly bringing a greater chance to see the aurora across the UK, even with the naked eye, before activity returns to normal levels by Wednesday. The display offered a spectacle for many regions. </p>

          <p>Guyana held its presidential election amidst an oil boom and rising tensions with Venezuela. Voters chose from candidates representing six political parties, with the incumbent People's Progressive Party, the main opposition A Partnership for National Unity, and newcomer We Invest In Nationhood being the primary contenders. The winning party will manage significant oil revenues, though poverty remains a concern despite the country's newfound oil wealth. The election also occurred amidst a territorial dispute with Venezuela, with Guyana accusing Venezuela of firing shots on a boat transporting election officials, adding complexity to the political landscape. </p>

          <p>Newcastle United concluded a busy transfer window by selling Alexander Isak to Liverpool for a record £125m and acquiring Yoane Wissa from Brentford for £55m. The club reluctantly sold Isak after receiving an irresistible offer, while also securing Wissa to bolster their attacking options. The departure of Isak was met with mixed reactions from fans, while the arrival of Wissa and Nick Woltemade is expected to add depth to the squad. The club also hired a technical director to improve recruitment processes for future transfer windows, hoping to enhance their ability to compete with top clubs. </p>
