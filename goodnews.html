          <p>She Yiyuan, an award-winning data scientist and professor, has left his position at Florida State University after nearly two decades to join Westlake University in China. A fellow of the American Statistical Association, She is recognized for his significant contributions to high-dimensional statistics, machine learning, and big data analysis. His move is highlighted by Westlake University as a major gain for China's research capabilities in data science, a field foundational to the advancement of artificial intelligence. This relocation is indicative of a broader trend of scientific talent shifting, as China seeks to bolster its domestic expertise in critical technology sectors.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) has engineered its own proprietary hardware to cool the next generation of power-intensive Nvidia GPUs used for artificial intelligence. As AI workloads grow, the massive energy consumption of these chips requires advanced cooling solutions that traditional methods cannot provide at scale. Instead of overhauling its data centers for liquid cooling, AWS developed the In-Row Heat Exchanger (IRHX), a system that can be integrated into existing facilities. This innovation allows AWS to efficiently support Nvidia's most powerful AI systems, like the GB200 NVL72, maintaining its competitive edge in the cloud infrastructure market.</p>

          <p>In a decisive 4-0 Club World Cup semi-final victory, a cohesive and relentless Paris Saint-Germain dismantled a disjointed Real Madrid. The match highlighted the contrast between PSG's team-oriented system under Luis Enrique and Real Madrid's struggles to integrate its star players, including former PSG forward Kylian Mbappé. While Ousmane Dembélé shone for PSG with his work rate and a goal, Mbappé was largely ineffective, overshadowed by his former team's collective brilliance. The game served as a stark illustration of PSG's successful evolution after Mbappé's departure and raised questions about Real Madrid's tactical direction under new manager Xabi Alonso.</p>
