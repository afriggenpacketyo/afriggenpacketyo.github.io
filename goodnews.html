          <p>The FDA has approved three natural-source colors for use in food items: Galdieria extract blue, butterfly pea flower extract, and calcium phosphate. This decision aligns with the HHS and FDA's move to ban petroleum-based synthetic dyes due to health concerns, with FDA Commissioner Martin Makary emphasizing the agency's commitment to transitioning to natural alternatives. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. noted that the food industry is actively collaborating with federal agencies in this shift, while industry experts like Vani Hari and Courtney Swan lauded the change, highlighting the health risks associated with synthetic dyes and the availability of safer, plant-based alternatives. Tyson Foods has also announced its intention to remove petroleum-based dyes from its products.</p>

Apple had previously announced plans to invest $500 billion to expand its US operations, including assembling AI servers in Houston. The tariff pause is expected to benefit Apple, which conducts a significant portion of its production in China and relies on the region for a substantial portion of its sales.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order to revive a policy aimed at lowering drug costs by tying them to prices in other developed countries. The 'most favored nation' policy seeks to ensure the US pays the lowest price available worldwide for certain medications, impacting both commercial and government markets like Medicare and Medicaid. The administration intends to focus on drugs with significant price disparities, potentially including popular weight loss and diabetes treatments. The order directs agencies to crack down on foreign policies that suppress drug prices and establish a pathway for US patients to buy drugs directly from manufacturers at the most favored nation prices.</p>

          <p>A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that individuals taking tirzepatide, sold as Zepbound and Mounjaro, experienced greater weight loss compared to those taking semaglutide, known as Ozempic and Wegovy. Tirzepatide users lost approximately 20% of their body weight, while semaglutide users lost around 14% over a 72-week period. Dr. C√©line Gounder noted the study was funded by Lilly, the maker of tirzepatide, but added that the research appears legitimate and aligns with previous findings. Beyond weight loss, these drugs offer additional health benefits, including improved blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and cholesterol. The high cost and limited insurance coverage remain significant barriers to access.</p>

While these fees can add up, they are generally more affordable than the interest on high-balance credit cards or the fees charged by other debt relief options.

Key measures include raising qualification requirements for skilled worker visas, expanding eligibility for elite university graduates, doubling the residency wait for indefinite leave to remain, and implementing stricter rules for international students.

          <p>The US and China have agreed to a truce to lower import taxes on goods traded between the two countries, marking a significant de-escalation in their trade war. Both nations will cancel some tariffs and suspend others for 90 days, reducing US tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% and Chinese tariffs on some US imports to 10%. China has also halted non-tariff countermeasures, such as the export of critical minerals to the US. Talks are set to continue, with both countries expressing a desire to bridge differences and deepen cooperation, though the situation remains subject to change.</p>

          <p>Stocks soared after the US and China agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs for 90 days, with major indexes rising over 2% in early trading. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all saw significant gains, reflecting relief from tech companies. The agreement, reached in Switzerland, will lower tariffs by 115%, bringing the US tariff on Chinese imports down to 30% and China's rate on American goods down to 10%. Investors remain cautiously optimistic, warning of potential volatility as the tariff pause approaches its end in August.</p>

          <p>The US and China have agreed to a temporary but significant easing of tariffs, suspending most levies imposed since early April for 90 days. This breakthrough in trade negotiations follows high-level talks in Geneva, with both sides committing to ongoing discussions. The temporary reductions will bring the US tariff on Chinese goods down to about 30%, while China will reduce its levies on American imports to 10%. China also agreed to ease some non-tariff barriers, potentially resuming the export of rare earths to the US. The agreement has boosted commodities, currency markets, and stock futures.</p>

          <p>The US and China have taken steps to de-escalate their trade war by canceling retaliatory tariff increases and lowering the 'reciprocal' tariff rate for at least 90 days. This move, following talks in Switzerland, has been welcomed by global markets and is seen as a ceasefire in the global trade war. While longer-term challenges remain, the agreement averts a potential factory shutdown and significant unemployment in China. The US now faces the challenge of justifying why allies who did not retaliate should receive less favorable treatment than China.</p>

          <p>A power failure caused major disruption across the London Underground network, London Overground, and the Elizabeth line, leading to line suspensions and severe delays. Transport for London (TfL) attributed the issues to a power outage in south-west London, affecting multiple lines and stations. Power has since been restored, but delays and line suspensions are ongoing. Many commuters are facing significant travel disruptions, with some stations being closed due to safety concerns.</p>

          <p>The Indian Premier League (IPL) is expected to resume in the coming days following a ceasefire announcement, with 16 games remaining to be played. A new plan could involve cutting the number of venues used or playing more double headers. While some players have left India, others have remained, and any immediate resumption of the IPL would ease future scheduling concerns. A deadly militant attack in Kashmir had previously escalated tensions between India and Pakistan, but a ceasefire was announced by US President Donald Trump.</p>
