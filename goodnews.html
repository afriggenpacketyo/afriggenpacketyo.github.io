          <p>A new public art installation in Brooklyn, titled the "Wall of Shame," aims to bring public attention to the more than 1,500 individuals pardoned by President Trump for their involvement in the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack. Created by artist Phil Buehler, the 50-foot mural documents the names, photos, and alleged crimes of the rioters, color-coded by the nature of their actions. The project serves as a factual counter-narrative to what the artist sees as an attempt to rewrite history and downplay the severity of the event. It is the third in a series of political art projects by Buehler intended to challenge authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>Belgian sprinter Tim Merlier secured victory in a chaotic third stage of the Tour de France, narrowly beating Italy's Jonathan Milan in a photo finish. The stage was marked by several crashes, including one that forced stage one winner Jasper Philipsen to abandon the race. Another major crash in the final kilometers involved general classification contenders, though they managed to continue. Despite the turmoil, Mathieu van der Poel successfully defended his position and retained the overall leader's yellow jersey. The day also saw the recovery of 11 bikes that had been stolen from the Cofidis team truck before the stage.</p>

          <h2>Micro-Robots Offer Potential New Antibiotic-Free Treatment for Sinus Infections</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 13:00:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have developed microscopic robots that could revolutionize the treatment of sinus infections by offering a targeted, drug-free alternative to antibiotics. These micro-robots, made of magnetically guided particles, can be navigated through the nasal cavity directly to the site of an infection. Once in place, a fiber optic light activates them to break through mucus and destroy harmful bacteria without affecting surrounding tissue. While animal trials have been promising, showing effective infection clearance without damage, further research is needed to ensure safety before human use. This technology could help combat the growing problem of antibiotic resistance.</p>

          <p>Block CEO and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has launched Bitchat, a new decentralized messaging app that operates peer-to-peer over Bluetooth mesh networks, requiring no internet connection. The app is designed for ephemeral, encrypted communication between nearby devices, allowing messages to be relayed from phone to phone to extend range beyond standard Bluetooth capabilities. This model ensures that no central servers are involved and no personal data is collected, reflecting Dorsey's continued push for privacy-focused, censorship-resistant technology. The app is intended to function even during internet shutdowns, similar to tools used in past pro-democracy protests.</p>

          <p>The film "F1," starring Brad Pitt, has become Apple's most successful theatrical release ever, surpassing $293 million at the global box office. Distributed by Warner Bros. Discovery, the movie has out-grossed previous Apple-backed films like "Napoleon" and "Killers of the Flower Moon." Its success is partly attributed to a strategic partnership with IMAX, which secured a three-week exclusive run and contributed over $60 million to the film's total earnings. While the high-budget film still has a way to go to achieve profitability for Apple, its box office performance marks a significant milestone for the tech giant's growing ambitions in the entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>Keith Siegel, an American-Israeli man released from Hamas captivity in February, believes President Donald Trump has the power to secure the freedom of the remaining hostages and end the war in Gaza. Siegel, who was held for 484 days, made the comments ahead of a White House meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He thanked Trump for helping broker the deal that led to his own release and urged him to apply similar pressure on both sides to reach a new agreement. Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas recently resumed but have yet to produce a breakthrough.</p>

          <p>Reading council in the UK is considering a new Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO) to clamp down on anti-social behaviors like aggressive begging, street drinking, and the misuse of e-scooters. Supported by local police, the borough-wide order would provide an additional tool for enforcement, which officials say was lacking in a previous, less effective PSPO. The council noted a high number of complaints about these issues and aims to use the order first as a preventative measure to request that the behavior stops before issuing penalties. Councillors are set to review the proposal, with a public consultation potentially starting in July.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Pakistan's Punjab province have confiscated 18 lions that were being kept illegally as pets in the densely populated region. The crackdown was initiated after a lion escaped from a home in Lahore last week and attacked a woman and two children. The owner was arrested, and officials say keeping such animals without a proper license can result in a significant jail sentence. The operation also included raids on 38 big cat breeding farms, as keeping exotic animals is seen as a status symbol among some wealthy Pakistanis despite the legal requirements and public safety risks.</p>

          <p>Wimbledon officials have modified their electronic line-calling system to prevent a repeat of a controversial incident caused by human error. During a fourth-round match, an operator accidentally deactivated the Hawk-Eye ball-tracking technology for a game, leading to a missed call and a disputed point replay. In response, the All England Club has removed the ability for operators to manually turn off the system. The club also stated it would consider implementing a video review system, similar to those used in other major tournaments, as part of its post-championship operational review.</p>

Mulder explained the decision was made in the team's best interest to have enough time to bowl Zimbabwe out, but also out of respect for the West Indies legend.

          <p>A comprehensive review by the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI has concluded that Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in 2019 and that no secret "client list" of high-profile associates exists, contradicting long-standing conspiracy theories. The review of government files, which included extensive digital and physical searches, found no credible evidence to support investigations against uncharged third parties. The DOJ also released surveillance footage from the correctional center, showing no one entered Epstein's area around the time of his death, aiming to provide transparency and counter misinformation surrounding the case.</p>
