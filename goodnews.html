          <p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. defended the independence of the judiciary and criticized any attempts to impeach judges based on disagreements with their rulings. Speaking in Buffalo, Roberts emphasized the judiciary's role in checking the excesses of Congress or the executive branch.

Roberts's defense comes amid intense pressure on the justices as they navigate legal challenges to Trump administration policies and scrutiny from the administration on federal judges.</p>

          <p>In response to Republican-controlled legislatures banning the flying of pride flags on government property in Utah and Idaho, Salt Lake City and Boise have found a creative solution. Salt Lake City adopted three new city flags incorporating the pride flag, trans flag, and Juneteenth flag, while Boise retroactively declared the pride flag as an official city flag. These actions are seen as a direct response to the legislative restrictions and a continued affirmation of diversity, equity, and inclusion in both cities.</p>
