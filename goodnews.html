          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa has officially announced she will not seek reelection when her second term ends in 2026. Ernst, the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate, cited prayer and reflection as guiding her decision to conclude her chapter of elected service. Her retirement opens up a competitive race for the Senate seat in a state that has trended Republican in recent presidential elections. Speculation is already underway about potential Republican and Democratic candidates who may contend for the position.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price increased on Tuesday, moving contrary to a sell-off in the stock market, while gold reached a new record high of over $3,500. The cryptocurrency reclaimed the $111,000 level amid broader market concerns over the legality of global tariffs and their economic impact. Market strategists note that while both assets benefit from geopolitical uncertainty, Bitcoin's performance has been partly tempered by a significant rotation of capital into Ethereum. This divergence highlights a market seeking both safety in traditional assets like gold and yield in the crypto space. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Home Depot Leverages SRS Acquisition and Trade Credit to Expand Professional Contractor Business</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 13:23:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Depot is significantly expanding its business with professional contractors through its recent multi-billion dollar acquisitions, including the over $18 billion purchase of SRS Distribution. A key element of this strategy is the expansion of trade credit, which allows contractors to buy supplies and pay for them later, acting as a financier for their projects. The company has already seen a double-digit lift in spending from pros who utilize these credit accounts. This focus on the "complex pro" market is a strategic move to capture a larger share of a market estimated to be worth around $250 billion.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Highlight Opportunity for 0% Capital Gains Tax Harvesting Under New Bill</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 13:17:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A provision for a 0% tax rate on long-term capital gains, combined with new deductions in President Trump's recent tax legislation, may create a significant opportunity for investors. Financial planners note that more individuals could qualify for this bracket, which applies to those with taxable income below certain thresholds. This allows for "tax-gain harvesting," a strategy of selling profitable assets without incurring taxes, or selling and rebuying assets to reset their cost basis for future tax savings. For 2025, the 0% rate applies to single filers with taxable income of $48,350 or less. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Facing financial pressures that have led to closures and acquisitions, many independent rural hospitals across the U.S. are joining "clinically integrated networks." These collaborations allow them to remain autonomous while sharing resources, negotiating better prices for services like mobile MRI units, and combining patient pools for value-based care contracts. By banding together, these hospitals can offer services they couldn't afford alone and gain leverage with vendors and insurers. This model presents a viable alternative to shutting down or being absorbed by larger health systems, helping to preserve local healthcare access and employment.</p>

          <p>The head of the Palestinian mission in London, Husam Zomlot, believes that formal recognition of a Palestinian state by major Western nations would act as a "starting gun" for a rapid push toward a two-state solution. Several countries, including Britain, France, and Canada, have indicated they will recognize Palestinian statehood at the upcoming UN General Assembly. The diplomatic moves are intended to pressure Israel to end its military operations in Gaza and halt settlement construction. Despite the diminishing viability of the two-state proposal, Zomlot expressed hope that this momentum could lead to meaningful progress.</p>

          <p>Qualifying for a reverse mortgage, a loan that allows seniors to convert home equity into cash, involves several key requirements set by the federal government for its most common version, the HECM. A borrower must be at least 62 years old, the property must be their primary residence, and they must have substantial home equity. Lenders also conduct a financial assessment to ensure the homeowner can still cover property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. Additionally, mandatory counseling from an independent third party is required to ensure applicants fully understand the loan's implications before approval.</p>
