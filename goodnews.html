          <p>The Berkshire Hathaway board has voted for Greg Abel to become the CEO on January 1, 2026, while Warren Buffett will remain as chairman. This decision aims to provide stability and experience during the transition, especially with Berkshire Hathaway holding over $347 billion in cash. Buffett indicated he could assist with major acquisition opportunities amid volatile markets. Despite the announcement and somewhat disappointing earnings, Berkshire shares experienced only a slight dip in premarket trading, having closed at a record high the previous day. The market's reaction reflects confidence in the company's future leadership and financial position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. crude oil futures fell after OPEC+ agreed to increase production in June, adding 411,000 barrels per day to the market. This decision follows a similar production increase in May and has led to concerns about an oversupplied market. Oil prices have already fallen more than 20% this year, impacted by tariffs and fears of a recession slowing demand. Oilfield service firms anticipate reduced investment in exploration and production due to the weak price environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has reduced the default withholding rate for new overpayment notices from 100% to 50% for Title II benefits, which include retirement, survivors, and disability insurance. This change comes after criticism of the initial 100% rate, though experts still warn that even a 50% clawback can cause significant financial hardship for affected beneficiaries. Overpayments can occur for various reasons, such as unreported changes in circumstances or agency errors. Beneficiaries have 90 days to request a lower withholding rate or a waiver of recovery, otherwise, the agency will withhold up to 50% of their benefits until the overpayment is recovered.</p>
