          <p>Svetlana Dali, a Russian citizen and U.S. permanent resident, has been found guilty of stowing away on a Delta flight from New York to Paris. She passed through security in a lane reserved for crewmembers and bypassed gate agents by blending in with boarding passengers. Dali admitted to not having a boarding pass and staying in the bathroom for most of the flight. This incident led to a Transportation Security Administration review, resulting in additional security measures to prevent similar occurrences. Dali has been in custody since December 2024 after attempting to cross into Canada illegally.</p>

          <p>Several Glastonbury festival-goers have been left without tickets and accommodations after Yurtel, a luxury yurt company, went into liquidation. Customers had booked hospitality tickets and accommodation packages ranging from ¬£10,000 to ¬£16,500 through Yurtel, which ceased trading on May 8. Glastonbury Festival clarified that it has no involvement with Yurtel's operations and has not received payment for any tickets for the 2025 festival. Affected customers are advised to pursue recompense through the liquidation process, while the festival is attempting to help customers find alternative options.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally, reaching a new record high above $111,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership and corporate adoption. Easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, along with the Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, have also contributed to the cryptocurrency's rise. Bitcoin ETFs have seen strong inflows, and the number of bitcoin held by public companies has grown significantly. Pro-crypto policies from the Trump administration and the Senate's move to advance crypto legislation have further supported the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Teachers and doctors in England have been granted a 4% pay rise after the government accepted recommendations from pay review bodies. Education unions have welcomed the decision but warn of potential budget cuts without additional funding. Health unions, however, have reacted negatively to a smaller 3.6% rise for other NHS staff, including nurses and midwives. Resident doctors are considering strike action due to concerns that the pay award is inadequate. The government says that the pay rises will be funded from existing budgets and improved productivity.</p>

          <p>Heal the Bay's annual Beach Report Card has identified the Santa Monica Pier as one of California's dirtiest beaches for the second consecutive year. The report monitors beaches for fecal bacteria, with the pier-adjacent area receiving a low grade despite upgrades. Other beaches with poor water quality include several in San Diego and San Mateo counties. The report also highlights California's top 'honor roll' beaches, with Orange County dominating the list. Overall, the report indicates a noticeable improvement in coastal water quality due to a dry summer and winter.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that the sluggish nature of sloths has contributed to their evolutionary success. Scientists examined the evolutionary history of sloths, including extinct forms, and found that tree-dwelling sloths were better able to survive than their giant ground-dwelling counterparts, which were easier targets for human hunters. The research emphasizes the importance of conserving Earth's remaining sloth species, as they represent only a fraction of their evolutionary history. The study also highlights the adaptability of sloths in coping with climate changes.</p>
