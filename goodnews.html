        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nicusor Dan, the pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, secured the Romanian presidency after a closely contested race against right-wing nationalist George Simion, leader of the AUR party. Dan's victory, with 53.6% of the vote, followed months of political turbulence, including an annulled presidential race due to Russian interference allegations. Supporters celebrated Dan's commitment to fighting corruption and supporting Ukraine, while Simion, who attacked the EU and called for cutting aid to Kyiv, initially contested the results before conceding. The article also highlights the strong support Simion received from diaspora voters in Western Europe, reflecting broader discontent with mainstream parties in Romania.</p>

          <p>Professor Benjamin Horton, the new dean of City University of Hong Kong's energy and environment school, views China as a pivotal force in climate science. Horton cites China's substantial funding, advancements in green technology, and governmental support for environmental research as key factors. He contrasts China's proactive investments in green initiatives and reforestation with the pullback observed in other countries. Horton's decision to relocate to China reflects his belief in the nation's potential to drive significant progress in addressing climate change, leveraging its superpower status and pro-environment stance.</p>

          <h2>UK Energy Bills Forecast to Decrease in July</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 02:33:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Domestic energy prices in the UK are projected to decrease in July, reversing a trend of consecutive increases in the regulator Ofgem's price cap. Cornwall Insight analysts predict that the annual energy bill for a typical household will decrease by ¬£129, a nearly 7% reduction. This forecast comes after household bills increased in April, and it would result in a typical annual bill of ¬£1,720 for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit. The price cap is based on the cost per unit of energy, so total bills still depend on consumption.</p>

          <p>China is preparing to deploy its "drone carrier," the Jiu Tian, for its first mission by the end of June, enhancing the country's unmanned aerial combat capabilities. The Jiu Tian, a super-high altitude, long-range UAV, can carry up to 6 tonnes of ammunition and small-sized drones, extending their reach. With a range of 7,000km and an altitude of 15,000 metres, the jet-powered drone can release up to 100 units of loitering ammunition or small drones, including kamikaze UAVs, from its belly. This deployment marks a significant step in China's military modernization and its ability to project power.</p>

          <p>Conservationists in Wales are employing an innovative method to track endangered water voles by feeding them edible glitter. Water vole populations have drastically declined, and tracking these shy creatures in the wild has been challenging. By adding edible, biodegradable glitter to their food, researchers hope to identify water vole habitats and movements through glitter found in their droppings. This information will help conservationists implement targeted measures, such as removing invasive species and fencing off riverbanks, to protect and support the water vole population.</p>
