          <p>Burberry is planning to cut approximately 1,700 jobs globally as part of its ongoing turnaround strategy, aiming to save ¬£60 million by 2027, adding to the ¬£40 million already cut in November. The job reductions, impacting about 20% of Burberry's workforce, will primarily affect office-based roles, stores, and its Castleford factory. Despite a slight sales decrease in the fiscal fourth quarter, CEO Joshua Schulman remains optimistic about the brand's future, highlighting the challenges of refocusing on timeless pieces and innovating within that space. Shares rose 8.5% after the announcement, signaling investor confidence in the cost-cutting measures.</p>

          <p>Social Security recipients in default on student loans may face benefit reductions of up to 15%, although a minimum monthly benefit of $750 is protected, according to experts. Borrowers may receive less notice of these offsets than in the past, but should still receive at least a 30-day warning sent to their last known address. Borrowers have the right to contest the offset by demonstrating financial hardship or a pending student loan discharge, and should seek assistance immediately upon receiving a notice to explore their options.</p>

          <p>The European Union's General Court ruled that the European Commission must provide more credible explanations for denying a journalist's request for text messages exchanged between Ursula von der Leyen and Pfizer's CEO during Covid-19 vaccine negotiations. The court rejected the commission's argument that text messages are inherently short-lived and lack important information, highlighting the need for transparency in major public health decisions. The New York Times, which brought the case, hailed the ruling as a victory for accountability, while the commission stated it would issue a more detailed explanation, but the ruling raises questions about the preservation and accessibility of communications in the digital age.</p>
