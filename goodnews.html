        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's government has introduced a one-year initiative to subsidize interest on personal consumer loans, aiming to boost household spending and support the economy. The plan, effective from September, will cover one percentage point of annual interest on loans for purchases like cars and education. This measure is part of a wider government strategy to unlock domestic demand, which also includes a significant allocation for a consumer goods trade-in program. Authorities will evaluate the program's effectiveness after a year to decide on a potential extension.</p>

In his first at-bat as a visiting player, Bregman hit a two-run home run, receiving a mix of cheers and boos from the crowd throughout the game. He became the first player in over 60 years to homer in his first road plate appearance against a former team with whom he won multiple championships.

          <p>AI search startup Perplexity has made a surprising $34.5 billion bid to purchase the Google Chrome browser, a figure significantly higher than its own valuation. The move comes after a U.S. court ruled that Google holds an illegal monopoly in internet search, with the Department of Justice proposing the divestment of Chrome as a remedy. Perplexity, known for its conversational AI search engine, stated that several investors have agreed to back the ambitious deal. Google has not yet commented on the unsolicited offer.</p>

          <p>The UK's driving theory test will incorporate questions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the use of defibrillators starting in early 2026. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) hopes the change will equip the 2.4 million annual test-takers with life-saving knowledge, as drivers are often the first to arrive at accident scenes. Learning materials have already been updated with information on how to perform CPR and use a public access defibrillator, which can increase cardiac arrest survival rates to as high as 70%.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has declared the water safe to drink for residents in Granada Hills and Porter Ranch, ending a weeklong advisory. The issue began when a faulty, 57-year-old valve disrupted water flow to approximately 9,200 households. After complex repairs, service was restored, but a boil water notice remained in place until testing confirmed its safety. The DWP is now advising residents to thoroughly flush their pipes and appliances and will issue a $20 credit to affected customers for the inconvenience.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has formally admitted that France employed "repressive violence" in Cameroon during the 1950s as the nation fought for independence. In a letter to his Cameroonian counterpart, Macron accepted France's responsibility for actions that cost "tens of thousands of lives," including the killing of independence leaders. The acknowledgment follows a 2022 report commissioned by France that detailed mass displacements and support for brutal militias by French colonial forces, which continued even after Cameroon's independence in 1960.</p>

          <p>A report from the UK's Transport Committee has recommended piloting a free bus pass scheme for everyone under 22 in England to improve access to work and education. The report highlights that declining bus services and fares rising faster than inflation have become a significant barrier to opportunity, particularly in rural areas. A similar program is already in place in Scotland. MPs argue that unreliable and expensive public transport restricts young people's prospects and contributes to social exclusion for various vulnerable groups.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Rolls-Royce, the engineering giant, has claimed the company has the potential to become the UK's most valuable by powering the energy-intensive AI industry. The firm has signed deals to provide small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) to power data centers in the UK and the Czech Republic. While SMRs are still an unproven technology on land, the company is leveraging its extensive experience building nuclear reactors for submarines. The CEO's ambitious vision has contributed to a ten-fold increase in the company's share price since 2023.</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Advises Investors to 'Stay the Course' Amid Market Volatility and Political Events</h2>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer urged investors to remain invested in the stock market despite geopolitical turmoil and seemingly disruptive political actions. He argued that investors who sell in response to negative headlines often miss subsequent rallies, as problems are typically resolved after stocks have already recovered. Citing recent market gains despite concerns over tariffs and White House decisions, Cramer suggested that company profitability remains strong and that corporations have adapted to the political environment, continuing to deliver returns for shareholders.
