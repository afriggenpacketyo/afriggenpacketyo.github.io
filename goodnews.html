          <p>A London court has thrown out the terrorism case against Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, a member of the Irish rap group Kneecap known as Mo Chara. He was charged with displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah, a proscribed organization in the UK, during a concert. The chief magistrate ruled the charge was "unlawful" because the necessary consent from the Director of Public Prosecutions was not obtained within the six-month statutory time limit. Following the ruling, Ó hAnnaidh stated the case was an attempt to silence advocacy for Gaza.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill, the Faith in Housing Act, has been introduced in the U.S. Congress to help address the affordable housing crisis by allowing religious institutions to build homes on their land. The legislation would override restrictive local zoning laws that often prevent churches, synagogues, and mosques from developing their property for residential use. This "Yes in God's Backyard" (YIGBY) movement seeks to create a win-win situation, providing low-income housing while generating revenue for faith organizations facing declining membership. The bill follows similar state-level efforts, most notably in California.</p>

          <p>As autumn begins, health officials are warning of a potential rise in both flu and COVID-19 cases, creating confusion due to their overlapping symptoms. While the flu often presents suddenly with fever, aches, and exhaustion, COVID-19 symptoms have evolved and can now mimic a common cold, though a hoarse throat has become a hallmark of recent variants. Both viruses can cause serious illness, especially in vulnerable populations. Officials urge eligible individuals, including those over 65 and with underlying health conditions, to receive both the flu and COVID-19 vaccines to reduce the risk of severe outcomes.</p>

          <p>A submersible expedition in Germany's Luebeck Bay has discovered that unexploded Nazi-era bombs on the seafloor are teeming with marine life. Scientists were stunned to find dense populations of organisms, including about 40,000 marine worms per square meter, living on the munitions. The hard surfaces of the bombs, including V-1 cruise missiles, have become artificial reefs, attracting crabs, sea anemones, and even starfish, which were observed directly on exposed TNT. This remarkable discovery highlights nature's ability to adapt and utilize human remnants, turning instruments of death into vibrant habitats.</p>

          <p>An Interpol-coordinated operation targeting cybercrime networks across Africa has resulted in the arrest of 260 suspected scammers. The sting, funded by the UK, focused on criminals using digital platforms for romance scams and "sextortion," where victims are blackmailed with explicit images. The operation identified over 1,400 victims who collectively lost nearly $2.8 million. Authorities in countries like Ghana, Senegal, and Ivory Coast seized numerous devices and dismantled 81 cyber-crime groups, highlighting a sharp rise in such digital-enabled crimes on the continent.</p>

          <p>New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani is championing a proposal to create a network of city-owned grocery stores aimed at providing low-cost food by operating without profit motives or rent expenses. While the idea has found support among many likely voters, it has drawn sharp criticism from business leaders, including supermarket CEO John Catsimatidis, who call it unrealistic. The concept of municipal grocery stores has a mixed record in the U.S., with some small towns finding success out of necessity while others have failed due to financial losses.</p>

          <p>While some travelers seek new adventures, many find comfort and deeper connection by returning to the same vacation destinations repeatedly. Psychologists note that revisiting a place allows for a more profound cultural experience and the creation of meaningful memories, as both the traveler and the location evolve over time. Southern California residents shared their prized repeat destinations, from the cultural allure of London and the natural grandeur of Yosemite to the relaxing beaches of Jalisco, Mexico. These familiar locations offer a sense of tradition, comfort, and an opportunity to build lasting family memories.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's comments linking Tylenol to autism, medical experts and researchers are clarifying the science, emphasizing that the drug remains the safest option for treating fever in pregnant women. While some studies suggest an association between frequent acetaminophen use and neurodevelopmental disorders, a causal link has not been established, and the risk from a few doses for a fever is considered low. Physicians stress that untreated high fevers pose significant, proven risks to a fetus, including birth defects. The consensus recommendation is for judicious use at the lowest effective dose under a doctor's guidance.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, retired Admiral Bill McRaven, who oversaw the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden, expressed concern over whether the U.S. is maintaining its historical role as a global "good guy." He emphasized that the American military's allegiance is to the Constitution, not to any political figure, and that service members are obligated to follow lawful orders but not illegal ones. McRaven reflected on the nation's growing political polarization and the military's apolitical stance, suggesting that the country needs a unifying leader who will govern for all Americans, not just a political base.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto is currently forecast to remain at sea, but meteorologists are monitoring its potential interaction with another nearby developing storm in the Atlantic. If the two systems get close enough, they could engage in a rare phenomenon known as the Fujiwhara effect, where two storms orbit a common center. Typically, a stronger storm absorbs a weaker one, but two storms of comparable strength can "dance" around each other before separating. While this interaction is considered unlikely, it could slightly alter the storms' predicted tracks as they move through the region.</p>

This will be the first NFL regular-season game held in the city, taking place at the historic Croke Park.

          <p>Pop Mart, the Chinese company behind the viral Labubu monster toys, has stated it is pleased with the recent cooling of the toy's secondary market prices. After seeing resale markups exceed 2,000% and even prompting a robbery, the company increased production tenfold to meet demand and make the products more accessible to genuine fans rather than scalpers. Analysts note that while the resale bubble boosted the brand's popularity, a more stable market is healthier for long-term growth. The company's focus is now on sustainable expansion and developing its characters through other media. (not investment advice)</p>
