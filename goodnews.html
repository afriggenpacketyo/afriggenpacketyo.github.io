          <p>Lowe's has reaffirmed its full-year financial outlook, citing increased sales to home professionals as a buffer against weaker demand from do-it-yourself customers, despite narrowly missing quarterly sales expectations but surpassing earnings estimates. CEO Marvin Ellison credited investments in stores, technology, and customer service for navigating housing market challenges. Sales to home professionals saw mid-single-digit growth, attributed to Lowe's strategic investments since 2018, including expanding merchandise and a pro loyalty program. The company anticipates full-year sales between $83.5 billion and $84.5 billion, with comparable sales projected to be flat to up 1% year over year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corporation announced that the redesigned 2026 Toyota RAV4 SUV will be offered exclusively as a hybrid or plug-in hybrid, marking the first time the model will eliminate the traditional gas engine. This decision is driven by growing customer demand for hybrid vehicles, which accounted for roughly half of RAV4 sales last year. David Christ, head of the Toyota brand in North America, noted that the hybrid model has faster turnover and more sales orders. The all-hybrid RAV4 lineup is part of a next-generation redesign that includes interior and exterior changes, along with upgrades to the vehicle's performance and technologies.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's recent trip to the Middle East resulted in significant artificial intelligence (AI) investment deals between US tech firms and Saudi Arabia and the UAE. These deals, involving companies like Nvidia and OpenAI, aim to bolster AI development in the Gulf states. However, critics worry that providing advanced chips to these countries could indirectly benefit China in the global AI race. The Trump administration had previously scrapped rules that restricted the sale of AI-capable chips to certain Middle Eastern countries, leading to concerns that these chips could find their way to China.</p>

Hari, who gained a following for her food activism and public shaming of companies using ingredients she deems toxic, now finds herself at the center of the administration's efforts to promote healthier eating. While her rise has thrilled supporters, it has also drawn criticism from food industry executives and scientists who question her methods and scientific accuracy. This transformation has sparked debate, with some questioning whether liberals can support her mission and whether MAGA loyalists can trust a former Obama supporter.</p>

          <p>A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report indicates that five-day in-office mandates are outdated, citing benefits of telework like improved talent acquisition, cost savings, and productivity gains. The report highlights that flexible work arrangements attract and retain talent, reduce costs through smaller office footprints, and boost productivity by eliminating commutes. However, it also acknowledges challenges in building workplace culture in distributed teams, suggesting solutions such as virtual meetings and mentorship programs.
