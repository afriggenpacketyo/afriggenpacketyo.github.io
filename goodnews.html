          <p>The Women's Super League (WSL) will expand from 12 to 14 teams starting in the 2026-27 season. The Football Association (FA) is expected to formally approve the changes, which will include adjustments to the promotion and relegation system between the WSL and WSL 2. Currently, only the WSL 2 winners earn promotion, but the expansion will introduce a play-off between the second-bottom WSL team and the WSL 2 runners-up. All clubs must meet the license criteria to play in the WSL 2 and the WSL, and the FA will decide on the next steps for the lower tiers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has declined to hear a copyright lawsuit alleging Ed Sheeran's "Thinking Out Loud" infringed on Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On," effectively ending the legal battle in Sheeran's favor. Structured Asset Sales (SAS), which owns a portion of the rights to Gaye's song, argued that Sheeran copied the melody, harmony, and rhythm. A lower court previously dismissed the case, finding the musical elements in question too common to warrant copyright protection. This decision follows Sheeran's victory in a separate copyright lawsuit over the same song, marking a significant legal win for the artist.</p>

          <p>As potential Federal Reserve rate cuts loom, experts are weighing in on the most beneficial certificate of deposit (CD) terms for savers. Short-term CDs are currently offering the highest interest rates, making them attractive for maximizing returns. Long-term CDs provide security and predictability, but may have lower rates relative to short-term options. A CD ladder, which involves opening multiple CD accounts with varying terms, offers a balance of high rates and flexibility. Savers should research and compare rates from different banks and credit unions before opening a CD account. (not investment advice)</p>
