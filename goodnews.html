          <p>Thousands of viewers tuned in for a rare live-streamed dive to the bottom of Lake Tahoe, one of the deepest lakes in the United States. A remotely operated vehicle (ROV) named Emmy descended over 1,500 feet, offering a unique glimpse into the lake's ancient and delicate ecosystem, which is estimated to be 2 to 3 million years old. The event, sponsored by environmental non-profits, aimed to raise awareness about the challenges facing the lake, including pollution and invasive species. Experts on the stream discussed the lake's geological history and debunked urban legends about mob bodies, emphasizing conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden is moving forward with plans to establish his presidential library in Delaware, his home state and the base of his political career. A newly formed 13-person governance board, including prominent allies like former Secretary of State Antony Blinken, has been tasked with fundraising and site selection for the project. The foundation faces the challenge of raising significant funds in a politically divided climate, with the total cost expected to be substantial, following the trend of increasingly expensive presidential libraries. The library aims to be a hub for leadership and civic engagement, documenting his four years in office.</p>

          <p>Following the sudden departure of executive chairman Daniel Levy, Tottenham Hotspur is set to be led by new chief executive Vinai Venkatesham, who previously held the same role at rival club Arsenal. Venkatesham is known for his inclusive and understated leadership style, in contrast to Levy's reputation as a fierce negotiator. During his time at Arsenal, he was instrumental in appointing manager Mikel Arteta, championed the women's team, and guided the club through the financial uncertainties of the pandemic. His move across North London signals a significant cultural shift for Tottenham's boardroom and future strategy.</p>

          <p>A Massachusetts family is sharing their story after their son, Jonny, was diagnosed with malignant rhabdoid tumor, a rare and aggressive cancer, just after his first birthday. His mother's persistence about his frequent infections led to the discovery of a large tumor on his liver. Despite a grim prognosis, Jonny responded well to a complex and individualized treatment plan involving chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation at Massachusetts General Hospital for Children. Now over two years old and in remission, Jonny is under careful surveillance, and his family is adjusting to their new normal after a traumatic year.</p>

          <h2>China Reports Successful Test of AI-Powered Radar System Resistant to Jamming</h2>

          <p>Chinese researchers claim to have successfully tested a new AI-powered radar system that is nearly impossible to jam, potentially signaling a major shift in electronic warfare capabilities. In a landmark test flight, the AI-enhanced system maintained a target tracking continuity of over 99%, whereas conventional radar systems lost the target for approximately a quarter of the engagement time under jamming conditions. The project's lead scientist stated that the technology represents a "paradigm shift in radar design philosophy." The development comes from China's premier military radar research institute, based in Nanjing.</p>

          <p>Medical experts are optimistic about recent progress in the fight against dementia, citing advances in early detection, treatment, and prevention strategies. The recent FDA approval of a diagnostic blood test for Alzheimer's offers a simpler method for early identification, while new drugs can help manage symptoms of mild cognitive impairment. Furthermore, a major study called U.S. POINTER has provided strong evidence that lifestyle interventions, including physical activity, a healthy diet, and social engagement, can significantly improve cognitive function in at-risk individuals. Upcoming conferences aim to educate the public on these promising developments.</p>

          <p>A top Chinese space researcher has revealed that the country is designing a planetary defense mission to test its ability to deflect a potentially hazardous asteroid. The mission, which could launch as early as this year, would involve sending an impactor spacecraft to collide with a small asteroid millions of kilometers from Earth. The goal is to alter the asteroid's orbit by a few centimeters, demonstrating the viability of a "kinetic impact" defense strategy. If successful, China would become only the second nation, after the United States, to have demonstrated this critical capability for protecting the planet.</p>

          <p>With gold prices reaching new records, investors are increasingly looking to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset amid economic uncertainty and expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut. Financial experts suggest that the most efficient way for most people to gain exposure is through gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) rather than owning physical bullion, due to lower costs and higher liquidity. They generally recommend limiting gold to a small portion of a well-diversified portfolio, typically under 3%, to mitigate risks associated with commodity price volatility.

          <p>Ten years after its Broadway debut, the cultural impact of the musical "Hamilton" is being re-examined as a filmed version hits movie theaters for the first time. An academic suggests the show's legacy is intertwined with the political era in which it emerged, with its hopeful first act mirroring the optimism of the Obama administration. In the context of a second Trump term, the show's more tragic second act, which deals with political polarization and collapse, feels more resonant. The article explores how critiques of the show's historical accuracy and its once-celebrated progressive message have become more widespread over time.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, is set to be canonized as the first Millennial saint. Known for his piety and his use of the internet to spread his faith, Acutis has been embraced by the Catholic Church as a modern role model for young people. He famously created a website cataloging Eucharistic miracles and has been dubbed a "computer genius" by the Vatican. His story presents a unique blend of contemporary youth culture, symbolized by his burial in jeans and Nikes, and deep, traditional faith, appealing to different factions within the Church.</p>

          <p>Following an April report on the dire situation in Zambia where HIV patients were losing access to medication due to U.S. foreign aid cuts, there has been a significant local response. The Zambian government, initially in denial, investigated the claims and has since partnered with community leaders like Pastor Billiance Chondwe to help affected individuals. A new agreement ensures patients from now-closed clinics can register at government facilities to receive their life-saving drugs for free. While access to medication has improved, challenges remain, as many have lost food support and jobs tied to the U.S.-funded programs.</p>

          <p>The Harlem Hellfighters, the celebrated all-Black 369th Infantry Regiment that served with distinction in World War I, have been posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. The honor recognizes the soldiers' bravery and sacrifice on the battlefields of France, where they fought alongside the French army due to segregation in the U.S. military. The ceremony comes amid a national debate over how American history is taught and remembered, with some historians noting the irony of the Trump administration honoring these soldiers while simultaneously seeking to promote a narrative of "American exceptionalism" and remove what it deems divisive historical accounts.</p>
