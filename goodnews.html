          <p>Nearly 4,000 individuals have filed the largest environmental pollution lawsuit in UK history against poultry producers Avara Foods and Freemans of Newent, as well as the water company Welsh Water. The claimants allege that pollution from chicken manure and sewage has severely damaged the ecosystems of the Wye, Lugg, and Usk rivers. They are seeking substantial damages and a court order for a comprehensive clean-up of the affected waterways. The companies involved deny the claims, citing their own investments in environmental protection and attributing pollution to other sectors.</p>

          <p>Approximately 900 people, including 580 hikers and over 300 guides and staff, have been safely rescued after being stranded by a severe weekend snowstorm on the Chinese side of Mount Everest. The storm trapped the group in tents at an altitude exceeding 16,000 feet, cutting off access. Rescue teams provided food, medicine, and oxygen to those affected, some of whom suffered from hypothermia. The successful rescue operation concluded by Tuesday, though the scenic area has been temporarily closed to ensure safety.</p>

          <p>The New York Yankees secured a dramatic 9-6 victory against the Toronto Blue Jays in a must-win Game 3 of the ALDS, marking the largest comeback win in an elimination game in the franchise's history. After falling behind 6-1, the Yankees' offense ignited, highlighted by a game-tying three-run home run from Aaron Judge in the fourth inning. The team scored eight unanswered runs, with subsequent contributions from Jazz Chisholm Jr. and Austin Wells, while the bullpen successfully shut down the Blue Jays to keep their postseason hopes alive.</p>

          <p>American immunologist Dr. Fred Ramsdell discovered he had won the Nobel Prize for medicine while on a remote, off-grid hiking trip in Montana. The Nobel committee was unable to reach him, and he only learned of the prestigious award when his wife received a flood of text messages upon briefly regaining cell service. Dr. Ramsdell, who won for his research on the immune system, was successfully contacted by the committee nearly 20 hours after their initial attempts. The incident adds to a history of laureates learning about their wins in unconventional and sometimes comical ways.</p>

          <h2>New Blood Type Conversion Technique May Expand Kidney Transplant Access</h2>

          <p>Researchers have developed a new method to convert the blood type of donor kidneys, a breakthrough that could significantly increase the availability of organs for transplantation and reduce waiting times. In a recent study, a kidney converted using this enzyme-based technique was successfully transplanted into a recipient and functioned for two days without signs of hyperacute rejection. The scientific team highlighted that this approach could help address the critical shortage of donated organs and improve equality in organ allocation. This innovation offers a more immediate solution compared to engineered animal organs, which remain many years from widespread clinical use.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers Designate Roki Sasaki as Primary Closing Pitcher After Near-Collapse in Game 2</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a tense ninth inning in Game 2 of the NLDS, Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts has confirmed that rookie Roki Sasaki is now the team's primary option for save situations. Roberts had initially tried to rest Sasaki, using veteran Blake Treinen to protect a three-run lead, but Treinen allowed two runs without recording an out. Sasaki was ultimately brought in to secure the final out and preserve the win. The team remains cautious about overusing the 23-year-old, who has never before pitched in a relief role, and will carefully manage his workload throughout the postseason.</p>

          <p>Matt Van Epps has won the Republican primary in a special election for a U.S. House seat in Tennessee, securing the victory after a late endorsement from former President Donald Trump. Van Epps, a former state official and military veteran, will now face Democratic nominee Aftyn Behn in the December general election. The race is for the seat vacated by former Rep. Mark Green and is being watched as a potential gauge of Trump's influence, particularly with suburban voters. The 7th Congressional District is considered a safely Republican seat, having been redrawn to favor the GOP.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed former football player and Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker as the next ambassador to the Bahamas. Nominated by President Trump, Walker's confirmation fills a diplomatic post that has been vacant for over a decade. Walker, a Heisman Trophy winner, was a prominent Trump ally during his unsuccessful 2022 Senate campaign. His confirmation was part of a large package of over 100 nominees approved by Senate Republicans using a procedural rule change that allows for en bloc voting, a move intended to expedite the confirmation process amid Democratic opposition.</p>

          <p>Shares of minerals explorer Trilogy Metals surged by over 200% after the White House announced it would take a 10% stake in the company through a $35.6 million investment. The partnership is part of a federal initiative to develop domestic sources of critical minerals like copper from the Ambler mining district in Alaska. This move reverses a Biden-era decision that had blocked the controversial Ambler Road project, which opponents argue will harm the environment. The investment signals a renewed federal focus on securing domestic supply chains for resources essential for defense and energy infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A rare interstellar comet, designated 3I/ATLAS, was recently photographed by two European Space Agency orbiters as it made a close approach to Mars. The images capture the comet, only the third of its kind ever confirmed in our solar system, as a faint but distinct object against the backdrop of space. Discovered in July, the comet poses no threat to Earth and will make its closest pass by the sun in late October. Scientists will continue to analyze the data from the Mars orbiters to learn more about this visitor from another star system.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, leader of the UK's Conservative Party, is set to announce a new economic "golden rule" aimed at cutting both government borrowing and taxes. Under the proposed plan, half of all savings achieved by a future Conservative government would be allocated to reducing the national deficit, while the other half would fund economy-growing policies, including tax cuts. In her upcoming conference speech, Badenoch will argue this demonstrates fiscal responsibility and contrasts with the Labour government's economic strategy. The policy signals a return to the deficit-reduction focus of past Conservative governments.</p>

          <p>Tesla has introduced new, lower-priced "Standard" versions of its Model Y and Model 3 vehicles in the United States, with starting prices of $39,990 and $36,990, respectively. The move is an attempt to attract more mass-market buyers and counter falling sales amid increased competition and the loss of a $7,500 federal tax credit. However, some analysts and investors expressed disappointment that the price reduction was not more significant, questioning whether it will be enough to unlock a new wave of demand. The new models feature slightly reduced premium features but still offer a driving range of over 300 miles.</p>
