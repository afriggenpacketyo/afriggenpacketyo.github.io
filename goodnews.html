          <p>The Daniel K. Inouye Telescope in Hawaii has achieved a milestone by capturing a detailed image of sunspots using its new Visible Tunable Filter (VTF). Scientists hope this powerful tool will enhance their ability to predict solar storms, which can disrupt Earth's radio communications and electrical grids. The National Solar Observatory (NSO) emphasized that the image was taken during technical testing, highlighting the VTF's potential. Researchers expressed optimism that the telescope will provide valuable insights into solar physics and help mitigate the damage caused by geomagnetic disturbances.</p>
