          <p>The Trump administration has acquired a 10% stake in chipmaker Intel, investing $8.9 billion primarily through CHIPS Act grants and secure chip program awards. This move, which saw Intel shares rise, represents a significant shift in U.S. industrial policy towards greater government involvement in the private sector. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick emphasized the government's right to an equity stake for its funds, while Intel stated the government would not have a board seat. This development follows a $2 billion investment from SoftBank and Intel's efforts to expand U.S. chip manufacturing despite project slowdowns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny is leveraging his immense global platform to educate audiences on the complex history of Puerto Rico through his latest album, "DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS," and a 30-concert residency. Collaborating with historian Jorell Meléndez-Badillo, the artist integrates narratives of colonialism, surveillance, and resistance into his visualizers and stage productions, blending modern Latin trap with traditional Caribbean sounds. This initiative aims to highlight the island's ongoing fiscal and political crises, including the impact of an unelected fiscal oversight board, to a global audience often only exposed to its tropical paradise image.</p>

          <h2>Arguments for Banning Student Cell Phones in Schools to Improve Focus and Social Development</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues strongly for banning student cell phones in schools, citing their detrimental effects on learning, increased social anxiety, and suppressed emotional and intellectual growth. The author, a former teacher and parent, highlights how phones distract students, condition them to constant online engagement, and hinder face-to-face interactions crucial for developing social acuity and resilience. With 31 U.S. states now requiring or recommending phone limits, and positive outcomes reported from bans in Australia, there's growing momentum for such policies. However, challenges remain in implementation, as some parents resist restrictions and school curricula increasingly integrate device use.</p>

          <h2>New Clinical Trial in South Africa Shows Promising Results Towards HIV Cure</h2>

          <p>A groundbreaking clinical trial in South Africa has yielded a rare and extraordinary outcome: one young woman, Anele, may be cured of HIV, offering significant hope for the continent most affected by the virus. The FRESH program, which facilitated early diagnosis and treatment, enrolled 20 women in the trial, using a "kick and kill" strategy with vesatolimod and broadly neutralizing antibodies. While 16 participants experienced viral rebound, four remained in remission, with Anele being HIV-free and off treatment for over two years. This milestone, conducted in Africa with a focus on its unique demographic and viral strains, is fueling optimism for future cure trials and new treatment possibilities.</p>

          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper announced an $18 billion acquisition of Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's, a move aimed at boosting its struggling U.S. coffee business. The deal, which offers a 33% premium to JDE Peet's shareholders, is expected to generate $400 million in cost synergies. Following the acquisition, Keurig Dr Pepper plans to split its beverage and coffee divisions into two separate, U.S.-listed companies, effectively unwinding its 2018 merger. This strategic restructuring seeks to enhance appeal to thrifty shoppers and expand into cold coffee offerings, with new leadership appointed for each prospective entity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jessica Knurick, a dietitian with a PhD, has gained significant traction on social media, particularly Instagram and TikTok, by debunking health misinformation from figures like U.S. Health Secretary Robert F.

Troubled by the rise of anti-science content, Knurick uses engaging videos to explain complex scientific concepts, aiming to reach those misled by fear-based narratives. She acknowledges valid concerns about chronic disease and system failures but challenges MAHA's misidentification of causes, advocating for evidence-based public health approaches over ideological ones.

Participants include Australia, Japan, France, and the UK, focusing on staff exercises, cyber defense, and live-fire events. While Washington denies the drills are aimed at Beijing, China has expressed concern, accusing the U.S. of attempting to create an "Asian NATO."

          <h2>Rethinking Tackle Football: Why Gender Disparities in Sports Safety Highlight Broader Issues for Boys</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article questions the societal double standard where flag football is promoted for girls due to safety concerns, while boys continue to play tackle football despite known health risks like CTE. The author, a scholar of gender and sports, argues that adapting sports rules for girls' "supposed physical limitations" is a historical pattern, but the health costs for boys in tackle football are often overlooked. The piece suggests that the public celebration of tackle football reinforces a self-destructive masculinity, disproportionately affecting working-class men of color. It calls for a re-evaluation of why boys play tackle football, proposing a shift towards flag football for all youth.</p>

          <p>GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic, already widely used for weight loss and diabetes, are showing promise in treating a range of conditions from cardiovascular disease to addiction and dementia. With more affordable and accessible versions on the horizon, the article explores the profound implications of these drugs' mysterious ability to control compulsions. While they offer significant health benefits, a major unanswered question remains: what are the long-term effects on human desire, joy, and the broader emotional experience? Scientists are researching whether these drugs suppress harmful cravings without compromising productive desires, but more evidence is needed to understand their full impact on our "wanting" versus "liking" mechanisms.</p>

          <h2>New Research Suggests Fish May Experience Pleasure and Actively Seek It Out</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to common perception, new research indicates that fish may experience pleasure and actively seek it, challenging the view of them as "simple-minded animals." Scientists studied bluestreak cleaner wrasse and threadfin butterflyfish, observing that butterflyfish preferred areas where they had been "cleaned" by wrasse, even without parasites. Experiments using opioid mimics and blockers suggested that the fish's opioid system mediates this pleasurable sensation. The findings differentiate between "liking" and "wanting," proposing that the desire for pleasure might be governed by dopamine. This research could lead to a rethinking of fish treatment in aquariums and aquaculture, highlighting their complex emotional states.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are grappling with an identity crisis, displaying inconsistent performance despite a recent dominant victory over the Padres. Plagued by numerous injuries, the team has cycled through various challenges, from starting pitching to bullpen reliability and now offensive inconsistency. With 31 games left, the return of injured players is crucial for their postseason prospects, as winning their division could secure a first-round bye, while failing to do so would lead to a dangerous wild-card series. The team's ability to maintain focus and improve its offense will determine its fate in October.</p>
