        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cash App has introduced "Pools," a new peer-to-peer feature allowing users to create shared balances for group payments, now accepting contributions via Apple Pay and Google Pay. This marks the first time Cash App has opened to out-of-network payments, aiming to expand its user base and improve P2P virality. The move comes as Cash App seeks to regain momentum against competitors like Venmo, which has seen strong growth. This strategic reset aligns with CEO Jack Dorsey's focus on reinvesting in core P2P features for network expansion rather than immediate profit maximization.</p>

          <p>As college costs continue to rise, private student loans often fill the financial gap after federal aid and scholarships. This article highlights top private lenders, categorizing them by features like flexible repayment (College Ave), specialized loans (Sallie Mae), no-cosigner options (Ascent), and international student support (MPOWER Financing). It emphasizes comparing interest rates, cosigner rules, and repayment plans to find the best fit. Borrowers are advised to exhaust federal loan options first due to their generally more favorable terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Candy and snacks giant Mars Inc. plans to invest an additional $2 billion in its U.S. operations through 2026, building on over $6 billion invested in the last five years. This funding will support a new $240 million Nature's Bakery facility in Salt Lake City, Utah, set to open soon and create over 230 jobs. The move bolsters Mars' U.S. production capabilities, with about 94% of its U.S.-sold products already manufactured locally. This expansion aligns with a broader trend of companies increasing domestic production amidst tariff policies.</p>
