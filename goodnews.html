          <p>Historians Jill Lepore and Jeffrey Rosen discuss the U.S. Constitution as a living document, originally designed by its framers to be continually amended and adapted by the people. The article notes that while the Constitution has been changed through amendments like the Bill of Rights and those abolishing slavery, it has not seen a meaningful update in over 50 years. Rosen expresses concern that modern political gridlock, where Congress abdicates its role and courts hold excessive power, is contrary to the founders' intent. Despite current strains, he argues the document's core principles of limited government and rule of law remain timeless and essential for preventing tyranny.</p>

          <h2>Wealthy Retirees May Face an Unexpected Social Security Tax Increase</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 09:11:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A "Social Security tax trap" can catch affluent retirees by surprise, significantly increasing their tax burden due to required minimum distributions (RMDs) from tax-deferred retirement accounts like traditional IRAs. These mandatory withdrawals, which begin at age 73, increase a retiree's combined income, potentially pushing them over the threshold where Social Security benefits become taxable. This can cause a sudden jump from paying no tax on benefits to paying tax on up to 85% of them, and may also trigger higher Medicare premiums. One strategy to mitigate this is to gradually convert traditional IRA funds into a Roth IRA. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy revealed that the European Ryder Cup team is using a novel training method to prepare for the potentially hostile crowd at the upcoming event at Bethpage in New York. Captain Luke Donald has supplied players with virtual reality headsets that simulate the sights, sounds, and even verbal abuse they might face from American fans. McIlroy noted that players could customize the intensity of the simulated heckling to "go as close to the bone as you like." This unconventional approach is part of the team's detailed preparation as they aim to win on U.S. soil for the first time since 2012.</p>

          <p>With the 2025 WNBA playoffs set to begin, sports analysts are weighing in on the key matchups and potential outcomes. A major topic of discussion is the Minnesota Lynx, who are seen as being on a "revenge tour" after a controversial loss in the 2024 finals and are a popular pick to win the championship. Experts also consider which high-seeded teams, like the Phoenix Mercury or Las Vegas Aces, might be at risk for an early exit. The predictions highlight key players to watch, such as MVP candidates A'ja Wilson and Napheesa Collier, whose performances will be critical to their teams' success.</p>

          <h2>Wall Street Analysts Highlight Three Tech Stocks with Long-Term Growth Potential</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 08:35:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Top-performing Wall Street analysts are recommending three technology stocks—Broadcom (AVGO), Zscaler (ZS), and Oracle (ORCL)—as strong long-term investments, largely driven by the artificial intelligence boom. Broadcom is favored due to its accelerating AI-related revenue and a new $10 billion customer, believed to be OpenAI. Cybersecurity firm Zscaler is seeing high demand for its AI security and Zero Trust solutions, leading to strong growth projections. Oracle's stock surged after it reported massive growth in its contracted cloud revenue, reinforcing confidence in its ability to capture a significant share of the AI infrastructure market.

          <p>This archival report from "48 Hours" revisits the complex and highly publicized case of Amanda Knox, the American exchange student accused of murdering her British roommate, Meredith Kercher, in Perugia, Italy, in 2007. The article details the initial investigation, Knox's controversial 14-hour interrogation that led to a coerced-seeming confession, and the media frenzy that branded her "Foxy Knoxy." It explores the evidence presented by Italian police, including disputed DNA on a knife, and the counter-arguments from investigators who believed the evidence pointed solely to another suspect. Knox and her then-boyfriend were ultimately exonerated after spending nearly four years in prison.</p>

          <h2>Political Analysts Suggest UK's Labour Party Could Learn from Zohran Mamdani's Success in New York</h2>

          <p>As UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party sees its popularity decline, some political observers are looking to Zohran Mamdani's successful New York mayoral primary campaign for lessons. Mamdani, a progressive Democrat, has gained significant traction with a laser-sharp focus on economic issues like housing affordability and free public transit. Analysts suggest his success stems from championing clear, compelling policies that connect to a broader narrative of siding with working-class people against the establishment. This contrasts with Labour's shifting priorities and perceived lack of a strong, overarching story, leaving it vulnerable to right-wing populists.</p>

          <p>In a remarkable display of courage, a team of Ukrainian doctors in Kyiv successfully performed a heart transplant on a 12-year-old girl, Kira Skliarova, during a heavy Russian missile and drone attack. Dr. Borys Todurov and his team drove through the bombarded city to retrieve the donor heart from a 4-year-old who had died in an accident. They then conducted the life-saving surgery at the Kyiv Heart Institute as explosions shook the building. Kira, whose own heart was severely weakened by illness, is now recovering well, offering a powerful story of hope and resilience amid the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>A proposal by Florida's Surgeon General, Joseph Ladapo, to eliminate all vaccine mandates in the state appears to be faltering after facing widespread criticism, including from President Donald Trump. Ladapo had announced a plan to end requirements for all vaccinations, but Trump publicly defended the efficacy and importance of vaccines for diseases like measles. Following the backlash, the state's health department clarified it would only propose rule changes for immunizations not mandated by legislation for school entry. The future of the broader rollback is now uncertain, as it would require the support of state lawmakers.</p>

          <p>This article addresses the potential danger of door-to-door scams, prompted by a reader's unsettling encounter with an aggressive person offering lawn-mowing services. It advises that while not all door-to-door salespeople are fraudulent, high-pressure tactics, refusal to take no for an answer, and demands for upfront cash payment are major red flags. Common scams involve home repair, utility services, or security system upgrades, often targeting older adults. To stay safe, experts recommend not opening the door to strangers, verifying credentials independently, and always getting a written contract before agreeing to any work or payment.</p>
