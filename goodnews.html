          <h2>Chinese Exports Shift to Southeast Asia Amid US Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 02:59:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese exports to Southeast Asian industrial centers have increased significantly due to pressure from U.S. tariffs. Shipments to Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia have risen by double-digit percentages in the first five months of the year. This shift allows Chinese manufacturers to circumvent U.S. tariffs by shipping goods to Southeast Asia for final assembly and re-export, either for local sale or to Western countries. Factories in Thailand and Vietnam, some invested in by China, produce various items for re-export, such as cars and smartphones, contributing to closer economic and investment relations between China and Southeast Asia.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to curb elevated prices of the staple food. The released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, expected to be sold at 1,700 yen ($12) per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, following previous releases through auctions. The government aims to quickly deliver the stockpiled rice to consumers at lower prices, addressing public frustration over soaring rice prices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have significantly decreased, particularly among Gen Z, with a 47% reduction in fatal overdose risk. This decline is attributed to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, weaker fentanyl potency, increased addiction healthcare access, and more cautious drug use among teens. A study found deaths attributed entirely to fentanyl nearly quadrupled among people aged 15 to 24 from 2018 through 2022, but recent data reveals a 40% drop in fatal overdoses among teens. Despite progress, experts warn that the most at-risk individuals still struggle with addiction, and potential funding cuts could reverse the positive trend.</p>
