          <p>Archer Aviation's stock experienced a 15% decline following the announcement of an $850 million share sale intended to support the company's infrastructure development and AI-based aviation software platform. The funding will also support Archer's Launch Edition program, including its partnership to provide air taxi services during the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. This stock offering follows President Donald Trump's executive order to support the development of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles in the U.S., which had previously boosted Archer's stock. Archer is preparing to showcase its Midnight eVTOL aircraft at the Paris Air Show, with the United Arab Emirates as its first launch market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon is restructuring its health-care business into six new units under Amazon Health Services, aiming for a simpler and more efficient organizational structure after several senior health leaders recently departed.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the growing popularity of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services, particularly among young people and those with limited credit history, and the regulatory landscape surrounding these services. It examines concerns about financing everyday purchases like groceries and the role of BNPL in supporting the "millennial lifestyle subsidy," where tech companies once offered cheaper and more convenient services. The article also discusses the potential risks to consumers, including the possibility of debt and the impact on credit scores, and the shifting regulatory environment under the Trump administration. The rise of BNPL reflects broader economic trends and the challenges of affording increasingly expensive conveniences.</p>

          <p>Melissa Febos's new memoir, *The Dry Season*, explores the benefits of voluntary celibacy and the act of refusal, arguing that saying no to one thing can open the door to unexpected bounty and new experiences. Febos also wrote an essay for *The Atlantic* recommending six books that celebrate refusal and abstinence, highlighting how these acts can lead to unforeseen delights. The author explains that taking a break from sex and dating allowed her to widen her aperture and notice things that had previously escaped her attention. The book suggests that spirituality can be found in smaller phenomena and stiller moments, emphasizing the importance of marshaling one's attention to the world around us.</p>
