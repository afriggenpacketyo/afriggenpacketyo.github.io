          <p>This article explains credit card debt forgiveness options, noting that there are no government-sponsored programs for eliminating credit card debt. It discusses debt settlement programs, where a debt relief expert creates a payment plan and negotiates with creditors to reduce the principal balance. Bankruptcy is presented as a last resort, potentially forgiving 100% of the debt but harming credit scores. The article also mentions debt consolidation loans and debt management programs as alternative options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Belgian parliament voted to scrap the country's planned nuclear phaseout, which was initially adopted over two decades ago. The motion passed with a significant majority, signaling a shift towards a more realistic and resilient energy model. This decision follows a previous delay of the phaseout by 10 years due to energy uncertainty caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The reversal reflects a broader trend in Europe, with countries like the Netherlands and Sweden planning to build new nuclear plants, as Belgium aims to secure its energy future.</p>

          <p>CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator defended the company's significant capital expenditure plans, stating they are driven by strong demand signals from major hyperscalers for faster infrastructure deployment.

Some investors raised concerns about the company's debt and the sustainability of demand for its AI servers. Intrator reassured that financing remains strong and the company can repay lenders within the terms of the contracts, backed by its growing list of major technology clients.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump's decision to lift sanctions on Syria could stabilize the war-torn country, but many details remain unknown. The end of US sanctions could mean economic relief, reconstruction and the return of many Syrian refugees from abroad. The EU has lifted some sanctions on Syria but others remain in place, and Kaja Kallas, the bloc's foreign policy chief, proposed a further loosening of sanctions on Syria. Along with lifting sanctions, Trump also urged Syria to do five things, including signing onto the Abraham Accords with Israel and deporting Palestinian terrorists.</p>

These include Medicare supplemental insurance to cover costs not fully covered by traditional Medicare, long-term care insurance for nursing homes and in-home caretakers, and whole life insurance for borrowing cash and leaving money to beneficiaries. The article emphasizes that coverage is generally more robust and less expensive the sooner one applies, so seniors should research their options and start compiling policy quotes sooner rather than later.

          <p>A new genetics study has traced prehistoric human migration from Asia to North and South America, revealing insights into the origins of Indigenous groups. The study found that the first people to colonize the Americas migrated from modern-day Russia approximately 20,000-30,000 years ago. Researchers sequenced the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas, comparing them with ancient DNA to study patterns of population history, migration, and adaptation over thousands of years. The findings corroborate existing archeological evidence and provide a new understanding of South American communities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explains the complexities of using credit cards after settling debt, noting that the settled account is likely closed. Issuers view settling debt as a sign of repayment inability, raising concerns about future lending risk. While settled debt remains on credit reports for seven years, individuals can rebuild credit by monitoring reports, starting with secured cards, and becoming authorized users. Consistent on-time payments and low balances are crucial for improving credit scores, but it's advised to wait before applying for new cards to allow credit profiles to stabilize.

Investors were also disappointed by the lack of planned share buybacks for the remainder of the year, as management prioritizes debt reduction. The company needs to clear the air on the Harkey incident and deliver a quick resolution, as the market tends to punish exploration and production firms when there are doubts about the quality of their inventory.
