          <p>IBM announced its roadmap for developing a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer named Quantum Starling, with the new IBM Quantum Nighthawk processor slated for release later this year. The company aims to create a device capable of running larger, deeper circuits with hundreds of millions of gates operating on hundreds of qubits, while also correcting errors and preventing their spread throughout the system. This announcement follows recent advancements in quantum computing by Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. IBM's focus on fault tolerance underscores the growing importance of error correction in the pursuit of practical quantum computing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article compares debt forgiveness (debt settlement) and debt consolidation as strategies for managing high credit card debt. Debt consolidation combines multiple debts into a single loan with a potentially lower interest rate, while debt forgiveness involves negotiating with creditors to accept less than the full amount owed. The article includes a cost comparison showing potential savings for each strategy, but notes that debt forgiveness can significantly damage your credit score. The article concludes that the best option depends on individual circumstances, with debt consolidation being preferable for those who can qualify and manage payments, while debt forgiveness may be a last resort for unmanageable debt (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has denied that political pressure led to his government's reversal on winter fuel payments, attributing the change to an improved economy.

Critics argue that the economy has not improved significantly and question how the government will fund the change, estimated to cost around ¬£1.25 billion.
