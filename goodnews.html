          <h2>Japanese Survey Reveals Strong Support for Regulating Election Social Media</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 23:36:00 EDT</div>

          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey indicates that a majority of Japanese citizens, approximately 58%, believe that social media platforms should be legally regulated during elections to combat the spread of unverified information. The survey highlights growing concerns over partisan online posts influencing election outcomes, citing a recent gubernatorial election where accusations of abuse of power were dismissed through online campaigns. While some respondents feel social media operators should self-regulate, the overall sentiment leans toward legislative intervention, particularly as Japan has already enacted laws aimed at removing defamatory content online, though its effectiveness remains limited. The survey also touched on constitutional matters, revealing divided opinions on revising Article 9, which renounces war, and broad support for allowing married couples to keep separate surnames.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled against President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie, deeming it unconstitutional and an attack on the American legal system. Judge Beryl Howell's ruling permanently blocks the order, which imposed punitive measures on Perkins Coie for representing clients and causes disliked by Trump. The judge framed the targeting of Perkins Coie as an attack on the independence of the legal profession and the judicial system. The ruling underscores the importance of protecting lawyers' ability to represent clients without fear of retribution.</p>
