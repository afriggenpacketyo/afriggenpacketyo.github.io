          <p>Top mathematician Liu Jun clarified that his decision to leave Harvard University for China's Tsinghua University was driven by personal and family reasons, not political protest. In an email to the South China Morning Post, Liu stated the move was unrelated to the Trump administration but was instead motivated by a deep, lifelong bond with the Tsinghua campus where he was born. His departure had sparked speculation amid rising academic and political tensions between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank announced it would hold interest rates steady, citing persistent economic uncertainty largely stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies. While inflation in the euro zone is currently hovering around the bank's 2% target, concerns remain about the impact of trade disputes on sluggish economic growth. The ECB stated it will maintain a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach, leaving the door open for potential rate cuts later in the year if economic conditions worsen.

          <p>Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used to simplify how consumers plan and book trips, with new tools designed to save time and money by acting as personalized travel agents. These AI-powered apps can generate itineraries, compare fluctuating prices, and maximize loyalty points, disrupting the traditional travel planning process. While many travelers have started using AI for inspiration and booking, some experts note that the technology is currently more effective for on-the-ground assistance, like translating menus, than for comprehensive trip planning.</p>

          <p>The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note briefly fell to 4% before stabilizing, as investors analyzed conflicting economic signals. The August consumer price index indicated slightly higher inflation than anticipated, while weekly jobless claims also jumped unexpectedly, pointing to a potentially weakening labor market. This mixed data has solidified market expectations that the Federal Reserve will proceed with an interest rate cut at its meeting next week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry voiced his support for L.A. Clippers owner Steve Ballmer, stating he does not believe allegations that Ballmer tried to circumvent the NBA's salary cap. The controversy centers on a report that a company in which Ballmer invested provided a $28 million sponsorship deal to star player Kawhi Leonard, which sources claimed was a covert payment. The NBA has launched an investigation, but Lasry dismissed the claims as likely being "a lot of smoke."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This Vox article examines the cultural shift away from teenage babysitters toward a more professionalized, adult child care workforce, and explores what has been lost in this change. The author suggests that babysitting offers teens crucial lessons in responsibility and problem-solving, while younger children benefit from the unique mentorship of an older peer. The decline of this practice is linked to broader societal trends, including intensive parenting, over-scheduled teen lives, and a weakening of community bonds.</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic features a photo essay looking back at the monumental public health campaign to vaccinate Americans against polio during the 1950s. The disease reached its peak in the U.S. in 1952, causing thousands of deaths and paralyzing over 20,000 people, mostly children. The widespread introduction of the Salk vaccine in 1955 led to a dramatic and rapid decline in cases, marking one of the greatest triumphs of modern medicine.</p>
