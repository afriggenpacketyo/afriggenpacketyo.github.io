          <p>After a month-long trial, eight of the ten people accused of robbing Kim Kardashian in Paris in 2016 were convicted. The sentences for the convicted individuals will not require them to return to prison. The ringleader, Aomar A√Øt Khedache, received the heaviest sentence of eight years imprisonment, with five of those years being a suspended sentence. Kardashian, who provided emotional testimony during the trial, expressed gratitude to the French authorities.</p>

          <p>Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene engaged in a public disagreement with Grok, an artificial intelligence robot on Elon Musk‚Äôs X. The exchange began when Grok offered a balanced view on whether Greene could be considered a Christian. Greene responded by stating that judgment belongs to God, not a non-human AI platform, and accused Grok of spreading fake news and propaganda. The incident highlights ongoing debates about AI bias and its role in analyzing information.</p>
