          <p>Taiwan's military has reclassified Chiang Kai-shek‚Äôs mausoleum in Taoyuan as a ‚Äúcamp area,‚Äù a move seen as an effort by the island's independence-leaning authorities to diminish the legacy of the former Kuomintang leader. The mausoleum of Chiang's son and successor, Chiang Ching-kuo, was also reclassified. The sites will no longer be referred to as ‚Äúmausoleums‚Äù or ‚Äúspirit-worship facilities,‚Äù reflecting updated administrative needs and the 2014 reclassification of Taoyuan as a metropolitan area.</p>

          <h2>Expert Argues Trump's Plan to Weaken the Dollar Is Flawed</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 01:00:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard economics professor, argues that Donald Trump's plan to weaken the dollar, proposed by Stephen Miran, is based on a flawed diagnosis. While the dollar's reserve-currency status contributes to trade deficits, it's only one of many factors. Rogoff suggests that reducing the fiscal deficit would be a more straightforward fix than launching a trade war. He also points out that the strength of the American economy and increased automation in factories contribute to the current account deficit.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators announced a series of policy measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, to stimulate economic growth amid trade tensions. The measures aim to support key sectors like technology and real estate, along with boosting consumption and elderly care. However, analysts suggest these measures may have limited impact on domestic credit demand. The government is also preparing additional measures to support small and medium enterprises and the private sector.</p>

The company has the support of nearly three-quarters of its debt holders and expects to emerge from bankruptcy within 45 days. WeightWatchers has been transitioning into the prescription drug weight loss business, acquiring Sequence (now WeightWatchers Clinic) in 2023. Despite a decline in overall revenue, the company's clinical subscription revenue from weight-loss medications has increased.</p>

          <p>Morocco is emerging as a crucial hub for Chinese companies seeking to bypass tariffs and export to Europe, thanks to its free-trade agreement with the European Union. The country has attracted significant investment from Chinese energy, electric vehicle, and battery producers. However, growing tensions between China and the United States pose a challenge for Morocco, requiring it to balance its economic ties with China against its strategic partnership with the U.S. The Trump administration could pressure Morocco to choose between the two powers.</p>

          <p>In England and Wales, criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings may face up to two additional years in prison under a new bill. The measure aims to ensure offenders cannot avoid facing the consequences of their actions. Victims' families have expressed support for the bill, viewing it as a step in the right direction. The legislation follows instances where offenders, such as Thomas Cashman, who killed Olivia Pratt-Korbel, did not attend court for their sentencing.</p>

          <p>The fire-ravaged Tahitian Terrace mobile home park in Pacific Palisades will be included in the federally funded debris removal program after initially being left out. This decision brings residents closer to returning home, as the government will clear their properties. The determination of who would pay for debris removal has been a major factor in deciding whether to rebuild the park. The federal assistance is viewed as a crucial step in the recovery process.</p>

          <p>China is experiencing a surge in tourism, defying a broader slowdown in consumer spending. The May Labor Day holiday saw a significant increase in domestic tourist trips and revenue. The popularity of cultural and historical sites, along with improved transportation infrastructure, is driving the trend. Despite concerns about macroeconomic headwinds, consumer sentiment remains resilient, with travel being a top priority for spending. Cities are investing in attractions to lure tourists, signaling a potential shift in consumption patterns.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump plans to announce that the U.S. will refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia. Arab nations have advocated for this change, while Iran has maintained its historical ties to the original name. The move, expected during Trump's trip to Saudi Arabia, could further inflame tensions with Iran. Trump can change the name for official U.S. purposes, but he cannot dictate what the rest of the world calls it.</p>
