          <p>My Chemical Romance is currently on a major stadium tour, performing their iconic 2006 album "The Black Parade" in its entirety, a testament to their enduring influence on emo and rock music. The show at Dodger Stadium featured elaborate theatrical elements, including a narrative involving a fictional dictator, which served as a satirical take on political authoritarianism. The band's lasting appeal is attributed to its blend of dramatic world-building, frank lyrics about mental health, and a flexible portrayal of gender. The performance also included a set of other fan-favorite hits and a previously unreleased song.</p>

          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar has won his fourth Tour de France title, solidifying his status as one of the sport's greats. Despite having the overall victory effectively secured, Pogačar characteristically launched an attack on the final stage in Paris, even on dangerously wet roads, finishing fourth for the stage but winning the tour overall. He finished 4 minutes and 24 seconds ahead of two-time champion Jonas Vingegaard, continuing their multi-year rivalry at the top of the sport. Pogačar's victory marks another dominant year, having also won the Giro d'Italia earlier in the season.</p>

          <p>Ichiro Suzuki, the first Japanese position player to be enshrined, was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, receiving 99.7% of the vote. He was joined by six-time All-Star pitcher CC Sabathia and dominant reliever Billy Wagner in the 2025 class in Cooperstown. Suzuki, a 10-time All-Star and Gold Glove winner, is celebrated for his remarkable contact hitting, amassing over 3,000 hits in MLB after a storied career in Japan. The ceremony highlighted the profound and growing connection between Japanese and American baseball, a legacy Suzuki was instrumental in building.</p>

          <p>Several Eastern Caribbean nations, including Antigua and Barbuda, are experiencing a significant increase in demand for their "citizenship by investment" programs, where individuals can gain a passport by purchasing real estate. A large portion of this new interest is coming from US citizens, reportedly driven by political and social instability in the United States. These programs, which offer visa-free travel and tax advantages, are a major source of revenue for the islands but have drawn scrutiny from the EU and US over security and financial crime concerns. In response, the Caribbean nations are implementing stricter oversight and due diligence measures.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have finalized a major trade deal, establishing a 15% baseline tariff on most EU goods imported into the US, averting a potential trade war. Announced by Donald Trump and Ursula von der Leyen, the agreement also includes significant EU commitments to purchase billions in US energy and invest in the American economy. While hailed for bringing stability, the deal is more complex than a simple tariff, with zero tariffs on some sectors like aircraft and a retained 50% tariff on steel. The agreement also raises diplomatic questions regarding its impact on Northern Ireland's unique trade status. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tom Lehrer, the brilliant and influential musical satirist known for his witty and incisive songs in the 1950s and '60s, has died at the age of 97. A Harvard-educated mathematician, Lehrer led a dual life, creating darkly humorous music that tackled subjects like nuclear war, pollution, and politics before largely retiring from public performance to focus on teaching. His work, including songs like "The Vatican Rag" and "Pollution," is credited with establishing the genre of comedy songwriting and influencing generations of artists.

          <p>The Keeladi excavation site in India's Tamil Nadu state has unearthed artifacts suggesting a sophisticated urban civilization existed there as far back as 580 BCE, challenging established narratives about the subcontinent's history.

Some archaeologists and politicians claim the evidence suggests the Tamil Brahmi script is older than the Ashokan Brahmi script from the north.

          <p>An investigative journalist and a photographer successfully tracked down a Skyvan PA-51 airplane used by Argentina's military dictatorship for "death flights," where political prisoners were thrown alive into the Atlantic Ocean. Their multi-year investigation uncovered the plane's flight logs in the US, where it was being used for skydiving, providing crucial evidence that documented the clandestine missions. This evidence, including the names of the pilots, was instrumental in a landmark 2017 trial that convicted dozens of former officials for crimes against humanity. The plane has since been returned to Argentina and is now displayed at the ESMA Museum of Memory as a witness to state terrorism.</p>

Piastri took the lead from Norris on the first lap, capitalizing on the slipstream advantage at Spa-Francorchamps, a move he had anticipated after losing pole position. While Norris was on more durable hard tires, Piastri skillfully managed his medium compound tires to the end. The article suggests a few small errors from Norris, including a suboptimal restart and mistakes during his chase, may have cost him a chance to challenge for the win in the final laps.</p>
