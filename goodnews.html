          <p>Despite JPMorgan Chase's record profits and growth under CEO Jamie Dimon, Dimon frequently expresses concerns about the economy and geopolitical risks. While Dimon's warnings about potential economic calamities have not always materialized, JPMorgan has consistently outperformed its rivals. Some analysts suggest Dimon's downbeat remarks serve to keep his management team focused and prevent complacency, while others believe it's a strategy to manage expectations and protect his reputation. Dimon's cautious outlook may also stem from the inherent fragility of financial institutions, as evidenced by the past failures of other major firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant number of millennials are choosing not to have children, contributing to a record low fertility rate in the U.S. This trend is attributed to financial burdens, career priorities, and concerns about climate change, but also a cultural shift in defining harm and abuse. Millennials are holding their parents to higher standards, expecting them to be accountable for their mental health and career success well into adulthood, creating a new, nearly impossible standard for parenting. This generation's dread of parenthood stems from the fear of not meeting these elevated expectations and potentially causing harm to their children. </p>

While Wilson has touched on Beaker's adult life through her daughter's perspective in children's books, she feels it would be inappropriate to delve into certain aspects of Beaker's personal life. The author has previously returned to some of her characters as adults, such as in her adult fiction book Think Again, but remains wary of doing so with Tracy Beaker. Dame Jacqueline said she still felt anxious when writing. "Always about halfway through a book, even now, you think 'I've got the hang of this with all these books that I've written', but I get that terrible doubt and worry about it and and it's just something you learn.

          <p>Oscar Piastri topped the second practice session at the Spanish Grand Prix, with McLaren setting the pace in Barcelona. The event's talking point is the introduction of a new front-wing flexibility test by the FIA, aimed at reducing aerodynamic manipulation through flexing wings. Red Bull and Ferrari hope the restrictions will boost their competitiveness, while McLaren believes it will have little effect on them. Teams have long used front-wing flexibility to boost speed on the straights while retaining downforce in the corners.</p>
