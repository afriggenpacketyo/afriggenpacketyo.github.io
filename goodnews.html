        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a 5% year-on-year decrease in net profit for the first quarter of 2025, primarily due to lower crude oil prices and reduced production. The company's net income for the quarter was $26 billion, slightly above analyst expectations, but free cash flow also declined. CEO Amin Nasser noted that global trade dynamics and economic uncertainty impacted energy markets. The company faces pressure due to lower oil prices, costly megaprojects, and OPEC+ production cuts, even though it has eased pressure on itself by slashing its performance-linked dividend payout, which means less revenue for the Saudi government.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay for The New York Times, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a senior staff psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, challenges the notion of the 'perfect mother,' arguing that flaws are essential for children to learn acceptance and resilience. She criticizes the historical tendency of psychiatry to blame mothers for their children's problems and encourages mothers to stop constantly questioning their adequacy. The article advocates for self-compassion and the recognition that being flawed is a vital part of motherhood, allowing children to develop healthy perspectives on relationships and self-acceptance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the United States remained steady at 6.76%, close to the year's highest levels but below the rate from a year prior. Mortgage rates are influenced by various factors, including the demand for Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve policies, and investor expectations. Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for prospective homebuyers, contributing to a lackluster spring home-buying season. The recent fluctuations in mortgage rates reflect volatility in the 10-year Treasury yield, used by lenders to price mortgage loans.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that China is shifting its energy investments in Africa towards renewable projects, with solar and wind power now comprising 59% of its energy projects on the continent. From 2010 to 2024, China's energy sector investment and construction activity in Africa totaled $66 billion, with the continent becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology. This trend aligns with China's global commitment to halt funding for new coal-fired power plants overseas, driven by Africa's rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production.</p>
