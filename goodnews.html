        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority has outlined a compensation scheme for millions of drivers affected by the mis-selling of car finance. The plan covers 14 million agreements from 2007 to 2024, addressing issues like unfair commission arrangements and inaccurate information provided to consumers. While initial estimates were higher, the average payout is now expected to be around £700 per person, with lenders potentially facing a total bill of £8.2 billion. This regulatory action aims to provide fair restitution to customers who were overcharged for their vehicle loans.</p>

          <p>The World Trade Organization has significantly increased its global trade growth forecast for 2025 to 2.4%, citing strong performance in the first half of the year driven by demand for AI-related goods and favorable macroeconomic conditions. However, the organization has sharply downgraded its outlook for 2026, predicting growth will slow to just 0.5% due to the cooling global economy and the full impact of trade tariffs. The report highlights the dual influence of technological innovation boosting current trade and protectionist policies posing a significant future risk. (not investment advice)</p>

Beyond serving customers, the restaurant prepares and donates 80 to 100 hot meals every day to community members in need.

          <p>In an article adapted from his book, author Morgan Housel argues that financial happiness is less about wealth and more about contentment and managing expectations. He presents five rules for living a happier life without needing a lot of money, emphasizing the importance of appreciating the ordinary and recognizing that happiness is the gap between one's expectations and circumstances. Housel suggests that the relentless pursuit of more often leads to dissatisfaction, while finding satisfaction with what one already has creates a form of "psychological wealth." This perspective challenges the conventional link between high income and personal fulfillment.</p>

          <p>Tesla has rolled out a new version of its Full Self-Driving supervised software, but the move has been overshadowed by anticipation for a more significant product reveal. The company fueled speculation with cryptic teaser clips posted online, leading investors to expect an announcement about a lower-cost Model Y, the long-promised next-generation Roadster, or another new venture. This comes as Tesla seeks to shift focus toward its robotics and autonomous driving ambitions amid a slump in auto sales and increasing competition. The company has not released a new vehicle model for sale since the Cybertruck in late 2023.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is increasing its position in GE Vernova, purchasing 20 additional shares of the power equipment manufacturer. The move comes as the stock has traded sideways following a strong second-quarter earnings report, providing what the club sees as a buying opportunity. The rationale for the investment is tied to the long-term demand for AI infrastructure, as the proliferation of data centers will require a massive increase in power generation. GE Vernova is positioned to benefit from this trend through its gas turbines and grid solutions, despite softness in its onshore wind business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The creators of the Paddington Bear films and the estate of his author, Michael Bond, are suing the producers of the satirical puppet show "Spitting Image." The lawsuit, filed in the UK's High Court, cites copyright concerns over a parody sketch that depicts the beloved children's character as a foul-mouthed podcast host who swears and admits to taking cocaine. The sketch, titled "The Rest is Bullsh*t!," features Paddington with a strong South American accent interviewing public figures like Elon Musk and Prince Harry. The legal action challenges the satirical use of the iconic and typically gentle character.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Ukraine Is Adapting Its Military Strategy for a Protracted War</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis of the war in Ukraine suggests the country is effectively adapting its military tactics to counter Russia's manpower advantage and settle in for a long-term conflict. Ukrainian commanders are increasingly focused on minimizing their own casualties through the sophisticated use of drones, more precise artillery strikes, and better troop rotation schedules. This strategy aims to avoid direct infantry engagement whenever possible, conserving their limited number of soldiers. This shift, combined with successful strikes on Russian infrastructure, indicates a growing confidence that Ukraine can sustain its defense and that time may be shifting in its favor.</p>
