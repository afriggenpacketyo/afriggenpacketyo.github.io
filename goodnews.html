          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Tianjin, called for increased global trade collaboration despite rising tariffs and barriers. Li emphasized that globalization is irreversible and cautioned against turning trade into a political or security issue. He advocated for "reshaping the rules and order" of the international economy through collaborative processes. Adam Tooze, a Columbia University professor, interpreted Li's comments as a call for a pluralization of global economic order, with a focus on processes rather than a single dominant entity. The article highlights China's perspective on international trade relations and its desire for a more collaborative global economic environment. The Chinese premier believes that it is best for all nations to collaborate on trade for the sake of reshaping the rules and order.</p>

          <p>The UK government will acquire 12 new F-35 A fighter jets equipped to carry nuclear bombs, joining NATO's airborne nuclear mission. Downing Street described this as the "biggest strengthening of the UK's nuclear posture in a generation." These jets can also carry conventional weapons and will be based at RAF Marham in Norfolk. The decision follows the Strategic Defence Review, prompted by increasing nuclear risks from other states. Prime Minister Starmer pledged to meet a new NATO target of spending 5% of the UK's GDP on national security by 2035. This investment aims to bolster national security amid growing global uncertainty.</p>

          <p>China plans to increase gold production and reserves over the next three years due to soaring demand and geopolitical tensions. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology announced a plan to boost gold reserves by 5% to 10% and increase gold output by over 5%. Gold is considered a strategic mineral resource with both commodity and currency attributes, crucial for maintaining national industrial and financial security. The ministry stated that China's gold industry faces challenges, including insufficient resource security and difficulties in meeting demand from key technologies. China has been the world's top gold consumer for 12 years, with gold output standing at 377.24 tonnes last year.</p>

The crew will spend 14 days aboard the ISS, conducting nearly 60 experiments spanning biology, material science, and technology demonstrations. The launch was delayed due to weather and a leak on the ISS, but the crew is now en route to the station in a new SpaceX Dragon spacecraft.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China and India are reducing their imports of Indonesian thermal coal in favor of higher-calorific value (CV) coal from other regions. This shift is driven by a global fall in prices, making higher-quality coal more competitive. Indonesian coal exports to China and India have declined significantly, while imports from Mongolia, South Africa, and Tanzania have increased. The shift towards higher-grade coal allows both nations to generate more energy per ton, improving efficiency. Overall, Chinese and Indian coal imports have decreased, but Indonesian exports have been particularly affected. This illustrates the changing dynamics of the global coal market.</p>

          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Zohran Mamdani declared victory after a strong showing in the first round, leading former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who conceded earlier. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, gained momentum with younger voters. Cuomo's campaign indicated he might consider an independent run in the general election. The race will proceed to a ranked-choice count since no candidate reached 50%, with comprehensive results expected on July 1. The winner of the primary will likely have an advantage in the November general election, though incumbent Mayor Eric Adams is running as an independent.</p>

The study proposes an interconnected system drawing on regions with abundant renewable energy potential to supply energy across continents. Researchers acknowledge that setting up such a system would require navigating geopolitical boundaries and crises. Successful interconnection could improve energy efficiency and resilience against conflict and climate extremes.

          <p>Australian journalist Antoinette Lattouf won her case against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), with a court ruling she was unfairly sacked over a social media post about the war in Gaza. The court found that the ABC sacked Lattouf for reasons including her opinions on the Israeli military campaign in Gaza. She was awarded damages of A$70,000. Lattouf said she was "punished for my political opinion." The dismissal raised questions over the ABC's independence and support for culturally diverse staff. The ABC apologized, stating it had "let down our staff and audiences" in its handling of the matter.</p>

          <h2>California Budget Deal Hinges on Housing Reform</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-24 23:50:11 EDT</div>

          <p>California leaders reached a tentative agreement on the state budget, contingent on the Legislature passing a housing reform proposal. The agreement reflects the challenge of overhauling environmental regulations to speed up housing construction. The $321.1-billion budget relies on borrowing money, tapping into state reserves, and shifting funding to address a $12-billion deficit. The plan restores cost-of-living adjustments for child-care workers and provides additional funding for Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention grants. The agreement is expected to serve as a precursor to more challenging financial discussions in the months ahead. The budget deal is not yet finalized.</p>

          <p>Michael Conforto had a productive game in the Dodgers' 9-7 win against the Rockies, going two for five with a double and a three-run home run. This marked his first multi-hit effort since May 27 and his first game with multiple RBIs this season. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the importance of the upcoming month for Conforto. Justin Wrobleski contributed with two runs over five innings of bulk relief. Ohtani added a two-run home run. This may help his playing time in the future.</p>
