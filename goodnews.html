          <p>The Aukus security pact, a multi-billion dollar submarine deal between Australia, the UK, and the US, faced a review by the Trump administration to align with its "America First" agenda. Despite initial concerns, US President Donald Trump confirmed the deal was moving "full steam ahead" after meeting with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. The agreement involves Australia purchasing US Virginia-class submarines and jointly developing new nuclear-powered attack submarines with the UK, along with collaboration on advanced military capabilities like hypersonic missiles and AI. This initiative is largely seen as a strategy to counter China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region, a view China has condemned as "extremely irresponsible."</p>

          <p>Following the firing of Billy Napier, the Florida Gators football team is searching for a new head coach. Former NFL star Robert Griffin III publicly suggested Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow as a strong candidate, citing his iconic status and potential recruiting appeal in Florida. While Tebow has not expressed interest in coaching, focusing instead on human trafficking efforts and college football analysis, Griffin believes a strong support staff could make it work. The article notes the mixed success of hiring iconic athletes as coaches in college sports, contrasting Georgetown's Patrick Ewing with Florida's past success with Steve Spurrier.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has successfully completed a round of radiation therapy for an aggressive, high-risk form of prostate cancer, as confirmed by his spokeswoman. Biden, 82, underwent treatment at the University of Pennsylvania’s Radiation Oncology clinic, with his daughter Ashley sharing a video of him ringing a symbolic bell marking the end of a treatment phase. This follows a September surgery to remove skin cancer lesions. Concerns about Biden’s mental and physical health were prominent during the 2024 campaign, ultimately leading to his withdrawal from the November election. He is slated to receive a lifetime achievement award in Boston.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets are expected to open higher, mirroring gains on Wall Street, primarily driven by a rally in Apple shares. Investors in Japan are closely watching a parliamentary vote, which could see Sanae Takaichi become the next prime minister with support from the Japan Innovation Party. Australia's ASX/S&P 200 rose, with rare earth companies seeing significant increases following a critical minerals agreement signed between Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and US President Donald Trump, aimed at countering China's market dominance. Hong Kong futures also indicated a higher open, while Indian markets remained closed for a holiday. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and Australia have signed a significant agreement to boost the supply of rare earths and other critical minerals, directly aiming to counter China's near-monopoly in the market. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced the deal would support an $8.5 billion pipeline of "ready-to-go" projects to enhance Australia's mining and processing capabilities, including a $1 billion joint investment over six months. This initiative builds on previous efforts, with President Trump also confirming the Aukus submarine deal is "full steam ahead." The US will invest in an advanced gallium refinery in Western Australia and provide $2.2 billion in financing for critical mineral projects.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>St. Johns, Michigan, a city of 8,000, has begun regulating golf carts on public roads due to a boom in their use for transportation and growing safety concerns. With approximately 2,000 golf carts now mixing with regular traffic, Mayor Scott Dzurka highlighted the potential for "disastrous" wrecks. The new ordinances restrict carts to streets with speed limits of 25 mph or lower, mandate inspections for turn signals and horns, and require drivers to be at least 18 years old with a valid license. While some residents express safety worries, golf cart owners like Cathy Kochensparger feel safe, especially when driving with awareness.</p>

          <h2>Early Peanut Introduction Prevents Allergies in 60,000 Children, Study Shows</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates that approximately 60,000 children have avoided developing peanut allergies thanks to landmark 2015 guidance recommending early introduction of peanut products to infants. A study published in Pediatrics found a significant decline in peanut allergies among children aged 0-3, with rates dropping over 40% after the expanded recommendations in 2017. This reverses decades of medical advice to delay allergen introduction. Despite initial slow adoption, the data offers promising evidence that the "eat early, eat often" approach works in real-world settings. The article emphasizes the updated 2021 guidance for introducing major allergens between four and six months without prior screening.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) reported that its services have returned to normal operations after a day-long outage impacted numerous major websites and applications globally. The disruption, which began early Monday, was attributed to an "operational issue" affecting an internal subsystem responsible for monitoring network load balancers, specifically involving DNS problems with its DynamoDB database service. The outage affected Amazon's own services, including Alexa and Ring, and a wide array of popular platforms like Snapchat, Reddit, and United Airlines. AWS, a leading cloud infrastructure provider, has pledged to release a detailed post-event summary to explain the incident fully.</p>

          <p>A potential tragedy was averted at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport when police arrested Billy Cagle, 49, after his family reported his social media threats to "shoot it up." Cagle, a felon with mental health challenges, was taken into custody unarmed inside the terminal, though an AR-15 assault rifle with 27 rounds of ammunition was found in his truck. Police Chief Darin Schierbaum credited the family's quick alert and inter-agency collaboration for preventing harm. Investigators believe Cagle was likely returning to his truck to retrieve the weapon with intent to use it in the crowded terminal.</p>

          <p>Panama's Minister of Canal Affairs, Jose Ramon Icaza, indicated that the government is preparing for potential outcomes regarding CK Hutchison's concession to operate the Balboa and Cristobal ports.

Icaza stated that if the Supreme Court rules against the extension, the Panama Maritime Authority would take control to avoid supply chain disruption.
