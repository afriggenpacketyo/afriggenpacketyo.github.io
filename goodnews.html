          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen from a Japanese temple in 2012 and taken to South Korea, has been returned to its rightful owner, concluding a long-standing dispute that strained relations between the two countries. The statue, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, was handed over in South Korea after the South Korean Supreme Court ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership, resolving a lawsuit filed by a South Korean temple claiming the statue had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago. The artifact, designated as a cultural asset, is expected to be stored at a museum after a ceremony at the temple.</p>

China's Vice Premier called the talks in-depth and candid. The White House referred to it as a trade deal but provided no further details. These meetings represent the first face-to-face discussions since President Trump imposed a 145% tariff on Chinese imports, prompting Beijing to respond with a 125% levy on some US goods. The announcement has sparked optimism in financial markets, with stocks in mainland China and Hong Kong showing gains.</p>
