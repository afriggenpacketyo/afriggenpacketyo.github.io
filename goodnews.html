          <p>AstraZeneca has launched an at-home delivery service for its FluMist nasal spray flu vaccine, aiming to increase vaccination rates through convenience. Previously only available in clinical settings, the vaccine can now be ordered online and self-administered by adults or given by caregivers to children, following FDA approval for this method. The company hopes this needle-free, accessible option will encourage more families to get vaccinated, especially after a recent flu season with a high number of pediatric deaths. Most insurance plans are expected to cover the cost of the vaccine.</p>

Both sovereign wealth funds reduced their exposure to technology stocks, with PIF completely divesting its stake in Alibaba. This shift mirrors strategies seen from other large firms reacting to market volatility and increasing geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China.

          <p>The fast-fashion giant Shein saw its UK sales increase by over 32% last year, reaching £2.05 billion and boosting its pre-tax profits to £38.3 million. The company, now headquartered in Singapore, acknowledged that future growth could be impacted by inflation affecting consumer spending habits. Shein may also face new import taxes, as the UK government is reviewing a tax exemption for low-value packages, a change that has already led the company to raise prices in the U.S. The robust financial results come as the company reportedly moves closer to a public listing on the London Stock Exchange.</p>

          <p>A former senior economic official in China has urged the government to stimulate domestic consumption by removing purchase restrictions on items like property and vehicles. Speaking at a Peking University seminar, Yin Yanlin argued that encouraging affluent groups to spend would create a positive economic cycle. He emphasized that high savings rates, not low income, are the main impediment to spending, pointing to a significant increase in household savings. This advice comes as Beijing seeks new ways to invigorigate its domestic market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has formally requested that the prime minister allow his party to appoint peers to the House of Lords. In a letter to Sir Keir Starmer, Farage argued that the current composition of the upper chamber is a "democratic disparity," as his party lacks representation despite its significant vote share and local government presence. While appointments are at the prime minister's discretion, Farage pointed out that smaller parties have representation and that Reform's electoral support now surpasses that of the Liberal Democrats, who have 76 peers.</p>

          <p>Investment firms for the world's wealthiest families are increasingly allocating capital to private markets, with participation surging over 500% since 2016. According to data from Preqin, family offices are outpacing other institutional investors in shifting towards assets like private credit and infrastructure. This trend is driven by the large amounts of wealth these offices manage and their long-term investment horizons, which can accommodate illiquid assets. While still bullish, some recent surveys indicate a more selective approach, with a preference for private debt over private equity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has disclosed a new stake worth approximately $1.6 billion in the beleaguered health insurer UnitedHealth. The investment comes as a surprise given the insurer's recent struggles, including a Justice Department investigation and a significant drop in its stock price throughout 2025. This move aligns with Buffett's history of value investing, acquiring shares in troubled companies at a low price. The disclosure caused UnitedHealth's stock to rise in after-hours trading.

          <p>Mortgage rates in the U.S. have seen a significant decline, with the average 30-year fixed rate falling to 6.58%, down substantially from a peak near 8% in late 2023. This drop is prompting a wave of refinancing applications as homeowners with higher-rate loans seek to lower their monthly payments. Economists note that rates are tracking declining 10-year Treasury yields rather than the steady federal funds rate. Experts suggest homeowners with rates above 7% could particularly benefit from exploring refinancing options. (not investment advice)</p>
