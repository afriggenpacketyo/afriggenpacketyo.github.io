        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With increased immigration enforcement actions, foreign-born residents, especially undocumented immigrants, are increasingly concerned about managing their finances in case of detention or deportation. Experts recommend creating a plan that includes designating someone to handle finances through legal means such as a financial power of attorney. Key steps include collecting and securing important documents like birth certificates and immigration paperwork, understanding account access options with financial service providers, and drafting pre-need guardianship documents for children. Planning ahead can help individuals maintain access to their accounts and property and ensure their family's financial well-being in emergency situations.</p>

          <p>A recent study has found that music therapy is as effective as cognitive behavioral therapy in managing symptoms and anxieties associated with cancer. The therapy involves a hybrid approach combining talk, music, and lyrical composition, allowing patients to express emotions and manage stress. As cancer survival rates improve, there is a growing need for varied therapies to enhance the quality of life for survivors. For some patients, music therapy provides a unique way to process emotions and find healing through creative expression.</p>

          <p>A new drug, Vykat XR, has been approved to treat Prader-Willi syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by insatiable hunger, offering hope for patients and their families. However, this breakthrough comes as federal funding for health research is being slashed, potentially impacting future progress in obesity and rare disease research. While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promotes a "Make America Healthy Again" agenda, cuts to university labs, FDA staff layoffs, and concerns about the dismantling of the nation's medical discovery infrastructure threaten to disrupt ongoing research efforts. Despite the success of Vykat XR, the future of obesity research and drug development remains uncertain.</p>
