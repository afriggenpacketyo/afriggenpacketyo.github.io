          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 15:02:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Internet infrastructure company Cloudflare announced it will now, by default, block AI crawlers from scraping data from websites using its services. This move aims to give content creators more control over their intellectual property and potentially create new revenue streams through a "pay per crawl" model. The decision could significantly impact AI companies like OpenAI and Google, which rely on vast amounts of web data to train their large language models. This policy shift addresses growing concerns that AI models are profiting from online content without compensating the original publishers, thereby disrupting the internet's traditional ad-based revenue system.</p>

          <p>Stocks for clean energy companies experienced a significant surge following the removal of a punitive tax on solar and wind projects from the Senate's version of a major Republican spending bill. The proposed tax, which targeted projects using components from foreign entities like China, would have imposed a multi-billion dollar burden on the industry. While the removal was a relief for investors, industry groups like the Solar Energy Industries Association remain critical of the overall bill. They caution that it still phases out key investment tax credits, undermining long-term growth and America's progress in renewable energy manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated he would not rule out a potential interest rate cut at the central bank's upcoming meeting in July, depending on how economic data evolves. Speaking at a European Central Bank forum, Powell emphasized the Fed's focus on its dual mandate of controlling inflation and maximizing employment, deflecting questions about political pressure from President Trump. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde expressed solidarity, stating she and other central bankers would act exactly as Powell has. The remarks come as the Fed has held rates steady for six months, with a majority of its board members still projecting two rate cuts by the end of 2025.</p>

          <p>During his first-round match at Wimbledon, French tennis player Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard recorded the fastest serve in the tournament's history, a staggering 153 mph thunderbolt. The 21-year-old's record-breaking serve surpassed the previous best of 148 mph set by Taylor Dent. Despite this historic feat and hitting 37 aces, Mpetshi Perricard ultimately lost the epic five-set match to the fifth seed, Taylor Fritz. Ironically, the record-setting 153 mph serve was returned by Fritz, and Mpetshi Perricard lost the point, underscoring that sheer power does not always guarantee victory in the sport's highest echelons.</p>

The push includes forming a "Meta Superintelligence Labs" unit, co-led by recently acquihired Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, to develop next-generation models.

          <p>With U.S. homeowners holding significant equity, this article outlines five strategic ways to use $100,000 in home equity, particularly as rates for these loans are much lower than for credit cards. The primary recommendation is to pay off high-interest debt, which can save thousands in interest payments. Other smart uses include funding strategic home renovations that boost resale value, investing in a diversified portfolio, starting or expanding a small business, or financing education to increase long-term earning potential. The article cautions that tapping home equity turns it into a secured debt backed by the property, so it should only be done with a clear financial plan. (not investment advice)</p>

Draper, seeded fourth, was leading comfortably with a score of 6-2, 6-2, 2-1 when the Argentine clay-court specialist withdrew. The injury occurred after Baez slipped on the Court One baseline during the second set. As the host nation's leading hope, particularly following Andy Murray's retirement, the 23-year-old Draper's performance was a commanding display.

          <p>A federal judge in Rhode Island has issued a preliminary injunction, halting the Trump administration's plan for mass layoffs and a major restructuring of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The judge ruled that the states challenging the plan were likely to succeed in their claim that the action was "arbitrary and capricious as well as contrary to law." The lawsuit, brought by 19 Democratic attorneys general, argued the reorganization would cause "devastating consequences" and interrupt critical public health services nationwide. The order blocks HHS from finalizing the announced layoffs of over 10,000 employees and proceeding with plans to consolidate numerous health agencies.</p>

          <p>In a positive sign for consumers feeling the pinch of high food costs, Waffle House has officially removed the 50-cent surcharge it had added to egg-based orders. The chain implemented the temporary charge in February when a severe outbreak of avian flu led to record-high egg prices across the nation. Since then, wholesale and retail egg prices have started to decline from their peaks, allowing the popular 24-hour diner chain to eliminate the extra fee. The move reflects a broader, albeit slow, normalization of food prices after a period of significant inflation, offering some relief to family budgets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores whether credit card debt forgiveness is a sensible option for consumers struggling with high balances, especially with current interest rates near record highs. Forgiveness programs can reduce debt by 30% to 50% for those with significant balances and a demonstrated financial hardship, offering a path to financial freedom. However, the process can take several years and will negatively impact one's credit score. The article advises that individuals who can afford to pay off their debt in a reasonable timeframe should explore alternatives like debt management plans or consolidation loans to avoid the credit damage associated with forgiveness.
