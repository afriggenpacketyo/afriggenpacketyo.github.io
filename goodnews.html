During their first visit to the city since Naruhito's accession in 2019, they laid flowers and bowed at the cenotaph in Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, which commemorates around 340,000 victims. They also toured an exhibition displaying atomic bombing relics, with the Emperor expressing his sorrow upon learning that the area near the hypocenter was once a densely populated neighborhood.

          <p>Juneteenth, now a federally recognized holiday, commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S., originating from June 19, 1865, when enslaved people in Texas learned of their freedom. Celebrations include parades, concerts, and educational events, though some corporate sponsorships have decreased amid efforts to roll back diversity initiatives. The holiday serves as a reminder of the country's foundation on slavery and the long struggle for emancipation, with historical celebrations varying by region based on when news of the Emancipation Proclamation reached different communities. Despite changes in funding, Juneteenth festivities are expected to draw crowds across the country, memorializing a specific day in Galveston while symbolizing the joyful anniversary of independence.

          <p>Doctors Without Borders collaborated with community healers in Alto Baud√≥, Colombia, to develop rituals addressing mental health issues caused by ongoing violence. One ritual involves tearing and sewing back together photos of loved ones and homes, symbolizing healing from psychic wounds. The project also incorporates traditional herbs and leaves to provide comfort and pain relief, while training locals as health workers to ensure basic medical services are available.

          <p>Juneteenth provides an opportunity to reflect on the significant influence of Black American cuisine on the broader culinary landscape of the United States. Foods like sweet potatoes, black-eyed peas, and collard greens, introduced by enslaved West Africans, are now staples in American holiday meals. Cooking methods such as barbecuing and deep-frying also trace their roots back to West Africa and were preserved through generations of enslaved people. These culinary traditions, celebrated during Juneteenth, highlight the profound contributions of Black Americans to the diverse and rich food culture of the nation.

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has ruled out dissolving the House of Representatives for the time being, ensuring that elections for both parliamentary chambers will not occur simultaneously in July. This decision follows the announcement by Yoshihiko Noda, head of the main opposition party, that he will not submit a no-confidence motion against Ishiba's Cabinet, citing concerns about stalling progress on key political issues. Ishiba expressed readiness to dissolve the lower house if a no-confidence motion were submitted, but the opposition's reluctance stems from a lack of preparedness for a general election.

          <p>The contrast between Juneteenth and current immigration raids highlights the need for mass legal empowerment to protect democracy. While the Emancipation Proclamation theoretically rejected slavery, it was not until Juneteenth that enslaved people in Texas could assert their freedom. To protect democracy today, it is crucial for citizens to understand and participate in the legal system, challenging unlawful actions and asserting their rights. By coming together and using the law, individuals can reduce the distance between institutions and themselves, fostering trust and accountability.
