          <p>Lady Gaga performed a free concert on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, drawing over two million attendees.

A large security presence of 5,000 police officers, drones, and facial recognition cameras were deployed to manage the event. Lady Gaga, visibly emotional, unfurled a Brazilian flag and wore Brazil-themed costumes, singing along with her hits including Alejandro, Poker Face and Abracadabra.</p>

          <p>The European Court of Justice has ruled against Malta's "golden passport" program, which granted EU citizenship to foreign investors, deeming it a mere commercial transaction. The court emphasized the need for a genuine link between member states and their citizens, and solidarity among EU countries. While Malta's Prime Minister defended the scheme, saying it had raised millions for charitable causes, the government has agreed to rework the system to align with the court's decision. Despite the ban on golden passports, "golden visas" allowing residence permits for investments remain prevalent, raising concerns about security, money laundering, and corruption risks. </p>
