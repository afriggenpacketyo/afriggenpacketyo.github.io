          <p>The energy regulator Ofgem announced that energy bills in England, Scotland, and Wales will decrease by 7% in July, marking the first drop in a year. This translates to a ¬£129 reduction for a typical household's annual bill, bringing it down to ¬£1,720. While charities welcome the decrease, they emphasize that many households still struggle with energy costs, collectively owing suppliers around ¬£4 billion. The price cap does not apply to Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A man in Norway woke up to find a large container ship had run aground and crashed into his front garden. The 135-meter Cypriot-flagged cargo ship, the NCL Salten, missed Johan Helberg's house by only a few meters. The ship, carrying 16 people, went off course while traveling through the Trondheim Fjord. No injuries were reported, and Norwegian police are investigating the cause of the incident. The head of NCL said it was a "serious incident" and they are awaiting the conclusion of the investigation by the relevant authorities.</p>

          <p>The US Mint is set to stop making new pennies following President Donald Trump's directive to abolish the coin, which he deems "so wasteful". The US Treasury expects annual savings of $56 million in reduced material costs. The penny, made from zinc with a copper coating, costs almost four cents to produce, and there are around 114 billion currently in circulation. Advocates for ditching the penny cite its high production cost and limited utility, while others point to its usefulness in charity drives and cheaper production cost compared with the nickel coin.</p>

This move could force thousands of foreign students to transfer or leave the country, potentially impacting the composition of many of Harvard's 42 varsity sports teams.
