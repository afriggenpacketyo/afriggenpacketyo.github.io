          <p>Despite years of U.S. trade restrictions, Chinese tech giant Huawei has strategically pivoted to become a major competitor in the artificial intelligence sector. The company is developing its own advanced AI chips, like the Ascend series, positioning itself as a rival to Nvidia, particularly within China. This article details Huawei's expansion from telecommunications into a comprehensive AI powerhouse, involved in everything from data centers and cloud computing to industry-specific AI models. Its resilience and government backing have turned it into a "national champion," redefining AI infrastructure and expanding its influence globally.</p>

          <p>A new article explores the potential for GLP-1 drugs, such as Ozempic and Wegovy, to treat Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder in women. Patients in trials and anecdotal reports have experienced significant improvements in PCOS symptoms, including regulated menstrual cycles, weight loss, and reduced androgen levels. While there is no standard treatment for PCOS, these drugs may offer a new therapeutic avenue by improving insulin sensitivity, a key issue linked to the condition. However, experts emphasize the need for larger clinical trials and note that insurance coverage remains a significant barrier for many patients.</p>

          <p>Adolfo "Fito" Macias, the notorious leader of the "Los Choneros" gang, has been extradited from Ecuador to the United States to face charges of cocaine trafficking and firearms violations. This marks the first time Ecuador has extradited one of its own citizens. Macias was recaptured in June after a high-profile prison escape in January that led Ecuador's president to declare a state of "internal armed conflict." His extradition is a significant development in the fight against organized crime in Ecuador, which has become a key transit point in the global cocaine trade.</p>

          <p>This article contrasts the divergent energy strategies of China and the United States, highlighting China's aggressive investment in renewable energy as part of its technological rivalry with the U.S. As global demand for electricity rises, driven by AI and data centers, Beijing is forging ahead with its green energy goals. In contrast, the Trump administration is portrayed as canceling tax credits for wind and solar, labeling them "unreliable." This difference in policy underscores a key area of competition, with China aiming to lead in the critical field of clean energy technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article presents a market analysis arguing against the conventional wisdom that looming tariffs will harm highly valued stocks. It outlines ten positive factors buoying the market, including strong corporate earnings, massive economic stimulus from the "One Big Beautiful Bill," and significant investment in infrastructure like data centers and the electric grid. The analysis suggests that tax cuts, deregulation, and a boom in domestic building and energy production will create powerful tailwinds for the U.S. economy, potentially overshadowing the negative impact of trade disputes.

          <p>The UK government has confirmed it will hold a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The clash, which occurred on June 18, 1984, involved thousands of police officers and striking miners outside a coking plant in Rotherham. The inquiry will examine the events of the day and their aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of 95 miners amid allegations of falsified police evidence. Campaigners, who have sought an inquiry for years, expressed cautious elation at the decision to address the long-unanswered questions.</p>

          <p>Following his victory at The Open, golfer Scottie Scheffler is drawing frequent comparisons to a prime Tiger Woods for his dominant performance in the sport. This article analyzes how the 29-year-old has become the undisputed world number one, having won four major championships in the last four seasons. Peers and commentators point to his "Tiger-like" consistency and ruthless ability to close out tournaments. While Scheffler himself remains humble about the comparison, his machine-like precision and recent improvements in his putting game have solidified his status as the player to beat in men's golf.</p>

          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, the single most important skill to teach a child is "self-connection"—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and needs. The article argues that common parenting responses, like dismissing a child's fears or sadness, can inadvertently teach them to distrust their feelings, leading to anxiety and low self-esteem. The author provides practical advice for fostering this skill, such as validating emotions, welcoming a child's full self, and modeling healthy emotional awareness, which builds resilience and authentic confidence.</p>

Using a $300 million investment fund, the organization provides equity to finance projects, bypassing the slow and costly process of securing government grants and tax credits. While the resulting rents are higher than in traditionally subsidized housing, the model aims to create a new supply of affordable units much faster. The group is currently bidding on several large projects in the Los Angeles area. (not investment advice)</p>
