          <p>European markets experienced a rebound, with traders keenly focused on the upcoming quarterly earnings report from chipmaker Nvidia, a critical bellwether for the global technology sector and the ongoing artificial intelligence boom. France's CAC 40 index recovered from a previous decline caused by political instability concerns, contributing to broad-based gains across the pan-European Stoxx 600 index. This positive market sentiment persists despite a mixed performance in Asia-Pacific markets, influenced by China's industrial profits data, and investors largely overlooking recent political events in the US. The overall market shows cautious optimism, driven by tech expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully completed its tenth Starship test flight, marking a significant comeback after earlier explosive failures and achieving crucial developmental milestones. The towering 400-foot rocket, essential for both SpaceX's commercial aspirations and NASA's plans to return astronauts to the Moon, successfully deployed eight mock Starlink satellites and relit its Raptor engine in orbit. A key achievement was the stress-testing of its reusable heat shield, which is vital for the company's long-term reusability goals. Both the Super Heavy booster and the Starship spacecraft executed controlled splashdowns, demonstrating considerable progress toward making spaceflight fully reusable and supporting future Mars colonization.</p>

This highly anticipated news resonated deeply with Swifties, many of whom have grown up with the artist and feel a personal connection to her relationships, especially as her ballad "So High School" is rumored to be about Kelce.

          <p>China's struggling property market is showing initial signs of recovery, with leading developers China Resources Land and Sunac posting better-than-expected interim financial results. State-owned CR Land reported a 16.2% increase in first-half net profit to 11.9 billion yuan, primarily fueled by a significant rise in property development revenue and steady income from investment properties like shopping malls. Concurrently, Sunac, a major private developer, saw its interim loss narrow by 14.4% due to lower operating and financing expenses. These positive outcomes indicate that government stimulus and recovering retail consumption are starting to stabilize the industry, which previously faced severe debt and sales challenges.

          <p>Denmark's National Museum has unveiled a remarkable 10th-century miniature figurine, hailed as potentially the first "portrait" of a Viking, depicting a well-groomed man with an imperial moustache and braided beard. Carved from walrus tusk, this 1.2-inch piece was discovered in Norway in 1796 but remained forgotten in the museum's archives until recently. Curator Peter Pentz notes that its detailed features and neat hairstyle challenge the stereotypical image of Vikings as wild, suggesting the figure represents a high-status individual, possibly even King Harald Bluetooth. Its unique, smiling, and human-like expression offers an unprecedented insight into individual representation during the Viking Age, which typically favored animal motifs.</p>

          <p>Polly Bancroft, chief executive of Grimsby Town, considers the rare Carabao Cup second-round match against Manchester United a significant highlight, attracting immense global interest and even crashing Grimsby's website due to demand. Bancroft, who previously served as Manchester United's head of women's football, emphasizes the substantial impact such a high-profile fixture has on the League Two club, which could have sold out its 9,000-capacity stadium three times over. She also reflects on her current, more senior role at Grimsby, appreciating the direct reporting lines to owners and management of the head coach, a contrast to her prior experiences at a larger, more established Premier League institution.</p>

          <p>Mitch Brown, a former Australian Football League (AFL) player who played for the West Coast Eagles, has made history by publicly coming out as the first openly gay or bisexual man in the league's 129-year history. Brown revealed that the immense pressure of concealing his sexuality played a "huge" part in his decision to retire, and he hopes his announcement will cultivate a more accepting and safe environment for other players. He recounted a "hyper-masculinity" culture within the AFL, experiencing "countless" homophobic comments and hearing teammates express discomfort about gay individuals. Brown, who is currently in a relationship with a woman and has two sons, advocates for greater empathy and for the league to champion positive male role models.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton's challenging first season with Ferrari has sparked discussions about his performance, the impact of age on athletes, and his adaptation to the current generation of Formula 1 cars. Despite a strong start with a sprint race victory, Hamilton has struggled for competitiveness, leading to self-questioning and a significant gap in qualifying pace compared to his teammate. The article delves into how F1 car design changes since 2022, favoring ground effect and requiring a different driving style, may not suit Hamilton's traditional cornering approach. While his biological age and mental clarity are considered, the upcoming rule changes in 2026, reverting to flat-bottomed cars, offer a potential "magic solution" that could better align with his driving style and reignite his success.</p>

          <p>China has successfully tested a new residual heat removal system, significantly enhancing the meltdown-proof capabilities of its next-generation nuclear power plants designed for radioactive waste recycling. The China Institute of Atomic Energy hailed this as a breakthrough in developing a fourth-generation nuclear plant with a closed-loop fuel cycle, marking the nation's first proof-of-principle test for such passive heat removal technology in integral fast reactors. These advanced reactors, which utilize liquid metal coolants, are notably more fuel-efficient and can generate more fissile material than traditional thermal reactors. This development is crucial for China's sustainable nuclear energy strategy and its efforts in advanced nuclear waste management.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits saw a narrowed decline of 1.5% year-on-year in July, a notable recovery after months of steeper drops, signaling the positive impact of Beijing's campaign against aggressive price wars. This improvement, following a 4.3% slump in June, suggests that government policies are easing the financial strain on companies and improving profitability. While the mining sector continued to struggle, manufacturing and utilities saw profit improvements. Economists attribute the narrower declines to policies aimed at recovering consumer price levels and combating "involution," or excessive competition. However, analysts caution that a full rebound in producer prices is unlikely, with deflationary pressures expected to persist until market consolidation occurs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British tennis player Jacob Fearnley achieved his first US Open main-draw victory, overcoming nerves, a heckler, and a challenging service game to defeat veteran Roberto Bautista Agut in a late-night battle. The 24-year-old Scot, whose ranking has rapidly climbed into the top 50, struggled with 16 double faults across the first three sets but managed to reset in the fourth to secure the win. Fearnley, who will now face German third seed Alexander Zverev, acknowledged that high-tension moments contribute to his serving issues. Despite his inexperience at this level, he believes playing on big courts in high-stakes environments will ultimately help him address his serve and continue his rapid ascent in the sport.</p>

          <p>A report from SAP Concur reveals contrasting travel trends to the United States: leisure travel has decreased this year, yet business travel remains stable and shows a slight increase. The U.S. was the leading destination for global business travelers in the first half of 2025, capturing 15% of all business air travel bookings, significantly surpassing countries like Germany and the United Kingdom. This steady rise in corporate travel, including a consistent volume from Canada, suggests that business interests in the U.S. are largely immune to the negative travel sentiments prevalent in other parts of the world. Despite a minor deceleration in overall global business travel growth, the U.S. continues to be a magnet for corporate visitors. (not investment advice)</p>
