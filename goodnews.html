          <p>Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is expected to start the season opener against the Houston Texans after recovering from a back issue, showing no setbacks in recent workouts. However, the availability of left tackle Alaric Jackson, crucial for Stafford's protection, remains uncertain as he will return to full-team drills next week following blood-clot issues. Jackson's ability to manage his condition under increased workload will determine his playing status, with the team hoping for a trajectory similar to Stafford's recovery. Coach Sean McVay expressed optimism about Stafford's readiness, highlighting the importance of a strong offensive line for the Super Bowl contender.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that the share of working Californians represented by unions has remained stable, ranging between 16% and 18% over the past two decades, contrasting with a nationwide decline in union membership. Researchers attribute California's resilience to consistent new organizing efforts, particularly in the medical industry and at companies like Starbucks. While some unions, such as United Food and Commercial Workers, experienced declines due to automation, the state's proactive union activity has largely counteracted national trends. This stability highlights California's unique labor landscape compared to the broader U.S.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump met with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, emphasizing a "100%" U.S. commitment to South Korea and discussing trade and national security. Trump touted his "great relationship" with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, expressing a desire for another meeting to achieve "big progress." The leaders also touched on boosting the shipbuilding industry, with Trump suggesting the U.S. would buy South Korean ships, although he remained firm on a 15% tariff rate from a recent trade deal. This bilateral meeting occurred amidst Trump's earlier social media comments about a "purge" in South Korea.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump met with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, reiterating his desire to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un "this year" and highlighting his "very good relationships" with Kim. Beyond trade and shipbuilding cooperation, Trump expressed a desire for the U.S. to take ownership of the land where American military bases are located in South Korea, urging the ally to pay more for hosting troops. The meeting, though seemingly friendly, followed Trump's earlier social media criticism of South Korea's government over alleged "vicious raids on churches" and an incident involving a US military base.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles city officials announced the arrest of several alleged South L.A. gang members, part of the "Rich Rollin’ Burglary Crew," accused of nearly 100 home and business break-ins since 2022, primarily on the city’s Westside. The gang allegedly targeted high-end jewelry, purses, and guns, selling the stolen goods for cash. A break in the case occurred in February with a vehicle pursuit and subsequent arrests, leading to the recovery of weapons and stolen items. Mayor Karen Bass praised the operation as a "major win" for the city, though police warned residents about social media displays making them targets for similar crimes.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball will introduce a Relief Pitcher of the Year award for each league starting in 2026, recognizing the significant transformation and increasing importance of this role in baseball. This new honor, the fifth annual award from the Baseball Writers’ Association of America, addresses a historical lack of recognition for relievers in major awards like MVP and Cy Young. While closers were honored more frequently in earlier decades, the award aims to acknowledge the evolving value of bullpen specialists, including setup relievers, in an era where starting pitchers average fewer innings. This move signifies a formal acknowledgment of the crucial impact relievers have on game outcomes.</p>
