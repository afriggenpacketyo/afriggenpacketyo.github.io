          <p>McDonald's is bringing back its popular Monopoly Game sweepstakes after a nearly ten-year hiatus, now featuring a digital component. Running from October 6 to November 2, customers can collect physical and digital game pieces from select purchases to win instant food prizes, cash prizes up to $1,000,000, and other significant rewards. The game's return comes after a fraud scheme halted it in 2016, and aims to connect with new generations while offering a modern twist to a nostalgic promotion. Pre-registration on the McDonald's app offers bonus rewards points.</p>

          <p>New technologies, including autonomous robots, advanced genetic sequencers, and machine-learning algorithms, are transforming how scientists track life on Earth. Researchers are now able to identify thousands of species, many previously unknown to science, by collecting environmental DNA and analyzing sounds or shapes. This revolution in biodiversity monitoring is crucial for cataloging Earth's estimated 8 million species, with a significant portion remaining undescribed, known as dark taxa. These tools help reveal the intricate ecological roles of even minute creatures, offering insights for new medicines and climate adaptation strategies, though human taxonomists remain essential for intuition and creativity.</p>

          <p>DuPont is making strategic moves ahead of its planned spin-off, including acquiring Sinochem RO Memtech to expand its reverse osmosis manufacturing in Asia. This acquisition aligns with DuPont's goal of increasing secular growth in its Healthcare and Water markets, which are expected to grow faster than its Building and Industrial segments. The company's electronics business, named Qnity, is set to spin off on November 1, with expectations that this separation will unlock significant shareholder value as Qnity's peers trade at higher multiples. Investors are advised to consider the potential for increased value post-split, but this is not investment advice.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-29 14:02:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Individuals aged 55 can generally purchase annuities, which are insurance contracts providing guaranteed income streams, offering a flexible option for retirement planning. Most at this age opt for deferred annuities, allowing for tax-deferred growth before income payments begin, potentially securing better rates due to a longer investment horizon. However, annuities are illiquid, often carrying surrender penalties for early withdrawals, which could limit financial flexibility for unexpected expenses. The decision depends on personal financial situation, risk tolerance, and existing retirement plans, making it crucial to weigh the long-term commitment against potential market growth and liquidity needs.

          <p>Mortgage interest rates have recently fallen to their lowest in three years, with the average 30-year term at 6.30%, offering new affordability for homebuyers. This drop presents a potential opportunity, especially as another Federal Reserve rate cut looks likely by the end of October, which could further lower rates. However, rates remain higher than early-decade lows, and market volatility driven by factors beyond the Fed could cause them to spike again. Homebuyers should weigh the benefits of current lower rates against the potential difficulties of transacting in the fall market, which typically sees weaker inventory and limited viewing opportunities.
