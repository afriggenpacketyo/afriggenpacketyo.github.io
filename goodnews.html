          <p>China has finished assembling the world's largest single-unit floating offshore wind turbine, a 16-megawatt system with domestically produced key components. The turbine's massive rotor has a diameter of 252 meters, covering an area equivalent to seven soccer fields. Once operational, it is projected to generate enough electricity to power over 4,000 American homes annually, marking a significant advancement in China's clean energy industry and its efforts to expand its marine economy.</p>

          <p>India and China have announced the resumption of direct flights between select cities by late October, ending a five-year suspension that began during the COVID-19 pandemic. The halt in air travel was prolonged by ongoing border tensions between the two nations, which peaked in 2020. This move, part of a gradual normalization of relations, follows Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit to China, signaling a thaw in diplomatic and economic ties between the two Asian powers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This review of Taylor Swift's new album, "The Life of a Showgirl," describes it as a work of expertly crafted pop and a form of "damage control" after the more divisive "The Tortured Poets Department." The article praises the slick production from collaborators Max Martin and Shellback, particularly on the lead single, but argues that the album lacks the raw, psychological depth of its predecessor. While some tracks are highlighted as standouts, the overall collection is seen as a retreat from vulnerability, with lyrics that feel less profound.</p>

          <p>A team of divers has discovered over 1,000 gold and silver coins, valued at an estimated $1 million, off the coast of Florida. The treasure is believed to be from a fleet of Spanish ships that sank in a hurricane in 1715 while transporting wealth from the colonies of Bolivia, Mexico, and Peru back to Spain. The find is historically significant as many of the coins still have visible dates and mint marks, providing valuable information for historians about the Spanish Empire's Golden Age.</p>

However, the article explores the potential impact on gamers, who have long criticized EA for a lack of innovation and aggressive monetization tactics like microtransactions. Analysts are divided on whether going private will lead to more creative risks or cause the company to double down on its profitable but controversial live-service and mobile gaming models to service its new debt.
