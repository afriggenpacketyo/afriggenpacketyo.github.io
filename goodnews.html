          <p>Qualcomm is set to re-enter the data center market with new processors designed to work with Nvidia's GPUs, targeting the growing demand for AI computing power. This move signifies Qualcomm's strategy to diversify beyond smartphones into chips for cars and PCs. The new CPU is custom-designed and based on Arm architecture, stemming from Qualcomm's acquisition of Nuvia in 2021. By linking with Nvidia's GPUs and software, Qualcomm aims to compete in the competitive data center CPU market, currently dominated by Intel and AMD, and also sees big cloud computing players like Amazon and Microsoft designing and deploying their own custom CPUs.</p>

          <p>Domestic energy prices in the UK are forecast to fall in July, marking the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that a typical household's annual bill for gas and electricity will decrease by ¬£129, nearly 7%. This would bring the typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit down to ¬£1,720 from the current level of ¬£1,849. The price cap is based on the cost of each unit of energy, not the total bill.</p>
