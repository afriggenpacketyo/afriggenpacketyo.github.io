        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Phillip C. Saunders and Joel Wuthnow of the New York Times, President Xi Jinping's ongoing purge of top military officials, including high-ranking officers in the Rocket Force and General He Weidong, casts doubt on China's ability to successfully invade Taiwan by 2027. The dismissals, potentially related to corruption or ideological differences, raise questions about the competence and reliability of Xi's commanders. While China's military has made significant advancements, the internal turmoil and lack of battlefield experience among officers may weaken Xi's appetite for war, offering Taiwan and the United States time to bolster their defenses.

          <p>The European Union (EU) intends to present a "roadmap" on Tuesday to phase out all current and future Russian gas deliveries to the bloc. This move comes as the EU aims to reduce its reliance on Russian gas, which has fallen out of favor due to Russia's war with Ukraine. The EU seeks to end its dependence on Russian gas by 2027, though legal complexities and existing contracts pose challenges. Currently, the EU imports approximately 19% of its gas from Russia, a significant decrease from 40% in 2022. Optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>Despite the absence of most American buyers, China's largest trade fair, the Canton Fair, achieved unexpected growth in deals signed, driven by a record high in overseas attendance. The fair's performance has boosted export sector confidence and strengthened belief in China's ability to cope with a prolonged trade war with the U.S. Over 64.9% of foreign visitors were from countries involved in China‚Äôs Belt and Road Initiative, accounting for more than 60% of the total transaction volume. Optimism score is 80.</p>

          <p>The New York Times article describes how Bangladesh's garment industry, a crucial driver of the nation's economy, faces significant challenges due to potential tariffs imposed by the United States. While President Trump paused these tariffs, the possibility of their reinstatement worries workers who depend on the industry for their livelihoods. The article highlights the resilience of Bangladeshi workers and the industry's efforts to improve safety and sustainability after the Rana Plaza collapse. Despite these efforts, tariffs threaten to disrupt the country's economic growth and stability. Optimism score is 60.</p>
