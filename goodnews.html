          <p>An administrative law judge has endorsed State Farm General's request to increase homeowner rates by 17% in California, citing financial losses from the January 7 fires in Los Angeles County. The ruling also recommends interim rate hikes for condo, renters, and landlord rental-dwelling insurance. The judge's decision is a recommendation to California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara, who has the final authority on the matter, and comes amid controversy and unhappiness among fire victims over State Farm's handling of claims. State Farm originally sought a 22% emergency rate hike.</p>

          <p>Roki Sasaki, the highly anticipated pitching prospect for the Los Angeles Dodgers, is experiencing a decline in his fastball velocity, causing concern among the team's coaching staff. After initially hitting 100 mph during his MLB debut in Japan, Sasaki's fastball has since averaged around 96 mph, sometimes dropping to the 92-93 mph range. This decline impacts the effectiveness of his fastball, which relies on velocity due to its lack of natural deception. The Dodgers are working with Sasaki to identify the root cause of the velocity drop and find a solution to improve his performance.</p>

          <p>Former FDA Commissioner Dr. David Kessler warns about the unknowns surrounding the long-term use of weight loss drugs, emphasizing the lack of data on how to safely discontinue or restart them. Kessler, who personally used GLP-1 drugs, highlights that the FDA approved these medications without a comprehensive long-term strategy. He underscores that these drugs, which condition the brain to desire less food by inducing nausea, are just one tool in a larger health journey. He advises that individuals on these drugs should be under the care of a doctor, nutritionist, and dietitian, expressing concern that not everyone can afford such comprehensive care.</p>

The columnist, who personally experienced a childhood stammer, advises readers to reach for this "bright splinter of untouchability" when anxiety arises, allowing them to observe their experience without being consumed by it. By watching themselves go through the anxiety, individuals can eventually detach from it and find relief.</p>

          <p>Independent test results confirm that drinking water in fire-affected areas around Altadena and the Pacific Palisades is largely free of harmful contaminants, leading to the lifting of the last "do not drink" notice by an Altadena utility. Researchers found only one home with benzene levels slightly above the state's allowable limit, which is still below the federal limit. Experts attribute the successful restoration to the hard work of local utilities and state regulators, following a post-fire playbook developed after previous wildfires.
