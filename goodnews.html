          <p>West Point's decision to replace "duty, honor, country" with "Army Values" in its mission statement is facing renewed criticism. Judicial Watch alleges the change was part of a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) agenda and that the school attempted to conceal this motivation. However, West Point maintains that the change was not politically driven and that "duty, honor, country" remains the academy's motto. The controversy underscores ongoing debates about the role of DEI initiatives in military institutions.</p>
