          <p>Scientists in China have successfully created high-purity hexagonal diamonds, a rare structure first found in meteorites. This laboratory breakthrough, detailed in the journal Nature, produced crystals up to 100 micrometers in size, providing definitive proof of the material's macroscopic existence. This achievement culminates years of global research efforts to replicate the unique atomic stacking of these diamonds, which are believed to form under the immense pressure of meteorite impacts. The accomplishment marks a significant step forward in materials science.</p>

          <p>Firefighters have made significant progress against the 5,370-acre Canyon fire near the Los Angeles and Ventura county line, reaching 28% containment. This progress allowed for the lifting of evacuation orders for thousands of residents, although warnings and air quality advisories remain in effect. The fire, which started during a heat wave, destroyed two structures and injured three firefighters. Crews are capitalizing on cooler overnight temperatures but remain cautious due to low fuel moisture and rugged terrain.</p>

The model aims to create more meaningful connections by matching attendees into small groups based on an algorithm that considers interests and personality traits. These events, which can draw hundreds of people, are part of a growing "IRL" trend as users seek alternatives to online interactions. Rout's venture taps into a market of people who, like her, desire more accountability and kindness than they find in the virtual dating world.</p>

          <p>Actor Chris Hemsworth has described learning he has a significantly higher genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's disease as a pivotal moment that shifted his life's motivations. The discovery, made during the filming of his show "Limitless," revealed he carries two copies of the APOE4 gene, increasing his likelihood of developing the disorder by eight to ten times. Hemsworth stated the news prompted him to re-evaluate his purpose, focusing more on what he contributes rather than collects. This change in mindset has reportedly influenced the second season of his show, making it a more personal and experiential journey.</p>

          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is reportedly booming as people seek mood boosts during periods of economic instability. This behavior involves spending on both small, affordable luxuries like makeup and larger, memorable experiences such as concerts. An evolution of the "lipstick effect," this trend is driven by a desire to inject moments of joy into uncertain times, with consumers sometimes cutting back on daily essentials to afford these treats. Economists note that with traditional life milestones like home ownership feeling less attainable, people are shifting to celebrating smaller "inch-stones" instead. (not investment advice)</p>

He also served as the command module pilot for Apollo 8, the first mission to orbit the Moon, from which he famously described Earth as a "grand oasis."

          <p>A fire that broke out in the historic Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba, Spain, was successfully extinguished by firefighters, averting a potential catastrophe. The blaze reportedly started in one of the chapels, possibly due to a short circuit in an electric sweeper. The rapid response prevented significant damage to the UNESCO World Heritage site, a jewel of Islamic architecture that was converted to a cathedral in the 13th century. The incident drew comparisons to the 2019 fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, but fortunately had a much less destructive outcome.</p>

Commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi, and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov are scheduled for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. This marks a change from previous Atlantic landings, a decision made by SpaceX to ensure any debris falls harmlessly away from populated areas. During their 148-day mission, the crew conducted over 200 scientific experiments and handed over command of the station to their replacements.</p>
