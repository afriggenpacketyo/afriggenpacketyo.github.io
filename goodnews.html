          <p>Following significant pressure from the public and lawmakers, President Trump has requested the Department of Justice to seek the unsealing of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein. Attorney General Pam Bondi formally filed a motion to release the transcripts, citing intense public interest in the case. This move comes as Trump simultaneously sues The Wall Street Journal for defamation over a report about a letter he allegedly sent to Epstein, and as bipartisan calls for transparency on the matter intensify. Lawmakers argue the release is crucial for restoring public trust in government.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced that Kyiv formally proposed a new round of peace talks with Moscow, suggesting they take place next week to increase momentum toward a ceasefire. This diplomatic initiative comes as Ukraine continues to face intense Russian aggression, with Zelenskyy reporting that Russia launched approximately 300 drones and 30 missiles in recent overnight attacks. The article also notes that Ukraine has evacuated 43 of its citizens from a Georgian holding site after they were deported from Russia, and Australia is delivering Abrams tanks to aid Kyiv's defense.</p>

          <p>A.P. Deauville has voluntarily recalled more than 67,000 cases of its Power Stick brand deodorant products due to deviations from the FDA's Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations.

The FDA has published the specific lot numbers for the affected products, which include "power fresh," "spring fresh," and "original nourishing" varieties.

          <p>According to an SEC filing, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sold another 75,000 shares of the company's stock, valued at approximately $12.94 million. This transaction is part of a pre-arranged trading plan established in March, under which Huang intends to sell up to 6 million shares. The sale follows a recent surge in Nvidia's market value, which has surpassed $4 trillion, driven by high demand for its AI-powering graphics processing units.

          <p>The British and Irish Lions defeated the Wallabies 27-19 in their first Test match, driven by what coach Andy Farrell called an "immense" performance from flankers Tadhg Beirne and Tom Curry. Curry, in particular, delivered a dominant and aggressive performance, setting a physical tone from the start and scoring a try before being substituted. Despite a late-game dip in performance after building a significant lead, the Lions' early intensity was enough to secure the crucial win in Brisbane. The players' physicality was highlighted as a key factor in overcoming the Australian side.</p>

          <p>Major champions Bryson DeChambeau and Henrik Stenson have voiced frustration with the R&A's enforcement of slow-play rules during the third round of The Open. Both golfers' groups were warned by officials for their pace, a day after another player received a controversial penalty. Stenson criticized the inconsistency, noting that long rounds on the first two days were ignored, while a minor delay on Saturday prompted a warning. DeChambeau called the first two rounds "out of control" and advocated for a fairer system that times every individual shot to address the issue more effectively.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Generation Life, a group of young, college-aged Christian activists who travel to the Jersey shore to advocate for chastity before marriage. The activists engage with beachgoers, attempting to connect over shared anxieties about modern dating, social media, and the search for meaningful relationships. Rather than leading with abstinence pledges, they focus on broader themes of "dignity" and seeing people beyond their physical appearance. The piece explores their countercultural mission in an era of shifting sexual norms and how they adapt their message for a generation grappling with a "sex recession."</p>
