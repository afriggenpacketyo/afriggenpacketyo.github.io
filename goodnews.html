          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to reduce its monthly government bond purchases further beyond April of next year, but will do so at a slower pace while maintaining its current interest rate. The central bank will scale back its debt buying by 200 billion yen per quarter, a decrease from the current 400 billion yen, aiming for a total purchase amount of approximately 2 trillion yen by early 2027. Amid economic uncertainties and concerns about U.S. tariffs impacting Japan's export-oriented economy, the BOJ opted to keep its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 0.5 percent during its two-day meeting. The decision to review the pace of bond-buying follows a surge in yields on super long-term government bonds, partly due to concerns about Japan's fiscal health. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung are scheduled to meet on Tuesday during the Group of Seven leaders' summit in Canada. This marks their first face-to-face meeting since Lee succeeded impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol earlier in June. During a phone conversation last week, both leaders expressed a shared desire for stable development in bilateral relations, which have seen improvement after previous tensions related to wartime history and territory. This year commemorates the 60th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic ties between the Asian neighbors, who were previously strained due to Japan's colonial rule over the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold has emerged as the leading safe-haven asset, outperforming traditional options like the Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and U.S. Treasurys, with spot prices surging 30% in 2025. Experts at the Asia Pacific Precious Metals Conference attribute gold's appeal to its independence from government liabilities, contrasting with currencies and bonds that are tied to specific economies. Instability and uncertainty, particularly developments in the Middle East, have fueled demand for gold, while confidence in U.S. assets has been shaken by volatile policymaking. Gold's advantage lies in its lack of susceptibility to high debt-to-GDP ratios and its apolitical nature, making it a favored choice amidst global economic and political uncertainties.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has ruled that directives from the Trump administration, which led to the cancellation of several research grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), were "void" and "illegal". The judge stated that the cancellation of grants related to LGBTQ+ issues, gender identity, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) violated federal law, constituting discrimination. The ruling mandates the NIH to restore the terminated grants, which some estimates suggest amounted to $1.8 billion in research funding. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has expressed disagreement with the ruling and is exploring legal options, while plaintiffs like Dr. Brittany Charlton, whose grants were terminated, expressed relief and hope.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England (BoE) is widely expected to hold interest rates steady at 4.25% this week, as policymakers assess rising geopolitical risks, persistent inflation, and conflicting domestic economic data. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will announce its decision on Thursday, with markets anticipating a continuation of its ‚Äúgradual and careful‚Äù approach to easing policy. The central bank faces a complex global and domestic backdrop, including rising oil prices and a strengthening pound, while domestic economic data presents a mixed picture with recent contraction and fluctuating wage growth. Economists suggest monetary policy is in a good position, allowing the Bank of England to wait and see how economic conditions and the international political backdrop evolve.

          <p>A Chinese team of scientists has successfully used a 2-watt laser on a satellite in stationary orbit to transmit data to Earth at 1Gbps, which is five times faster than Starlink. The satellite, located 36,000 kilometers above Earth, achieved this feat despite atmospheric turbulence, which typically scatters light and weakens signals. The team, led by Professor Wu Jian and Liu Chao, utilized a combination of adaptive optics (AO) and mode diversity reception (MDR) to overcome these challenges. This "groundbreaking" solution, known as AO-MDR synergy, marks a significant advancement in satellite laser downlink technology.</p>

          <p>Wildlife enthusiasts have installed swift boxes on church buildings in Essex to encourage the endangered birds to nest, aiming to boost their declining numbers. Swifts were added to the UK's red list of birds most in need of conservation after their population declined by 66% between 1995 and 2022. Conservationists attribute the decline to changes in farming methods, a drop in insect populations, and fewer nesting sites in tall buildings. The swift boxes are designed to be non-invasive to church structures and to provide safe nesting environments for the birds, which spend most of their lives in flight.</p>

While Britain is exempt from the global tariff of 50% on steel and aluminum, a 25% tariff remains, with ongoing negotiations to remove this technicality. The agreement also includes reciprocal access to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef being sold each way, ensuring British farmers can export beef to the US without changes to food safety standards.</p>
