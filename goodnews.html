          <p>In Inner Mongolia, China is deploying a fleet of 100 self-driving, photovoltaic-battery-powered trucks at the Yimin open-pit coal mine. This initiative addresses a shortage of drivers and improves safety in dangerous conditions, as younger generations show declining interest in the profession. The Yimin mine, one of China's largest, previously required 1,200 drivers operating 300 trucks around the clock. This upgrade is part of China's broader push to digitally transform its coal industry and construct intelligent mines, aligning with strategic goals outlined by central government agencies in 2020. The project highlights China's commitment to modernizing traditional industries using advanced technologies amidst a shrinking and aging workforce.</p>

          <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has saved over $5 million annually by identifying and eliminating unused software licenses across various agencies. For example, the IRS had 3,000 software licenses but only used 25, leading to a 99% reduction in licenses. Similar cuts were made at the Department of Labor and the Securities and Exchange Commission, resulting in significant savings. These audits, continuously conducted since February, have contributed to an estimated $175 billion in savings due to asset sales, contract cancellations, and fraud payment reductions, translating to about $1,087 per taxpayer (not investment advice).</p>

Speaking in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Trump stated the move would boost the local steel industry and national supply, decreasing reliance on China. Trump also mentioned a $14 billion investment in the area's steel production through a partnership between U.S. Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel, though he has yet to approve the final deal.
