          <p>Prince Harry met with his father, King Charles, for a private, 50-minute meeting at Clarence House, marking their first face-to-face interaction since February 2024. The meeting is viewed as a potential step toward reconciliation amid a well-publicized family rift, following Harry's previous statements expressing a desire to rebuild relationships. This brief reunion occurred while Harry was in the UK for charity events, shortly after the King's cancer diagnosis last year prompted their last meeting. Buckingham Palace has declined to provide further details on the private discussion.</p>

          <p>The sandwich chain Potbelly is set to be acquired by convenience store operator RaceTrac in an all-cash deal valued at $566 million. The acquisition, which values Potbelly shares at a significant 47% premium, caused the company's stock to surge over 30% following the announcement. Potbelly, with over 445 stores, aims to expand to 2,000 locations, a goal that its CEO believes will be fortified by RaceTrac's strategic vision and commitment to quality. The deal is expected to be finalized in the fourth quarter of the year, providing immediate value to Potbelly shareholders.</p>

          <p>Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison has overtaken Elon Musk as the world's wealthiest individual, with his net worth reaching $393 billion. This shift occurred after Oracle's shares surged more than 40% following a highly optimistic outlook for its cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence businesses. The company's stock soared due to a reported spike in demand from AI companies for its data centers. Meanwhile, Elon Musk's fortune stands at $385 billion, as his primary asset, Tesla, has faced stock declines amid changing EV policies and consumer backlash.</p>

          <p>The White House is requesting that Congress undo a spending cap on Washington D.C. that was inadvertently passed in March, which created a $1.1 billion funding shortfall. The error reverted the city's spending authority to 2024 levels, despite its 2025 budget already being passed, forcing local leaders to scramble to avoid service cuts. This budget fix is part of an anomaly request sent to lawmakers as they negotiate a stopgap bill to prevent a government shutdown. The move follows improved relations between President Trump and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who recently extended cooperation with federal law enforcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Under new manager Thomas Tuchel, England's national football team has shown a more aggressive and risk-taking tactical style, winning all five World Cup qualifiers without conceding a goal. The team's impressive 5-0 victory against Serbia highlighted Tuchel's refined principles, which emphasize direct, attacking play and off-the-ball running to create space. Tuchel has prioritized selecting players who fit his system, such as wingers adept at one-on-one situations, and has leveraged domestic club partnerships for on-field chemistry. While the team's defense against sustained pressure from top-tier opponents remains untested, the tactical foundation appears strong ahead of the World Cup.</p>

          <p>Swedish fintech company Klarna saw its shares jump 30% in its New York Stock Exchange debut, opening at $52 after pricing its IPO above the expected range at $40 per share. The offering raised $1.37 billion and valued the 'buy now, pay later' giant at approximately $15 billion. The successful launch continues a trend of strong tech IPOs this year, signaling robust investor demand for new offerings. Klarna's public entry will test Wall Street's confidence in its expansion into banking services, including a new debit card and deposit accounts in the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's direct control over Washington D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department, initiated 30 days ago as a "public safety emergency," is set to expire. The takeover, which involved activating the National Guard and deploying federal officers to crack down on crime, will not be extended by Congress. Statistics from the Justice Department indicate that 2,310 arrests were made and overall crime fell by 15% during the period. Despite the expiration, hundreds of federal officers and National Guard troops are expected to remain in the city, and the move has drawn criticism and a lawsuit from the city's attorney general.</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has acquitted Choi Mal-ja, now 79, six decades after she was convicted of grievous bodily harm for biting off part of her sexual attacker's tongue in self-defense. In 1964, at age 19, Choi was attacked by a man who was convicted only of trespassing and intimidation. The court has now ruled that her actions constituted justifiable self-defense against an unjust infringement on her bodily integrity. Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi sought a retrial in 2020, and after a lengthy campaign, South Korea's top court ordered the case to be reheard, leading to her exoneration.</p>

          <p>The producer price index (PPI), which measures inflation at the wholesale level, unexpectedly fell by 0.1% in August, contrary to economists' expectations of a 0.3% increase. This marks the third time this year the gauge has shown deflation, with the core PPI also declining. The report provides positive news on inflation fundamentals, particularly a 0.2% drop in the services sector, which drives most of the U.S. economy. The tame reading has intensified market expectations for an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its upcoming meeting (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>NASA's Perseverance rover has discovered rocks on Mars containing organic carbon and mineral compounds that represent the strongest candidate yet for potential signs of ancient microbial life. The sample, collected from a dry river channel in Jezero Crater, contains iron phosphate and iron sulfide, which on Earth are byproducts of microorganisms consuming organic matter. Scientists emphasize that non-biological processes could also be responsible and that conclusive analysis requires returning the samples to Earth. This ambitious sample-return mission is currently on hold as NASA explores more cost-effective options for retrieval.</p>
