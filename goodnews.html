          <p>European stocks saw slight gains, buoyed by an 8% surge in Anglo American shares after the company announced a "merger of equals" with Canada's Teck Resources. The new entity, Anglo Teck, will be headquartered in Canada and aims to become a global leader in copper production. This deal, which will see Anglo American shareholders own 62.4% of the combined company, is expected to provide significant benefits for Canada, strengthening its position in critical minerals. Investors also monitored ongoing political turmoil in France, though the merger was the primary driver. (not investment advice)</p>
