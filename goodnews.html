          <p>Charlie Javice, the founder of the student financial aid startup Frank, has been sentenced to over seven years in prison for fraud. She was found guilty of grossly inflating her company's user base to secure a $175 million acquisition by JPMorgan Chase in 2021. The bank later discovered that Frank had fewer than 300,000 actual customers, not the claimed five million. During the sentencing, Javice expressed deep remorse for her actions, which prosecutors described as a crime scene fueled by greed that embarrassed the major financial institution.</p>

          <p>A Chinese businesswoman, Qian Zhimin, has pleaded guilty in a London court to charges related to a massive bitcoin fraud scheme valued at approximately $7.4 billion. The case involves what is believed to be the world's largest single cryptocurrency seizure. According to London's Metropolitan Police, Qian orchestrated the fraud in China between 2014 and 2017, defrauding over 128,000 victims. She then fled to the UK using false documents and attempted to launder the illicitly obtained funds by purchasing property before her eventual arrest.</p>

          <p>During an interview for CBS's '60 Minutes,' UFC President Dana White engaged in a high-stakes baccarat session at the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas. While being filmed, White initially went down $1.24 million while betting $400,000 per hand. However, his luck dramatically reversed, and he ultimately left the table with a profit of $700,000. The segment also touched on White's management of the UFC, including his staunch defense of free speech for his fighters and his opposition to 'cancel culture,' which he believes unfairly seeks to destroy people's lives over mistakes.</p>

          <h2>Stress Expert Suggests Helping Others is the Most Effective Way to Manage Stress</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-29 15:15:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A stress physiologist argues that the most effective way to manage stress is not through inward-focused self-care but by channeling stress-related energy outward to help others. This approach, termed 'stress springboarding,' leverages the hormone oxytocin, which is released during stress and motivates social connection. Research cited in the article indicates that workplace wellness programs encouraging charity or volunteer work are uniquely successful in improving well-being. By focusing on contributing to one's community, individuals can activate reward centers in the brain and reduce activity in stress-related regions.</p>

          <p>After leading Team Europe to a second consecutive Ryder Cup victory, Captain Luke Donald has not ruled out serving a third term for the 2027 event in Ireland. Donald became the first European captain since 1987 to win back-to-back titles, a feat made more notable by winning both at home and away. In an interview, he also addressed the unruly behavior of some American fans, praising the U.S. team for attempting to quiet the crowd. Donald stated he will take time to consider the decision, while players have lauded his leadership as being difficult to follow.</p>

          <p>Scientists are increasingly using a suite of advanced technologies, including drones, environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis, and artificial intelligence, to catalog Earth's vast biodiversity at an unprecedented scale. These tools allow researchers to identify millions of species, many previously unknown to science, by collecting genetic material from the air or analyzing sounds and images. This technological revolution is crucial for understanding ecosystems and addressing the biodiversity crisis, as many species face extinction due to climate change. However, the effort is hampered by a shortage of human taxonomists and underfunded natural history collections.</p>

While a direct U.S. landfall is not expected, swells from the storm are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along much of the East Coast.</p>

          <p>This article examines whether purchasing an annuity at age 55 is a feasible or advisable retirement strategy. It confirms that individuals at this age can indeed buy annuities, often opting for deferred annuities that allow funds to grow tax-deferred until retirement. The potential advantages include locking in rates and having a longer period for growth, which can provide peace of mind. However, it also cautions that annuities are illiquid investments with surrender periods, which could limit financial flexibility for unexpected expenses before retirement.</p>

However, market volatility could cause rates to rise again, and the fall season typically presents challenges with lower housing inventory. With the Federal Reserve likely to cut rates again at the end of October, buyers must weigh the benefits of acting now against the potential for future changes. (not investment advice)</p>
