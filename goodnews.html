          <h2>Senator Blackburn Aims to Curb Birth Tourism with New Legislation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 21:18:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Marsha Blackburn has introduced the Ban Birth Tourism Act, seeking to prevent foreign nationals from exploiting U.S. immigration laws by entering the country solely to give birth and obtain citizenship for their children. The bill aims to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act, declaring such individuals inadmissible while protecting legitimate medical travelers. This initiative aligns with the Trump administration's focus on immigration integrity and addresses concerns about the industry's impact on the immigration system. The bill seeks to codify the inadmissibility of travelers exploiting this loophole. </p>

          <h2>FDA to Restrict COVID Vaccine Access to High-Risk Groups, Demanding More Data on Younger Adults</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 21:15:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will approve COVID vaccines for adults over 65 and those with certain medical conditions this fall, but may require additional studies before approving the shots for healthy Americans younger than 65. This decision marks a shift from the previous policy of recommending annual COVID shots for everyone aged 6 months and older. Some experts worry that the new criteria are overly restrictive and will deny access to people who want to be vaccinated, while others support the agency's rationale. The agency anticipates the need for new clinical trials in which participants under 65 are randomly assigned to receive the new shots or a placebo. </p>

General Michael Guetlein of the Space Force will oversee the project's implementation.
