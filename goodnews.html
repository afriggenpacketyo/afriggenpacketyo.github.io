          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to maintain its policy interest rate at 2.5%, pausing to assess the effects of recent measures aimed at cooling Seoul's overheated housing market. Housing prices in the capital spiked over 19% annually in June, prompting authorities to address the rapid growth in household debt. Although South Korea's economy experienced a slight contraction in the first quarter, the central bank prioritized financial stability over stimulating growth. The bank cited the need to evaluate risks associated with the housing market and potential volatility in the foreign exchange market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Law enforcement in Minnesota arrested two men after seizing almost 900 pounds of suspected methamphetamine, valued at approximately $1.7 million. Authorities are calling it one of the largest meth busts in the state's history. The operation involved two separate traffic stops following an undercover purchase from one of the suspects. Investigators believe the two men, Joel Casas-Santiago and Guillermo Mercado Chaparro, are connected to a larger drug trafficking organization based in Mexico. The seizure is part of a broader federal focus on targeting violent crime and drug trafficking rings.</p>

          <p>A tentative contract agreement has been reached between the city of Philadelphia and its blue-collar workers, ending an eight-day strike that disrupted city services. The strike by 9,000 workers, including sanitation employees and 911 dispatchers, had led to trash piling up across the city. The new three-year deal includes a 3% raise in each year and a one-time $1,500 bonus, which is significantly less than the union's initial demands. First-term Mayor Cherelle Parker stood firm on the city's fiscal limits, and workers began returning to their jobs immediately after the agreement was announced.</p>

          <p>AI chipmaker Nvidia briefly became the first company ever to achieve a $4 trillion market capitalization, underscoring its dominant role in the new industrial revolution powered by artificial intelligence. The company's value has surged as its GPUs are considered essential for developing and running advanced AI models, making it the world's most valuable company ahead of Microsoft and Apple. CNBC's Jim Cramer noted that Nvidia's technology is making other systems obsolete and will transform business operations, from robotics to autonomous vehicles. The company's products are also seen as a key U.S. bargaining chip in trade relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Amazon Web Services Develops Custom Hardware to Cool Next-Generation Nvidia AI Chips</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 18:40:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, has engineered its own custom cooling hardware, called the In-Row Heat Exchanger (IRHX), to manage the immense heat generated by Nvidia's next-generation AI processors. As the demand for powerful GPUs accelerates, traditional cooling methods are becoming insufficient, and commercial liquid-cooling solutions were deemed inadequate for AWS's scale. This development allows AWS to efficiently deploy dense computing racks, like Nvidia's GB200 NVL72 system, in its data centers. The move reflects a broader trend of cloud giants designing their own infrastructure to optimize performance and reduce reliance on third-party suppliers.</p>
