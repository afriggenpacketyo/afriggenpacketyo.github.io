          <p>Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, recently sold approximately $36.4 million worth of the company's stock, part of a pre-established plan to sell up to six million shares. This transaction comes as his personal net worth has surged to $143 billion, placing him nearly on par with Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett. The sale coincides with Nvidia's historic achievement of becoming the first company to exceed a $4 trillion market capitalization, driven by the booming demand for its AI-powering chips. Huang still retains over 858 million shares in the company through various holdings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A German backpacker, Carolina Wilga, has been found alive after being missing for 12 days in the Australian outback. She vanished on June 29 near Beacon, a remote town north of Perth, after her vehicle was found abandoned. An extensive search was conducted, and Wilga was ultimately found by a passing motorist on a regional road. She was suffering from exhaustion, dehydration, and hunger with minor injuries, and was subsequently airlifted to a hospital in Perth for medical treatment and recovery. Police confirmed she was safe and well after the ordeal.</p>

          <p>London's Gatwick Airport marked a milestone by welcoming its first-ever all-electric flight. The aircraft, a two-seater Pipistrel Velis Electro, landed at the airport as part of a 17-day tour around France. The plane is commercially approved for pilot training and other operations, representing a step forward in sustainable aviation. The event aligns with Gatwick's broader decarbonization strategy, which includes a £250 million program to achieve net-zero emissions and transition its entire 300-vehicle fleet to electric by 2030, demonstrating a commitment to a more sustainable future for air travel.</p>

The installations, such as a series depicting bus stops with and without proper shade, aim to provoke thought on historical planning decisions and inspire a vision for a greener, more equitable future for Los Angeles.

          <p>A commentary piece addresses the recent culture war backlash against the new “Superman” movie, which some critics have labeled “superwoke” for its focus on the character being an immigrant. The author argues that this criticism is overblown, as Superman’s origin has always been an immigrant story, created by children of Jewish immigrants. The article contends that the film's core themes are about kindness and the hero's choices, shaped by his upbringing in America's heartland, rather than radical politics. It suggests the controversy ignores the character's long history and the film's actual narrative focus on assimilation and values.</p>
