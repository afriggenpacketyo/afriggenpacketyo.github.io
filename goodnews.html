          <p>Jos√© Mujica, the former president of Uruguay, has died at the age of 89; he served from 2010 to 2015 and was known for his humble lifestyle and progressive policies. A former guerrilla fighter, Mujica refused to live in the presidential estate, opting instead for his rural farm, and donated most of his salary to housing projects. During his presidency, Uruguay legalized abortion, gay marriage, and marijuana, earning him international recognition. Mujica's political career began in the Tupamaro urban guerrilla movement, leading to over a decade in prison before transitioning to mainstream politics and ultimately the presidency.</p>

          <p>Three key House committees are working to finalize a major budget package aimed at addressing President Trump's priorities in defense, energy, and tax. The package includes changes to Medicaid and food stamps to offset tax cuts, but Republicans remain divided on issues such as Medicaid overhaul and a tax deduction expiring in December. Democrats are criticizing the proposed Medicaid cuts, arguing they will negatively impact vulnerable populations, while conservative Republicans are pushing for steeper cuts. The White House has called for Republicans to unify behind the bill, but significant disagreements remain.</p>

EToro's Nasdaq debut, under the ticker symbol ETOR, will test the market's appetite for new offerings after previous IPO plans were shelved due to tariff uncertainty.

          <p>A forthcoming book titled ‚ÄúOriginal Sin‚Äù by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson details concerns about former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.‚Äôs mental and physical decline while in office. The book recounts instances where Biden forgot names of longtime aides and allies and appeared frail in meetings, leading to aides wrapping him in a protective political cocoon. Despite these concerns, the book notes that few Biden allies were willing to speak openly about his decline, even after his defeat. The authors suggest that powerful figures in the Democratic Party either misjudged the situation or declined to address the issue.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has unveiled his cabinet, promising "decisive action" on his ambitious economic agenda, amid a trade war with the US. The new cabinet of 28 ministers and 10 secretaries of state heralds some significant changes, including a new foreign minister to handle the US-Canada relationship. The reshuffle, two weeks after the election, brings some familiar names as well as political newcomers - a team "purpose-built for this hinge moment", Carney told reporters. The cabinet maintains gender parity, and includes fresh faces in key roles such as housing, immigration, and energy.</p>

          <p>President Trump often takes maximalist positions, only to back down and declare a win. His opponents are catching on. As President Trump backs off from his initial demands, China, Russia, and Iran appear to be honing their strategies after watching Mr. Trump in action. Emissaries from those countries are hinting to Mr. Trump‚Äôs negotiator, Steve Witkoff, that there may be some investment opportunities for Americans if the United States eases off its demands. Mr. Trump has long reveled in his reputation as a maximalist, issuing a huge demand, creating a crisis and setting off a high-pressure negotiation.</p>

          <h2>Inflation Rate Rises by 2.3% in April, CPI Report Shows</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index in April rose 2.3% on an annual basis, rising less than economists had expected yet still reflecting price hikes that remain above the Federal Reserve's goal of bringing down inflation to a 2% rate. The CPI was forecast to rise 2.4% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. April's reading reflects the lowest level since February 2021, government data shows. On a month-over-month basis, the CPI rose 0.2%, lighter than the 0.3% pace forecast by economists. Housing costs were a major driver of inflation last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.</p>
