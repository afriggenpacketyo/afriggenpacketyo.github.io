        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has granted expedited refugee status to a small subset of Afrikaners from South Africa, citing violence and discrimination. This decision has sparked controversy, with claims of a 'White genocide' being circulated by right-wing groups, a narrative not widely supported within the Afrikaner community. CBS News reports that South African police data indicates that the majority of murder victims on farms are Black laborers or security workers, not white farmers. The situation is further complicated by discussions of land expropriation and the South African government's stance against Israel, leading to questions about the motives behind the refugee program.</p>
