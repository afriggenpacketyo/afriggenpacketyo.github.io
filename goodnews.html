Rodgers delivered a strong performance with 244 passing yards and four touchdowns, marking his second consecutive game with that many scoring passes. When asked about the significance of defeating the Jets, whose coach had previously doubted his fit with the team, Rodgers quipped that he was "happy to beat everybody associated with the Jets." He emphasized that his main goal was to enjoy the game with his new teammates and rediscover his competitive spirit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cultural influence of the American South is expanding nationwide, evident in trends like northern students flocking to southern universities and the mainstream rise of southern music genres. This cultural shift is rooted in decades of political, logistical, and technological changes, including the civil rights movement, the development of the highway system, and the widespread adoption of air conditioning. These factors facilitated economic growth and population increases, attracting businesses with incentives like union-unfriendly policies. This migration and economic integration have propelled southern aesthetics, from hip-hop to country music, into the national spotlight, reshaping the American cultural landscape.</p>

          <p>Following Angela Rayner's resignation, the UK Labour Party is preparing for a contest to elect a new deputy leader, with the party's ruling committee set to establish the rules and timetable. Former deputy leader Harriet Harman has stated that the replacement should be a woman from outside London to broaden the leadership's reach and complement Sir Keir Starmer. The contest was triggered by Rayner's departure after an investigation found she breached the ministerial code regarding a stamp duty payment. Several high-profile figures, including Dame Emily Thornberry and Louise Haigh, are considered potential candidates in a race that could influence the party's future direction.</p>

          <p>England's cricket coach, Brendon McCullum, has stated that the team for the first Ashes Test against Australia, which begins on November 21, has not yet been finalized. One of the key decisions involves the number three batting position, with selectors choosing between vice-captain Ollie Pope and 21-year-old Jacob Bethell. Bethell recently scored his first professional century and is seen as a promising talent with significant future potential. McCullum emphasized that while Bethell has adapted quickly to international cricket, the final decision on the Ashes XI will be made closer to the series in Australia.</p>

          <p>China's top economic planning agency has unveiled an ambitious plan to become a global leader in the application of artificial intelligence within the energy sector by 2030. The National Development and Reform Commission aims to develop at least five industry-specific AI models for power grids, coal, oil, and gas by 2027. The strategy involves creating AI innovation platforms, training specialists, and identifying over 100 potential application scenarios to drive technological breakthroughs. This initiative is part of Beijing's broader effort to integrate cutting-edge technology into critical industries and establish a unique innovation model tailored to its national conditions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread discussion about artificial intelligence transforming the workforce, economists suggest its overall impact on the labor market has been relatively small so far. Recent job market weakness is attributed more to general economic uncertainty than to AI-driven layoffs, which have been largely concentrated within the tech industry itself. An analysis shows that early-career workers in AI-exposed fields have seen some employment decline, but more experienced workers have not. Experts advise that for AI to be considered a broad threat, its impact would need to extend significantly into other major sectors like retail and marketing. (not investment advice)</p>

The mural's appearance shortly follows the arrests of nearly 900 people at a protest against the ban on the group Palestine Action, though the artwork does not reference a specific cause.

Coca-Cola has launched a "Made in Germany" campaign featuring its German employees, highlighting that most of its products sold in the country are bottled locally. Similarly, McDonald's is stressing its reliance on German agricultural sourcing.
