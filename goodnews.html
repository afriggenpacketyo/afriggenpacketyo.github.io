          <p>A large fire broke out at St Michael's Hospital in Bristol, leading to the evacuation of pregnant women and babies. The fire, which started on the roof and destroyed solar panels, was extinguished by firefighters. Women were moved outside the building, supported by midwives, while some were relocated to the Bristol University Life Sciences building. The hospital, including the delivery suite, has reopened, and individuals with appointments should attend as planned. The cause of the fire is under investigation, and the public was asked to avoid the area.</p>

          <p>The Navy has reversed its decision to remove 381 books from its libraries after a Pentagon review found that only about 20 books touched on diversity, equity, and inclusion issues. The reversal came after a May 9 Pentagon memo standardized search terms for DEI titles, leading the Navy to use those terms for a new review. The initial removal included titles like "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" and "How to Be an Antiracist". The Navy stated that nearly all of the originally pulled books are back in circulation, pending the Defense Department's formal review.</p>

Following the incident, the TSA conducted a review and implemented additional security measures to prevent similar occurrences in the future.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally, hitting a new record high above $111,000. The price of the flagship cryptocurrency was last higher by 3% at $111,578.76, according to Coin Metrics. The rise has been driven by increasing institutional ownership, corporate adoption, easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and the Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. Positive momentum and growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation have also contributed to the surge. (not investment advice)</p>

Health unions have reacted angrily after a smaller rise of 3.6% was announced for other NHS staff, including nurses and midwives. Resident doctors will get an extra ¬£750 top-up, which the health department says brings their average rise to 5.4%.</p>

Joun also blocked transferring the management of federal student loans and special education functions out of the Education Department. Randi Weingarten, the president of the nation's largest teachers' union, the American Federation of Teachers, said in a statement after the ruling that it is the "first step to reverse this war on knowledge and the undermining of broad-based opportunity."</p>

Final Destination: Bloodlines is well plotted and brilliantly grisly, but most important, it knows how to enjoy itself. I‚Äôd say that having fun, more than anything, is what people are seeking from the communal cinematic experience.  It's fun to have a horror movie you can cheer during. If Scream revived the slasher in the 1990s with its clever meta storytelling, Final Destination helped bring back the proper amusement park vibe for the genre, jolting the viewers every few minutes with a gory surprise that had them screaming and giggling at the same time.</p>
