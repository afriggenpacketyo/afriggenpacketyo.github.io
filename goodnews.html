          <p>Shares of Japanese investment giant SoftBank Group surged by 13% to a record high, marking the stock's best day in five years. The dramatic rise followed the company's announcement of a fiscal first-quarter profit of 421.8 billion yen, far exceeding analyst expectations. This is the company's second consecutive profitable quarter and was driven by a $4.8 billion gain in its Vision Funds segment, its largest since 2021. The strong performance was attributed to gains from private investments and listed portfolio companies like Grab and Swiggy, signaling a positive turn for the influential tech investor.

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued a nationwide injunction blocking President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to parents who are not citizens or are in the country on temporary visas. This is the fourth court decision to halt the policy, which has been challenged as unconstitutional. The judge certified the lawsuit as a class action and ruled that the plaintiffs were "extremely likely" to win their argument that the order violates the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause. The ruling prevents the administration from withholding citizenship documents from those affected while the case proceeds.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced he will host the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan at the White House for what he described as an "official Peace Signing Ceremony." In a post on social media, the president claimed credit for ending the long-standing conflict between the two nations, which has resulted in thousands of deaths over many years. Trump stated that his administration has been engaged with both sides for some time and that the signing will be a historic day for the countries involved and the world. The ceremony is intended to formalize a peace agreement between the two former adversaries.</p>

          <p>For the first time on record, the Southern Small White butterfly, a species native to Southern Europe, has been spotted in the United Kingdom. A volunteer at the Landguard Bird Observatory in Suffolk photographed the female butterfly, with experts confirming its identity. The species has been rapidly expanding its range northwards across Europe over the past two decades, a phenomenon that scientists believe is at least partly driven by a warming climate. While this sighting is a significant milestone, it is not yet clear whether the butterfly will be able to establish a breeding population in the UK.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people, particularly millennials, are experiencing dating app fatigue and are turning to in-person singles events as an alternative way to meet potential partners. This trend is reflected in the declining stock value of apps like Bumble and a 42% rise in attendance at singles events from 2022 to 2023. The article highlights the success of a Cincinnati-based event series called Date Cincy, which has facilitated numerous connections, including an engaged couple who met at one of their gatherings. The shift is driven by a craving for genuine, face-to-face connection that online profiles often fail to provide.</p>
