          <p>The United States and China have confirmed the details of a trade framework aimed at resolving ongoing commercial disputes. According to China's Ministry of Commerce, the agreement will involve China reviewing export control applications while the U.S. removes certain restrictive measures. This development follows high-level talks in London and seeks to implement a previous consensus reached in Geneva. While the move is seen as a positive step in stabilizing the relationship, experts caution that ambiguities remain, particularly concerning the extent of relaxed curbs on rare earth exports.</p>

          <p>Tokyo's Nikkei stock index closed above the 40,000 mark for the first time since January, rising for a fourth consecutive day. The surge was driven by investor relief after the White House indicated a potential extension of the 90-day pause on certain U.S. tariffs. The market's positive momentum was also supported by a holding ceasefire between Israel and Iran, which eased geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. The broader Topix index also saw significant gains, reflecting widespread optimism in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Twelve years after the 2013 British and Irish Lions tour of Australia, former Wales winger George North reflects on one of its most iconic moments. During the second Test, North famously lifted his 17-stone opponent, Israel Folau, onto his shoulders while carrying the ball and used him to drive forward. Now 33 and playing in France, North recalls the incident as a defining memory for fans, even more so than his spectacular solo try in the first Test. He cherishes the impact he had and the unique responsibility of representing the Lions on two separate tours.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. announced that its global sales in May rose by 6.9 percent from the previous year, reaching 898,721 units and setting a new record for the month. The company attributed the strong performance in part to a surge in last-minute demand in the United States. This spike was driven by consumer concerns that car prices would increase due to high tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. In contrast to the sales growth, Toyota's global production for the same month saw a slight dip of 0.7 percent, its first year-on-year decline in five months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At a global forum in Bangkok, Unesco is advocating for international collaboration on its ethical guidelines for artificial intelligence. Unesco's director general called for governments, businesses, and civil society to work together to ensure AI serves the common good as the technology rapidly evolves. The event highlights the growing divide in the AI world, with major US and Chinese tech companies notably absent. Amid this competition, host country Thailand stated it would not take sides but would instead focus on developing its own domestic AI ecosystem.</p>

          <h2>Economists Urge China to Implement Structural Reforms to Boost Domestic Consumption</h2>

          <p>At the World Economic Forum's "Summer Davos" in Tianjin, prominent economists have called for China to enact structural reforms to transition towards a consumption-driven economy. They argue that while China has made technological strides, its long-term prosperity depends on increasing domestic consumption rather than relying solely on production-focused subsidies. An over-reliance on exports could create trade friction with the rest of the world. Experts suggest that reorienting local government priorities to include consumption metrics could help harmonize trade relationships and unlock new growth in the services sector.
