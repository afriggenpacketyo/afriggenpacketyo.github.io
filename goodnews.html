        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nine Just Stop Oil activists who planned to glue themselves to a runway at Heathrow Airport received sentences of time served or suspended jail terms. They were convicted of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance after police prevented them from disrupting the airport on July 24. Judge Hannah Duncan acknowledged that the activists did not breach the perimeter fence or cause any "actual harm," but criticized them for treating the trial as an "extension of the protest" and showing no remorse, emphasizing the strain they put on the court system. The judge also referenced the amount of time the trial took, and that court resources could have been used for other more urgent cases involving sexual assault or abuse.</p>

          <p>A vote on a megabill aimed at advancing President Trump's agenda failed in the House Budget Committee due to opposition from Republican hard-liners, creating a setback for Speaker Mike Johnson. Representatives Andrew Clyde, Josh Brecheen, Lloyd Smucker, Ralph Norman, and Chip Roy voted against the bill, arguing that the savings largely take effect after Trump leaves office. This move tested Johnson's leadership as he tries to unify his conference, with House Republican leaders continuing negotiations to try and find a resolution and get the bill through the House before the Memorial Day recess.</p>

The event, scheduled for June 14, has drawn criticism from Democrats who consider it a wasteful use of taxpayer money, while White House officials say the cost will be shared by the Department of the Army and the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission.</p>
