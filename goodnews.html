          <p>Professor Mohd Rizal Arshad, a prominent Malaysian deep-sea robotics scientist, has relocated to China to advance his work on underwater prototypes. He emphasized China's strong ecosystem for rapidly converting research into industrial applications, its direct engagement with businesses to solve real-world problems, and the convenient access to necessary components for building new devices. Rizal, who foresees oceans as vital future sources for drinking water, food, minerals, and energy, assumed the role of dean of robotics at Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University's Entrepreneur College. This transition underscores China's increasing leadership and investment in deep-sea science and marine robot technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla experienced a substantial 40% year-on-year drop in European new car registrations in July, marking its seventh consecutive month of decline. In contrast, Chinese electric vehicle rival BYD saw its registrations surge by 225% during the same period, leading an aggressive push into the European market. Analysts attribute Tesla's struggles to intense competition, an aging vehicle lineup, and reputational damage from CEO Elon Musk's rhetoric. This trend highlights the increasing pressure on established automakers from rapidly expanding Chinese brands, which now command a record market share in Europe. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A unique and humorous image of seventh-seed Jasmine Paolini at the US Open has been hailed as potentially one of tennis's greatest photos. Photographer Ray Giubilo captured the one-in-a-million shot by chance, attributing it to Paolini's momentary imbalance during a forehand stroke. The image's comedic timing, almost impossible to replicate, has captivated viewers and even earned Paolini's personal admiration. Giubilo, a veteran sports photographer, emphasized the blend of patience, creative flair, and technical skill required to seize such fleeting moments in professional tennis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of British-made cars to the United States rose by 6.8% in July, reversing a three-month decline, following the implementation of a new UK-US tariff deal. The agreement, which reduced the import tax on the first 100,000 UK cars to 10% from an initially proposed 25%, has been credited with stimulating exports to the UK's largest single national market. Despite this positive development, overall UK car manufacturing output remains down for the year, facing challenges from higher labor costs, increased international competition, and Brexit.

          <p>Computer-chip designer Nvidia reported a 56% surge in second-quarter revenue to $46.7 billion, driven by strong demand from tech giants expanding their AI capabilities. Despite navigating US-China trade tensions and fast-changing Trump administration policies aimed at AI development, Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang declared the "AI race is now on," with spending from major tech firms doubling. The company's data center revenue also saw significant growth, though it slightly missed analyst expectations, causing a minor dip in after-hours trading. Nvidia continues to lobby the US government for approvals to sell advanced chips to China, a critical market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The news of Taylor Swift's engagement has sparked widespread emotional reactions from fans, bringing attention to the concept of parasocial relationships. This phenomenon describes one-sided feelings of friendship or romance towards celebrities, fueled by extensive access to their private lives through social media and reality shows. Psychologists note that while these relationships can provide a sense of connection and community, particularly online, they cannot replace reciprocal real-life interactions. Experts caution that despite the illusion of intimacy, celebrities do not individually reciprocate fan affection, akin to "fast food" for emotional needs.</p>

          <p>Argentine authorities are actively searching for an 18th-century Italian portrait, believed to have been looted by a fugitive Nazi officer 80 years ago, after it appeared in a real estate advertisement. The painting, "Portrait of a Lady" by Guiseppe Vittore Ghislandi, was part of Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker's extensive collection. Police raided a seaside villa in Argentina, believed to be owned by descendants of the Nazi fugitive, finding German documents but not the artwork itself. This renewed search highlights Argentina's history as a post-WWII haven for Nazis and their plundered assets.</p>

          <p>Darren Aronofsky's new film, "Caught Stealing," adapted from Charlie Huston's novel, is reviewed as a bruising crime caper set in a gritty 1998 New York City. Austin Butler stars as Hank Thompson, a former baseball player who inadvertently stumbles into a dangerous criminal underworld after a series of unfortunate events. The movie is praised for its intimate, chaotic tour of the city, featuring a colorful array of goons and a raw, energetic soundtrack. Aronofsky's direction, consistent with his career-long theme of squandered potential, is noted for its affection for the city's less glamorous corners.</p>

          <p>Chinese retail stock traders are experiencing a significant bull run, with some reporting over 30% returns this year and anticipating another 20% gain. This optimism is fueled by a government pledge to stabilize the stock market amid a shaky economy, aiming to create a "wealth effect" to stimulate consumption. Software engineer Jacky Jia, for example, has focused his investments on high-beta stocks in new-consumer, consumer-electronics, software, and hardware sectors.

          <p>The South Florida Water Management District is deploying 120 robot rabbits in the Everglades as a new strategy to combat invasive Burmese pythons. These robots, designed to mimic real marsh rabbits with heat, smell, and movement, aim to lure the voracious snakes out of hiding for removal. Pythons have severely impacted native wildlife, decimating small mammal populations by 95% in some areas. The solar-powered robots are monitored by cameras, signaling when a python is nearby for contractors to capture. This innovative approach seeks to improve detection rates of the well-camouflaged reptiles.</p>

Following his second Tommy John surgery, Ohtani pitched five full innings of one-run ball, recording nine strikeouts, his most in over two years. He strategically diversified his pitch selection, utilizing his curveball and splitter more frequently, which manager Dave Roberts noted made him less predictable. This outing marked a significant step in Ohtani's return to full two-way duties, demonstrating his ability to work deeper into games and potentially secure a pivotal postseason pitching role.</p>

USC Athletic Director Jennifer Cohen expressed optimism for a swift agreement, acknowledging the series' importance to both programs and fans. Previously, USC was hesitant to commit long-term due to College Football Playoff uncertainties and Big Ten travel demands. The primary sticking point remains the game's date, with USC preferring an earlier season slot to balance its schedule, while Notre Dame has less incentive to change the traditional late-season matchup.</p>
