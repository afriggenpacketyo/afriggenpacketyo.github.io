          <h2>Tesla Shares Rise Following Robotaxi Launch in Austin</h2>

          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a 10% surge after the company launched its Model Y robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, this past weekend. The autonomous rides were initially available to a select group of Tesla enthusiasts, promoters, and shareholders. CEO Elon Musk noted a flat fee of $4.20 per ride, while early access program participants reported positive experiences. However, other observers noted the robotaxis appeared to violate some traffic regulations, with one instance of traveling the wrong way and another of braking abruptly for stationary police vehicles. The launch represents a culmination of a decade of work by Tesla's AI software and chip design teams.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Co. is recalling nearly 200,000 Mustang Mach-E SUVs from model years 2021-2025 because of potentially faulty door latches. The electronic door latches may remain locked after a driver exits, potentially trapping passengers, especially children, in the back seat. Letters notifying owners of the safety risk are scheduled to be sent on June 23, and the problem will be fixed by updating the vehicles' software. The remedy is expected to be available by late September, and owners can contact Ford customer service or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for more information.</p>

          <p>China's exports of hi-tech goods to the European Union surged last month, coinciding with a significant drop in exports of the same goods to the United States. This suggests that ongoing trade and technology tensions between the US and China may be influencing trade patterns with Europe. Several EU countries experienced unprecedented import levels of Chinese batteries, laptops, smartphones, and solar panels in May. While many EU markets saw falling exports to China, the overall impact was a 22% increase in the union's trade deficit with China.</p>

          <p>An 18th-century oil painting at Florence's Uffizi Gallery was allegedly damaged after a museum visitor tripped while taking a selfie. The painting, a portrait of Ferdinando de' Medici by Anton Domenico Gabbiani, sustained damage that the museum believes can be repaired quickly. Gallery director Simone Verde warned that restrictions on visitor behavior might be imposed in the future due to the increasing problem of visitors focusing on taking selfies and creating memes. The visitor has been identified by the police and reported to judicial authorities, and the exhibition is temporarily closed for repairs.</p>

          <p>Compass is suing Zillow, claiming that the online property website's new rule, which bans home listings from its platform if they appear on any other service for more than 24 hours before being posted on Zillow, violates antitrust laws. Compass alleges that Zillow is leveraging its market dominance to impose this block on listings outside of its website, aiming to stifle competition. Compass CEO Robert Reffkin argues that the "Zillow ban" restricts consumer choice and gives Zillow undue power over the real estate market. Zillow, however, maintains that the rule ensures fair access to listings for all buyers and denies Compass's claims.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk is ending its partnership with Hims & Hers Health, claiming the telehealth company sold illegitimate versions of its weight-loss drug, Wegovy. The pharmaceutical firm accused Hims & Hers of "deceptive marketing" practices that put patient safety at risk. This decision comes less than two months after the companies announced a "long-term collaboration" to improve obesity treatment access. Novo Nordisk stated it began selling Wegovy via telehealth companies to shift patients from using "knock-off, compounded versions" to the FDA-approved drug, but found Hims & Hers failed to adhere to regulations prohibiting mass sales of compounded drugs.</p>

          <p>Apple is no longer behaving as a safe haven stock, experiencing its worst relative performance compared to its sector fund since 2002. While tech stocks have generally rebounded strongly from early 2025 tariff-triggered selloffs, Apple has underperformed, raising questions about the sector's traditional role as a safe haven during volatility. Investors are using broad stock market dips as buying opportunities, betting on tech through S&P 500 index funds and ETFs. Experts suggest investors are diversifying with traditional defensive sectors like utilities and consumer staples, indicating a shift from relying solely on tech for safety.</p>

          <p>Death Stranding 2, a video game directed by Hideo Kojima, casts players as Sam Porter Bridges, a courier delivering essential items in a post-apocalyptic world, exploring anxieties about digital connectivity and technological obsolescence. The game highlights the creeping erosion of human intimacy by digital substitutes and growing unease about technologies that might render human roles obsolete. As Bridges connects isolated communities, players experience both the benefits and the dehumanizing aspects of technology, building systems that could ultimately replace him. The game emphasizes the importance of physical connection and balance in a world increasingly dominated by virtual interactions.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his goal for the upcoming national election is for the ruling coalition to maintain its majority in the House of Councillors. The election will be a critical test for Ishiba, who has been leading a minority government since the ruling coalition lost its majority in the more powerful House of Representatives last October. He emphasized addressing rising living costs amid inflation and surging rice prices as key issues. Ishiba also dismissed the idea of cutting the consumption tax rate, stating that an alternative funding source must first be secured.</p>

          <h2>Killer Whales Observed Using Kelp for 'Massages'</h2>

          <p>Researchers have observed orcas in the North Pacific using kelp to "massage" each other, rubbing pieces of seaweed between their bodies. Drones captured footage of the whales selecting and biting off kelp, then placing it on the back of another whale. Scientists suggest this behavior, dubbed "allokelping," may serve a health, hygiene, or social bonding function. The findings indicate tool use in killer whales, with the animals fashioning tubular pieces of seaweed for a specific, planned purpose.</p>
