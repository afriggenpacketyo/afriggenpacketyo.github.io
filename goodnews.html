          <p>A U.S. District Court judge rejected a lawsuit from an investment fund, Azoria Capital, which sought to force the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings to be open to the public. The judge ruled the FOMC is not subject to the "Sunshine Act" and questioned if the lawsuit was a publicity stunt for the new fund, which is run by a Donald Trump ally critical of current interest rate policies. The decision upholds the long-standing practice of the FOMC meeting privately to deliberate on the nation's monetary policy, as the fund had argued the Fed was keeping rates high for political reasons.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to maintain current interest rates, the price of gold is projected to remain relatively stable in the short term. Historically, gold prices have reacted to interest rate changes, but recent surges have been driven more by inflation and geopolitical concerns, decoupling it from traditional monetary policy effects. While a rate cut is unlikely this week, future comments from the Fed, inflation data, and global tensions could still influence the precious metal's market value. Investors are watching these factors to gauge potential entry points into the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a new HBO documentary, musician Billy Joel has directly refuted longstanding rumors that he has a history of driving under the influence (DUI). The 76-year-old artist stated he has never had a DUI, attributing past car accidents to a "mental fog" and deep depression following the 9/11 attacks, not alcohol. Joel, who was recently diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), expressed frustration with the tabloid press for perpetuating the myth over the years. He has canceled tour dates to focus on his health and recovery from the brain disorder.</p>

          <p>University of Colorado football coach Deion Sanders announced he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of bladder cancer but is now considered cured following surgery. The procedure involved removing his bladder and reconstructing a new one from a section of his intestine, and he will not require chemotherapy or radiation. Sanders, who has dealt with other serious health issues, including amputated toes, maintained a positive outlook throughout the ordeal and confirmed he will be coaching the upcoming season. He emphasized the importance of early detection, as his cancer was found during a routine precautionary scan.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a nationwide order requiring the Trump administration to continue Medicaid reimbursements for all Planned Parenthood clinics. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by the reproductive health organization challenging a provision in a recent tax bill that aimed to "defund" abortion providers by halting their Medicaid payments for one year. The judge's order stated that cutting off funds would likely cause adverse health consequences for patients by reducing access to services like contraception and STI testing. This decision marks a significant, albeit potentially temporary, victory for Planned Parenthood in its ongoing legal battles.</p>

          <p>China has offered to strengthen economic ties with Brazil and defend a multilateral global trade system ahead of new, sweeping U.S. tariffs on Brazilian exports. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman expressed Beijing's willingness to work with Brazil and other nations to uphold WTO-centered trade. The statement specifically mentioned expanding cooperation in the aviation sector, a significant area for Brazil's economy as its leading aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, heavily relies on the U.S. market. The move positions China as a supportive partner for Brazil as it faces escalating trade tensions with the United States.</p>

          <p>A large-scale study of over 2,100 older adults has provided strong evidence that a combination of diet, exercise, and cognitive training can significantly improve thinking and memory. The two-year POINTER study found that participants in an intensive program not only boosted their mental abilities but also appeared to slow the cognitive declines associated with aging, performing like individuals one to two years younger. The regimen included aerobic exercise, a Mediterranean diet, and social engagement. These findings reinforce that proactive lifestyle interventions can change the trajectory of brain health, with researchers now focused on implementing these strategies.</p>

          <p>Wall Street saw a slight downturn on Monday, with major indices giving up early gains despite news of a trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union. Investor focus is shifting to a busy week of economic events, including a Federal Reserve policy announcement, the monthly jobs report, and crucial earnings reports from tech giants. Analysts are particularly watching to see if revenue growth from companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon justifies their massive spending on AI infrastructure. The market's subdued reaction suggests a cautious "wait-and-see" approach ahead of these significant data releases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has successfully shut down four major dark web sites dedicated to sharing child sexual abuse material as part of "Operation Grayskull." The investigation, which began in 2020, has led to the conviction of at least 18 individuals who led or used the network, which had over 120,000 members and housed millions of illicit files. One of the key figures, labeled "one of the most significant" purveyors of such material, was sentenced to life in prison. Officials called the operation one of the most successful of its kind, dismantling a sophisticated and sadistic online community.</p>

          <p>Shareholders of the UK-based financial technology company Wise have voted to move its main stock market listing from London to the United States. The company, valued at around £11 billion, believes a dual listing in the U.S. will attract more investors and provide access to deeper capital markets. The vote was controversial because it was bundled with an extension of a dual-class share structure that enhances the voting power of its co-founder and CEO, Kristo Käärmann. Despite some opposition, the proposal received overwhelming approval and is expected to take effect next year.</p>
