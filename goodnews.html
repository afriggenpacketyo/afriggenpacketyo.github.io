          <p>Shohei Ohtani hit a two-run home run, his ninth of the season, during the Los Angeles Dodgers' 7-4 win against the Miami Marlins. The home run, clocked at 117.9 miles per hour, was the hardest-hit in Major League Baseball this season. Ohtani reflected on his confidence boost after homering off a great pitcher in a clutch situation. The article notes that Ohtani also made history at the same stadium in September 2024, becoming the first MLB player to reach 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in a single season.</p>

          <p>Credit Suisse Services AG will pay nearly $511 million after pleading guilty to conspiring with wealthy American taxpayers to hide over $4 billion in offshore accounts. The DOJ stated that Credit Suisse AG Singapore held undeclared accounts for U.S. persons with assets valued at over $2 billion between 2014 and June 2023. This criminal conspiracy allowed clients to evade U.S. tax obligations from 2010 through 2021, violating a 2014 plea agreement.
