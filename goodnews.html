          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was welcomed back to Massachusetts after being released on bail following her detainment by ICE in March. Ozturk, who co-authored an op-ed critical of Israel's war with Hamas, expressed gratitude for the support she received from her community and others. Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley attended the event, emphasizing the importance of due process and free speech. The article highlights that a federal judge ordered her release, citing a lack of evidence for her detainment besides the op-ed, and that the Trump administration had until May 14 to comply with the order to transfer Ozturk to Vermont.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has fired Shira Perlmutter, the head of the U.S. Copyright Office, according to sources familiar with the situation. The firing came after Perlmutter's office issued a report on artificial intelligence and expressed concerns about the usage of copyrighted materials by AI technology. President Trump has been a major proponent of AI and announced a joint venture to invest in artificial intelligence infrastructure. Perlmutter had held the position since October 2020 and was appointed by former Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, who was also fired by Mr. Trump on Thursday.</p>

          <p>Nearly 50 years after the murder of Jeannette Ralston in San Jose, California, authorities have charged Willie Eugene Sims, 69, with her death. Ralston was found strangled in her car in 1977, and the case went cold due to a lack of leads. The breakthrough came last year when a fingerprint from the crime scene matched Sims in the F.B.I.‚Äôs database after an upgrade to its search algorithm. Sims, who had a prior conviction for attempted murder and robbery, was identified through DNA evidence and an old sketch that resembled his booking photo from 1977.</p>

          <p>As negotiations intensify for President Donald Trump's tax agenda, key issues are emerging, including the potential impact on millions of Americans. The House Ways and Means Committee has released a preliminary partial text of its portion of the bill, but it may undergo significant changes before the final vote. Republican lawmakers can pass Trump's package without Democratic support through reconciliation, but the process is complex and subject to budgetary constraints. Some lawmakers are pushing for a more fiscally responsible package, potentially affecting individual provisions.</p>
