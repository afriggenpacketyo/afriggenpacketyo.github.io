          <p>Three massive wildfires in northeastern Minnesota are nearly contained after burning for weeks, prompting the lifting of all evacuations on Memorial Day. Firefighters are also battling large wildfires in Central and Western Canada, where thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and the National Incident Management Organization are leading efforts to contain the fires, which have collectively burned approximately 30,000 acres. Interactive maps provide updates on the fires' perimeters and affected areas, and donations are being accepted to support relief efforts for affected communities.</p>

          <p>Chelsea has completed the signing of striker Liam Delap from Ipswich Town for a reported fee of ¬£30 million. The transfer was triggered by a release clause in Delap's contract following Ipswich's relegation from the Premier League. Chelsea beat out competition from Manchester United, Newcastle United, and Everton for the 22-year-old England Under-21 international. Delap scored 12 goals in 37 top-flight appearances last season, adding to Chelsea's attacking options.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The German government is considering a streamlined process for designating countries as safe origins to curb asylum seeker numbers. Chancellor Merz's Cabinet approved a draft policy allowing a country to be declared safe via statutory order, removing the need for Bundesrat consent. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt framed the move as part of broader efforts to implement an "asylum turnaround." Opposition lawmakers and NGOs have criticized the draft as potentially violating German law. The reform still requires approval from the lower house of parliament.</p>

          <p>Karine Jean-Pierre, former White House press secretary under President Biden, has announced she is no longer a Democrat, according to her publisher's summary of her upcoming book, "Independent." The book details Jean-Pierre's decision to embrace independence, motivated by disillusionment with the Democratic Party's alleged pressure on Biden to abandon his reelection bid. Jean-Pierre will explore what it means to be an Independent and why it's worthwhile to prioritize personal beliefs over party affiliation. Her book will be available in October.</p>

          <p>A nearly 200-year-old condom is on display at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam as part of an exhibition on 19th-century prostitution and sexuality. The condom, dating back to 1830, is believed to be made of a sheep's appendix and features an explicit print. Museum curator Joyce Zelen stated that the condom is in "mint condition" and is thought to have been a "luxury souvenir" from a brothel in France. The museum notes that the item embodies both the lighter and darker sides of sexual health during an era fraught with fears of unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.</p>

          <p>Russell Martin is reportedly on the verge of being appointed as the new manager of Rangers. Despite accusations of being reluctant to adapt, Martin's former Norwich City teammate, Angus Gunn, disputes this, noting Martin's tactical flexibility in the Championship. Martin himself emphasizes the difference between stubbornness and conviction, suggesting he will stick to his principles if he secures the Ibrox job. The appointment signals a potential shift in Rangers' approach under a manager known for his strong beliefs.</p>
