          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has refrained from endorsing Zohran Mamdani, the presumptive Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, citing a need to get to know the candidate better. While praising Mamdani's successful campaign focus on the high cost of living, Jeffries noted that their districts do not overlap and they have never had a substantive conversation. He stated that Mamdani would need to clarify his positions on antisemitism and his relationship with the Jewish community, calling some of his past rhetoric unacceptable. Jeffries emphasized that the nominee must demonstrate a commitment to addressing the rise in antisemitism in the city.</p>

          <p>A new biography by Sam Tanenhaus, titled "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America," examines the profound influence of William F. Buckley Jr. on the American conservative movement. The article highlights how Buckley, through his magazine National Review and TV show "Firing Line," created a platform for conservative ideas that propelled figures like Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan to prominence. It argues that Buckley invented a form of cultural politics that reshaped the Republican Party, creating a direct lineage to today's political landscape, including the rise of Donald Trump. The analysis presents Buckley's legacy as complex, blending intellectual civility with controversial stances on issues like civil rights.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Labour government has significantly altered its proposed welfare reform bill after facing a substantial rebellion from over 120 of its own backbench MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the initial rollout was mishandled and that concessions were made after MPs raised concerns that the cuts would harm disabled people. Key changes include limiting cuts to Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants only and ensuring the health component of Universal Credit rises with inflation for existing recipients. The U-turn has been seen as a way to reset relations within the party, though it has drawn criticism from conservatives for delaying necessary reforms.</p>

          <p>The upcoming movie "Superman" aims to present a more vulnerable and relatable version of the iconic hero, according to director James Gunn and star David Corenswet. Gunn, who is also the CEO of DC Studios, explains that his vision for the character is one who is not indestructible and feels more grounded. Corenswet, who steps into the role, emphasizes the character's loneliness as an alien desiring to be part of humanity. The film seeks to stand apart in an era of superhero movies by focusing on Superman's inherent goodness as a form of rebellion against a mean-spirited world.</p>

          <p>British sports car manufacturer Lotus has assured the UK business secretary that it has no plans to close its historic factory in Hethel, Norfolk, which employs 1,300 people. The meeting was called after reports suggested the company's Chinese owner, Geely, was considering moving production to the U.S. to avoid tariffs. Lotus had temporarily paused production in May due to supply chain issues related to a 25% U.S. tariff, which is set to be reduced. The government expressed its commitment to supporting the UK's automotive sector, and Lotus reiterated that the UK remains the heart of its brand.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to financial experts, the most significant error Americans make in retirement planning is delaying the start of their savings. Procrastination, often with the intent to save after earning more or paying off debt, results in missing out on substantial gains from compound interest over decades. Experts also highlight a secondary mistake: focusing on a total savings number rather than creating a reliable income strategy for retirement. The primary recommendation is to begin saving immediately, even with small amounts, to build the habit and take advantage of employer matches. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British government has announced a new strategy to tackle obesity by partnering with major food retailers and manufacturers to encourage healthier consumer habits. Under the plan, businesses will voluntarily find ways to promote healthy food, such as through special offers, loyalty point incentives, or changing store layouts. The policy, which will include retailers reporting on healthy food sales to increase accountability, is part of a broader 10-year plan for the NHS. While the government frames it as a collaborative approach, it has faced criticism from the opposition for being a "nanny state" measure.</p>

          <p>A psychologist who studies couples suggests that answering "no" to four specific questions may indicate unrecognized unhappiness in a relationship. These questions probe whether partners feel they are on the same team during conflicts, if they can be their authentic selves, if their partner is genuinely curious about their inner world, and if their partner takes accountability for mistakes. The article argues that healthy relationships require collaborative problem-solving, security in self-expression, ongoing curiosity, and a willingness to repair after conflict. A consistent lack of these qualities can lead to resentment, distance, and a loss of personal identity.</p>

The election is seen as a verdict on Ishiba's government, which is contending with voter frustration over inflation and stagnant wages.

It posits that this generation, shaped by political turmoil and the internet, views sex and its consequences as inherently political. Many are consciously rejecting traditional definitions of sex, virginity, and gender roles that they see as restrictive. This shift is happening alongside a rise in sexual conservatism that has restricted access to reproductive healthcare, creating a complex landscape where young people are both more progressive and more fearful about sex.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis by investment firm Vanguard reveals a direct correlation between income and retirement savings, with higher earners accumulating significantly larger 401(k) balances. For example, workers earning between $100,000 and $149,999 have a median balance nearly double that of those earning between $50,000 and $74,999. The data suggests that despite economic uncertainty, many Americans are prioritizing retirement savings. A key factor boosting balances across all income levels is automatic enrollment in employer-sponsored plans, which has led to substantially higher savings compared to voluntary opt-in systems.

In a startup environment with limited resources, Jain argues that every team member must be able to identify a problem, devise a solution, and then get into the details to implement it.
