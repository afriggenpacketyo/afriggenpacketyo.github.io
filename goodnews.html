          <h2>Study Shows Early Exposure to Beneficial Bacteria Can Reduce Lung Infections in Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 20:48:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK scientists have discovered that early exposure to beneficial bacteria, specifically Bifidobacterium longum, in newborns can significantly reduce the risk of lung infections. The study, conducted by University College London and the Sanger Institute, analyzed stool samples from over 1,000 newborns and tracked their health for two years. Results indicated that babies with B. longum were less likely to be hospitalized for lung infections, suggesting these bacteria play a crucial role in immune system development. Researchers believe the bacteria interact with the immune system, helping it differentiate between harmful and harmless entities, and this protective effect was more pronounced in babies born via vaginal delivery.</p>

          <p>The 2025 NBA Finals between the Oklahoma City Thunder and Indiana Pacers marks a generational shift, with both teams primarily composed of Gen Z players. These young teams, led by stars like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Tyrese Haliburton, represent a departure from the era of super teams. The Thunder, boasting the youngest team to win 68 games in a regular season, and the Pacers, who reached their first Finals in 25 years, have built their rosters through strategic draft picks and trades. This Finals matchup is reshaping NBA history, bringing fresh energy and connecting with a younger fan base through social media engagement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review the latest data on mifepristone, commonly known as the abortion pill. This review comes amidst concerns, fueled by a report from the Ethics and Public Policy Center, regarding the drug's safety, though the FDA maintains that it has found no new safety concerns in periodic reviews since its approval in 2000. Medical experts argue that the concerns are misguided, as some reported adverse events are normal occurrences during medication abortions. The Supreme Court previously rejected a challenge to the availability of mifepristone in 2024, preserving access to the drug.</p>

          <p>Drug safety experts are advising women who are pregnant, trying to conceive, or breastfeeding to stop using weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro. Concerns have been raised about the potential harm these medications could cause to unborn babies, as the effects are not fully understood. The UK drugs regulator also advises women to use contraception while taking these medications and for a period afterward before trying to become pregnant. There are also concerns that these injections may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives in overweight or obese women.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has complied with a judge's order to bring back a Guatemalan man who was wrongly deported to Mexico. This action marks a significant departure from the administration's often defiant stance on immigration matters. The judge's order was issued after it was determined that the man's deportation lacked due process. The man, who had applied for asylum in the U.S., feared persecution in Mexico, and the U.S. government's initial claim that he did not express such fears was found to be erroneous.</p>

          <p>Jared Isaacman, after his nomination for NASA was withdrawn by President Donald Trump, told investors that his "brief stint in politics was a thrilling experience". Isaacman resigned as CEO of Shift4 and will assume the role of executive chairman. Trump cited a "thorough review of prior associations" as the reason for withdrawing the nomination, potentially referring to Isaacman's donations to Democrats. Isaacman, who has close ties to Elon Musk, suggested the timing was related to Musk's exit from government service and his criticism of Trump's tax-cut bill.</p>
