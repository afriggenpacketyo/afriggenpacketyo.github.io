          <h2>UK Energy Bills to Decrease Following Ofgem Price Cap Revision</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 02:41:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem announced that energy bills in England, Scotland, and Wales will decrease by 7% in July, marking the first drop in a year due to falling international wholesale gas prices. This change means a typical household will save ¬£129 annually, reducing the average bill to ¬£1,720. However, charities warn that many still struggle with energy costs, owing suppliers about ¬£4 billion collectively. The announcement follows Prime Minister Starmer's indication of potential changes to winter fuel payments, with the government hoping to provide more support to pensioners this winter.</p>

          <p>The US Mint is set to stop producing new pennies following a directive from President Donald Trump, who deemed the coin "so wasteful". The US Mint has made its final order of penny blanks, with the expectation that penny production will cease once those are cashed out. Trump claims the coin costs the country more to produce than its actual value, with the Treasury expecting annual savings of $56 million in reduced material costs. While some argue for the penny's usefulness in charity drives, others highlight its high production cost and limited utility.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reinstating in-person training at the National Fire Academy after abruptly pausing it in March, citing a review that found certain courses provide effective training. This reversal follows heavy criticism from Maryland's congressional delegation and firefighters who argued that halting training for first-responders was dangerous. The academy, often described as the national war college for firefighting, brings in thousands of fire chiefs annually for training in leadership, management, and fire investigation.</p>
