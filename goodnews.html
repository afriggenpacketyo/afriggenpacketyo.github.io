          <p>Newly promoted sumo grand champion Onosato has announced his goal to win the upcoming Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament, a feat rarely achieved by wrestlers in their yokozuna debut. The 25-year-old is the first Japanese-born yokozuna since his stablemaster, Kisenosato, in 2017, and his rapid rise has garnered significant attention. Onosato expressed his desire to overcome his past mixed results in Nagoya and bring energy to his hometown of Tsubata in Ishikawa Prefecture, which was heavily affected by the Noto Peninsula earthquake earlier this year. He emphasized his commitment to remaining grounded despite his newfound fame.</p>

His 21-year-old son is a rising amateur talent, creating a compelling storyline where either could potentially eliminate the other from contention for golf's oldest major championship.</p>

          <p>Canada has rescinded its plan to impose a Digital Services Tax on large technology firms, prompting the resumption of trade talks with the United States. The move came after President Trump suspended negotiations, calling the proposed 3% levy on revenue from Canadian users a "blatant attack on our country." The tax would have retroactively affected companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney confirmed the policy reversal after a phone call with Trump, aiming to make progress on a new economic and security relationship ahead of a July 21 timeline.

          <p>Japan's industrial output saw a modest increase of 0.5 percent in May compared to the previous month, according to preliminary government data. This marks the first rise in two months and was primarily driven by strong production of manufacturing machinery, including metal molds used in vehicle production. The seasonally adjusted index of production at factories and mines reached 101.8 against the 2020 baseline of 100. This slight rebound follows a revised 1.1 percent decrease in April, offering a tentative sign of stabilization in the country's industrial sector. (not investment advice)</p>

This development comes as the social media platform faces a divest-or-ban law in the U.S. due to concerns over its Chinese ownership by ByteDance. Trump, who has extended the divestiture deadline to September 17, suggested that any deal would likely require approval from Beijing, but expressed optimism that Chinese President Xi Jinping would agree to it.

The fitness of key players like Lauren James and Georgia Stanway remains a central concern, as does the relative inexperience in the goalkeeping department following recent retirements.

          <p>China has conditionally resumed imports of Japanese seafood, partially lifting a blanket ban that was imposed in 2023. The ban was enacted before Japan began releasing treated wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant. According to the new customs notice, shipments can resume from most of Japan, but the prohibition will remain in place for ten prefectures, including Fukushima, Tokyo, and several others surrounding the plant. This move marks a slight thaw in trade relations, though significant restrictions on Japanese aquatic products remain in effect due to ongoing concerns from Beijing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, and new research explains why. Studies reveal that the unique characteristics of EVs, particularly their regenerative braking systems, are a primary cause. This system, which converts kinetic energy back into electrical energy to charge the battery, creates a low-frequency deceleration that can provoke queasiness. The rapid and smooth acceleration of EVs also contributes to the effect. Researchers are now exploring solutions to mitigate this issue and improve passenger comfort in new energy vehicles.</p>
