          <p>The Trump administration has signed an executive order to end the comprehensive U.S. sanctions program against Syria, which has been in place since 2004. The White House stated the move aims to support Syria's path toward stability and reconstruction following the ousting of Bashar Assad. However, targeted sanctions will remain on Assad, his associates, and various designated groups. The order also directs a review of the terrorist designations for the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group, from which the new transitional government has emerged, and its leader.</p>

          <p>GE Appliances announced it will invest $490 million to bring 800 manufacturing jobs from China back to the United States, establishing a new laundry care production facility in Kentucky. An executive stated that while the company has long-term plans to build appliances where they are sold, recent U.S. tariff policies on Chinese imports accelerated the decision. The move aligns with the company's "zero distance" philosophy to be closer to American consumers and its design teams. The new plant is expected to be operational by early 2027, creating new engineering and skilled manufacturing roles.</p>

          <p>The Privy Council in London, the final court of appeal for the Cayman Islands, has upheld the territory's Civil Partnership Law, securing legal recognition for same-sex couples. The law was originally enacted by the governor in 2020 after the local parliament rejected a similar bill, prompting a legal challenge against the governor's authority. LGBTQ+ rights advocates have hailed the ruling as a major victory that provides certainty for same-sex couples and could set a precedent for other British overseas territories where similar rights are being contested.</p>

          <p>The Writers Guild of America West has removed film producer Randall Emmett from its "strike list," allowing guild members to work with him again. The decision came after Emmett paid approximately $630,000 to resolve a long-standing judgment over unpaid compensation and benefits to four writers. The dispute stemmed from a proposed 2019 television series that was never produced. Emmett stated he made the personal decision to settle the debt, which was tied to a defunct former company, because it was "the right thing to do."</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Why Recent U.S. Tariffs Have Not Yet Led to Major Price Inflation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 17:59:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread concern, President Trump's recent tariffs have not yet caused a significant spike in U.S. consumer prices. Economists point to several short-term factors buffering the impact, including companies "front-loading" inventory by stocking up on goods before the tariffs took effect. Additionally, some businesses are absorbing the initial cost increases or using legal loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay duty payments. While inflation remains muted for now, experts caution that these are temporary measures and that price increases are likely to materialize later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision is part of a broader cost-saving initiative aimed at ensuring "value for money" in the monarchy's finances. The announcement was made alongside the release of the annual royal financial report, which showed that a single two-day trip on the train cost over ¬£44,000, while it was only used twice in the last year. The Royal Family will continue to use regular train services for travel.</p>
