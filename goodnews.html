          <p>Baltimore Orioles player Coby Mayo faced criticism for his baserunning tactic during a game against the Chicago White Sox, leading to a bench-clearing incident. Mayo, attempting to advance to second base, ran out of the baseline and collided with White Sox infielder Lenyn Sosa, drawing accusations of interference. Words were exchanged, and Mayo shoved Sosa, prompting both benches to empty onto the field before order was restored. Mayo defended his actions, stating he was trying to get into scoring position and thought Sosa was in the baseline.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that Donald Trump's political resilience is tied to his willingness to swerve, backpedal, and contradict himself. This flexibility reassures swing voters that anything extreme is also provisional, allowing him to test limits while remaining open to pulling back. Recent shifts in his approach to China tariffs and foreign policy have helped his poll numbers recover. Voters appreciate seeing Trump check himself and be checked by others, finding this dynamic interaction essential to their approval of his presidency.</p>

          <p>The ban on the sale of single-use disposable vapes has come into force across the UK, aiming to protect children's health and the environment. Shops and supermarkets are prohibited from stocking these items, though rechargeable and refillable devices can still be sold. Disposable vapes have contributed to the rise in youth vaping, with millions being discarded annually. While vaping is considered less harmful than smoking, health experts emphasize the need for further regulation to address youth vaping.</p>
