The image, taken during technical testing, demonstrates the VTF's power and its potential to answer critical questions in solar physics.

          <p>Voice of America (VOA) is expected to resume broadcasts as early as next week after a media watchdog successfully challenged President Trump's executive order that had silenced the network. The Department of Justice informed Reporters Without Borders that VOA staff could begin returning to work and programming would resume. The executive order, which aimed to eliminate the workforce and activities not required by law, was challenged in court and a temporary stay was upheld, leading to the restoration of employees' accounts. The news coincides with World Press Freedom Day, highlighting the importance of free and accurate information.</p>
