          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 19:36:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Block, the fintech company founded by Jack Dorsey, surged more than 10% in extended trading following the announcement of its inclusion in the S&P 500 index. Block is set to replace oil producer Hess, which was recently acquired by Chevron, with the change taking effect on July 23. Inclusion in a major index like the S&P 500 often boosts a company's stock price as index-tracking funds are required to purchase its shares. Despite a 14% decline in its stock value this year, Block's market capitalization of around $45 billion places it well above the median for the index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Microsoft has announced it will no longer use engineers based in China to provide technical support for its U.S. government and Department of Defense cloud services. The change comes in response to a ProPublica report that raised national security and cybersecurity concerns about the practice. Previously, Chinese engineers provided support while being supervised by U.S.-based "digital escorts," an arrangement critics argued could leave sensitive systems vulnerable. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the old system "unacceptable" and pledged a review of similar legacy practices across the department.</p>

          <p>Ten Americans wrongfully detained in Venezuela have been freed and are returning to the U.S. as part of a complex three-way prisoner exchange. The deal involved El Salvador repatriating over 200 Venezuelan nationals who had been deported from the U.S. and held in El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison. The Trump administration had sent the Venezuelans, alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang, to El Salvador under the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act. U.S. officials stated that with this release, no Americans are currently known to be wrongfully detained in Venezuela.</p>

          <h2>UK Experiences a Surge in Wasp Populations This Summer</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts and pest control professionals in the United Kingdom report that this summer is shaping up to be a "strong year" for wasps, likely due to a very warm and dry spring. While many people dislike the insects, ecologists emphasize their crucial role as apex predators and natural pest controllers in the ecosystem. The article notes that the common wasp appears to be thriving, bucking the trend of widespread decline seen in many other global insect populations. To coexist peacefully, experts advise staying calm and distracting the insects with a small amount of something sweet placed away from picnic areas.</p>

          <h2>Liverpool Theatre Premieres 'Lord of the Rings'-Inspired Spoof About Wayne and Coleen Rooney</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new stage show in Liverpool, "The Legend of Rooney's Ring," is a comedic fantasy spoof that reimagines the lives of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife, Coleen. Written by a co-creator of the sitcom "Motherland," the play merges a tabloid myth about Coleen's lost engagement ring with the epic quest narrative of "The Lord of the Rings." The creators insist the show is an affectionate homage rather than a malicious satire, celebrating the couple as heroic figures who have endured immense public scrutiny. The production is characteristic of Liverpool's Royal Court theatre, which focuses on original, locally relevant comedies.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland is expanding its RSV vaccination program to include premature babies, who are particularly vulnerable to the common respiratory virus. Starting this autumn, eligible infants will be offered a long-acting injection called Nirsevimab, which provides about 80% protection against the virus. This new program is designed to protect infants born too early to benefit from the maternal RSV vaccine, which has been available to pregnant women since last year. Health officials highlighted the move as a crucial step in protecting vulnerable children and reducing winter pressures on the health service.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered a specific interaction between a common gene variant and certain gut bacteria that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. The study, published in Science Immunology, found that a faulty version of the OTUD3 gene fails to regulate an immune protein called STING. When exposed to a molecule produced by gut bacteria, this can lead to chronic inflammation in the colon. This finding helps explain the unpredictable nature of the disease and could pave the way for more precise, personalized treatments for the millions affected by inflammatory bowel disease.</p>

          <p>Irish golfer Shane Lowry has voiced his frustration after receiving a two-stroke penalty during the second round of The Open for a rules violation he says he did not see. Officials determined, using slow-motion video, that Lowry's ball moved in the rough during a practice swing and that his actions caused it to move. Lowry insisted he was looking at the ball and did not see it move with his naked eye, but accepted the penalty to avoid being labeled a cheat. The R&A, golf's governing body, stated that the player's own vision is not the deciding factor in such rulings.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's recent six-day trip to China, which included meetings with Premier Li Qiang, is being interpreted as a sign of Canberra's "stiffening spine" in its foreign policy. The visit, aimed at stabilizing relations with Beijing, demonstrates Australia's effort to navigate the intense rivalry between China and the United States. Analysts suggest that Australia is forging a more independent path, balancing its crucial economic relationship with China against its security alliance with the U.S. This diplomatic maneuvering reflects a broader challenge faced by many nations in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>After falling behind rivals like OpenAI and Google in the generative AI race, Meta is rebooting its approach with a new division called Meta Superintelligence Labs. Despite creating its pioneering FAIR research lab over a decade ago, the company has struggled to translate its research into competitive consumer-facing AI products. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is now personally recruiting top talent with massive compensation packages and plans to spend billions on data centers to build "personal superintelligence for everyone." This new strategy may involve moving away from its previous open-source model as it scrambles to regain a leading position in the critical AI sector.</p>
