          <h2>Workplace Crying: A Sign of Weakness or an Indicator of Emotional Strength?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 05:31:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent emotional display by a UK politician has reignited the debate over whether crying at work is professionally damaging or simply a human response. The article explores various perspectives, with some viewing it as a sign of weakness, particularly in male-dominated fields, while others see it as a mark of emotional intelligence and strength. Career coaches suggest that employers who respond with compassion are more likely to foster motivated and happier staff. Ultimately, while some bias against workplace emotion persists, many now argue that authenticity and the ability to handle complex emotions are valuable leadership traits.</p>

          <h2>FICO to Incorporate 'Buy Now, Pay Later' Loans into Credit Score Calculations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Credit scoring company FICO has announced it will begin including data from "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) loans in some of its credit score models, a significant change reflecting the payment method's growing popularity. This move is intended to provide lenders with a more complete financial picture of consumers, potentially preventing them from offering more credit than a person can afford. For consumers, this means that making on-time BNPL payments could help build their credit history, while missed payments could negatively impact their score. Consumer advocates note that while this adds transparency, BNPL services still lack some of the consumer protections offered by traditional credit cards. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 04:41:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent Ethereum Community Conference in Cannes showcased the blockchain's increasing integration into the core of global finance, with major institutions like Robinhood and Deutsche Bank building on its infrastructure. Robinhood announced the launch of tokenized U.S. stocks for European users on an Ethereum-based network, a move that helped propel its stock to new highs. Despite market volatility, institutional interest is driven by Ethereum's utility, stability, and security for applications like tokenized assets and stablecoins. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin noted that dependability, rather than just speed, is what makes the network attractive to large financial firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese state-owned company Sinopec has launched a significant offshore solar power station in the coastal waters of Qingdao, marking a breakthrough for the industry. This project, combined with a similar one from late May, forms the largest initiative of its kind and is expected to generate 16.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. The floating solar panels, which rise and fall with the tide, are reportedly 5-8% more efficient due to the cooling effect of the water. This development represents a major step in China's efforts to expand its renewable energy capacity and reduce carbon emissions.</p>

          <p>Following recent US and Israeli strikes on Iran, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for the negotiation of a new international agreement to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue. Speaking in Paris, Wang expressed deep concern over escalating regional tensions and advocated for placing Iran's nuclear activities under strict IAEA supervision. This diplomatic push positions China as a key mediator and reflects its intensified criticism of the US and Israeli actions. Beijing's proposal aims to create a new framework for peace and stability, emphasizing its role as a responsible global power.</p>

          <p>Japan's rugby team defeated Wales 24-19 in an intensely hot and humid match in Kitakyushu, extending Wales' international losing streak to 18 games. Wales held a 19-7 lead at halftime but struggled to cope with the extreme weather, which necessitated multiple water breaks and an extended interval. Japan rallied in the second half, with Halatoa Vailea scoring the decisive try in the 71st minute to seal the win for Eddie Jones' side.

          <p>England and Wales have been drawn into what is being called the "toughest group" for the Women's Euro 2025 tournament, alongside top-ranked teams France and the Netherlands. This means three of the four teams in Group D are ranked in the world's top 11, setting the stage for highly competitive opening matches. Defending champions England and 2017 winners the Netherlands bring strong tournament histories, while Wales, competing in their first major tournament, enters as the underdog. Analysts note the high stakes, as the challenging draw means even top teams face a real risk of early elimination.</p>

          <p>Joey Chestnut has reclaimed his title at the renowned July 4th hot dog eating contest in Coney Island, New York, cementing his legacy as a dominant figure in the sport of competitive eating. After being banned from the previous year's event over a sponsorship dispute, Chestnut returned with a point to prove, consuming a winning number of hot dogs in the 10-minute contest. The article reflects on the bizarre yet compelling nature of the event, which combines intense athletic preparation—including specialized exercises and diet—with a spectacle of sheer consumption.

          <p>The long-standing question of whether culture shapes visual perception is being revisited through new research with conflicting results. One study found that people from Western, "carpentered" environments perceive an illusion as rectangles, while people from rural Namibia see circles, supporting the idea that our surroundings tune our vision. However, another study convincingly argues that the well-known Müller-Lyer illusion is experienced across cultures and even by animals, challenging the "carpentered world" hypothesis. This suggests that while perceptual differences exist, their origins are complex and not easily explained by simple environmental or cultural stereotypes.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over a century, Paris has officially reopened sections of the Seine River for public swimming, a key legacy project of the 2024 Olympic Games. The city has established three supervised swimming zones, complete with lifeguards and amenities, following a massive €1.4 billion investment to improve water quality. Swimming in the Seine was banned in 1923 due to severe pollution, but significant upgrades to wastewater management have made it safe again. This initiative is part of a broader city effort to adapt to climate change and enhance the quality of life for residents and tourists.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have made a significant breakthrough in regenerative medicine by successfully restoring damaged ear tissue in mice. The study, published in the journal *Science*, identified a "genetic switch" that controls organ regeneration, which they were able to reactivate. The scientists found that the mice's inability to regenerate was linked to a failure to produce enough retinoic acid, a key compound in tissue development. By reactivating this pathway, they achieved complete restoration of the lost tissue, offering hope that this mechanism could one day be applied to help regenerate organs in humans.</p>
