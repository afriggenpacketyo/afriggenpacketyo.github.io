        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Navan, a startup specializing in corporate travel and expense management, has officially filed to go public, planning to list on the Nasdaq under the symbol "NAVN." The company, formerly known as TripActions, reported $613 million in revenue over the last twelve months, a 32% increase. The move comes amid a resurgent IPO market, which has seen the best activity since 2021, with other major tech firms like Klarna and Figma also recently going public. Navan aims to disrupt the business travel sector with its all-in-one app that integrates booking and expense management.</p>

          <p>England, the tournament host and world's top-ranked team, is set to face France in a highly anticipated Women's Rugby World Cup semi-final at Ashton Gate in Bristol. The Red Roses are strong favorites, holding a 16-match winning streak against their French rivals, though their last Six Nations encounter was a narrow one-point victory. England has dominated the tournament so far, extending their world-record winning run to 31 matches. The winner of this clash will advance to the final at Twickenham to play against Canada, who defeated defending champions New Zealand in the other semi-final.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields rose on Friday, with the 10-year note reaching its highest level in two weeks, in a seemingly counterintuitive move following the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut earlier in the week. Investors in longer-term debt are weighing broader economic factors beyond the Fed's immediate policy, including expectations for future economic growth and inflation. The increase in yields suggests that the market sees underlying strength in the economy, supported by recent data like lower-than-expected jobless claims, which may be tempering the impact of the central bank's rate reduction.

          <p>Las Vegas Raiders offensive coordinator Chip Kelly has clarified the nature of minority owner Tom Brady's involvement with the team's coaching staff. Responding to a television report suggesting Brady was involved in weekly game planning, Kelly stated that this was not accurate. He explained that while he does use Brady as a valuable resource to discuss football concepts and defensive schemes, the seven-time Super Bowl champion does not participate in the formulation of weekly game plans. The NFL has confirmed that there are no policies prohibiting an owner from sitting in the coaches' booth during a game.</p>

          <p>A community-led nonprofit, the Molokai Heritage Trust, has formed with the ambitious goal of purchasing the 55,000-acre Molokai Ranch from its absentee Hong Kong-based billionaire owner. For years, the vast property, which includes critical water infrastructure, has sat neglected, causing environmental damage and hardship for local residents. The group aims to raise the $260 million asking price to return the ancestral lands to Hawaiian stewardship, restore the island's health, and manage its resources for the benefit of the community. This effort represents one of the largest potential land-back initiatives in Hawaii's history, moving to reclaim the land for its people.</p>

          <p>Pattern Group, a leading third-party seller on Amazon's marketplace, made its public debut on the Nasdaq, with its stock closing up 11% on its first day of trading. The IPO raised $300 million and valued the Utah-based e-commerce accelerator at approximately $2.5 billion. Pattern helps over 200 brands, including Panasonic and Skechers, optimize their sales on various online platforms. The company's successful entry into the public markets is another sign of a revitalized tech IPO landscape, though its prospectus acknowledges risks related to its heavy reliance on Amazon and global trade uncertainties.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new industry forecast from Wolfe Research predicts a massive increase in U.S. electricity demand over the next five years, primarily fueled by the construction of power-hungry AI data centers. This surge is expected to significantly benefit industrial companies that are integral to the power grid's expansion. Firms like GE Vernova, which manufactures gas and wind turbines for electricity generation, and Eaton, which produces essential electrical equipment, are positioned to see sustained growth. The strong demand is creating a substantial backlog for these companies, suggesting favorable pricing and profitability for the foreseeable future. (not investment advice)</p>

The reopening fulfills Macron's promise to restore the 12th-century Gothic landmark within five years, symbolizing a remarkable moment of cultural rebirth and resilience.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department and the IRS have issued proposed regulations clarifying President Donald Trump's new "no tax on tips" policy. The guidance specifies which workers are eligible for the deduction of up to $25,000 in tips annually, confirming that many jobs in so-called "specified service" sectors like healthcare, law, and financial services will not qualify. Furthermore, the rules state that automatic gratuities, such as those added for large parties at restaurants, are not considered voluntary tips and are therefore ineligible for the tax break. The agencies will finalize the regulations after a public comment period.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a series of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, including one this week, borrowing costs are beginning to decrease from their recent highs. Financial experts point to home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) as one of the most affordable borrowing options, with average rates now around 8%. Home equity loans offer a slightly higher fixed rate, providing more stability, while personal loans remain a cheaper alternative to high-interest credit cards and do not require home collateral. As the Fed signals potential future cuts, variable-rate products like HELOCs may become even more attractive for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A retrospective on the career of actor and director Robert Redford reveals a consistent and critical theme: the hollowness and corrupting nature of winning. Across his most iconic roles and directorial efforts, from the ambitious athlete in "Downhill Racer" to the compromised politician in "The Candidate," Redford explored the idea that easy victory often leads to moral decay. This recurring motif, born from his own experiences as an athlete, demonstrated a deep distrust of the American obsession with success. His work consistently suggested that true value lies not in the triumph itself, but in the art and struggle of the pursuit.</p>

          <p>The Panama Canal Authority is taking steps to win back the liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipping trade that it lost during recent years of severe drought. Officials plan to reinstate a preferred booking slot system for LNG carriers and are developing a new 76-kilometer pipeline to transport natural gas liquids across the isthmus as an alternative to canal transits. These initiatives are designed to offer more flexibility and reliability to energy companies, which had been forced to use longer, more expensive routes. The move comes as the canal anticipates a decline in container traffic after a period of record volume.</p>
