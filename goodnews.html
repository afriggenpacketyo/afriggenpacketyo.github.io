          <p>A Los Angeles judge resentenced Erik and Lyle Menendez to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving over 35 years for the 1989 murders of their parents. The judge cited the brothers' rehabilitation efforts in prison and the support of family members as factors in his decision. The resentencing came after emotional testimony from family, who argued that the brothers had served enough time and have been forgiven. The decision aligns with a previous request by the former District Attorney, and a parole hearing is expected in the coming months.</p>

          <p>Aides to former President Joe Biden have responded to a new book alleging a cover-up of his physical and mental decline during his re-election campaign. The book, "Original Sin," claims aides discussed putting Biden in a wheelchair and sought to limit his physical activity. A Biden spokesperson dismissed the claims, arguing that "evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity." The book cites anonymous sources and includes a quote from David Plouffe criticizing Biden for exiting the race too late.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has reinstated Pete Rose and "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, along with 15 other players, making them eligible for the Hall of Fame after their careers were marred by gambling scandals. The league's policy on permanent ineligibility will now expire at death. Rose, banned for betting on baseball, and Jackson, implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal, can be considered for induction as early as 2028. However, their eligibility remains contentious due to character clauses considered by Hall of Fame voters.</p>
