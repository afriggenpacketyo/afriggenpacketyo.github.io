          <p>British newspapers are covering Prime Minister Keir Starmer's new trade deal with the EU, which promises economic benefits but also involves concessions on fishing rights. The deal is being criticized by some as a betrayal of Brexit, with accusations that it hands control back to Brussels. The papers also note Donald Trump's latest phone call with Vladimir Putin, offering a trade deal in exchange for an end to the Ukraine war. The article encapsulates the ongoing debates about the UK's post-Brexit relationship with Europe and its place on the world stage. ()</p>

          <p>Shares of CATL, the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped over 18% in their Hong Kong debut, driven by investor confidence in the company's ability to capitalize on the growing electric vehicle market.

Despite facing trade tensions and allegations of ties to China's military, CATL's global expansion plans and strong demand from international investors signal continued growth potential. ()</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has struck trade deals with the European Union and the United States, demonstrating Britain's ability to engage with both major trade partners. However, the deals required politically challenging concessions, reflecting Britain's diminished position in the post-Brexit era. While the agreements offer benefits such as reduced tariffs and streamlined travel, they add only marginally to Britain's GDP. The article suggests that Britain faces a more constrained set of choices in a world dominated by larger trading blocs. ()</p>
