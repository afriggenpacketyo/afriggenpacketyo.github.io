          <p>The team bus for the Welsh women's national football team was involved in a road accident while traveling to a training session in St. Gallen, Switzerland. The Football Association of Wales confirmed that all players and staff on the bus were unharmed. An ambulance attended to the driver of the other vehicle involved in the collision. As a result of the incident, the team's scheduled training session was cancelled, though head coach Rhian Wilkinson stated their priority was ensuring the well-being of everyone involved before reassessing their preparations for the upcoming match against France.</p>

          <p>Tech giants Anthropic, Microsoft, and OpenAI are backing a new $23 million initiative called the National Academy for AI Instruction, launched by the American Federation of Teachers (AFT). The program aims to educate U.S. teachers on how to safely and ethically integrate artificial intelligence into their classrooms. The academy will offer workshops, online courses, and hands-on training, with the goal of reaching 400,000 educators over the next five years. AFT President Randi Weingarten emphasized that while AI can enhance learning, it cannot replace the direct connection between a teacher and a student.</p>

          <p>A U.S. magistrate judge has recommended that the criminal case against Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan should not be dismissed. Dugan was charged with concealing a person from arrest and obstruction after allegedly helping a man in the U.S. illegally evade immigration authorities at her courthouse. Her defense argued for dismissal based on judicial immunity, but the magistrate found this immunity does not extend to criminal prosecutions. The recommendation is non-binding, and a federal district judge will make the final decision on whether the case proceeds to trial.</p>

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty, financial advisors are recommending several strategies for managing savings to balance growth and security. Many favor high-yield savings accounts and money market accounts for their liquidity and competitive interest rates, which are ideal for emergency funds and short-term goals. For those willing to accept slightly more risk for higher potential returns, money market funds are an option, though they are not FDIC-insured. Another strategy involves creating a CD ladder to lock in rates while maintaining periodic access to funds, ensuring savings can effectively combat inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>International Criminal Court Issues Arrest Warrants for Taliban Leaders</h2>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for the Taliban's supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhunzada, and the head of Afghanistan's supreme court, Abdul Hakim Haqqani. The charges focus on the persecution of women, girls, and other non-conforming individuals since the Taliban seized power nearly four years ago. The warrants accuse the leaders of crimes against humanity, specifically targeting those who do not align with the Taliban's strict gender and political policies. This action represents a significant step by the international legal body to hold the Taliban's leadership accountable for their actions.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is ending its long-standing policy requiring passengers to remove their shoes during airport security screenings. According to an internal memo, the new rule will be rolled out at major U.S. airports, allowing travelers in all screening lanes, not just PreCheck, to keep their shoes on. The policy shift comes nearly two decades after the rule was implemented in 2006 following the failed "shoe bomber" attempt. Passengers who trigger an alarm at the security scanner will still be required to remove their shoes for additional screening.</p>

          <p>A jury at the Old Bailey has found three men guilty of an aggravated arson attack on a London warehouse that was sending aid to Ukraine. The attack, which caused around £1 million in damage, was orchestrated on behalf of the Russian mercenary organization, the Wagner Group. Two other men had already pleaded guilty to orchestrating the plot, which also included plans to attack businesses owned by a prominent Russian dissident. The case is a stark example of a foreign state-linked entity using British citizens as proxies to conduct serious criminal activity in the UK.</p>

          <p>Dan Osborn, a union leader and registered independent, has launched a new campaign for the U.S. Senate in Nebraska, setting up a challenge against Republican incumbent Sen. Pete Ricketts. Osborn, who lost a surprisingly competitive race in 2024, is framing his bid as a fight between the working class and the "billionaire class" represented by Ricketts. In his announcement, Osborn stressed populist themes of affordability, border security, and anti-corruption. The Ricketts campaign has already positioned Osborn as a liberal aligned with out-of-state donors, forecasting a contentious race in the deep-red state.</p>

          <p>The R&A, organizers of The Open Championship, are considering moving up the tee times for the third round to mitigate disruption from a large loyalist parade planned in Portrush. The parade, involving over 60 bands, is scheduled to start shortly after play would typically conclude, raising concerns about significant congestion for the thousands of spectators leaving Royal Portrush. Organizers had previously requested the parade be rescheduled, but the request was denied. Any change to the schedule would be notable, though it may be limited by live television broadcast commitments in the United States.</p>

          <p>A Harvard study published in Nature Medicine suggests that adopting a plant-based diet in middle age can significantly increase the likelihood of healthy aging. The 30-year study followed over 100,000 participants and found that those who closely followed the Alternative Healthy Eating Index—which emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and nuts—had up to an 86% greater chance of being free of chronic diseases at age 70. The research indicates that dietary patterns rich in plant-based foods, with moderate inclusion of healthy animal products, are key to enhancing long-term wellness and cognitive health.</p>

          <p>Germany's armed forces, the Bundeswehr, are experiencing a significant increase in interest, with applications and hires rising by about 20% this year. Officials attribute this surge in volunteerism partly to the ongoing war in Ukraine, which has motivated many young people to serve. Despite the increase, the Bundeswehr faces a personnel shortage and is aiming to recruit up to 60,000 additional soldiers to meet NATO demands. To boost numbers, the defense minister plans to make military service more attractive and will soon require all 18-year-old men to complete a questionnaire about their willingness to serve.</p>

This vision aligns with Alibaba's strategy to become a key provider of AI infrastructure, supported by its popular open-source Qwen models and massive investment plans. The expert also noted that Hong Kong is well-positioned to play a significant role in AI development due to its capital, research talent, and supportive government.</p>
