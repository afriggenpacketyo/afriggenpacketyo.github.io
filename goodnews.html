          <p>The UK government plans to move thousands of civil servant jobs out of London to save money and distribute government roles across the country. This initiative aims to cut 12,000 roles in London and close 11 offices, saving ¬£94 million annually by 2032. Two new government campuses will open in Manchester and Aberdeen, focusing on digital innovation/AI and energy, respectively, with additional roles created in other regional cities. Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden emphasizes the goal of bringing decision-making closer to communities and creating a more representative civil service, expecting employees to be in the office at least 60% of the time. The government expects this initiative to bring ¬£729m to the local economy by 2030.</p>

          <p>Burberry announced plans to cut approximately 1,700 jobs globally as part of its ongoing turnaround strategy, aiming to reduce costs by ¬£60 million by 2027. The job cuts will affect around 20% of Burberry's workforce, primarily in office-based roles, stores, and its factory in Castleford, England. This move follows earlier cost-cutting measures announced in November and is part of CEO Joshua Schulman's efforts to revive the British luxury brand. While sales fell slightly less than expected in the fiscal fourth quarter, Burberry acknowledged operating in a challenging macroeconomic environment influenced by geopolitical developments, and the company is navigating potential impacts from U.S. tariffs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China have agreed to cut back on most new tariffs for 90 days while negotiating trade policy, marking a significant shift in their relationship. This agreement comes after a period of heightened trade tensions and reflects a desire for mutual respect and stability. The new business landscape requires companies to mitigate tariff uncertainty and diversify supply chains, as the post-World War II trade framework has changed. China continues to emphasize self-sufficiency and is diversifying its exports to Southeast Asia, the European Union, and Latin America. While tariffs are expected to be cut, businesses should remain diversified from China-based suppliers.</p>

          <p>The European Union's General Court ruled that the European Commission should not have denied a journalist's request for text messages exchanged between Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla during negotiations for COVID-19 vaccine access. The court stated that the commission must provide credible explanations for why the requested documents cannot be found and explain why the text messages were deemed not to contain important information. The case, brought by The New York Times, centered on the commission's decision not to release the texts, arguing they were short-lived and not subject to transparency requirements. This ruling could set a legal precedent regarding what constitutes an official document in the EU and raises questions about transparency and accountability in public policy negotiations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will remove all sanctions on Syria to give the country a chance at greatness. Trump stated that Syria has a new government that will hopefully succeed in stabilizing the country and keeping peace. The toppling of the Assad regime during a shock offensive by anti-Assad militia groups in December of 2024 stunned the global community, and brought about the prospect of a new beginning for the devastated country. The U.S. sanctions were the most severe, deterring other countries and groups from transacting with the country. The United Nations and aid organizations had been pushing for sanctions relief following the devastating 2023 earthquake that hit Syria and neighboring Turkey.</p>

Currently, these drugs are restricted to sales by pharmacists or registered sellers.

To address concerns about drug abuse, sales of certain high-risk medicines, such as cough and cold remedies, will be limited to one small package per person for young people.

          <p>A Reddit post inquiring about flight attendants' awareness of passengers vaping in airplane bathrooms sparked a debate regarding on-board actions. Users claiming to be flight attendants responded that smoke detectors and other sensors throughout the plane can detect vaping, triggering alarms in the cockpit. Travel expert Gary Leff confirmed that modern smoke detectors can detect aerosols from vaping, and the FAA prohibits vaping on planes, extending the ban on cigarettes to include e-cigarettes. Some users recounted instances of passengers vaping discreetly in their seats, while others shared stories of alarms sounding due to vaping in the lavatory.</p>

Trust is a key criterion for family offices, often prioritizing lifelong relationships over expertise. Young employees are reluctant to work at family offices due to the lack of a clear corporate structure and the perception of it being a retirement job.
