          <h2>Chinese Researchers Discover Evidence of Recent Landslides on the Moon</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has found evidence of recent landslide activity on the moon, challenging the long-held belief that the moon is geologically dormant. Researchers from several universities analyzed high-resolution images taken since 2009, identifying 41 new landslides that appear to have been triggered by moonquakes. This discovery has significant implications for future lunar missions and the establishment of permanent bases, as it highlights previously unexplored geological hazards that must be considered. The findings were published in the peer-reviewed journal National Science Review, which is supervised by the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Angels star Mike Trout hit his 400th career home run, a significant milestone in a career marked by both extraordinary talent and recent injury struggles. Despite being hampered by injuries over the past five seasons, the 34-year-old remains one of baseball's elite players, having won three MVP awards and maintained a consistent presence in MVP voting for nearly a decade. The article reflects on his legacy, comparing his potential to that of all-time greats had he remained healthy. Trout has remained loyal to the Angels throughout his career, twice forgoing free agency to sign long-term deals with the team that drafted him.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite general consumer caution and economic headwinds, sales of used electric vehicles in the U.S. have surged, with a 40% spike recorded in July. This trend is driven by the discovery that pre-owned EVs are often priced lower than comparable gasoline-powered cars, a perception that counters the common belief about high EV costs. New owners express high satisfaction, citing the elimination of fuel expenses and the overall driving experience as major benefits. This boom in the used market, along with aggressive lease deals on new models, is making electric vehicles more accessible to a wider range of consumers.</p>

          <p>Evelyn Palla is set to be appointed as the first female CEO of Deutsche Bahn, Germany's national railway operator. The 52-year-old executive, who currently heads the company's regional subsidiary DB Regio, will replace Richard Lutz, who was dismissed last month. The appointment comes as part of a broader restructuring effort by the German government to address persistent issues plaguing the state-owned company, including widespread delays and cancellations attributed to aging infrastructure. Palla's leadership is anticipated to bring a new direction to the troubled rail operator as it undergoes modernization.</p>

          <p>An Italian woman named Giulia Baccosi has shared her story of being stranded at sea for 188 days after taking a last-minute job as a cook on a cargo schooner. The ship set sail from Germany in early 2020, just before the global COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread lockdowns and port closures. What was meant to be a three-month voyage turned into a six-month ordeal, during which the crew was denied shore leave and faced dwindling supplies. The experience included a dramatic rescue of migrants off the African coast and the challenges of isolation before the ship finally returned to Germany.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant increase in Chinese tourists visiting Japan is being driven by the weakness of the Japanese yen, making travel and high-end goods more affordable. In the first eight months of 2025, Japan recorded over 6.7 million visits from Chinese travelers, a substantial rise from the previous year. This influx, particularly from middle-class and wealthy visitors, is boosting Japan's economy as tourists spend on luxury items, cultural experiences, and fine dining. The trend highlights how currency fluctuations can directly impact international travel patterns and local economies, providing a welcome lift to Japan's tourism sector.</p>

          <p>Filmmaker Anuparna Roy has become the first Indian director to win the Orizzonti Award at the Venice Film Festival for her debut feature, "Songs of Forgotten Trees." Her victory is particularly noteworthy given her grassroots origins in a tribal village in West Bengal, far from the traditional centers of Indian cinema. Roy, who is self-taught, funded her first short film with earnings from a call-center job. Her award-winning film, set in Mumbai, explores the intimate relationship between two women from different backgrounds as they navigate survival, desire, and urban marginality, drawing praise for its subtle and authentic storytelling.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has reiterated his prediction that the proliferation of AI and humanoid robots by 2030 will lead to an era of "sustainable abundance" and a "universal high income." Responding to a claim that automation will replace all jobs, Musk stated that intelligent robots will far outnumber humans, providing for everyone's needs. He envisions a future where society moves beyond a basic income safety net to one where everyone has access to the best healthcare, housing, and services. Critics question the economic and political feasibility of such a system, citing current national debt and resistance to universal welfare programs.</p>

          <p>Jane Austen's classic 1815 novel "Emma" is being reimagined for the 21st century in a new stage adaptation at London's Rose Theatre. Written by Ava Pickett, this modern version places the meddling protagonist Emma Woodhouse in contemporary Essex, where she interferes with her friends' dating app profiles instead of arranging society matches. The play explores themes of social class, friendship, and love through a modern lens, reflecting on the pressures of online dating and returning home after university. The adaptation aims to capture the timeless human elements of Austen's story while grounding them in a relatable, present-day context.</p>

          <p>Creatine, a supplement widely known for enhancing muscle mass and athletic performance, is now being explored for its potential cognitive benefits, including alleviating "brain fog." As a naturally occurring compound that helps cells produce energy, creatine is vital for high-intensity physical activity. A growing body of research suggests it may also improve short-term memory, mood, and focus, particularly in individuals under stress or with dietary deficiencies. While many users, including perimenopausal women, report positive effects on mental clarity, experts caution that research is still developing and results are not guaranteed for everyone.</p>

          <p>The White House has outlined the terms of a pending deal for TikTok's U.S. operations that would place its algorithm and data under American control. Under the agreement, U.S. tech giant Oracle will manage the data and privacy, and Americans will hold six of the seven seats on the board overseeing the app's U.S. business. The arrangement aims to resolve national security concerns that the Chinese parent company, ByteDance, could access the data of American users. President Trump has reportedly approved the deal, which could be signed in the coming days, though Beijing has yet to formally comment.</p>
