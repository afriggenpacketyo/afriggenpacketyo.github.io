Seale was arrested as he left his wedding ceremony and charged with inciting riots at the 1968 Democratic convention. Shames notes that Baldwin frequently visited Seale while he was incarcerated in San Francisco before being sent to Chicago for the Chicago Eight trial, where he was infamously bound and gagged by Judge Hoffman. The two men became lifelong friends, meeting regularly and engaging in deep conversations. Shames felt honored to witness these two giants in conversation.</p>

Tsikhanouski, who was imprisoned in 2020, is almost unrecognizable after losing significant weight due to harsh prison conditions. He recounts being held in solitary confinement, denied medical care, and given minimal food. Tsikhanouski credits Donald Trump with aiding his release, believing Belarusian authorities want to improve relations with the West. Despite his ordeal, Tsikhanouski vows to continue fighting for a democratic Belarus and expressed strong support for Ukraine, calling the Kremlin a common evil.</p>

          <p>NATO allies are expected to pledge to increase their defense spending, potentially reaching 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP). The U.S. is pushing for this increase, comprised of 3.5% for "pure" defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure. While some member states support the target, others struggle to meet the existing 2% threshold. The increased spending aims to address ongoing conflicts and demonstrate a united front. However, the actual implementation of these pledges remains uncertain, as nations balance defense commitments with domestic priorities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The NHS is considering opening ketamine clinics to treat severe depression, offering an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This move follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that offers ketamine-assisted therapy. Ketamine, while not licensed for routine depression treatment, can be prescribed 'off-label' by doctors. Advocates believe ketamine infusions can make patients more receptive to psychotherapy. However, concerns remain regarding the drug's potential for misuse and serious health complications. Experts emphasize the need for controlled administration and careful patient selection.</p>

          <p>New York City will use ranked choice voting in its upcoming Democratic mayoral primary election. Voters can rank up to five candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the voters' second choices. This process continues until two candidates remain, and the one with the most votes wins. The system aims to ensure that the elected candidate has broad support, but it can also be complex and less transparent than traditional voting methods.</p>

The observatory, equipped with a large telescope and the world's biggest digital camera, will collect data on about 40 billion celestial objects. By constantly comparing new images to previous ones, the facility's computer systems will be able to spot changes or movements in the sky. The observatory is expected to detect about 10 million changes every night, sending alerts to researchers for follow-up observations.</p>

          <p>Three new military academies in China are set to begin recruiting high school graduates, sparking significant interest among young people. The announcement has garnered millions of views on social media, with many expressing excitement about serving their country. However, the total number of new recruits will remain largely the same as last year. The creation of these academies is part of a broader restructuring of the military education system, aimed at creating a more efficient and higher-quality system for nurturing talent. The ministry has also scrapped the requirement for military academy students to have three years of work experience before they can become commanders.</p>
