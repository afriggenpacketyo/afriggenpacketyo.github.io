        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has indicated that a youth mobility scheme could be part of a new deal with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years. The UK already has similar reciprocal agreements with countries like Australia. While specific details are yet to be finalized, the proposal has faced criticism from Conservative Party leaders, who describe it as "free movement through the back door." London Mayor Sadiq Khan has welcomed the idea, suggesting it would boost businesses in sectors like hospitality and creative industries. Relevant context: Prior to Brexit, young people in the UK had the right to travel and study freely in Europe without a visa.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a plasma drive technology that can significantly improve the aerodynamic performance of high-altitude drones. Wind tunnel tests revealed that plasma generated by high-voltage currents can boost an aircraft wing's lift-to-drag ratio by nearly 88%. This advancement could extend the endurance of high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) drones, allowing them to fly longer. The research was conducted by a team at the State Key Laboratory of Aerodynamics under the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Centre (CARDC).</p>

          <p>Sierra Prindle, a military veteran and runner, experienced years of unexplained calf pain before finally being diagnosed with Popliteal Artery Entrapment Syndrome (PAES). The rare condition involves the compression of the popliteal artery, restricting blood flow to the lower leg. After an initial surgery failed, Prindle sought treatment from a specialist at the Cleveland Clinic, who performed a successful surgery to remove portions of her gastrocnemius and popliteus muscles. Now recovered, Prindle hopes her story encourages others to persist in seeking answers for their health issues. Relevant context: PAES is often misdiagnosed as chronic compartment syndrome or other orthopedic disorders due to its rarity.</p>

          <p>An "unofficial" copy of the Magna Carta, purchased by Harvard Law School for $27.50 in 1946, has been confirmed as an original, dating back to the year 1300. Professors David Carpenter and Nicholas Vincent used spectral imaging and ultraviolet light to authenticate the document. The Magna Carta, first issued in 1215, declared that all people had personal rights and that even kings had to abide by laws. This rediscovery is particularly relevant amid ongoing court cases about executive authority and individual rights. Relevant context: Only 24 original copies of the Magna Carta are known to exist today, with one from 1297 on display at the National Archives in Washington, D.C.</p>

          <p>Manvir Singh's new book, "Shamanism: The Timeless Religion," explores the widespread phenomenon of shamanism and its role in dealing with uncertainty. A shaman is defined as a specialist who engages with unseen realities through altered states to provide services like healing and divination. The article delves into the connection between neo-shamanism, conspiracy theory, and far-right ideologies, highlighting how the belief in a hidden order of reality can lead to paranoia. It also explores the therapeutic Western self, and whether the teeming otherworld of the shaman is simply finding new containers, new metaphors.</p>

          <p>Audio snippets from a 2023 interview with former President Joe Biden, which led Special Counsel Robert Hur to describe him as an "elderly man with a poor memory," have been released.

While a written transcript was previously available, the audio provides additional context to Biden's demeanor and memory problems. The report recommended against charging Biden, despite concluding that he "willfully" retained government documents.
