          <p>Federal prosecutors have reduced the charge against David Huerta, president of the Service Employees International Union California, from a felony to a misdemeanor. Huerta was arrested for allegedly obstructing federal agents during an immigration raid in Los Angeles in June, initially facing up to six years for conspiracy to impede an officer. The new charge, "obstruction resistance or opposition of a federal officer," carries a maximum punishment of one year. Huerta and his legal team continue to assert his innocence, arguing he was exercising his First Amendment rights and is being targeted for his vocal criticism of the administration's immigration policies, underscoring ongoing tensions between labor advocacy and federal enforcement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study in North America has revealed exciting results for the Galleri blood test, capable of detecting over 50 types of cancer, many of which lack existing screening programs. The test, developed by Grail, identifies cancerous DNA fragments circulating in the blood. A trial involving 25,000 adults successfully confirmed cancer in 62% of positive results, often at an early, more treatable stage, and correctly ruled out cancer in over 99% of negative cases. While these results are promising for early diagnosis, scientists emphasize the need for further research, including a large-scale NHS trial, to definitively confirm if this early detection translates into reduced cancer mortality rates, highlighting the cautious optimism surrounding this medical advancement.</p>

          <p>Credo, a 17-year-old Silicon Valley semiconductor company, is experiencing a surge in value due to its signature purple active electrical cables (AECs), which are crucial for connecting powerful GPUs in AI data centers. With shares more than doubling this year, Credo's market capitalization has soared to nearly $25 billion as it positions itself as a vital supplier in the trillion-dollar AI infrastructure expansion. These specialized copper cables, costing $300-$500 each, offer greater reliability than fiber optics, preventing costly downtime in massive AI clusters for hyperscalers like Amazon, Microsoft, and xAI. Analysts predict significant revenue growth for Credo as demand for AI networking solutions continues to escalate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Northern Metropolis Envisioned as Cultural Cradle Beyond Tech Hub</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 17:30:09 EDT</div>

          <p>The article argues that Hong Kong's Northern Metropolis project should transcend its initial purpose as a housing and industrial hub to become a significant zone of cultural emancipation. In an era where technological infrastructure in the Greater Bay Area is already highly advanced, the focus should shift from mere connectivity to understanding its purpose and fostering substantial cultural influence. The opinion piece strongly advocates for a reorientation from property-led development to prioritizing innovation and cultural growth within the metropolis. By embracing this vision, Hong Kong could establish itself as a global cradle for cultural content, mirroring the international impact of Hollywood films, Japanese anime, or Korean K-pop.</p>

          <h2>Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk Stocks Decline Following Trump's Call for $150 GLP-1 Drug Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 17:25:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of pharmaceutical giants Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk dropped after President Donald Trump expressed his desire to cap the price of GLP-1 weight loss drugs at $150 per month, a significant reduction from current costs. Trump cited international price disparities, suggesting US consumers pay substantially more for the same medications. While Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz clarified that negotiations are ongoing, the president's comments signal strong administration pressure on drugmakers. Such a price cut would dramatically impact the cash market, potentially making these popular weight loss drugs competitive with cheaper compounded alternatives and affecting company revenues.

          <p>The Northampton Saints secured the top position in the Prem table with a decisive 36-19 victory over Newcastle Red Bulls, who regrettably remain winless in the league. Despite playing a man down for half an hour due to two sin-bins for JJ van der Mescht, the Saints managed to secure a crucial five-try bonus point win, surpassing reigning champions Bath. Newcastle demonstrated resilience, narrowing the score gap twice, but ultimately could not capitalize on their numerical advantage to turn the tide. This defeat extends Newcastle's frustrating league victory drought since last November, while Northampton continues its impressive season with three wins and a draw in four Prem outings.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has approved Boeing's request to increase its 737 Max jetliner production rate to 42 aircraft per month. This milestone comes nearly two years after the FAA capped production at 38 jets monthly following a near-catastrophic midair incident in January 2024, where a door plug blew off an Alaska Airlines flight due to Boeing's failure to reinstall key bolts. The FAA confirmed extensive reviews of Boeing's production lines to ensure safety and quality, signaling increased confidence in the manufacturer. This approval is a significant step in Boeing's turnaround efforts after years of issues, including two fatal crashes, supply chain problems, and a labor strike, as the company aims for higher delivery rates.</p>

          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has publicly apologized for his controversial comments suggesting President Donald Trump should send the National Guard to San Francisco to address crime. His initial remarks, made to The New York Times, sparked immediate backlash from local politicians, other tech leaders, and led to the resignation of prominent investor Ron Conway from the Salesforce Foundation board. Benioff's apology clarifies he no longer believes federal troops are needed, attributing his earlier comment to "an abundance of caution" during the Dreamforce conference. The incident highlights the intense political sensitivities surrounding federal intervention, local governance, and the role of corporate leaders in public discourse, particularly in politically charged environments.</p>

          <p>A collection of 17 iPad drawings by renowned artist David Hockney, titled "The Arrival of Spring in Woldgate," sold for an impressive £6.2 million at Sotheby's in London.

This sale marks the largest group of Hockney's iPad drawings to enter the market from a private collection, more than doubling the estimated value. The series was first unveiled as part of an exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts in 2012, showcasing the artist's innovative approach to capturing natural landscapes and the strong market demand for his digital creations.</p>

          <p>Instagram is implementing a new PG-13 content restriction system for all users under 18, automatically placing them in a filtered version of the app by default. This update expands existing safety features, aiming to limit exposure to graphic violence, sexual content, risky stunts, and strong language, including content from AI chatbots. The move is a response to parental concerns about online safety, adopting a familiar movie rating to simplify guidelines. However, content moderation experts question its effectiveness, warning that such a blunt intervention may inadvertently filter out context-sensitive discussions and creative expression, potentially stifling valuable conversations and information for older teens.</p>
