          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the U.S. will likely extend the upcoming August 12 deadline for trade tariff negotiations with China. The current 90-day suspension of heavy tariffs was established to allow for ongoing talks, which are set to continue in Stockholm, Sweden. Bessent expressed optimism about the trade relationship, hoping to also discuss issues like China's manufacturing surplus and its support for Russia. This development follows a period of intense trade conflict where both nations had imposed tariffs exceeding 100% on each other's goods.</p>

          <p>Amid rising inflation and financial uncertainty, many seniors are considering reverse mortgages to access their home equity. This financial tool allows homeowners aged 62 and older to receive payments that are repaid only when the home is sold or the owner passes away. However, the article advises seniors to carefully weigh this option against other home equity products like HELOCs, which may have lower interest rates. Potential borrowers should also assess their actual need for funds and consider the impact on their beneficiaries' inheritance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a sign that travel restrictions may be easing, the executive director of a prominent German think tank has visited Beijing for the first time in four years. Mikko Huotari, head of the Mercator Institute for China Studies (Merics), was in Beijing after being sanctioned by the Chinese government. Merics, one of Europe's largest China-focused research institutes, welcomed the development and expressed hope for future engagement between European and Chinese researchers. EU officials have consistently called on Beijing to lift the sanctions, which have prevented Merics staff from traveling to China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at MIT, led by Professor Hugh Herr, have created a groundbreaking bionic knee that offers more natural movement for amputees. The system, called e-OPRA, involves a titanium rod implanted directly into the femur, which connects to a robotic limb and integrates with reconnected muscle pairs. This myoneural interface allows the prosthesis to respond to the user's intended movements, enabling actions like kicking a ball with intuitive control. Trial patients reported improved mobility, confidence, and a feeling that the prosthetic was a true part of their body.</p>

          <p>As major tech companies like Alphabet, Meta, and Apple prepare to release second-quarter earnings, investors are focused on several key uncertainties. Wall Street will be watching to see if massive investments in artificial intelligence are yielding returns or inflating a bubble. The impact of President Trump's global tariff policies and strained trade relations, particularly with China, on product sales and advertising revenue remains a significant concern. These earnings reports will be critical in determining if the market rally can be sustained. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. has finalized a trade and military cooperation agreement with the Philippines. According to Trump, the deal includes a 19% U.S. tariff on goods from the Philippines, while U.S. goods will face no tariffs from Manila. The announcement came shortly after a White House meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who stated his country needs to modernize its military due to regional tensions. The government of the Philippines has not yet officially confirmed the details of the agreement announced by President Trump.</p>

          <p>Chemical giant DuPont received a boost after China's market regulator announced it was suspending an antitrust investigation into the company's Chinese operations. The probe, which began in April and was viewed as potential retaliation for U.S. tariffs, had created an overhang on the company's stock. The investigation concerned DuPont's Tyvek business, which represents a small fraction of its total sales, but had sparked wider fears about its electronics business. The suspension of the probe removes a key uncertainty for the company ahead of its planned corporate breakup. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Arsenal is reportedly on the verge of signing Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting in a deal valued at £63.5 million. The transfer has been delayed due to extended negotiations over the structure of add-on payments between the two clubs. Gyokeres, who scored an impressive 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting last season, has already agreed to personal terms on a five-year contract with the Gunners. The signing addresses manager Mikel Arteta's long-standing search for an elite center-forward to bolster his team's attack for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes the interest-earning potential of a $20,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) today compared to the higher rates available a year prior. While current CD rates have declined from their 2024 peaks, they remain substantially higher than in previous years, still offering a predictable return. For example, a 2-year CD might earn over $1,600 today, compared to over $2,300 on a higher-rate account a year ago. The comparison highlights that while earnings have decreased, CDs still present a valuable savings tool, especially with potential future rate cuts looming. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>General Motors executives claim the company has secured the number two position in the U.S. electric vehicle market, trailing only Tesla. On a recent earnings call, GM's CFO stated that the company's "inherent advantage" lies in its manufacturing flexibility, allowing it to pivot between producing EVs and internal combustion engine (ICE) cars based on fluctuating consumer demand. This contrasts with Tesla's EV-only lineup, which GM suggests leaves it "overexposed" to market volatility. GM CEO Mary Barra reaffirmed that a profitable EV future remains the company's "North Star."</p>

After decades of joint recovery efforts, remains found on the mountain site were identified as Hall's using anthropological and DNA analysis.

The announcement followed a social media post by President Trump, who said he had spoken with the company about using "REAL Cane Sugar."

It offers loan forgiveness after 30 years and provides a $50 monthly credit per dependent.
