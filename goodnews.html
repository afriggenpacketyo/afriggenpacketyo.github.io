          <p>British heavyweight boxer David Allen, known as 'White Rhino', suffered a unanimous points defeat to Russian opponent Arslanbek Makhmudov in a highly anticipated headline bout at Sheffield Arena. Despite the judges scoring the fight decisively for Makhmudov, Allen expressed profound appreciation for the fervent support of the 9,000-strong home crowd, calling the atmosphere unprecedented. The 33-year-old, who had previously retired from boxing for five years, remains resolute in his commitment to the sport, having rebuilt his career after numerous challenges. This event, his first as a headliner at the venue, highlights his enduring passion and the unique connection he shares with his fanbase.</p>

          <p>The UK will revert to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on Sunday, October 26, 2025, as clocks go back one hour at 02:00 BST, marking the end of British Summer Time. This traditional shift, easily recalled by "spring forward, fall back," offers an extra hour for most but extends night shifts for some. While the change brings earlier sunsets, ongoing discussions persist about the potential advantages of adopting year-round BST, including economic benefits and a possible reduction in evening road accidents. Conversely, critics highlight that permanent BST would result in much gloomier winter mornings, especially in northern regions like Scotland, raising concerns about safety for commuters and students.</p>

          <p>Luka Doncic's appearance in Sunday's preseason game against the Golden State Warriors remains uncertain, despite his full participation in Saturday's practice, with Lakers coach JJ Redick listing him as "TBD." Doncic anticipates playing in two preseason games before the regular season commences. The team faces an early challenge as LeBron James is sidelined for three to four weeks with a sciatica nerve issue, impacting initial game planning. Despite James' absence, Doncic maintains a "next man up" mentality, stressing that team chemistry and collective effort are crucial for success, rather than him solely bearing a heavy load.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of thousands of Israelis convened in Tel Aviv, expressing significant praise for Donald Trump's role in brokering a Gaza ceasefire and a hostage release agreement. US special envoy Steve Witkoff addressed the rally, reassuring attendees that the hostages were "coming home" ahead of Monday's deadline for Hamas to release 48 remaining captives. Concurrently, Palestinian officials noted that approximately 500,000 people have returned to the devastated northern Gaza Strip following an Israeli troop withdrawal. An upcoming summit in Egypt, featuring over 20 world leaders, including Trump, aims to finalize a comprehensive agreement to end the war, underscoring the delicate and multifaceted nature of regional peace efforts.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is rapidly establishing an unparalleled dominance in the tech industry, distinguishing itself from previous giants through its private ownership, secretive financials, and aggressive spending. The company, led by CEO Sam Altman, is investing across the entire AI stack, from data center development to consumer applications, with its ChatGPT chatbot boasting 800 million weekly users. Venture capitalists acknowledge the "gold rush mentality" but express concern over OpenAI's rapid expansion into various AI niches, making it challenging for startups to find "white space." This swift, vertically integrated growth is reshaping the competitive dynamics of Silicon Valley, driven by massive capital raising and spending without public market scrutiny.

          <p>As China prepares its 15th five-year plan, the document is expected to redefine the country's infrastructure development approach, moving towards more tech-driven and people-focused projects. While past plans, like the 2009 stimulus package, spurred massive growth, they also contributed to local government debt, a persistent economic challenge. Despite these concerns, officials still recognize the value of infrastructure investments. The new plan aims to balance continued expansion with sustainable practices, addressing past issues while pursuing new avenues for economic growth.
