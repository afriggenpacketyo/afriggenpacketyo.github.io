          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 01:07:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spanish midfielder Mariona Caldentey has acknowledged England's resilience ahead of the Euro 2025 final, stating the Lionesses are dangerous opponents who "have it inside them" to win. The match is a highly anticipated repeat of the 2023 Women's World Cup final, which Spain won. Despite England's challenging tournament, including a penalty shootout and an extra-time victory, Caldentey, who plays for Arsenal, respects their ability to perform in crucial moments. Spanish star Aitana Bonmati also noted that while England has played more minutes, Spain is prepared for a tough game against a familiar rival.</p>

          <p>Several prominent Chinese companies are actively fundraising, signaling renewed investor confidence as market sentiment improves. AI firm SenseTime is set to raise significant capital by issuing 1.67 billion new shares to support AI infrastructure and research into areas like robotics. Concurrently, dairy giant Mengniu is issuing yuan-denominated bonds totaling 3.5 billion yuan to refinance existing debt and fund green and social-responsibility projects. This wave of capital market activity, particularly in the tech and consumer sectors, reflects a broader trend of firms shoring up liquidity and financing expansion plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 00:59:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two former City traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for manipulating the Libor inter-bank lending rate quashed after a decade-long legal battle. This high-profile ruling raises questions about potential compensation for wrongful imprisonment and the possibility of appeals from seven other traders convicted in the scandal. The decision has also renewed calls for a public inquiry into the broader context of the scandal, including the role of senior bank managers and the Serious Fraud Office's investigation methods. Both men maintain they were made scapegoats for the 2008 financial crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship is unconstitutional, affirming a nationwide block on its enforcement. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the order, which would deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents in the country illegally or temporarily, contradicts the 14th Amendment. The 2-1 decision upholds a lower court's ruling and marks a significant legal setback for the administration's policy. The issue is now positioned one step closer to a potential review by the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Amid a nationwide housing affordability crisis, a growing number of states are passing laws to override local zoning regulations and force cities to allow for denser, more affordable housing. The article highlights Utah, where skyrocketing home prices have made homeownership unattainable for most renters, prompting state-level mandates for cities to create cheaper housing options. While proponents argue this is necessary to address the housing shortage, many local officials and residents are pushing back, citing concerns over infrastructure strain and loss of local control. This reflects a broader national struggle over how to solve the housing crisis.</p>

          <p>The recent MLS All-Star game, which saw the MLS team defeat a Liga MX selection 3-1, has renewed discussions about the event's purpose and future. While the game provided entertainment, the notable absence of superstar Lionel Messi highlighted a potential disconnect between the league's traditions and the priorities of its top global talent. Messi's decision to skip the event, potentially saving himself for more critical matches, suggests a need for re-evaluation. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged the event's business importance but admitted it may be time to rethink the format to keep it compelling for players and fans.</p>

          <p>A major study indicates that walking just 7,000 steps a day, rather than the commonly cited 10,000, can significantly boost brainpower and reduce the risk of serious health issues. Published in the Lancet Public Health, the research found this more achievable target is linked to a lower risk of dementia, heart disease, cancer, and depression. The popular 10,000-step goal originated from a 1960s marketing campaign in Japan and lacks a strong evidence base. Researchers hope these findings will encourage more people to use step-tracking as a practical way to improve their health.</p>

          <p>A rare violet sea snail, Janthina janthina, has been discovered on a La Jolla beach, a species not typically seen in Southern California. An oceanography student from Scripps Institution of Oceanography found the creature, which is known for its vibrant purple shell and bubble raft that keeps it afloat in the open ocean. These snails usually inhabit warmer tropical seas, and their appearance often coincides with warmer offshore waters moving toward the coast. While a direct link to climate change is uncertain, researchers will monitor for more sightings if warm water trends continue.</p>

          <p>Following the death of frontman Ozzy Osbourne at age 76, this article looks back at how his band, Black Sabbath, invented the genre of heavy metal. Originating from working-class Birmingham, the band reacted against the optimistic music of the late 1960s by creating a darker, heavier sound inspired by horror films. Guitarist Tony Iommi's unique playing style, developed after an industrial accident, created the detuned, powerful riffs that became the genre's foundation. The band's controversial themes and Osbourne's electrifying stage presence cemented their status as rock legends, influencing countless musicians for over five decades.</p>

          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter compared to the previous one, surpassing expectations and allowing the country to avoid a technical recession. The growth was primarily driven by a strong 4.2% increase in exports, particularly in semiconductors and petroleum products, as some firms reportedly expedited shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. However, domestic demand remains a concern, and economists predict that externally facing sectors will struggle if global trade softens. The positive GDP figure may not be sustainable, with full-year growth expected to remain modest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has finalized new trade agreements with Indonesia and the Philippines, a strategic move that analysts believe could indirectly challenge China's economic influence in the region. Under the deals, imports from the two Southeast Asian nations will face a 19 percent tariff, while U.S. exports to them will be duty-free. This policy could encourage a reshaping of regional supply chains and provide the U.S. with access to critical resources like rare earth minerals.
