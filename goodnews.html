          <h2>Tariff Uncertainty Cuts Apple and Samsung Smartphone Growth Forecasts</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Counterpoint Research has significantly lowered its 2025 shipment growth forecasts for Apple and Samsung smartphones due to uncertainties surrounding U.S. tariff policies. The research firm reduced its overall global smartphone shipment growth forecast from 4.2% to 1.9% year-on-year, citing renewed concerns over U.S. tariffs. Apple's shipment growth is now expected to be 2.5%, down from 4%, while Samsung is projected to see no growth, compared to a previously anticipated 1.7% increase. The revisions also factor in weakened demand in North America, Europe, and parts of Asia, although Huawei is expected to see shipment growth due to easing component sourcing bottlenecks. Optimism about Apple's shipment growth has been tempered by concerns regarding tariffs on Chinese-made iPhones and Trump's desire for domestic production.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a reversal of changes to the winter fuel payment policy, ensuring more people will qualify for the allowance this year. The previous policy, which restricted the payment to those on pension credit, was widely criticized for negatively impacting pensioners with slightly higher incomes. While details on the exact changes remain unclear, the government aims to increase eligibility for the payment, worth up to ¬£300, to help cover energy costs during the winter. The government insists the initial policy was necessary to stabilize public finances, allowing for the current improvements in the economic picture.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is bringing back the Snack Wrap to its U.S. menus starting July 10 after a nine-year hiatus due to kitchen complexity. The revamped Snack Wrap will feature fried chicken and come in Ranch and Spicy flavors, a departure from the original version's grilled chicken and varied sauce options. The company launched a promotional webpage called snackwrapfiles.com, showcasing fan content and petitions that garnered nearly 19,000 signatures urging the wrap's return. McDonald's social media acknowledged the fans' role in resurrecting the menu item, emphasizing that customer demand ultimately drove the decision.</p>

          <p>Patricia Krenwinkel, a former Charles Manson follower imprisoned for 56 years for her role in the Tate-LaBianca murders, has been recommended for parole. The decision marks a significant step for Krenwinkel, now 77, after numerous parole hearings, with commissioners acknowledging her growth and concluding she poses no danger to society. Despite the recommendation, Krenwinkel's release is not guaranteed, as the governor has the authority to veto the decision. Supporters emphasize her rehabilitation, the impact of childhood abuse, and the low recidivism rates of those released after long sentences, while some victims' family members continue to oppose her release.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma has one of the most successful public, universal pre-kindergarten programs in the U.S., offering a free elementary school grade for all 4-year-olds regardless of income. The program was established through legislation that closed a loophole in kindergarten funding, and it has become popular due to its benefits for children and working families. While other states face challenges in implementing universal pre-K due to cost and potential impact on private child care facilities, Oklahoma's model offers lessons on how to balance public and private interests. The key is focusing on how to keep the child care industry afloat, develop an appropriate curriculum, and build enough facilities.</p>

The 31-year-old, who also withdrew from this month's Nations League squad due to burnout, expressed that she doesn't feel it's fair to take the place of another player who is ready to give everything. Bright was the captain when England was beaten by Spain in the 2023 World Cup final and was a regular in the 2022 Euros squad, where the Lionesses won the tournament.</p>
