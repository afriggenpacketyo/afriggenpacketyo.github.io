          <p>AMD shares experienced a significant rise after Piper Sandler analysts raised their price target, citing optimism about the chipmaker's latest product announcements. The analysts foresee a "snapback" for AMD's graphics processing units (GPUs) in the fourth quarter, expecting the company to have navigated the financial impact of new U.S. license requirements affecting semiconductor exports to China. AMD recently unveiled its next-generation artificial intelligence chips, the Instinct MI400 series, including the Helios full-server rack designed for AI customers.

          <p>Investing $400,000 in an immediate fixed annuity at age 65 can yield monthly payments ranging from approximately $2,246 to $2,590, contingent on factors like gender and payout option. These payouts are shaped by factors such as gender, life expectancy, the interest rate environment, and the annuity's structure. While annuities provide a guaranteed income stream, they also involve trade-offs such as reduced liquidity and limited potential for higher returns compared to other investments. The decision to invest in an annuity should be made after carefully assessing one's overall financial situation, retirement goals, and need for liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>
