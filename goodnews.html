          <p>Thames Water has been hit with a ¬£122.7 million fine, the largest ever issued by the water regulator Ofwat, for breaches related to its wastewater operations and dividend payments. The regulator's investigation, described as its "biggest and most complex," determined that the fines would be paid by the company and its investors, not by customers. A Thames Water spokesperson stated that the company takes its environmental responsibilities very seriously and is committed to improving its performance in this area, although specific details of the breaches were not provided in the article. The penalty underscores the increased scrutiny and accountability placed on utility companies regarding environmental compliance.</p>

          <p>China has secured a patent for a next-generation self-cooling turbine blade, marking a significant advancement in jet engine technology. This new alloy turbine blade can withstand temperatures 15% higher than existing versions, leading to greater engine thrust, improved fuel efficiency, and extended service life. Developed by the Beijing Institute of Aeronautical Materials under Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC), the innovation is expected to benefit both military and civilian aircraft. The improved thermal tolerance of the blades aims to overcome limitations caused by the degradation of conventional turbine blades under extreme heat.</p>

          <p>European companies operating in China are encountering increasing difficulties due to weak economic demand and unclear government regulations, according to a survey by the European Chamber of Commerce in China. Nearly three-quarters of the surveyed companies reported that operating in China is becoming harder, marking the fourth consecutive year of growing corporate pessimism. Despite these challenges, some European companies are increasing their reliance on Chinese suppliers for components, even as they reduce their overall investment in China. This trend highlights the complex dynamics of international trade and the challenges of decoupling from the Chinese economy.</p>

The report also calls for improved public health services for cannabis-related harm, enhanced education, and fair access to medical cannabis. Critics argue that decriminalisation would send the wrong message about the harm associated with cannabis, while supporters say it would create a more equitable and just system.</p>

Although the CDC is aware of the reported cases, there have been too few U.S. sequences reported for the variant to be included in its dashboard.
