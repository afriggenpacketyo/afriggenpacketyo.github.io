          <p>Chrysler is recalling more than 250,000 of its 2022-2025 Pacifica and Voyager models due to a potential problem with the side curtain airbags. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, some airbags may have improperly sealed seams, preventing them from holding sufficient pressure during deployment in certain crashes. The company has stated it is unaware of any accidents or injuries related to this defect. Dealers will inspect the vehicles and replace the airbags for free if necessary.</p>

          <p>Indian cricketer Smriti Mandhana scored a brilliant maiden T20 international hundred, leading her team to a commanding 97-run victory over England. Mandhana's explosive 112 from 62 balls propelled India to a formidable total of 210-5, the second-highest score England has ever conceded in the format. England's response faltered early, and despite a solid 66 from captain Nat Sciver-Brunt, they were bowled out for 113. The result marks England's heaviest T20 defeat by runs and highlights areas for improvement as they continue the five-match series.</p>

          <p>An estimated 100,000 people participated in the annual Budapest Pride march, openly defying a government ban enacted under a controversial law targeting LGBTQ+ events. The march, framed by organizers and the city's mayor as a municipal event to bypass the ban, proceeded despite threats of fines and potential police action. Many participants viewed the event not only as a stand for LGBTQ+ rights but also as a protest against what they see as broader democratic erosion under Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n. The significant turnout is seen as a public rebuke to the government's increasingly restrictive policies.</p>

          <p>The J.M. Smucker Co. has announced its intention to eliminate artificial colors from all its products by the end of 2027, with an earlier 2026 deadline for foods sold to schools.

Head coach Andy Farrell expressed concern but noted the team's attacking philosophy, led by fly-half Finn Russell, was on full display.

The letter requests that publishers refrain from releasing AI-generated books, using AI tools to replace employees, or using AI for audiobook narration without human involvement. This move represents a new front in authors' fight against AI, shifting focus from lawsuits against tech companies to direct appeals to their publishing partners. The authors argue that while AI is a powerful tool, it poses an existential threat to art and artists.</p>

          <p>A recent Ukrainian drone raid on Russian airbases, dubbed "Operation Spider Web," represents a significant tactical innovation that could change modern warfare. The operation, which reportedly used smuggled drones to destroy or damage numerous strategic bombers deep inside Russia, undermines the traditional concept of "rear areas" being safe from attack. This analysis suggests the low-cost, high-impact strategy provides a blueprint for smaller nations to counter the airpower of larger adversaries. The attack forces Russia to divert significant resources to base defense and carries a potent psychological blow, demonstrating Ukraine's sophisticated operational capabilities.</p>
