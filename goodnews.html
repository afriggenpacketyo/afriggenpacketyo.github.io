          <p>Huawei Technologies founder Ren Zhengfei stated that while the company's Ascend chips lag behind U.S. chips by a generation, state-of-the-art performance can still be achieved through methods like stacking and clustering. Ren emphasized China's advantages in AI development, including a large young population, sufficient electricity, and a developed information network. He also noted the availability of numerous open-source software programs to meet societal needs. Ren's comments come as the U.S. increases restrictions on China and Huawei, with new guidance stating that the use of Ascend chips could violate American export controls. Huawei's resilience suggests a continued push for technological advancement despite external pressures.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to curb elevated rice prices. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced that the released rice will be distributed to smaller supermarket operators in addition to major retailers. This move will leave the country with a rice reserve of 100,000 tons. Rice prices have doubled compared to last year, averaging 4,260 yen per 5 kilograms in late May, prompting the government to take action. This measure aims to stabilize the market and provide affordable rice to consumers.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2bn of investment to build the new Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, ahead of the Spending Review. Sizewell C is expected to create 10,000 direct jobs and generate enough energy to power six million homes. The government insists that nuclear power is crucial for eliminating fossil fuels from the UK's energy grid by 2030, though the project will take at least a decade to complete. Critics argue that the money could be spent on other priorities and fear the project will add to consumer bills. The investment reflects a commitment to nuclear energy.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros Discovery, the owner of CNN and HBO Max, plans to split into two companies by the middle of next year.

The Streaming & Studios business will include HBO Max and the film division, while the Global Networks business will include CNN, Discovery, and TNT Sports. The split aims to empower these brands with sharper focus and strategic flexibility.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Institution is challenging President Trump's authority to dismiss the leader of the National Portrait Gallery, asserting its control over personnel decisions. While the Smithsonian will look into Trump's complaints, it maintains that it has the autonomy to manage its staff. This stance reflects a broader tension between the administration and cultural institutions regarding artistic and intellectual freedom. The situation highlights the ongoing debate over the role of government in arts and culture.</p>

          <p>New government guidance in England says teachers can use artificial intelligence (AI) to speed up marking and write letters home to parents. The training materials state that teachers can use AI to "help automate routine tasks" and focus on "quality face-to-face time." Teachers should be transparent about their use of AI and always check its results. AI should only be used for "low-stakes" marking such as quizzes or homework. The guidance aims to support teachers in utilizing AI effectively. The implementation of AI may have a positive impact on education.</p>
