          <p>During President Trump's state visit to the UK, fashion choices took center stage as a form of diplomacy. Melania Trump's Dior suit and Burberry trench coat were interpreted as nods to both American support for Europe and British fashion, respectively, while the Princess of Wales coordinated her burgundy outfit with her husband's tie to signal unity. The Queen's sapphire blue dress and matching coat were seen as a reflection of the US flag alongside Catherine's red outfit, demonstrating coordinated diplomatic dressing. These sartorial selections sent powerful messages of support and alliance during the high-profile visit, emphasizing the importance of visual communication in international relations. The coordinated outfits of both the Trumps and the Prince and Princess of Wales further underscored their support for their respective countries' agendas, solidifying the role of fashion as a diplomatic tool. </p>

Lyft will manage the Waymo fleet in Nashville, handling vehicle readiness, maintenance, and depot operations. Waymo, owned by Alphabet, has been expanding its robotaxi services across the US, and this partnership with Lyft aims to further penetrate the market, while Lyft hopes to grow faster in markets where autonomous cars are present. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As interest rates potentially decrease, experts are advising homeowners on whether to refinance their home equity loans. Refinancing may be beneficial for borrowers with high rates or large balances, allowing them to lower monthly payments or adjust loan terms. However, it may not be worthwhile for those with already low rates, short-term selling plans, or near loan completion. Experts emphasize evaluating closing costs and individual financial situations to determine if refinancing is a sound financial decision. The decision depends on individual circumstances, emphasizing the importance of consulting a financial advisor. </p>

          <p>Former NFL star Shawne Merriman is optimistic about the Los Angeles Chargers after their strong start to the season. He believes the team's all-around performance, coupled with Jim Harbaugh's coaching and Justin Herbert's stability, makes them contenders for the AFC title. Merriman also noted that the Chargers are no longer solely reliant on Herbert, as they have a physical team on both sides of the football. He contrasted this with the Kansas City Chiefs, suggesting they can't solely depend on Patrick Mahomes anymore and need to address team weaknesses. </p>

          <p>Experts are advising workers to hold off on making major financial moves based on President Trump's "no tax on tips" deduction, citing a need for further clarification from the Treasury and IRS. The deduction, allowing certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in "qualified tips" per year, is set to begin in 2025. Uncertainty remains regarding which jobs will qualify and how the official list will interact with specified service trades or businesses (SSTBs). Financial advisors are urging those potentially eligible to consult with tax professionals to maximize the overall tax break once more details are released. </p>

          <p>J.D. Power has released its annual rankings for the best airports in North America, based on surveys from U.S. and Canadian residents. The rankings consider factors such as ease of travel, level of trust, facilities, staff, and food and retail options. Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport was the top-scoring mega airport for the second consecutive year, while John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, led the large airport category. Indianapolis International Airport ranked highest among medium airports for the fourth year in a row. Overall, mega airports tend to lag behind smaller ones due to longer wait times and bigger crowds. </p>

Divers were able to confirm the ship's identity through distinctive features, including a double drum trawl winch and a raised forecastle deck.

          <p>Kevin O'Leary suggests that $500,000 in savings can be enough to live comfortably off the interest alone, assuming a 5% return in fixed income or 8.5-9% in equities. This translates to $25,000 to $45,000 a year in passive income without touching the principal. O'Leary advises against risky investments like restaurants or bars, emphasizing the importance of smart financial decisions. However, the average American believes they need $1.26 million to retire comfortably, and most have far less saved. Therefore, while technically sound, O'Leary's suggestion requires discipline, strategy, and a modest lifestyle. </p>
