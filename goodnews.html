          <h2>U.S. Consumer Sentiment Shows Modest Improvement in July Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 11:49:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A University of Michigan survey revealed that U.S. consumer sentiment experienced a slight increase in July, marking the second consecutive month of improvement. This uptick occurred despite ongoing concerns about President Trump's tariff policies, which have targeted numerous countries. While the overall sentiment remains significantly lower than pre-presidency levels, year-ahead inflation expectations have notably decreased. The data suggests that robust consumer spending, a crucial component of the U.S. economy, has not yet been substantially dampened by the trade uncertainties, though analysts remain watchful of potential future price hikes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron has finalized its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that grants it significant access to prolific offshore oil reserves in Guyana. The deal proceeded after an international arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region's Stabroek Block. While Chevron's CEO celebrated the affirmation of corporate merger practices, the company's stock saw a slight dip, whereas Exxon's shares fell more significantly following the news. Some job reductions are expected as the two energy giants integrate their operations.</p>

          <p>The price of Ether and shares of cryptocurrency-related companies like Coinbase and Robinhood climbed significantly following the congressional passage of the GENIUS Act, a landmark stablecoin regulation bill. Ether reached its highest price since January, and ETFs tracking the cryptocurrency saw record inflows, surpassing those for Bitcoin. The market's positive reaction highlights growing investor confidence in the crypto sector as it moves toward a more defined regulatory landscape in the United States. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's price saw a slight dip as investor focus shifted to the newly legitimized stablecoin market and associated assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to the latest University of Michigan Survey of Consumers, Americans' inflation expectations have fallen to their lowest levels since before President Trump's major tariff announcements. The one-year inflation outlook dropped to 4.4% from 5% in June, while the five-year forecast also declined, signaling that consumers may believe the price hikes from tariffs will be temporary. Despite this improved outlook on inflation, overall consumer sentiment remains subdued and is still well below levels seen before the current administration took office. This data provides an encouraging sign for the Federal Reserve as it monitors economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Author Philippa Langley, known for helping discover the remains of King Richard III, now claims that the two young princes famously believed to have been murdered in the Tower of London actually survived. Her new book presents findings from the 'Missing Princes Project,' which argues that the traditional narrative of their murder by their uncle, Richard III, was Tudor propaganda. Langley's research suggests evidence of the princes' survival, including documents supporting a rebellion led by a boy identified as a son of King Edward IV. This new thesis challenges a centuries-old historical account, though it has been met with skepticism from some historians.</p>

          <p>Delta and United Airlines are increasingly distinguishing themselves from competitors in a difficult year for the airline industry, capturing over 86% of the profits among the top seven carriers. Analysts attribute their success to strong international networks and a focus on premium travel, which have provided a buffer against weaker domestic demand and falling airfares for coach seats. While both airlines have trimmed their 2025 forecasts, their emphasis on high-margin premium cabins and lucrative loyalty programs positions them to better navigate the market's challenges compared to other major U.S. airlines.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 'no tax on tips' provision included in President Trump's recent legislative package has been enacted, but it creates a tax deduction rather than a complete exemption. The new rule allows for a deduction of up to $25,000 on tipped income, though it is still subject to payroll and state taxes and phases out for higher earners. Significant questions remain about its implementation, as the IRS has yet to clarify which specific occupations will qualify for the break, which is set to be available from 2025 through 2028. This uncertainty leaves many tipped workers waiting for definitive guidance on how they will be affected. (not investment advice)</p>

The investigation was launched over comments made on stage, but police concluded there was 'insufficient evidence' for a realistic prospect of conviction. The group, which had faced controversy for its pro-Palestinian stance, called the investigation an act of 'political policing intimidation.'

          <p>A Mexican diplomat has stated it is 'very unlikely' that Chinese-owned factories operating in Mexico will be excluded from the preferential trade benefits of the USMCA pact. Deputy Commercial Counsellor David Trujillo addressed concerns ahead of the trade deal's review next year, suggesting that any revisions will likely focus on tightening rules-of-origin requirements rather than targeting companies from specific nations. This would mean products might need a higher percentage of locally sourced components to qualify for tariff-free treatment. The statement provides some reassurance to Chinese investors using Mexico as a manufacturing base for the North American market.</p>

          <p>Amy Shack Egan, a two-time founder who is currently pregnant with twins while launching her latest venture, speaks about the difficulties mothers face in the world of entrepreneurship. She argues that the pervasive 'hustle and grind' culture is not built to accommodate the realities of motherhood and often forces female founders to make significant sacrifices. Egan highlights the need for better support systems and a shift away from the expectation that entrepreneurs must abandon their personal lives to succeed. She advocates for finding balance, stating that a life outside of work is essential for avoiding burnout and achieving long-term success.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered a remarkably preserved wooden face, estimated to be over 1,000 years old, submerged in Poland's Lake Lednica. The carving, found on a structural beam from a defensive rampart, is believed to date back to the 10th century, a pivotal period in Polish history. Experts suggest the face likely had a spiritual or protective purpose, possibly intended to ward off evil spirits from the settlement. The discovery, along with similar finds in other Slavic cities, provides a rare and valuable glimpse into the artistic traditions and spiritual practices of early medieval Slavic people.</p>
