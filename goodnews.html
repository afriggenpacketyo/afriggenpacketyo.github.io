          <p>An ancient writing system from Zambia, Sona or Tusona, is being highlighted through a social media campaign by the Women's History Museum of Zambia. Sona, originating from the Chokwe, Luchazi, and Luvale people, involves geometric patterns conveying mathematical principles, messages about nature, and instructions on community life. The original custodians of Sona were women. The project aims to challenge the notion that African societies lacked their own knowledge systems and to revive cultural heritages nearly erased by colonialism.</p>
