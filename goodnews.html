        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a deadly attack on Hindu tourists in Kashmir, India has initiated a diplomatic offensive, sending delegations to 33 countries to garner support for its "zero tolerance" policy on terrorism. The delegations are equipped with dossiers detailing Pakistan's alleged involvement in fostering terrorism and linking the April attack to Pakistan-based militant groups. While Pakistan denies any involvement, India seeks to present its strikes on Pakistan as legitimate acts of self-defense under international law. Policy experts suggest this diplomatic push aims to counter Pakistan's narrative and reinforce India's position on fighting terrorism, highlighting the ongoing tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron's office has dismissed an incident in Hanoi where his wife, Brigitte Macron, appeared to push his face away upon arrival in Vietnam. Video footage showed Brigitte's hands on Macron's face, causing him to appear startled; however, Macron later told reporters that it was merely a joke between him and his wife. Sources close to the president described the incident as a harmless "squabble" and blamed pro-Russian accounts for amplifying negative comments about it. Macron's visit to Vietnam marks the beginning of a Southeast Asian tour, where he aims to position France as a reliable alternative to the US and China amid economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders issued a reminder to his players and staff to stay safe and make responsible decisions during the Memorial Day holiday. Sanders emphasized the importance of avoiding actions that could jeopardize their opportunities to become professionals, cautioning them about untrustworthy individuals. This message follows cryptic posts on X where Sanders called out "false stories," without specifying the exact subject. Coach Prime has been under scrutiny since his son, Shedeur Sanders, was drafted in the fifth round of the NFL Draft, with the younger Sanders attributing some of the online criticism to his father's public image.</p>

          <p>The Japan Sumo Association's Yokozuna Deliberation Council has unanimously recommended Onosato's promotion to yokozuna, the highest rank in sumo wrestling, after the ozeki secured his second consecutive championship. This decision will be formally ratified at a JSA meeting on Wednesday, making the 24-year-old the second active yokozuna alongside Hoshoryu. Onosato expressed his commitment to learning and understanding the responsibilities of a yokozuna, while Tadamori Oshima, head of the council, praised his dignified performance under pressure. His promotion is the fastest under the six-tournament calendar introduced in 1958, highlighting his rapid ascent in the sport.</p>

          <p>Liverpool secured their 20th title in a dominant Premier League season, marking a successful first year for head coach Arne Slot, and Mohamed Salah was a key player. Arsenal finished second, but had a disappointing season due to too many draws and failure to sign a striker. Manchester City had a disappointing season by their standards, failing to win a fifth consecutive Premier League title. Chelsea finished fourth and are looking forward to a Europa Conference League final against Real Betis, however, they need a better goalkeeper and a reliable goalscorer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senior figures in British business report a "chilling effect" on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, with companies "rebranding" these efforts to avoid political scrutiny. This comes as DEI initiatives face a right-wing backlash on both sides of the Atlantic, prompting organizations to reframe policies under terms like "wellbeing," "belonging," and "culture." Experts note that while a full-scale rollback is unlikely in the UK due to the Equalities Act, some US-headquartered firms are scaling back commitments and avoiding public celebration of inclusion work. The trend reflects a growing sensitivity to political pressure and a desire to maintain business operations amid a polarized environment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the five years since the anti-police protests following George Floyd's death, initiatives focused on officer mental health have gained momentum. The protests exacerbated the already poor mental health of officers, bringing the issue to greater public attention and contributing to resignations and burnout. Research shows that police officers are more likely to suffer from cardiac death at a younger age and experience higher rates of depression, PTSD, and substance abuse. States are implementing wellness units, mandated training, and peer support programs to address these challenges, and agencies are creating dedicated wellness rooms for their officers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the need to shift our perception of the natural world, arguing that we must recognize the aliveness and agency of elements like water, ice, and land. Drawing on the concept of "Agua es vida" and the work of writers like Robert Macfarlane and Amitav Ghosh, the author suggests that the climate crisis is not just a problem of emissions but also of the human imagination. The piece highlights the Rights of Nature movement, where countries are enshrining legal protections for natural entities, and emphasizes the importance of time, attention, and humility in understanding our interconnectedness with the environment. By animating the world through language and observation, we can foster a deeper sense of responsibility and connection to the planet.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the challenges posed by the current administration, America's democracy demonstrates resilience due to several key factors, according to this article. These factors include a robust network of advocacy groups, a powerful and independent judiciary, a constitutional system resistant to rapid change, a diverse and free private press, a federal system of government, and a strong commitment to free speech. The author argues that these elements distinguish the United States from countries where democracy has recently declined, and they provide a foundation for defending American values and institutions. While acknowledging the harm caused by recent actions, the article expresses hope in the enduring strength of America's democratic framework.</p>

          <p>The article explores the often-overlooked role of personal finance in the climate crisis, highlighting how pensions, investments, and banking decisions can contribute to fossil fuel projects. It reveals that switching to a sustainable pension provider can be far more effective than other individual actions like reducing air travel or adopting a vegetarian diet. The article discusses how banks fund the fossil fuel industry and explores green finance alternatives, emphasizing the need for greater transparency and regulation in the financial sector. Ultimately, it argues that while personal finance decisions can make a difference, collective action and policy changes are crucial for addressing the climate crisis.</p>
