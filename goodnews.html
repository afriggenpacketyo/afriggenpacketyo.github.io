        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for thunderstorms across southern England, parts of the Midlands, and most of south Wales, predicting 10-15mm of rain in less than an hour and potentially 30-40mm over several hours. The weather agency warns of frequent lightning, hail, and strong winds, which could disrupt transport, delay train services, cause power outages, and damage buildings. This follows an unusually dry spring, with some areas potentially receiving more rain on Saturday than they did throughout the entire month of May. While not every location will experience heavy showers, those that do could face significant disruptions. The yellow warning is the lowest level issued by the Met Office, indicating the probability of severe weather and its potential impact.</p>

          <p>Experts recommend six exercises to alleviate sore and achy feet, emphasizing that strengthening foot muscles can reduce pain and prevent injury. These exercises include foot doming, which strengthens the foot core; wall stretches, which increase blood flow and relieve pain; toe spreads, which improve flexibility and stability; toe yoga, which enhances balance; calf raises, which strengthen stabilizing muscles; and foot massages, which loosen tension and lubricate joints. Consulting a healthcare provider is advised for those with preexisting foot conditions. Regular foot exercises can improve overall foot health and prevent future problems.</p>

          <p>Following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, many young Russians fled their home country and found refuge in Germany, and some are now becoming involved in local politics. Ilya Makarov, 21, left Russia after facing administrative charges for anti-war activism and joined Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD). Anastasiya Lukomskaya, 35, an artist and activist from Moscow, joined the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) after realizing she could be in danger coming back home.

          <p>Tottenham captain Son Heung-min described recently dismissed manager Ange Postecoglou as a club legend who has "changed the trajectory of this club." Postecoglou, sacked just over two weeks after winning the Europa League final, received tributes from several players, including goalkeeper Vicario and defender Micky van de Ven. Despite a league season that fell short of expectations, the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust acknowledged that most fans will "love Ange forever" and called for his replacement to be fully supported by the club's board. Brentford boss Thomas Frank is among the leading candidates to replace Postecoglou.</p>
