        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rivian Automotive is laying off approximately 4.5% of its workforce due to increasing market challenges, impacting marketing, vehicle operations, sales, delivery, and mobile operations teams. CEO RJ Scaringe stated these changes are necessary to scale efficiently and build a profitable business as the company prepares to launch its new R2 models next year. The company's vehicle sales increased by 32% in the third quarter, but its 2025 delivery forecast was narrowed, and it flagged a larger adjusted core loss this year. These layoffs reflect the challenges EV manufacturers face amid changing regulations and slower-than-expected demand. Optimism is tempered by the need for restructuring in a competitive market.

This collaboration, expected to bring over a gigawatt of AI compute capacity online in 2026, is Google's largest TPU commitment to date. Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI researchers, utilizes a multi-cloud architecture, running its Claude language models across Google's TPUs, Amazon's Trainium chips, and Nvidia's GPUs, assigning specialized workloads to each platform. Anthropic's annual revenue run rate is approaching $7 billion, powering over 300,000 businesses, showcasing its rapid growth and efficient infrastructure strategy.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor exceeded third-quarter earnings expectations but lowered its 2025 guidance due to the impact of a fire at a Novelis aluminum supplier plant, which is disrupting production of profitable trucks and SUVs. The fire is expected to cost Ford between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, but the company plans to mitigate much of that impact by increasing manufacturing of impacted vehicles once supplies are available. Ford plans to add 1,000 workers to plants in Michigan and Kentucky to increase pickup truck production and recoup 50,000 units in 2026. Despite the setback, Ford remains on track to cut $1 billion in costs this year as part of its Ford+ plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ana Caldas, a transgender swimmer, has been banned from World Aquatics until 2030 and stripped of competitive results from June 2022 to October 2024 after refusing to take a sex verification test. This action follows World Aquatics' 2022 policy limiting transgender women's participation to those who transitioned before age 12 or Tanner Stage 2 of puberty. Caldas's wins at a U.S. Masters Swimming event earlier this year sparked controversy and criticism from competitors. The decision has been applauded by some who believe it upholds fairness in women's sports, while others may view it as discriminatory.</p>

          <p>Intel reported better-than-expected revenue, signaling a recovery in demand for its x86 processors for PCs; the stock jumped 6% in extended trading. The company recorded a per-share loss of 37 cents to account for shares in escrow to be released to the U.S. government as part of its $8.9 billion investment. Intel expects revenue in the fourth quarter of $13.3 billion at the midpoint, with adjusted earnings per share of 8 cents. Demand for Intel's chips outpaced supply, a trend expected to continue through next year, and the company also took a $5 billion investment from Nvidia in September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has cancelled plans to deploy federal troops to San Francisco following widespread condemnation from California leaders and protests. The decision came after conversations with Mayor Daniel Lurie and Silicon Valley leaders, including Marc Benioff and Jensen Huang. The operation, intended to start as early as Thursday, involved sending Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and other federal agents to the US Coast Guard base in Alameda. Protests had mobilized in anticipation, with hundreds gathering outside the base, but local leaders emphasized continued mobilization of support systems for affected residents.</p>

          <p>Meta is laying off an undisclosed number of employees in its risk organization as it shifts to using artificial intelligence to automate its compliance review process. The risk organization was established after the company was fined $5 billion by the Federal Trade Commission following the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal. Meta's revamped risk management system relies on more basic automation rather than bleeding-edge AI technologies. The job reductions come amid broader organizational restructurings at Meta, including layoffs in its Superintelligence Labs AI unit, but the top-tier TBD Labs division was unaffected.</p>

          <p>With the price of gold dropping, questions are arising about the potential for the price of the metal to fall even further in the weeks and months to come, especially for investors considering purchasing gold from major retailers like Costco or Walmart. A price decline in gold is worth exploiting, no matter where you ultimately feel most comfortable securing the metal from. Costco offers a more flexible way to buy in, and for some, it may be a more trustworthy path than having to deal with local jewelers or pawnshops. Price dips in the gold market are almost always temporary. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Home equity loan interest rates are near a two-year low, with an average rate of 8.11% on a 5-year loan, according to Bankrate data. Homeowners may benefit from applying for a loan now, as rates are lower than alternatives like personal loans and credit cards, and expected rate drops in the months ahead will be minimal. By locking in a rate now, homeowners can avoid worrying about future rate changes, although failure to pay could result in foreclosure.

          <p>The upcoming release of September's consumer price index report is expected to be a market-moving event due to a lack of recent economic data, with economists anticipating a monthly increase of 0.4%. This would put the 12-month inflation rate at 3.1%, a slight increase from August, and economists at Goldman Sachs expect upward pressure on categories such as communication, household furnishings, and recreation due to tariffs. Geopolitical uncertainty and trade tensions have raised worries about higher prices slowing economic growth, and the CPI report should help answer some of these questions. The report will also influence the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, where another interest rate cut is expected. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A CBS News poll explores California voters' opinions on Governor Gavin Newsom, former Vice President Kamala Harris, and key state issues. While a large number of California Democrats support Newsom running for president in 2028, overall voter opinion is split, and the poll also reveals that Californians believe the state sets a good example on technology, culture, and environmental policy. However, they do not think it sets a good example on housing, tax, economic, or political policy, with most describing the cost of living in the state as unmanageable. The poll also examines voter consideration of potential candidates for the 2026 gubernatorial race.</p>

          <p>With gold prices swinging sharply, investors can capitalize on the volatility through trading gold mining stocks, using gold ETFs or futures for short-term plays, and buying physical gold on dips. Gold mining stocks often move in tandem with the price of gold but with greater leverage, and gold ETFs offer diversified exposure to the sector. Gold-backed ETFs or futures contracts allow for precise trading of gold's price movements, while buying physical gold during sharp price drops can be a smart long-term strategy. The key to success is flexibility and strategic thinking, given the current market's uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>
