          <p>An opinion piece reflects on how Chairman Mao Zedong warned about the threat of "peaceful evolution" by American imperialists seeking to subjugate China by promoting Western values and inciting dissent against the Communist Party's rule. The author, who was born in the 1960s in China, notes that China has emerged as a major economic power, while the US has shifted away from nation-building efforts. The article suggests that under President Trump, the perceived threat of American subversion has receded, as the US has vowed to stop lecturing others on governance. This shift marks a significant change in the ideological Cold War dynamic between the two nations.</p>

          <p>An advice column addresses a reader's dilemma about her husband's interest in ethical non-monogamy while she prefers monogamy. The columnist emphasizes the importance of open communication, personal growth, and clearly stating one's desires and boundaries in a relationship. Drawing on the philosophy of Erich Fromm, the article discusses the concepts of freedom, self-love, and avoiding masochistic or sadistic dynamics in love. The advice focuses on ensuring emotional security within the existing relationship before considering non-monogamy and suggests a temporary relationship structure to ease into it if both partners are willing. </p>

          <p>Passengers on an American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Naples, Italy, experienced a significant disruption when their Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner was diverted to Rome due to operational limitations related to the aircraft's size. The flight, AA780, had to land in Rome because the 787-9 was too large to land at Naples Airport, which usually accommodates the slightly smaller Boeing 787-8. After landing in Rome, passengers were transported to Naples by bus, a journey of approximately three hours. American Airlines apologized for the inconvenience caused by this unexpected change in travel plans.</p>

          <p>A network of women in Latin America has transformed access to safe, self-managed abortions by sharing information and providing support, despite legal restrictions. The discovery of misoprostol's effectiveness in inducing abortions led activists to create hotlines, publish manuals, and develop acompa√±amiento (accompaniment) networks. These efforts have empowered women to safely terminate pregnancies outside of formal healthcare settings. The article highlights the evolution of this movement, from whispered conversations to international recognition, and its impact on legalizing abortion in several countries.</p>
