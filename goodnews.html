          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 13:00:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Interest rates for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have recently decreased, offering a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners. With average rates for both products now sitting around 8.25%, they present a potentially cheaper alternative to high-interest credit cards and personal loans. The article advises homeowners to carefully compare HELOCs and home equity loans, check offers from their current mortgage lender, and precisely determine their borrowing needs to avoid risk, as their home serves as collateral.

          <p>The city of Philadelphia has officially renamed a portion of South Broad Street as "Teddy Pendergrass Way" to honor the iconic R&B singer. The ceremony celebrated the life and legacy of the Philadelphia native, who was the lead singer of Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes before a successful solo career. The designated street is located in the Avenue of the Arts neighborhood, near where Pendergrass recorded many of his hits. Mayor Cherelle Parker also presented the singer's family with a replica of the Liberty Bell, the city's highest honor.</p>

          <p>Chicago's Field Museum is preparing a new exhibit to honor the culture of American Samoa, featuring two indigenous artists working on-site. Su'a Uilisone Fitiao and Reggie Meredith Fitiao are creating traditional pieces to ensure their heritage is preserved and represented for future generations. Su'a is carving an outrigger for a 19th-century canoe, while Reggie is creating a "siapo," a traditional artwork on bark cloth using natural dyes. Their work, which will be part of an exhibit opening in 2026, highlights the deep connection between their art and the natural world.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) has opened a new firefighter training facility in Merced County to expand its workforce amid increasing wildfire threats. The Atwater Training Center, located at a former Air Force base, will help train about 1,600 firefighters annually, bolstering the state's response capabilities. This expansion comes as federal firefighting agencies like the U.S. Forest Service face significant staffing shortages. The new center is part of a broader state effort that has nearly doubled Cal Fire's budget and authorized positions since 2017.</p>

          <p>Kathy Ball-Toncic, who escaped the World Trade Center's North Tower on 9/11, is now channeling her resilience into a new challenge after surviving two cancer diagnoses. Years after the attacks, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and later colorectal cancer, both of which are linked to toxic exposure at the WTC site. Having used marathon running as a way to heal and give back, her recent chemotherapy treatments made that impossible. Instead, she is now training to ride in the Pan-Mass Challenge to raise money for the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, which provided her care.</p>

          <p>Following England's victory in the Euro 2025 final, defender Lucy Bronze revealed she played the entire tournament with a fractured tibia. The 33-year-old Chelsea player started all six of the Lionesses' matches, playing a crucial role in their championship run despite the significant injury. Medical experts described her ability to compete at such a high level as "remarkable," suggesting the injury was likely a stress fracture that was carefully managed by the team's medical staff. England manager Sarina Wiegman praised Bronze's "crazy mentality" and resilience in playing through the pain.</p>

Family members were integrated into the camp, and a team barista even brought his dog, Reggie, to boost morale. This focus on camaraderie and mental well-being was credited with building the resilience needed to win the championship.</p>

          <p>Despite recent changes to airport security procedures, such as ending the "shoes off" policy for all travelers and adding dedicated family lanes, experts say paid services like TSA PreCheck still offer significant benefits. While standard screening lines may become faster, trusted traveler programs provide a consistently less stressful and more efficient experience, with 99% of PreCheck passengers waiting less than 10 minutes. For frequent travelers, the convenience and time savings can be well worth the enrollment fee, which some credit cards will cover.</p>
