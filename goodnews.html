          <p>In a series of interviews, candidates running for Governor of California in 2026 shared their perspectives on the accomplishments and shortcomings of Governor Gavin Newsom's administration. Democratic candidates like Toni Atkins and Xavier Becerra praised Newsom's economic management and efforts to counter the Trump administration. In contrast, Republican candidates such as Sheriff Chad Bianco and Leo Zacky were highly critical, struggling to name any positive achievements. The responses provide an early look at the key issues and political divides shaping the upcoming gubernatorial race.</p>

With a current valuation around $850 billion, JPMorgan's stock has seen significant gains this year, fueled by strong sector performance and an expansion of its price-to-earnings multiple as investors show renewed confidence in financial institutions.

          <p>Under manager Thomas Frank, Tottenham Hotspur has shifted from an attack-focused style to a more pragmatic, defensive approach, resulting in four clean sheets in their first five games. This change was evident in their recent 1-0 Champions League victory against Villarreal, where they secured an early lead and then defended resolutely, preventing the opposition from registering a single shot on target. While this cautious style may be less exciting for fans, players and the manager have emphasized the importance of a "clean sheet mentality" to make the team harder to defeat.</p>

          <p>The rendezvous of Northrop Grumman's Cygnus XL cargo ship with the International Space Station has been delayed after the spacecraft experienced two premature engine shutdowns. The uncrewed ship, carrying over 11,000 pounds of supplies and equipment, was on its way to the station following a Sunday launch. Flight controllers are now working to diagnose the problem and develop a new plan to safely guide the spacecraft to the ISS. All other systems on the Cygnus vehicle are reported to be functioning normally.</p>

However, a new agreement with the IOC and the strong desire from players to compete for their countries made the return worthwhile.

          <p>Josh Harris, co-founder of Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, stated that major sports ownership groups and teams are unlikely to go public despite soaring valuations. Speaking at a conference, Harris explained that sports assets have historically been valued more highly as private entities than on public markets. He argued that private ownership allows for a long-term perspective focused on winning, which can involve significant spending that public markets might not embrace. This structure is better suited for the intergenerational nature of sports franchise ownership.</p>
