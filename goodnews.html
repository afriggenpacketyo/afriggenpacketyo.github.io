          <p>President Trump has appointed Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia to lead the new U.S. National Design Studio, an agency tasked with streamlining and beautifying government websites. The studio will advise on usability and aesthetics for three years, succeeding the controversial Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Gebbia stated his goal is to create a user experience similar to the Apple App Store, making government services simple and reliable. This appointment follows Gebbia's shift in political alignment from a major Democratic donor to a Trump supporter in 2024.</p>

          <h2>New Proposal Suggests Storing Carbon Like Gold to Combat Climate Change</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-24 06:45:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book, "The First and Last Bank," proposes a novel approach to climate change by treating excess atmospheric carbon as a valuable commodity to be hoarded, similar to the U.S. gold reserves in Fort Knox. Authored by anthropologist Gustav Peebles and artist Ben Luzzatto, the concept envisions community-based carbon banks that convert organic waste into biochar, a stable form of carbon. Depositors would receive a digital currency in exchange, creating a grassroots, decentralized system to incentivize carbon sequestration without relying on government or corporate action.</p>

The event, Europe's largest street party, features a children's parade on Sunday followed by the main adults' parade on Monday. Multiple sound systems and live stages will showcase a variety of music genres rooted in Jamaican culture. The carnival will also hold a 72-second silence at 3 p.m. on both days to honor the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire and others.</p>

          <p>Chelsea has approved the transfers of Carney Chukwuemeka and Aaron Anselmino to Borussia Dortmund, pushing the club's summer player sales beyond £270 million. Chukwuemeka is set for a permanent move for a fee around £24 million, while defender Anselmino will join on a season-long loan without a purchase option. These sales are crucial for Chelsea to comply with UEFA's financial regulations, which require a positive transfer balance to register new players for the Champions League. The club is still looking to sign two more players before the transfer window closes.</p>

          <p>Parts of the UK are expected to experience temperatures up to 30°C on the late August Bank Holiday Monday, with Wales potentially setting a new record for the period. The warm, sunny weather is ideal for events like the Notting Hill Carnival and various music festivals. However, the forecast indicates a significant shift midweek, as the remnants of a weakened Hurricane Erin are set to bring unsettled, wet, and windy conditions across the country. Travel disruptions are also expected due to strikes and engineering works, complicating holiday plans for many.</p>

          <p>This contributor article argues for an urgent modernization of the U.S. healthcare system, citing the frustratingly outdated methods of managing patient data, such as paper forms and disconnected records. The author shares a personal story of their daughter, whose rare disease management was complicated by fragmented information until an AI assistant identified a critical discrepancy. The piece praises a recent White House initiative and CMS's focus on creating a national provider directory and interoperability standards to break down data silos.

          <p>This opinion article suggests that China and India are at a critical juncture where they can reset their bilateral relations by moving beyond their long-standing rivalry. Recent high-level diplomatic exchanges, including a visit by China's Foreign Minister to New Delhi, signal a renewed willingness for constructive engagement. The author argues that Beijing should view New Delhi as a partner in reforming the global order, especially as global uncertainties and U.S. tariff policies encourage India to maintain its strategic autonomy. Restarting talks on India's participation in the RCEP is proposed as a key step.</p>

          <p>Over 500 Taiwanese soldiers participated in this year's Northern Strike military exercises in Michigan, marking Taiwan's largest-ever involvement in the U.S.-led drills. The participation figures were reported by Stars and Stripes, a Pentagon-linked media outlet, in a break from the usual policy of ambiguity regarding Taiwan's role in such exercises. This public acknowledgment is seen as a sign of deepening defense cooperation between Washington and Taipei. The move comes despite the Trump administration's often transactional approach to foreign policy, indicating a continued strategic alignment on defense matters concerning Taiwan.</p>

          <p>A memorial dedicated to the victims of communist rule in Germany is set to be built in a prominent location near the Chancellery in Berlin. The project, approved by the Bundestag in 2019, is finally expected to receive funding, allowing a design competition to launch. Victims' associations have described the memorial as "long overdue," emphasizing the need to honor the hundreds who died trying to flee East Germany and the thousands imprisoned for political reasons. The foundation overseeing the project hopes it will serve as a "learning hub" and a reminder of the differences between dictatorship and democracy.</p>
