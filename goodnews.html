          <p>Hamas and other Palestinian factions are reportedly leaning towards accepting a U.S. proposal to end the war in Gaza, with a formal response expected soon. The plan, presented by President Trump, includes a ceasefire, the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and the establishment of an interim administration overseen by an international board. The proposal has garnered support from the Palestinian Authority and a coalition of key Muslim-majority nations, who welcomed the effort to achieve peace and rebuild the war-torn region.</p>

          <h2>An Essay on Reconnecting with Judaism Amidst Rising Anti-Semitism</h2>

          <p>The author reflects on their journey from identifying as a "cultural Jew" with little knowledge of the faith's traditions to discovering a rich, intellectual, and spiritual heritage. Initially embarrassed by what they perceived as outdated laws, they came to understand Judaism as a tradition of debate, questioning, and profound wisdom. This personal exploration reveals how historical anti-Semitism and assimilation pressures shaped a diluted Jewish identity for many. The essay argues that reclaiming this deeper knowledge is essential for American Jews to build stronger communities and combat rising Jew-hatred.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that a deal for TikTok's U.S. operations has been finalized, creating a new entity controlled by American investors to address national security concerns. The new company, involving tech giant Oracle and allies of the president, will manage a retrained algorithm for U.S. users, with American data stored on Oracle servers. While Trump claims Chinese President Xi Jinping has approved the arrangement, Beijing's public statements have been more reserved. The deal aims to avert a full ban of the popular app in the U.S. by severing operational control from its Chinese parent, ByteDance.</p>

          <p>Qatar's prime minister has confirmed the nation will continue its mediation efforts to end the war in Gaza following a significant diplomatic development. In a call with U.S. President Donald Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed deep regret for an air strike in Doha that killed a Qatari security officer and violated the country's sovereignty. Netanyahu affirmed that such an attack would not happen again, a move that helped repair relations after the incident, which targeted Hamas leaders during negotiations. This reconciliation is seen as a crucial step to reviving peace talks.</p>

          <p>A Michigan woman is reluctant to sell her home and move in with her husband because she holds an exceptionally low 2.8% mortgage rate, a common dilemma known as the "lock-in" effect. Hosts of The Ramsey Show advised that while the rate is financially advantageous, it should not derail major life plans like unifying a household's finances. They recommended she calculate the potential cash flow if she were to rent the property versus the net proceeds from selling it. The hosts emphasized that simplifying their financial life and focusing on shared goals likely outweighs the benefit of holding onto the low-rate mortgage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Diplomatic Recognition of Palestinian Statehood Seen as a Challenge to Israeli Policy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent official recognition of a Palestinian state by countries like Britain, Canada, and Australia is more than just a symbolic gesture, the article argues. While it doesn't immediately change the situation on the ground, it directly challenges the long-term strategy of Israel's far-right settler movement, which aims to make a two-state solution impossible. International recognition asserts that a border can be drawn regardless of settler presence, setting the stage for future diplomatic clashes over Israeli policy and rejecting the idea that territorial compromise can be unilaterally foreclosed.</p>

          <p>In an essay, Princeton's president contends that the popular image of college students as fragile and intolerant of opposing views is a myth fueled by media incentives and isolated incidents. He argues that most students are eager for constructive debate, and that disruptions are rare and often caused by outside actors. The author criticizes free-speech rankings that mistake a lack of controversy for a healthy climate, asserting that real engagement should feel uncomfortable. He concludes that self-censorship is a broader American problem, and students are often more committed to civil discourse than the general public.</p>

          <p>Thrive Global CEO Arianna Huffington is challenging the "collective delusion" that burnout is a necessary price for success, drawing from her own experience of collapsing from exhaustion. She advocates for a cultural shift where taking time to recharge is seen as essential for effectiveness, creativity, and leadership. Huffington promotes "micro steps"—small, incremental daily changes—to build healthier habits rather than relying on drastic resolutions. She stresses that scientific data confirms people perform better when they prioritize their well-being, a message she believes is crucial for younger generations.</p>

Scotland currently has four points in their qualification group and will play both crucial matches at home in Glasgow.</p>
