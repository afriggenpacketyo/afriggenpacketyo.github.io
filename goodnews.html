          <h2>Denver Fire Station 3 Celebrates History of First Black Firefighters</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denver Fire Station 3, the city's oldest serving firehouse, is recognized for its significant role as the first station to house Black firefighters. Until the desegregation of the Denver Fire Department in 1957, it was the only station where Black firefighters were assigned. The article highlights the pride and commitment to excellence exhibited by these early public servants, who overcame racial hurdles to serve the Five Points community. The article also mentions Fire Chief Rod Juniel, who had to go to court to be admitted to the Denver Fire Department in the 1970s.</p>

          <p>Australians are heading to the polls to elect a new government amidst economic challenges like inflation and housing affordability, as well as complex international relations. Voters are primarily concerned with cost-of-living issues, though both major parties have only offered small-scale solutions. The article notes a shift away from major parties toward independent candidates, reflecting dissatisfaction with the current political landscape. The opposition leader has adopted some policies similar to President Trump's, including denouncing "wokeness", but this strategy has become less effective as the Trump presidency has unfolded.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie as unconstitutional, marking the first permanent block of such an order. Judge Beryl Howell deemed the order an attack on the independence of the legal profession and the judicial system. The order had imposed punitive measures on Perkins Coie, including suspending security clearances and barring access to government buildings. The judge criticized the order for penalizing the firm based on its representation of clients with positions adverse to Trump.</p>

          <p>The White House has clarified that President Trump's announcement to rename Veterans Day as "Victory Day for World War I" was intended as an additional proclamation, not a full replacement of the existing holiday. Trump also expressed his intention to designate May 8 as "Victory Day for World War II." Establishing a federal holiday or patriotic observance requires the passage of a law, according to the Congressional Research Service.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>There has been a significant increase in autism diagnoses, but this does not necessarily mean there are more autistic people overall. The definition of autism has broadened over time, including conditions like Asperger's syndrome. Additionally, there's increased recognition of autism in women and adults, who were previously underdiagnosed. While some worry about the glamorization of autism, others emphasize the importance of support for those who spent much of their lives undiagnosed. This article is an examination of the data and the reasons behind the increase in diagnoses.</p>

          <p>Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has made substantial gains in English local elections, positioning itself as a significant challenger to Britain's main political parties. The party secured control of several councils from the Conservatives and won a by-election, increasing scrutiny of its performance in office. Farage has ruled out formal coalitions but remains open to informal cooperation with other parties. The results have prompted responses from major party leaders, acknowledging voter frustration and the need for change.</p>
