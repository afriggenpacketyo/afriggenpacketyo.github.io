          <p>Qatari mediators, alongside officials from Washington and Cairo, are actively working to broker a new truce between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. A spokesperson for Qatar's foreign ministry stated that the recent ceasefire between Iran and Israel has created a "window of opportunity" and momentum for restarting negotiations. The diplomatic push aims to leverage this new dynamic, with hopes that pressure from the United States could be instrumental in achieving a breakthrough. The efforts reflect a renewed international focus on resolving the Gaza conflict after a previous two-month ceasefire collapsed in March.</p>

          <p>Social media influencer turned boxer Jake Paul defeated former middleweight world champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. in a cruiserweight bout in California. Paul controlled the fight, winning by a unanimous decision with scores of 99-91, 97-93, and 98-92. Chavez Jr. appeared passive throughout the contest, throwing few punches and drawing boos from the crowd and visible frustration from his father, boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez Sr., at ringside. The victory continues Paul's professional boxing career, though it raises further questions about the caliber of his opponents.</p>

          <p>The French state has led a significant investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, aiming to establish a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. This move, which makes the French state the largest shareholder, is part of a broader push for Europe's technological sovereignty in the space sector. However, experts are skeptical about Eutelsat's ability to challenge Starlink's dominance in the near future, citing the massive disparity in satellite constellation size, manufacturing capacity, and launch access. Eutelsat's OneWeb arm operates 650 satellites, compared to Starlink's more than 7,600. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's 50th and final H2A liquid-fuel rocket was successfully launched, marking the end of a 24-year era for the country's space program. Developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the H2A series has been a cornerstone of Japan's space development. The vehicle is now being succeeded by the more cost-effective H3 rocket, which will serve as the nation's new mainstay for space launches. This final mission represents a significant milestone, closing a long and successful chapter in Japan's history of space exploration and satellite deployment.</p>

          <p>The Israeli ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, has confirmed that he will attend the upcoming peace ceremony in Nagasaki, which commemorates the 1945 U.S. atomic bombing. This marks a notable change from the previous year, when Israel was not invited to the event. Ambassador Cohen stated that he received a direct invitation from the mayor of Nagasaki and will attend to show Israel's respect for the Japanese people and a shared understanding of the importance of peace. The decision reflects a diplomatic recalibration between Israel and the city of Nagasaki regarding the annual memorial.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated significant progress in his return from elbow surgery by pitching two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During the outing, his four-seam fastball reached 101.7 mph, the fastest pitch of his Major League Baseball career. Ohtani, who is in his third start of the season on the mound, allowed one single and a walk while striking out one batter. Despite his strong pitching performance, he went hitless in four at-bats, and the Dodgers' five-game winning streak came to an end with a 9-5 loss.</p>

          <p>Major cities across the United States, including New York and San Francisco, are holding large-scale parades to mark the culmination of LGBTQ+ Pride Month. While celebratory, this year's events are taking on a more defiant and protest-oriented tone in response to recent political efforts to roll back LGBTQ+ rights. Organizers have emphasized themes of resistance and rising up, particularly in light of policies targeting transgender individuals. The events also coincide with the tenth anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, a milestone now viewed against a backdrop of new challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced a new plan for major food retailers and manufacturers in England to voluntarily encourage healthier eating habits among customers. Under the partnership, businesses will decide on strategies such as offering promotions on healthy items, adjusting loyalty point systems, or reformulating products to be healthier. The initiative aims to tackle rising obesity rates, which see over one in five children leaving primary school with obesity. While the move is welcomed by health advocates, some express concern that its voluntary nature may limit its impact without wider, mandatory changes.</p>
