          <p>England's pursuit of a 374-run target to win the fifth Test and the series against India was dealt a late blow on day three when Zak Crawley was dismissed. The hosts ended the day at 50-1, still needing 324 runs for a historic victory at The Oval. Earlier, India posted a formidable second-innings total of 396, largely thanks to a brilliant century from Yashasvi Jaiswal and a surprise fifty from nightwatchman Akash Deep. England's bowlers toiled on an improving batting pitch, hampered by six dropped catches throughout the innings.</p>

The event prompted online commentary from players, with Indiana Fever's Sophie Cunningham calling for the behavior to stop. In a lighthearted exchange on social media, Chicago's Angel Reese jokingly blamed Las Vegas Aces player Sydney Colson for the recurring incidents. The playful banter highlights a bizarre trend that has emerged during recent games.</p>

She now sits just three shots behind the leader, Miyu Yamashita of Japan, heading into the final day. Yamashita's lead shrank after she carded a two-over 74, setting up a potentially dramatic conclusion with several players in close pursuit. Hull, who has had previous near-misses in major championships, expressed confidence in her ability to chase down the leader for a victory.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has partially restricted President Trump's attempt to suspend the U.S. asylum system, ruling that the administration cannot bypass laws protecting migrants from deportation to countries where they face persecution or torture. The D.C. Circuit Court panel's decision modifies a lower court's ruling, allowing the administration to continue denying access to the asylum system itself but affirming that migrants must be allowed to apply for other mandatory humanitarian protections. The ruling stems from a lawsuit challenging Trump's proclamation that closed the border to asylum seekers, a measure the administration credits for a historic drop in illegal crossings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel has largely upheld a lower court's restrictions on immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, affirming that federal agents cannot detain individuals based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The ruling denies a Trump administration request to suspend an order requiring agents to have reasonable suspicion before making a detention. The case centers on controversial sweeps in Southern California that led to protests and were described by advocates as unconstitutional racial profiling. The court's decision is a victory for immigrant rights groups who argued the raids instilled widespread fear in the community.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team secured a dominant 97-7 victory over Spain, running in 15 tries in a one-sided affair at Welford Road. However, the win was overshadowed by a red card for captain Marlie Packer, who was sent off for a dangerous clearout. Packer now faces a potential suspension that could impact her availability for the upcoming Rugby World Cup. Before the dismissal, England showcased its overwhelming strength against the 13th-ranked Spanish side, with Helena Rowland scoring a hat-trick in a match that served as a World Cup warm-up.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian anti-corruption bodies announced the discovery of a significant graft scheme involving the procurement of military drones and jamming systems at inflated prices. The investigation implicated a sitting lawmaker, officials, and national guard personnel in a kickback operation.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who reversed his policy after the backlash, praised the agencies for their work and reaffirmed a zero-tolerance stance on corruption.</p>

          <p>Organizations like Black People Will Swim are working to combat the historical and ongoing racial disparities in swimming ability and drowning rates among Black Americans. This effort addresses a legacy of segregation where Black communities were denied access to public pools, leading to a generational gap in swimming skills. Research shows Black children are significantly more likely to drown than their white peers, a public health crisis linked to lack of access and representation. By providing lessons and scholarships, these programs aim to create a ripple effect, empowering a new generation of swimmers, instructors, and lifeguards.</p>

          <p>Florida has quietly become a national leader in solar energy, adding more utility-scale solar capacity than California last year, driven primarily by major utilities like Florida Power & Light. The state's rapid growth is facilitated by rules that streamline the approval process for solar projects and the increasingly favorable economics of solar over natural gas. However, this boom faces challenges from the rollback of federal tax credits and growing constraints on the electrical grid. Communities like the solar-powered Babcock Ranch, which maintained power through Hurricane Ian, demonstrate the potential resilience of this energy source. (not investment advice)</p>

The Wallabies, who showed significant improvement throughout the series, were the better team on the night, ending the Lions' unbeaten tour record.

Analysis points to the immense physical impact of Australian players like Will Skelton and the Wallabies' significant improvement after being underprepared for the first Test. The series was ultimately decided by a controversial late call in the second match, leaving a feeling that while the Lions won, they did not consistently perform at their peak.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Frontiers in Psychology indicates that matching your workout routine to your personality type could lead to greater enjoyment and adherence. Researchers found that extroverts tend to prefer high-intensity group activities like HIIT, while conscientious individuals enjoy goal-oriented training such as preparing for a marathon. People with higher levels of anxiety may benefit more from private, one-on-one sessions, and introverts gravitate towards solo exercises like running or at-home yoga. The findings suggest that instead of forcing a particular regimen, individuals can find a more sustainable fitness path by exploring activities that align with their innate traits.</p>

The book, reviewed in The Atlantic, explores the blue-collar experience and the quiet heroism of showing up daily to connect communities. This consistency is a feat of logistics and dedication, from remote Appalachian routes to the most isolated village in America, which receives its mail via mule train. The article reflects on how services like the USPS help restore a sense of normalcy and connection in a country that can often feel fragmented.</p>
