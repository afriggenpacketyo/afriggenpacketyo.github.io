          <p>The Republican-led House passed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" by a single vote, delivering on President Trump's tax and immigration agenda after weeks of GOP infighting. Speaker Mike Johnson hailed the bill as a victory for Americans, while Trump celebrated its passage on social media. The legislation includes tax cuts, Medicaid reform, and immigration spending, fulfilling campaign promises such as "No Tax on Tips and No Tax on Overtime." The bill now moves to the Senate, where revisions are expected, and faced opposition from some Republicans and the entire Democratic caucus, highlighting the deep divisions within the House. </p>

          <p>CNBC provides an exclusive look at ASML's High NA, a $400 million chipmaking machine that is transforming microchip manufacturing. This machine, bigger than a double-decker bus, is the latest generation of ASML's Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) machines and is critical for producing advanced microchips. The first commercial installation of High NA was at Intel's Oregon chip fabrication plant in 2024, and only a few have been shipped to major chipmakers like TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. High NA improves chip performance, speed, and yield by projecting chip designs at a higher resolution. </p>

This shift is driven by concerns over Chinese actions in the South China Sea and doubts about US security guarantees.

          <p>OpenAI's acquisition of Jony Ive's devices startup io for $6.4 billion is reminiscent of a strategy employed by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The deal, which represents just over 2% of OpenAI's paper worth, is a significant bet on a secretive hardware company co-founded by Ive, known for designing Apple's iconic products. This move is compared to Facebook's acquisition of Instagram in 2012, as Altman's position in the industry is similar to Zuckerberg's during Facebook's IPO. The purchase represents a bold step for OpenAI in the hardware space. </p>
