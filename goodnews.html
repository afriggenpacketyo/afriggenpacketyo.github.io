        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK state pension is projected to increase by 4.7% next April, guided by the "triple lock" policy which ties the annual rise to the highest of inflation, average earnings, or 2.5%. This increase, based on the latest wage growth figures, would add over £500 annually to the new state pension. However, concerns are being raised that the rising pension payments are moving closer to the frozen personal tax allowance threshold. This could result in more pensioners becoming liable for income tax in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom is seen as a potentially welcome distraction for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is facing significant domestic political turmoil. Amid cabinet resignations, dropping approval ratings, and internal party dissent, Starmer is expected to leverage the pomp and ceremony of the visit to project stability and strength. The trip will focus on strengthening the "special relationship," with trade taking center stage during meetings at Chequers. Despite their political differences, Trump's apparent personal affinity for Starmer could provide the struggling British leader with much-needed positive headlines.</p>

          <p>In Monday Night Football action, Baker Mayfield orchestrated a last-minute, 80-yard touchdown drive to give the Tampa Bay Buccaneers a 20-19 comeback victory over the Houston Texans. Mayfield's heroics, including a crucial fourth-down scramble, secured the win with just six seconds remaining. In the later game, the Los Angeles Chargers' defense dominated the Las Vegas Raiders in a 20-9 win. Chargers linebacker Daiyan Henley, despite being ill, set the tone with an interception on the first play and the defense held the Raiders to just 218 total yards.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce the "Hillsborough Law," a landmark bill that will legally require public officials and bodies to be truthful and cooperative during investigations into major disasters. The legislation, long campaigned for by families of the 1989 Hillsborough tragedy victims, will create a "duty of candour" and could impose criminal sanctions for non-compliance. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the law aims to end the "culture of cover-ups" seen in scandals like Hillsborough, the Grenfell Tower fire, and the Post Office Horizon case. Campaigners have welcomed the news, hoping it will prevent future injustices.</p>

For the Dodgers, the loss hinders their chances of securing a first-round playoff bye, as they now trail the Phillies by 5.5 games for the National League's number two seed. Despite fighting back from deficits three times, the Dodgers' bullpen struggles continued, and the offense went 0-for-8 with runners in scoring position.</p>

          <p>Professional women's rugby teams are increasingly using technology and tailored nutrition to manage and track players' menstrual cycles, viewing it as a "fifth vital sign" of health. By using apps and daily wellness forms, teams can adapt training intensity and nutritional plans to mitigate symptoms like fatigue and cramps, optimizing performance throughout the cycle. This data-informed approach allows for personalized adjustments, such as modifying gym routines or providing nutritional supplements like a "cramp cocktail" of vitamins and minerals. The goal is to support athletes' health without letting the cycle dictate their ability to compete.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Parliament is set to vote on a major justice reform bill that includes the abolition of the unique "not proven" verdict in criminal trials. This would leave only "guilty" and "not guilty" as possible outcomes. Critics of the three-verdict system argue that "not proven" is confusing and can stigmatize acquitted individuals, while supporters claim it offers an additional safeguard for the accused. To balance the change, the bill also proposes raising the jury majority required for a guilty verdict from a simple majority to two-thirds, a move that has sparked debate among lawyers and prosecutors.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for intensified efforts to build a unified national market, identifying it as a crucial strategy for China to gain an advantage in global competition and achieve its development objectives. In an article for the Communist Party's theoretical journal, Xi outlined key tasks, with a primary focus on curbing excessive and cutthroat price competition among domestic firms. He urged industry associations to guide companies toward prioritizing product quality over simply offering the lowest price. This directive aligns with a previous government call to crack down on harmful price wars. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are planning for Shohei Ohtani to be a starting pitcher in the playoffs, but the team has not ruled out using him as a reliever in certain high-leverage situations. Andrew Friedman, the team's president of baseball operations, acknowledged that unforeseen circumstances in October could lead to Ohtani being used out of the bullpen between his starts. This strategy would be complicated by MLB's two-way player rule, which would force the Dodgers to lose Ohtani as a designated hitter if he enters a game as a reliever. The team is currently weighing the complex pros and cons of how to best utilize his unique two-way abilities.</p>
