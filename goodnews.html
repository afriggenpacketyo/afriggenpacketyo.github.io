          <p>President Trump has agreed to postpone the implementation of 50% tariffs on goods from the European Union until July 9, following a phone call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Von der Leyen requested the extension to allow more time for negotiations to reach a favorable trade deal, emphasizing the close trade relationship between the EU and the US. Trump confirmed the extension on Truth Social, stating it was his "privilege" to grant the request, signaling a temporary easing of trade tensions. The EU and US will now resume discussions with the aim of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement within the new timeframe. The move provides some relief to markets concerned about renewed global economic disruption. Optimism is cautiously higher as the two sides engage in further talks. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to rule on the cases of two former City traders jailed for rigging interest rates, amid concerns that they may have been scapegoated. Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo were among 37 traders prosecuted for manipulating the Libor and Euribor benchmarks. Evidence has emerged that central bankers and government officials pressured banks to engage in similar conduct on a much larger scale, raising questions about fairness. The Serious Fraud Office maintains that the defendants were convicted of conspiracy to defraud, while supporters argue that their actions have been retrospectively criminalized. The Supreme Court's decision could potentially overturn all remaining convictions in the case.</p>

          <h2>New Parenting Style Prioritizes Emotional Safety for Highly Successful Kids</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 17:59:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting" prioritizes creating a secure environment where children feel safe expressing their emotions. This approach emphasizes emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing, encouraging parents to respond with empathy rather than judgment. Emotionally safe parents see misbehavior as a signal for support, set boundaries with empathy, and prevent shame by reconnecting after conflicts. The key is for parents to do their own inner work first, reflecting on their childhood experiences and emotional triggers to better understand their reactions and respond to their children with compassion.</p>
