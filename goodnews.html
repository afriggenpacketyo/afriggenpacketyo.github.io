The crew, consisting of two American astronauts, one Japanese, and one Russian, successfully completed their journey in a SpaceX Dragon capsule. During their 146 days in orbit, they conducted over 200 scientific experiments, including studies on plant growth and cellular behavior in microgravity. The mission also marked the replacement of the Crew-9 astronauts who had been previously stranded on the station.</p>

Citing negative experiences like ghosting and a decline in mental well-being, Rout designed events that use an algorithm to match attendees into small groups based on interests for activities like cricket or rugby. This initiative taps into a growing trend of people seeking real-life connections, as data shows a decline in users for major dating apps.

          <p>Actor Chris Hemsworth has described learning he has a significantly higher genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's disease as a major "gear shift" in his life. A genetic test revealed he carries two copies of the APOE4 gene, increasing his likelihood of developing the disorder by eight to ten times. Hemsworth stated the discovery prompted a shift in his motivations, focusing more on purpose, contribution, and living a healthier lifestyle to maximize time with his family. For the second season of his show, he took a more active role, exploring personal interests like learning the drums.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is on the rise, as people spend on small, affordable luxuries and larger, memorable experiences to boost morale during uncertain economic times. This phenomenon, an evolution of the "lipstick effect," includes purchases from makeup and collectibles to expensive concert tickets, often funded by cutting back on daily essentials. Analysts note this behavior is driven by a re-evaluation of personal well-being and the unattainability of traditional milestones like homeownership for younger generations. Experts predict this trend will persist for several years as global economic uncertainty continues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fire that broke out in Spain's historic Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba has been successfully extinguished by firefighters, averting a potential catastrophe at the UNESCO World Heritage site. The blaze reportedly started in a chapel, possibly due to a short circuit in an electric sweeper. The rapid response from fire crews prevented significant damage to the monument, a celebrated jewel of Islamic architecture that was converted into a cathedral in the 13th century. Officials praised the firefighters' intervention, which prevented a tragedy similar to the 2019 Notre Dame fire in Paris.</p>

          <p>Walmart has agreed to a $5.6 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit alleging the retail giant overcharged customers in California for certain products. The lawsuit, brought by several county district attorneys, claimed that Walmart sold items, particularly weighted goods like produce and baked items, for higher prices than advertised or for more than their actual weight. As part of the settlement, the company will pay $5.5 million in civil penalties and has agreed to implement measures to ensure accurate pricing. The case underscores the legal requirement for retailers to maintain accurate pricing.</p>

          <p>Actress Gina Carano and Disney have settled the wrongful termination lawsuit she filed after being fired from "The Mandalorian" in 2021 over her controversial social media posts. While settlement details remain private, a statement from Lucasfilm praised Carano's professionalism and expressed hope for future collaboration. The article argues the settlement was the right move, suggesting Disney's initial firing was an overreaction. The case, financed by Elon Musk, highlights the complex intersection of celebrity speech, social media outrage, and corporate decision-making.</p>

          <p>The Ford Transit, one of the world's most recognizable commercial vehicles, is celebrating its 60th anniversary.

          <p>An unexpected friendship has formed between U.S. Vice President JD Vance and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, despite their starkly different political ideologies. Vance is currently on a holiday trip in the UK, which began with a family stay at Lammy's official country residence. The two politicians, who come from different sides of the political spectrum, have reportedly bonded over shared experiences of difficult childhoods and their Christian faith. This personal relationship is seen by some analysts as a potentially important diplomatic channel, particularly given the personalized nature of foreign policy.</p>

          <p>A viral social media claim alleging that Donald Trump's plane flew to Jeffrey Epstein's private island 37 times has been found to be without evidence. The claim, originating from a Facebook user purporting to be a retired pilot, is discredited by several facts. Reporting indicates that Epstein's island, Little St. James, did not have an airstrip, with visitors arriving by helicopter or boat from a nearby island. Furthermore, the photo used by the claimant appears to be from a pilot costume sold online, and there is no public evidence to substantiate the claim.</p>
