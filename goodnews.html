          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 11:03:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Premier League clubs are dominating the summer transfer window with unprecedented spending, with Liverpool leading the outlay at £269m. Other major clubs like Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United, and Tottenham have also made significant investments, with several deals exceeding £50m. Despite the high figures, football finance experts note that when "football inflation" is considered, Liverpool's spending is not as historically lavish as it appears. The article details how top clubs maintain strong financial positions through various revenue streams and adherence to profit and sustainability rules, raising questions about the league's competitiveness as a few teams account for nearly two-thirds of total summer spending.

          <h2>Strategies to Maximize Social Security Benefits by Delaying Early Claims</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 10:39:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many Americans claim Social Security benefits early, often out of necessity, despite knowing that delaying can significantly increase monthly payments. This article outlines three key strategies to avoid early withdrawal: investing in immediate or deferred income annuities to bridge income gaps, utilizing a reverse mortgage loan for homeowners aged 62 and older with substantial home equity, and maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged retirement accounts like 401(k)s, IRAs, and HSAs in later working years. These methods aim to provide financial flexibility, allowing individuals to defer Social Security claims and secure larger lifetime benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>President Trump Expresses Confidence in Fed Chair Powell Lowering Interest Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 10:22:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump expressed confidence that the Federal Reserve would begin lowering interest rates, following a meeting with Chair Jerome Powell. Trump indicated a positive tone from the meeting, interpreting Powell's comments about the economy as a sign of impending rate cuts, despite the Fed's previous reluctance due to inflation concerns and economic strength. White House budget director Russell Vought reiterated calls for a Fed review and lower rates, though he denied it was a "pressure campaign." The interaction marks a shift from past rancor, yet market expectations for immediate rate cuts remain low, with September being the earliest anticipated move. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fountains, with a history spanning nearly five millennia, have evolved from practical water sources in ancient civilizations to elaborate symbols of power and beauty. From Minoan purification rituals and Islamic garden paradises to Baroque spectacles like Rome's Trevi Fountain, they have served diverse cultural roles. In modern times, iconic performing fountains like the Bellagio and Dubai Fountain captivate audiences. Facing climate change, cities are now adapting fountains for urban cooling, using fine sprays and mist to combat heatwaves. While not a standalone solution, their timeless appeal and adaptive utility suggest a renaissance in hotter futures.</p>

          <p>Depression in older adults often faces stigma and misdiagnosis, with symptoms sometimes attributed to normal aging rather than mental health issues. While symptoms largely mirror those in younger populations, older adults may present with more somatic complaints, leading to delayed recognition and more chronic manifestations. Social factors like changes in status, identity, and loss can also trigger or worsen depression. Experts highlight challenges in treatment, including medication interactions, and note that research often excludes older adults with co-existing conditions. Emphasizing the importance of professional help, the article advocates for early diagnosis to improve treatment outcomes.</p>
