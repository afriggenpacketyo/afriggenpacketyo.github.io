        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wisconsin's Supreme Court, backed by its liberal majority, has struck down the state's 176-year-old abortion ban in a 4-3 ruling. The court determined the ban was superseded by a more recent state law that permits abortions until fetal viability. This 1849 law, which criminalized intentionally destroying an unborn child's life, had been dormant since Roe v. Wade in 1973 and conservatives argued its activation after Roe's overturn in 2022. The decision, stemming from a lawsuit by the Democratic attorney general, significantly enhances certainty for abortion providers and patients, solidifying abortion access in Wisconsin.</p>

          <p>The Princess of Wales, Catherine, has openly discussed the life-changing difficulties of recovering after chemotherapy, emphasizing that the period following active treatment can be "really difficult." During a hospital visit in Essex, she explained that while one maintains a "brave face" during treatment, the post-treatment phase often leaves individuals unable to function normally at home. Catherine highlighted that this recovery process is a "rollercoaster" and a "life-changing experience" for both patients and their families, often going unrecognized. She also participated in planting "Catherine's rose" at the hospital, recognizing nature's healing power.</p>

          <p>The FBI has announced its new headquarters will be the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington D.C., ending nearly two decades of failed relocation attempts. This move, championed by FBI Director Kash Patel, aims to provide a safer and more cost-effective workspace, replacing the structurally problematic J. Edgar Hoover building. The decision reverses a previous Biden administration plan to move the headquarters to Maryland, which had drawn criticism from Maryland Democrats. The Trump administration's choice also aligns with a broader goal to redeploy some FBI personnel outside the D.C. area, impacting about 10% of the Washington workforce.</p>

          <p>A Yole Group report projects that mainland China will significantly expand its semiconductor foundry capacity, ultimately surpassing Taiwan by 2030. The mainland's share of global foundry capacity is expected to reach 30% by the end of the decade, a notable increase from 21% in 2024. This development highlights Beijing's substantial progress in its pursuit of chip self-sufficiency, particularly in the face of ongoing U.S. tech restrictions. While Taiwan currently leads the market, mainland China has already outpaced South Korea, signaling a significant shift in the global semiconductor landscape driven by increasing domestic fab contributions.

He called for enhanced policy support to accelerate the sector's growth, highlighting its substantial contribution to the national GDP. China's marine gross domestic product surpassed 10 trillion yuan for the first time in 2024, accounting for 7.8% of the national GDP. This milestone, following decades of investment, positions marine industries for a significant "pre-boom phase," reflecting a key component of the country's overall economic strategy.

          <p>China appears poised to attempt a landmark satellite refuelling and servicing test, an ambitious endeavor in geostationary orbit that the United States has yet to achieve. Optical tracking images show two Chinese satellites, Shijian-25 and another, nearly indistinguishable and in close proximity, suggesting a potential docking or refuelling operation. A previous close encounter in June may have been a rehearsal. The Shijian-25 mission, launched in January, was designed to test on-orbit refuelling and satellite life-extension technologies, aiming to reduce costs, improve sustainability, and address growing concerns over space debris in orbit.</p>

The long-term goal for creators like Jordi van den Bussche, who created Bloo, is full AI automation, though current AI still lacks human intuition for optimal content performance.

          <p>The European Commission has proposed a binding target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040, building on its existing 2030 goal. This ambitious plan aims to decarbonize the European economy by 2050 while offering a "more pragmatic and flexible way" for member states to achieve targets. Notably, the proposal allows carbon credits from non-EU countries to count for up to 3% of the reduction from 2036, a shift from previous domestic-only counting. This move seeks to balance climate action with economic competitiveness, addressing concerns from member states about the impact on heavy industry amidst global competition.</p>
