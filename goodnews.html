          <p>The Japanese government is planning to increase rice exports to offset a projected decline in domestic consumption, as outlined in the annual white paper on food and agriculture for fiscal year 2024. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has identified China, Singapore, the United States, Hong Kong, and Taiwan as key target markets. The government aims to increase rice exports nearly eightfold by 2030 and is seeking to lower production costs to compete with foreign-grown rice. This initiative reflects Japan's broader strategy to boost agricultural exports and adapt to demographic shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

The hawk, nicknamed "Bomber Harris," was responsible for attacks on approximately 50 people, resulting in injuries and disrupted postal deliveries. Falconer Wayne Housden captured and trained the hawk, and intends to keep the bird full-time. Housden believes the hawk was a captive-bred bird that had been lost by its owner, and is now providing it with a stable and caring environment.</p>

          <p>A new report from WWF highlights the vital role of the UK's saltmarshes as "sinks" that lock away climate-warming greenhouse gases in layers of mud. The charity is advocating for these muddy, tidal habitats to be included in the official UK inventory of carbon emissions and removals. Saltmarshes capture carbon in the soils, making them as important for climate mitigation as trees. The UK has lost about 85% of its saltmarshes since 1860, underscoring the need for restoration and protection efforts.</p>

The Trump administration accuses China of exploiting U.S. universities, while Japan's unemployment rate and job availability ratio remain unchanged in April.
