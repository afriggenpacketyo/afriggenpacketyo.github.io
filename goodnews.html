          <p>The White House announced that the "de minimis" tariff rate on low-value parcels from China will be reduced from 120% to 54% following an agreement with Beijing. This move comes after President Trump's earlier decision to eliminate the low-value parcel exemption, leading to tariffs of up to 145% on packages from China worth $800 or less. The end of the exemption had disrupted the business models of e-commerce companies like Shein and Temu, with Temu now relying on domestic sellers to fulfill U.S.-based orders.</p>
