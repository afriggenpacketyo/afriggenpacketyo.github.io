          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 16:56:38 EDT</div>

          <p>Researchers have discovered the severed bow of the USS New Orleans, a famed U.S. warship, on the seafloor of the Solomon Islands' Iron Bottom Sound. The bow was torn off by a Japanese torpedo during the 1942 Battle of Tassafaronga, an event that killed over 180 crew members. Despite the catastrophic damage, the crew's heroic efforts kept the ship afloat, allowing it to sail to Australia for repairs and eventually be fitted with a new bow. The discovery offers a poignant reminder of the crew's sacrifice and resilience during one of the U.S. Navy's most challenging nights in WWII.</p>

          <p>Mandonna Kashanian, an Iranian woman who has lived in the U.S. for 47 years without legal status, has been released from ICE detention following a sudden arrest at her New Orleans home. Her detention, which came just after U.S. airstrikes in Iran, sparked a significant community and political response, including a letter-writing campaign that drew the attention of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. Although she had previously been denied asylum and permanent residency, a judge had allowed her to remain in the country under supervision. Her release marks a positive turn in a case that highlighted fears amid a nationwide immigration crackdown.</p>

          <p>According to this review, director James Gunn's 'Superman' reboot presents a hero who, while earnest and good-hearted, comes across as obtuse and overwhelmed rather than simply naive. The film pivots away from cynicism with a pop-punk energy, but the main character, played by David Corenswet, can feel personality-deficient and dazed. While the plot is described as impatient but entertaining, the movie's tone is seen as recklessly shape-shifting. The critic notes that the script is more confident with its side characters and silly gags than with moments of sincere emotion.</p>

          <p>Disneyland has announced the annual temporary closure of its popular Haunted Mansion attraction, beginning August 11. This brief, expected downtime allows the park to transform the ride into its "Haunted Mansion Holiday" overlay, a popular seasonal makeover inspired by Tim Burton's "The Nightmare Before Christmas." The attraction is scheduled to reopen on August 22, just in time for the start of the Halloween season at the resort. Officials noted this is a standard procedure that guests anticipate each year.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: New 'Superman' Movie Succeeds by Surrounding Hero with Peers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 15:14:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This review argues that the new 'Superman' film is a brilliant and consciously sincere take on the character, successfully defining his uniqueness by placing him in a world already populated with other superheroes. Director James Gunn's approach moves away from grim origin stories to a lighthearted, whimsical tone reminiscent of Saturday-morning cartoons. The film cleverly incorporates modern skepticism about pure altruism into its narrative, as other characters constantly question Superman's motives. This makes his inherent goodness stand out in a world that struggles to accept it.</p>

          <p>The British Parliament has voted to pass the Football Governance Bill, a landmark piece of legislation that will establish an independent regulator to oversee the top five divisions of men's football in England. Reintroduced by the new Labour government, the bill is designed to protect clubs by ensuring their financial sustainability and to place the interests of fans at the heart of the game. The move was praised by football campaign groups as a historic step toward a fairer and more sustainable future for the sport.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis of where a $20,000 deposit can earn more interest: a certificate of deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account. Based on current rates, short-term CDs with terms of three to twelve months offer a slightly higher return than a typical high-yield savings account. However, for longer terms like 18 or 24 months, the high-yield savings account could potentially earn more, assuming its variable rate remains static. The choice ultimately depends on the saver's preference for a fixed return versus liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>
