          <p>A new telescope image from the International Gemini Observatory in Chile shows the growing tail of comet 3I/ATLAS, the third-known interstellar object to visit our solar system. The image indicates the comet has become more active as it approaches the sun, with its coma and tail appearing more extended than in previous photos. Scientists are studying the light spectrum from the comet to understand its composition and how it changes during its journey. The comet poses no threat to Earth and is expected to be visible through September.</p>

While Broadcom did not name the client, analysts at several firms widely believe it to be the AI startup OpenAI. This significant new partnership has boosted Broadcom's AI revenue forecast for the coming years, with shipments expected to begin in 2026. The news underscores the company's strong position in the AI hardware market, alongside other major players like Nvidia.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage saw its most significant one-day drop in over a year, falling to 6.29% following a weaker-than-expected August employment report. This decline brings rates to their lowest point since October of the previous year, offering potential relief to homebuyers facing high housing prices. The drop provided a boost to homebuilder stocks, though it remains uncertain if the lower rates will be enough to significantly reinvigorate mortgage demand. For a buyer of a median-priced home, the rate drop could translate to a monthly payment savings of nearly $170.</p>

          <p>In her new memoir, "Eternally Electric," singer Debbie Gibson reflects on her decades-long career, which began with a record-breaking hit at age 17. She credits her late mother, who acted as her manager, for being instrumental in her success by fostering her talent and fighting for her to have creative control in a male-dominated industry. Gibson discusses her process of writing a song every day as a teenager and how she later pivoted to independent recording to maintain her artistic integrity. She feels that her independent spirit is now allowing her to thrive more than ever in her career.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has withdrawn from Great Britain's team for the Billie Jean King Cup Finals to accept a wildcard entry into the Korea Open. The 22-year-old decided to prioritize playing on the WTA Tour to focus on the long-term development of her game and her new coaching partnership. This marks the second time Raducanu has missed the team competition this year, dealing a significant blow to Britain's chances of success in the tournament. The decision comes despite the event being moved to an earlier date specifically to attract more top players.</p>

          <p>As part of a heightened counter-drug initiative named Operation Pacific Viper, the U.S. Coast Guard has seized over 40,000 pounds of cocaine in the Eastern Pacific Ocean over the past month. The operations resulted in more than a dozen vessel interceptions and the apprehension of 36 suspected smugglers. The agency released images from the missions, including one of a burning vessel that was intercepted. This effort is part of a broader strategy to disrupt illicit drug trafficking from South America before it reaches U.S. shores.</p>

          <p>The massive $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot is creating a surge in business for Jackpocket, the lottery courier app owned by DraftKings. The company reported that 15 million tickets have been ordered through the platform during the current jackpot run, with daily sales increasing by 130%. This highlights the strategic value of DraftKings' 2024 acquisition of Jackpocket, which it uses to cross-sell customers to its sports betting and iGaming products. The company projects the app will generate hundreds of millions in incremental revenue by 2026.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A winner of the $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot, the second-largest in U.S. history, would face a substantial tax bill. The lump sum cash option is estimated at $826.4 million, which would be immediately reduced by a mandatory 24% federal tax withholding of about $198.3 million. However, because the winnings push the recipient into the highest federal income tax bracket of 37%, a much larger tax payment would ultimately be due. State taxes could further reduce the take-home amount, though some states do not tax lottery winnings.</p>

          <p>The city of Norwalk, California, has agreed to repeal a controversial local law that banned the development of homeless shelters and other services for the poor. The decision is part of a settlement to end a lawsuit filed by the state, which alleged the ban was discriminatory and violated fair housing laws. As part of the agreement, Norwalk will also dedicate $250,000 toward new affordable housing and accept increased state monitoring of its housing policies. City leaders had previously argued the ban was a tactic to get attention from state agencies.</p>

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching $1.8 billion, data analysis provides insight into the slim odds and varying outcomes for potential winners. The odds of winning the grand prize are approximately 1 in 292.2 million. A winner's take-home amount can differ significantly based on their state of residence due to varying state tax laws on lottery prizes. For example, winners in states with no income tax like Florida or Texas would receive a much larger payout than a winner in New York, which has the highest tax rate on winnings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial planners suggest that a good monthly retirement income is typically 75% to 85% of one's final pre-tax salary, though the national median is closer to $3,900 per month. Given economic uncertainties like inflation, experts advise creating multiple income streams to ensure financial security. Strategies include purchasing annuities for a guaranteed income, using a reverse mortgage to convert home equity into cash for homeowners over 62, and optimizing Social Security benefits by delaying claims until age 70. These approaches can help bridge the gap between savings and actual living expenses in retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

The album was created with many of the same producers as its predecessor and includes guest appearances from artists like Tems, Lil B, and Hurricane Chris. Thematically, the songs continue to explore his experiences with marriage, fatherhood, and religion, reflecting his current life stage.</p>

The network announced that it will now only broadcast interviews live or live-to-tape to ensure greater transparency. This change means the television audience will see the full, unedited conversation, a practice the network already followed by posting full transcripts and videos online. The initial interview with Noem drew criticism from the Department of Homeland Security, which accused the network of distorting the truth.</p>

          <p>With global stock markets at record highs but facing headwinds from a weakening labor market and tariff uncertainty, analysts suggest investors should consider defensive portfolio adjustments. A key concern is the heavy concentration of mega-cap tech stocks in major indexes like the S&P 500, creating significant risk if the market rotates. Investors are advised to review their exposure to avoid over-concentration in tech and large-cap growth funds. Shifting some capital toward value and defensive sectors that have underperformed in recent years could help insulate portfolios from potential downturns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is preparing an executive order that will establish a formal designation for countries that wrongfully detain U.S. citizens, allowing for punitive measures against them. The new policy, modeled on the state sponsors of terrorism list, would provide the State Department with tools to impose sanctions and potentially travel restrictions. The move is intended to deter nations from using detained Americans as political leverage and to secure the release of those currently held. The order is supported by families of former detainees, such as that of Robert Levinson.</p>
