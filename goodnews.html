          <p>The United Kingdom and India have signed a comprehensive free trade agreement projected to increase their bilateral trade by over $34 billion annually in the long run. The historic deal will eliminate or reduce tariffs on a wide array of products, including textiles, automobiles, and alcoholic beverages. Under the agreement, 99% of Indian goods exported to the U.K. will become tariff-free, while 92% of British exports to India will see duties lowered. Leaders from both nations have praised the pact as a significant step toward shared prosperity and strengthening economic ties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Tour de France Femmes continues to spotlight the significant disparities in professional cycling, particularly in prize money and salaries between male and female athletes. The winner of the men's Tour receives €500,000, while the women's champion earns only €50,000, a gap that top riders have called disappointing. However, the event's director, Marion Rousse, points to significant progress, noting the women's race has been extended and its prize money is higher than comparable men's stage races. Despite the financial gaps, the introduction of a minimum wage and growing media attention signal positive development for the sport.</p>

          <p>Swedish club Brommapojkarna is being recognized as a premier talent factory in European football, having produced high-profile players like Viktor Gyokeres, Dejan Kulusevski, and Lucas Bergvall. As Europe's largest club by number of youth teams, it operates a unique, integrated system where coaches work across different age groups, including the senior team, to foster development. This model focuses on nurturing local talent from the Stockholm area, creating a strong pipeline to professional careers. The club relies heavily on transfer income from selling these players to sustain its operations, given its small fan base.</p>

          <p>The WNBA is currently navigating a period of significant growth and heightened public scrutiny, largely fueled by the arrival of star players like Caitlin Clark. An analysis of the league addresses several key debates, including whether Clark is overrated, the league's dependence on her star power, and the quality of its officiating. While Clark's statistics show both strengths and weaknesses, the league's rising attendance and viewership are not solely attributed to her. The article suggests that while challenges like refereeing exist, the WNBA's fundamentals are strong, and its popularity is on a clear upward trajectory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom saw a 0.9% increase in June, rebounding from a drop in the previous month, according to the Office for National Statistics. The rise was largely attributed to a period of hot weather, which spurred consumer spending on fuel, supermarket drinks, and summer clothing. Fuel sales alone rose by 2.8% as more people traveled. Despite the monthly increase, the overall trend suggests a loss of momentum in retail spending, with only a 0.2% growth in the second quarter compared to the first, aligning with forecasts for lackluster economic growth.</p>

          <p>As England prepares to face Spain in the Euro 2025 final, analysis points to key tactical battles that could decide the outcome. Experts suggest England can exploit Spain's high defensive line, a weakness Germany exposed in the semi-final. To succeed, England's forwards will need to be well-connected and receive strong support to challenge Spain's aggressive defenders. A critical challenge for the Lionesses will be neutralizing Spain's talented midfield, particularly by cutting off the supply to pivot player Patri Guijarro. The match is expected to be a contest between Spain's possession-based style and England's strength in transition.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's visit to his golf resorts in Scotland is being viewed as a key opportunity for the U.K. government to finalize outstanding elements of its recent trade agreement with the United States. While a baseline deal is in place, several commitments remain unresolved, including the removal of a 25% U.S. tariff on British steel and aluminum. An informal meeting between Trump and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is scheduled to "refine" the pact. Analysts suggest a potential trade-off could involve the U.K. removing its digital services tax in exchange for the U.S. lowering its metal tariffs.</p>

          <p>With an August 1 deadline looming for a trade deal with the United States, India appears to be in a strong negotiating position and is not showing signs of concern. Analysts suggest that Washington has a strategic interest in securing a deal, viewing India as a crucial partner in the Indo-Pacific and a viable manufacturing alternative to China. India has successfully protected sensitive sectors like agriculture in other trade pacts, such as its recent agreement with the U.K. This multi-alignment strategy, combined with its role in the BRICS bloc, provides New Delhi with significant leverage in its talks with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former UFC middleweight champion Robert Whittaker is making his return to the octagon nine months after suffering a gruesome jaw injury during a fight. The injury, caused by a face crank submission, resulted in his bottom teeth caving in and required surgery to remove several teeth and install dental implants. Whittaker, who is now ranked fifth in the division, says the experience was painful but that his life is much better after the corrective surgery. He is set to face Dutch middleweight Reinier de Ridder in Abu Dhabi, stating that his motivation is now driven by setting an example for his children.</p>

          <p>The chief executive of England's Football Association, Mark Bullingham, has stated that there is no need to expand the powers of the video assistant referee (VAR) system. This position comes amid reports that football's law-making body, IFAB, might consider proposals to use VAR for decisions on corner kicks and second yellow cards. Bullingham argued that the current model already causes enough interruptions to the flow of the game. As the FA holds a key vote on IFAB, its opposition makes any significant expansion of VAR's scope less likely in the near future.</p>

This new system offers an alternative to the current prescription model, where patients obtain specific food items from a pharmacy. The Welsh government aims to "de-medicalise" the process, giving people more choice and flexibility to shop at supermarkets, local stores, or online.
