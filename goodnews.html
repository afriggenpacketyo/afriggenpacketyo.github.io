          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 05:55:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides an overview of what defines a state in international law and politics, a topic highlighted by the growing recognition of Palestine. It outlines the four criteria from the 1933 Montevideo Convention: a defined territory, a permanent population, a government, and the capacity to enter into international relations. However, the article emphasizes that political recognition, particularly from the UN Security Council's permanent members, often proves to be a more significant factor than these legal benchmarks. This political dynamic explains why some widely recognized entities like Palestine and Kosovo are not yet full UN members.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government of England and Wales is planning a major road safety overhaul that includes potentially requiring compulsory eye tests for drivers over 70 when they renew their licenses every three years. The proposed strategy also aims to lower the drink-driving limit to align with Scotland's stricter standard and to issue license points for not wearing a seatbelt. These changes follow a coroner's report that criticized the UK's current driver licensing system as the "laxest in Europe" after several fatal accidents involving drivers with poor eyesight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's tourism sector experienced a record-breaking first half of the year, with accommodation providers logging 223.3 million overnight stays. This new peak was fueled by a strong surge in domestic travel, as more Germans chose to vacation within the country. The increase in local tourism was significant enough to more than compensate for a decline in the number of overnight stays booked by foreign visitors during the same period. The report highlights a shift in travel patterns within the country.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service has stated that the large fire that spread across Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh was almost certainly caused by some form of human activity. While the exact cause is unknown and a deliberate act has not been ruled out, officials noted that natural wildfires are very rare in the country. The blaze on the popular hill, which was brought under control without any reported casualties, has drawn attention to the growing risk of wildfires fueled by climate change and human presence.</p>

          <p>Everton is reportedly making progress in talks with Manchester City to sign winger Jack Grealish on a season-long loan. The 29-year-old playmaker, who joined City for a British record £100m fee in 2021, has fallen out of favor with manager Pep Guardiola, making only seven league starts last season. A move to Everton would not offer European football but would provide Grealish a significant opportunity to rejuvenate his career and fight for a place back in the England national team.</p>

          <p>The remains of Dennis "Tink" Bell, a 25-year-old British man who died after falling into a crevasse in Antarctica in 1959, have been found 65 years later. A Polish research team discovered his bones and personal effects at the foot of a melting glacier on King George Island. Bell was working as a meteorologist for the organization that became the British Antarctic Survey. The remarkable discovery has brought long-awaited closure to his surviving siblings, who plan to finally lay him to rest.</p>

          <p>The Boston Public Library is collaborating with OpenAI and Harvard Law School on a project to digitize its vast collection of historical government documents using artificial intelligence. This initiative will make thousands of fragile and previously hard-to-access primary source materials, dating back to the 1800s, searchable and available to the public online. The partnership aims to enhance public access to knowledge while also providing high-quality, out-of-copyright data for training AI models, representing a new model for public-private collaboration in digital archiving.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article serves as a guide to understanding sunscreen labels to ensure proper skin protection. It explains that the Sun Protection Factor (SPF) number primarily indicates the level of protection against UVB rays, which cause sunburn. The star rating, conversely, measures protection against UVA rays, which are associated with skin aging. For optimal protection, consumers should look for a sunscreen with a high SPF (at least 30) and a high star rating, and remember to reapply it at least every two hours.</p>

          <p>Scientists have confirmed that a small, cherry tomato-sized fireball that crashed through the roof of a house in McDonough, Georgia, was a 4.56-billion-year-old meteorite. A planetary geologist from the University of Georgia determined the space rock is slightly older than Earth itself and originated from the breakup of a large asteroid about 470 million years ago. This makes it the 27th meteorite ever recovered in Georgia's history and one of only six whose fall was witnessed, providing a rare opportunity for scientific study.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's company, Tesla, has formally applied for a license to supply electricity to households and businesses in the United Kingdom. The application to the energy regulator Ofgem signals Tesla's intent to enter the UK energy market, potentially competing with established firms by leveraging its solar and battery storage products. This move to diversify its business comes as the company is experiencing a significant slump in its electric vehicle sales across Europe, including in the UK and Germany. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a surprise decision by Beijing to relax housing purchase restrictions in its suburbs, analysts now expect other major Chinese cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen to follow suit. The move by the central government is seen as a proactive stimulus measure to address the country's struggling property market. By easing buying curbs, authorities hope to strengthen market confidence, stabilize the sector, and address concerns that previous government support measures were coming too late to be effective.
