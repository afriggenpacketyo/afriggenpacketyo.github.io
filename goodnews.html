          <p>Fair Isaac CEO Will Lansing has defended his company's pricing for FICO credit scores against recent criticism from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Lansing argued that the $4.95 cost for a mortgage score is a minor part of overall closing costs and does not represent a barrier to homeownership. This statement comes after the FHFA allowed lenders to use the rival VantageScore model and its head characterized FICO as a monopoly. Lansing countered by highlighting FICO's dominant market share and asserting its models are more predictive and safer for the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve pausing interest rate cuts, savers holding maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) are facing a key strategic decision. The article suggests that the current high-rate environment presents a valuable opportunity to renew CDs, as rates are likely to remain elevated for the near future. It advises savers to actively shop around for the best available rates, potentially locking in a high-yield, long-term CD before any future rate cuts occur. Savers are warned against allowing their CDs to automatically roll over, as they could be placed into new accounts with much lower rates. (not investment advice)</p>

The company's Mac business also saw impressive growth of nearly 15%. However, Apple experienced sales declines in its iPad and wearables divisions but provided an optimistic outlook for the next quarter, anticipating continued revenue growth despite potential tariff costs.

          <p>A fugitive member of a prolific bank robbery crew, identified as Diego Ananias Arellano Diaz, has been arrested in Newport Beach, California. He was the last at-large member of a group accused of stealing over $4 million from banks and ATMs across the West Coast using sophisticated methods like signal jammers. After evading initial capture when 11 other members were indicted, Arellano Diaz was identified via facial recognition from a GoPro camera. He was ultimately apprehended after allegedly blowing up an ATM in San Ramon while out on bond for a separate charge.</p>

          <h2>High-Yield Savings vs. Money Market Accounts: A Comparison of Earnings on a $20,000 Deposit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 18:35:41 EDT</div>

          <p>This article compares the earning potential of high-yield savings accounts and money market accounts for a $20,000 deposit in the current interest rate environment. Using current average rates, it calculates that a high-yield savings account at 4.44% APY would earn slightly more over a year ($24 more) than a money market account at 4.32% APY. However, it concludes that since the difference in earnings is often negligible, the choice between the two should also depend on other features, such as the check-writing capabilities that are typically offered by money market accounts.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to construct a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom in the White House's East Wing. The project, with an estimated cost of around $200 million, will be funded by President Trump and other private donors, with construction scheduled to begin in September. The new State Ballroom will have a capacity for 650 seated guests, a significant increase from the East Room's capacity, and is intended to eliminate the need for temporary tents for large state functions. The announcement fulfills a long-stated desire of the president to add a grand ballroom to the executive mansion.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the removal of 1,350 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, leaving a contingent of 250 to protect federal property. The troops were part of a larger force deployed by the Trump administration two months ago to address protests against federal immigration raids. This deployment was met with strong opposition from California Governor Gavin Newsom and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, who filed a lawsuit against the administration. While the Pentagon maintains the troops were vital, reports indicated low morale and a lack of clear directives for the soldiers.</p>
