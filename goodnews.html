          <p>Leaders from the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), including India's Narendra Modi and Russia's Vladimir Putin, have arrived in China for a major summit. During a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Modi expressed a commitment to improving bilateral ties based on mutual respect, marking his first visit to China in seven years. The summit is seen by Beijing as an opportunity to strengthen regional cooperation and present an alternative to Western-led global forums, particularly amidst ongoing trade and security tensions with the United States. The gathering highlights deepening ties between Russia and China as Moscow faces international sanctions.</p>

          <p>Dr. Sohan Dasgupta, a Trump appointee who led the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), has resigned after a four-month tenure, declaring his "mission accomplished." He worked to reposition the U.S. foreign aid agency from a traditional development body into a strategic investment tool aimed at countering Chinese influence and prioritizing American economic and national security interests. Under his leadership, the MCC focused on projects in countries like Nepal and Kosovo to secure critical mineral supply chains and strengthen U.S. leverage. His departure aligns with the Trump administration's broader "America First" policy of reframing foreign engagement.</p>

          <p>Biologists are testing an innovative method to deter gray wolves from attacking livestock: drones equipped with loudspeakers that blast sounds like AC/DC's music and clips of actors Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver arguing. The USDA-led experiment, taking place near the California-Oregon border, aims to provide a non-lethal way to manage wolf populations, which have been recovering in the Western U.S. and leading to increased conflicts with ranchers. Preliminary results show that the novel sounds can successfully interrupt wolf hunts, though questions remain about whether the animals will eventually become accustomed to the tactic.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit is driven by a need to recalibrate economic ties as both nations face significant US tariffs. Washington's recent 50% tariffs on Indian goods, a response to Delhi's Russian oil purchases, are pushing India and China toward closer cooperation despite their long-standing border disputes and mutual mistrust. This meeting represents a potential turning point, signaling to the West that India has alternative strategic options and is willing to engage with Beijing to navigate shared economic pressures and reshape global trade dynamics.</p>

          <p>Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain, has announced ambitions to create a transaction system for virtual assets that could rival the traditional Swift network. He predicts that the transaction volume facilitated by Tron, which is expected to reach $8 trillion this year, will surpass that of Swift within the next five years. Sun highlighted Tron's ability to process transactions in seconds compared to Swift's multi-day settlement times. His confidence is rooted in Tron's growing dominance in the stablecoin market, which pegs cryptocurrencies to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans began their college football season with an overwhelming 73-13 victory against Missouri State, marking the team's highest point total since 1930. Quarterback Jayden Maiava was sharp, throwing for 295 yards and two touchdowns in the first half before being rested. The offense was explosive, never punting and recording three plays of over 60 yards, while the defense registered five sacks and a pick-six. While the win provided a confident start and allowed many players to get game time, the quality of the opponent, an FCS team, makes it difficult to gauge the team's true strength.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), is facing a significant political opportunity as public approval for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has fallen sharply. Recent polling shows the KMT's favorability rating has surpassed the DPP's, while public discontent with the ruling party has reached a new high. However, the KMT is currently grappling with internal uncertainty over who will succeed Chairman Eric Chu when he steps down in October. The leadership vacuum creates anxiety within the party as it seeks to capitalize on the shifting political landscape and voter dissatisfaction.</p>
