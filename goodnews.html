          <p>The Hubble Space Telescope has captured the most detailed image yet of 3I-Atlas, the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system. Traveling at 130,000 mph, the comet's icy core is estimated to be no more than 3.5 miles across. The new photographs provide astronomers with valuable data on its size and composition as it makes its closest approach to the sun. The object poses no threat to Earth and will remain observable with telescopes through September.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner, the agency's former head, Erica Groshen, has stated that politically manipulating official jobs data would be exceedingly difficult. She explained that the BLS uses a highly automated and transparent process designed to be impervious to interference. Any attempt to inject partisan bias would require a complete system overhaul and would likely be met with strong resistance, resignations, and whistleblowing from career civil servants.</p>

          <p>This commentary piece explores the cultural phenomenon of the name "Bobby" in American pop music during the early 1960s. The author nostalgically recalls a time when numerous hit songs and teen idols, from Bobby Vee to Bobby Vinton, shared the name. The article connects this trend to the popularity of the name Robert for baby boys in the preceding decades. It reflects on how this musical landscape shaped a generation's youth before the British Invasion changed pop culture forever.</p>

The plane has been repeatedly stolen from local airports, taken for joyrides, and then returned, sometimes to a different airport. The unknown pilot appears to be a trained aviator who has even performed maintenance, such as replacing the plane's battery. Police are baffled by the case, as there is no clear motive and no leads on the suspect's identity.</p>

          <p>In a podcast interview, geopolitical strategist George Friedman presents his realist perspective on global affairs, arguing that national interests and power dynamics, rather than ideology, are the primary drivers of foreign policy. He applies this framework to analyze Donald Trump's diplomatic model, suggesting there is a coherent, if unconventional, strategy behind his actions aimed at restructuring America's global role. Friedman concludes with an optimistic view that the U.S. is experiencing a predictable, cyclical crisis and will emerge stronger.</p>

While the project is seen as a critical step for long-term space exploration, some in the scientific community have raised concerns about the ambitious timeline and the estimated $3 billion cost.</p>
