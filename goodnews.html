          <p>Anthony Albanese has secured a second consecutive three-year term as Australia's prime minister, marking a historic win for the Labor Party, according to the article. Opposition leader Peter Dutton conceded defeat, acknowledging the cost-of-living crisis and energy policy as major campaign issues. Albanese emphasized improved relations with China and criticized the opposition's attempt to mimic U.S. President Trump's politics. The U.S. Secretary of State congratulated Albanese, underscoring the strong alliance between the two countries, while both campaigns focused on Australia's changing demographics and policies to assist first-home buyers amid international economic uncertainty generated by Trump's tariff policies.</p>

          <p>A factory in Mexico processing hazardous waste imported from the US will relocate its most polluting operations following a Guardian investigation, according to the article. Zinc Nacional, located in the Monterrey metropolitan area, recycles toxic steel dust and recovers zinc. Neighbors have protested the plant, citing concerns about pollution and health issues. The company has pledged to move its intensive operations outside the metropolitan area within two years and build an enclosure on its existing site.</p>

          <h2>Grizzly Bear Comeback in California</h2>

          <p>New research suggests that grizzly bears could return to California, where they were extinct by the mid-1920s, as reported in the article. The study identifies areas that could support a grizzly population and highlights the ecological benefits of reintroducing the species. While public support is mixed, proponents emphasize the symbolic impact and the opportunity to restore a keystone species. Any reintroduction effort would be slow and deliberate, starting with a small number of wild-born female bears in remote areas.</p>

          <h2>Financial Markets Act as Bulwark Against Populist Excesses</h2>

          <p>Financial markets are increasingly acting as a check on populist excesses, as noted in the article. The interconnectedness of world trade and the costs of disrupting supply chains have spooked investors, leading to rapid reactions against policies perceived as destructive. As private wealth has accumulated, few are willing to risk their wealth during political and economic upheaval. While sensible policies have reasserted themselves, those who consider themselves losers from the old system are left with a festering anger.</p>
