          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for intensified efforts to build a unified national market, framing it as a critical strategy for securing an advantage in global competition and achieving development targets. In an article published in the Communist Party's journal Qiushi, Xi outlined key tasks, prioritizing the reduction of excessive price competition among domestic firms. The directive encourages industry associations to guide companies toward competing on product quality rather than engaging in detrimental price wars, reinforcing a policy direction set earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>Despite extensive flooding and heavy rains damaging farmland across India, particularly in Punjab, analysts do not expect a significant long-term impact on the country's inflation. While food prices saw a minor increase in August, factors like sufficient cereal stocks and an upcoming cut in the goods and services tax are anticipated to keep overall inflation in check. This stable outlook provides the Reserve Bank of India with potential room for further monetary policy easing to support economic growth amid ongoing trade concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

Liberatore will serve as OpenAI's business finance officer, tasked with overseeing the company's substantial infrastructure and compute spending. His hiring follows a public falling out between OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Musk, who co-founded the organization in 2015. The move comes as OpenAI continues its rapid commercial expansion, recently securing a valuation of $500 billion from investors.</p>

          <p>A group of teenagers in Bradford, UK, participated in a five-day challenge to remove all technology from their bedrooms, leading to several positive outcomes. The experiment, part of a BBC project, resulted in participants reporting better sleep, increased family interaction, and the discovery of new hobbies like baking and reading. While the teens still used their devices in communal areas, the separation from technology in their personal spaces helped them break habits like late-night scrolling and gaming, demonstrating the potential benefits of setting digital boundaries for adolescent well-being.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The names of many of China's ballistic missiles, such as the 'Dongfeng' (East Wind) series, were directly inspired by the speeches and rhetoric of Mao Zedong. The name 'Dongfeng' originates from a 1957 speech in which Mao declared, "Either the east wind prevails over the west wind, or the west wind prevails over the east wind," symbolizing the ideological struggle between communism and capitalism. This practice of using politically and culturally significant names reflects a tradition of embedding national identity and historical context within the country's military arsenal.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are primarily planning to use Shohei Ohtani as a starting pitcher during the playoffs, but the team has not ruled out deploying him from the bullpen in specific high-stakes scenarios. Andrew Friedman, the team's president of baseball operations, confirmed that while Ohtani's main role will be as a starter, unforeseen circumstances in October could lead to his use as a reliever. This flexibility could be crucial for the team, though it presents logistical challenges due to MLB's two-way player rules, which would cause the Dodgers to lose their designated hitter if Ohtani enters as a reliever.</p>
