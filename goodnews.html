          <p>Clarksdale, Mississippi, the birthplace of blues music, is experiencing a resurgence in attention due to the success of Ryan Coogler's film "Sinners," which is set in the town. The film, which blends genres and explores themes relevant to Clarksdale's history, has resonated with residents who appreciate Coogler's respectful portrayal of their culture. After a local campaign, Coogler arranged for free screenings in Clarksdale, where residents had not been able to watch films locally since 2003. The film's success is anticipated to boost tourism and provide economic benefits to the town, while also celebrating its rich musical heritage.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to invest ¬£1.5 billion in at least six new munitions and explosives factories to bolster its defense capabilities. This initiative aims to support the production of up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons and create approximately 1,800 new jobs. The move is part of a strategic defense review prompted by the war in Ukraine, which highlighted deficiencies in Western weapons production. While the Conservatives welcomed the investment, they criticized the pace and scale of rearmament, with the government emphasizing that the UK's defense industry will become an "engine for economic growth."</p>

While shops can still sell rechargeable and refillable devices, the ban targets disposable vapes, which have been a key driver in the rise of youth vaping. Ministers predict the ban will significantly reduce youth vaping, but health experts say further regulation is needed. Retailers who breach the ban face fines, and similar bans have been implemented in Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>
