          <p>The United States and China have reached a preliminary agreement to temporarily ease tariffs imposed on each other's goods for 90 days, signaling a potential de-escalation in the trade war. As part of the agreement, the U.S. will reduce tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% from 145%, while China will lower its tariffs on American goods to 10% from 125%. This development has boosted stock markets globally, with futures in the U.S. soaring and Asian markets reacting positively, as investors express optimism that the deal could lead to further trade agreements and alleviate concerns about a potential recession. The temporary reductions aim to provide room for ongoing negotiations to address the economic and trade concerns of both sides.</p>

          <p>President Trump is preparing to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet from the royal family of Qatar, which will be retrofitted and used as Air Force One. The lavish gift is likely to raise questions from legal scholars and experts surrounding the legality of the move, as the jet is valued at approximately $400 million. This decision comes as the modernization of the existing Air Force One aircraft is over budget and facing delays, with completion not expected until 2027. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that any gift from a foreign government would be accepted in full compliance with applicable laws, emphasizing the administration's commitment to transparency.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the recent trade agreement with China represents a step in the U.S. reducing its reliance on Chinese products. While a complete break from China is unlikely, Bessent emphasized the importance of decoupling for strategic necessities, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in supply chains. The agreement involves a 90-day pause in reciprocal tariffs, though a 10% tariff and a 20% charge related to fentanyl will remain in place. Bessent expressed optimism regarding China's cooperation in stopping the flow of precursor drugs related to fentanyl, indicating that further talks will be held in the coming weeks to address these issues.</p>

The Trump administration appears more inclined to use A.I. chips to secure strategic partnerships, potentially influencing trade talks and negotiations in the region.

Cena is now the face of a Neutrogena campaign for sunscreen and aims to close the "gender gap" in SPF usage, noting that men are at a greater risk of melanoma than women.

          <p>When children encounter difficulties, penalizing them by taking away the activities they care about is counterproductive; instead, parents and educators should focus on cultivating their strengths, known as "islands of competence." These strengths provide a foundation for growth and can lead to higher engagement in school and lower stress levels. Encouraging children to lean into their skills can foster confidence and resilience, which can then be applied to other areas of their lives. Parents can help by identifying these strengths, naming them, building on them, and using them to address weaknesses, while also telling optimistic stories about their children.</p>

The U.S. and China negotiated a trade deal to lower tariffs, with both countries announcing on Monday the suspension of most levies implemented on each other's imports. Economists had worried that the U.S., and perhaps the globe, could be pushed into a recession if both countries kept in place high tariffs on one another. Odds of a rate cut from the Federal Reserve in the near-term are also dropping as there may be less of a reason for the central bank to intervene and boost the labor market if the U.S. avoids a recession.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid is reportedly seeking Xabi Alonso to replace their current manager in time for the Club World Cup. Conversations with Real Madrid began months ago, informing Alonso he would be the replacement if Ancelotti did not continue next season, and by March a verbal agreement was in place. Real Madrid hopes to complete the signing of Liverpool full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold before the start of the Club World Cup, while Leverkusen had a gentlemen's agreement with Alonso by which he could leave if one of his former clubs came calling. BBC Sport reported last month that Ancelotti is set for further talks about taking over as Brazil coach before the 2026 World Cup qualifiers in June.</p>

          <p>Journalist Libby Copeland discusses how at-home DNA tests have transformed family connections, emphasizing the distinction between biological and non-biological family. Copeland advises starting with the person found through the test, often through a letter, to allow them control over the situation. The conversation addresses the complexities of integrating new family members while managing existing relationships, noting that it is possible to have room in your heart for both. The article explores the motivations behind seeking new family, such as the desire to see shared physical traits, and the importance of managing expectations and avoiding oversimplification of genetic influences.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to reduce import tariffs on each other's goods for 90 days, subsiding trade tensions. The U.S. will cut tariffs on Chinese goods from as high as 145% to 30%, while China will reduce its tariffs on U.S. imports from 125% to 10%. This agreement has triggered a rally in global financial markets, with Asian stock indices and U.S. futures surging. Investors are optimistic that the deal will encourage trade agreements with other U.S. partners, but some analysts caution that the tariff cuts are time-limited and the long-term resolution of the trade war remains uncertain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement to temporarily reduce tariffs imposed on each other while trying to defuse the trade war threatening the world‚Äôs two largest economies. Under the agreement, the United States would reduce the tariff on Chinese imports to 30 percent from its current 145 percent, while China would lower its import duty on American goods to 10 percent from 125 percent. The Treasury Secretary placed blame on the Biden administration for failing to honor its commitments to the trade deal that Mr. Trump reached with China during his first term. The agreement, for now, breaks an impasse that had brought much trade between China and the United States to a halt.</p>
