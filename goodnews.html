          <p>India is launching an ambitious mission to become a major player in the global semiconductor market, investing over $18 billion to build a complete domestic supply chain. The initiative aims to reduce import dependency and attract manufacturing shifting away from China, leveraging its large pool of engineering talent. However, experts caution that success requires overcoming significant hurdles, including fierce competition, infrastructure challenges, and the need for a long-term, dynamic ecosystem beyond just financial incentives.</p>

This move brings together the "America First" wing of the party, represented by Ramaswamy, and the more established faction associated with Husted, who was appointed by Governor Mike DeWine. The joint endorsements are seen as a strategic effort to present a strong, united Republican front ahead of the upcoming elections in the deep-red state.</p>

          <p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey is proposing that the UK offer discounted visas to American cancer scientists whose research has been affected by funding cuts under the Trump administration. In a speech, Davey will argue that Britain should step in to support biomedical research if the U.S. government pursues an "anti-science agenda." The proposal follows the U.S. government's decision to cut billions from research grants, a move that prompted concern among scientists and medical organizations about the future of life-saving breakthroughs.</p>

Cramer suggests that even in a strong market, investors can find undervalued opportunities by focusing on companies with solid fundamentals and exposure to growing themes like artificial intelligence and data centers.

          <p>A magnitude 4.3 earthquake struck near Berkeley early Monday, waking residents across the San Francisco Bay Area with strong shaking. The United States Geological Survey reported the quake just before 3 a.m., and while it was widely felt, there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries. The event prompted Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) to run trains at reduced speeds for safety inspections, serving as a reminder of the region's seismic activity and the need for preparedness.</p>

          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta has formally accused Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr of engaging in unlawful intimidation to suppress disfavored speech. In a letter, Bonta cited Carr's demand that Disney "take action" against Jimmy Kimmel as a threat to the First Amendment rights of entertainers and a violation of legal precedent against government coercion. Bonta called on Carr to stop his "campaign of censorship" and disavow any future use of the FCC to retaliate against speech the administration disagrees with.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Walt Disney Company announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air, nearly a week after the show was "pre-empted indefinitely." The suspension followed comments Kimmel made about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which drew pressure from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr and led major station owners like Nexstar and Sinclair to pull the program. Disney stated the suspension was to avoid "inflaming a tense situation," but the decision sparked a nationwide debate on free speech, with many celebrities and free-speech advocates criticizing the move as censorship.</p>

          <p>A new NHS initiative named "Jess's Rule" is urging general practitioners in England to "think again" if a patient's condition does not improve after three consultations. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, who died from cancer at age 27 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed over five months. The guidance encourages doctors to consider further tests, second opinions, or specialist referrals in such cases, aiming to improve patient safety and catch serious illnesses like cancer earlier, particularly in younger patients.</p>

          <p>As China begins drafting its 15th five-year plan for 2026-2030, the strategic document is seen as crucial for navigating global uncertainty and achieving ambitious long-term goals. The plan is expected to lay the groundwork for reaching the status of a "moderately" developed country by 2035, a key milestone toward becoming a "modern socialist country" by 2049. Experts suggest that amid rising domestic and international challenges, Beijing may need to prioritize flexible, qualitative goals over the rigid quantitative targets of the past to ensure sustainable development.</p>
