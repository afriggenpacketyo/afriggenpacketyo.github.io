          <p>G√ºnther Uecker, a prominent figure in postwar German art and a key member of the ZERO art movement, has died at the age of 95. Uecker was renowned for his nail reliefs, creating art by hammering thousands of nails into wooden boards and other objects, exploring the interplay of light and shadow. His work, deeply rooted in his experiences during World War II, addressed human rights violations and was exhibited in over 60 countries, making him the first Western artist to exhibit in Tehran since the 1979 revolution. Uecker's art is celebrated for its universal appeal, with many recognizing a humane character in his work that stirs emotions. The author reflects on the artist's career with a sense of celebration for the artist's prolific work, but the death of anyone is always tragic. The score is 55.</p>

          <p>Asian economies are increasingly reducing their reliance on the U.S. dollar due to geopolitical uncertainties, monetary shifts, and currency hedging, as ASEAN commits to boosting the use of local currencies in trade and investment. The shift is also prompted by the recognition that the dollar has been used as leverage in trade negotiations, leading countries to reevaluate their U.S. dollar portfolios. Asian economies like Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China, with large foreign asset holdings, are positioned to repatriate foreign earnings back to their home currencies.

          <p>Archaeologists at Colonial Williamsburg made a surprising discovery, unearthing the remains of four Civil War soldiers and three amputated legs near a Revolutionary War-era gunpowder magazine. The skeletons, dating back to 1862, belonged to Confederate soldiers who died during the Battle of Williamsburg and were found buried with their arms crossed in non-uniform clothing. Historians believe a makeshift hospital once operated nearby, and researchers are working to identify the soldiers, having narrowed down potential names from regiments in Alabama, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Virginia. The remains have been reinterred at a local burial ground with dignity, highlighting ongoing efforts to uncover new details about the Civil War. The score is 60.</p>

          <p>Police officers in Chester, New York, rescued a 68-year-old woman from a burning car after it flipped over on a highway. Officer Nicholas Contino, arriving first at the scene, broke the sunroof glass to free the woman, who was trapped inside the vehicle engulfed in flames. With the help of passing motorists and a paramedic, the woman was safely removed from the car and transported to Westchester Medical Center's Burn Unit. The woman suffered burns to about a third of her body but is currently in stable condition, and Officer Contino is commended for his life-saving efforts. The score is 85.</p>
