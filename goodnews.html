          <p>A wave of Gen Z-led anti-corruption protests has swept across Asia, from Nepal to Indonesia and the Philippines, fueled by widespread anger over social inequality and a perceived lack of opportunities. Young activists, effectively leveraging social media platforms like TikTok and AI tools, have mobilized thousands against perceived corruption, often targeting the "nepo kids" of establishment figures. These demonstrations have, at times, turned violent, resulting in deaths and property damage, and even led to the resignation of Nepal's prime minister. This article highlights the potent combination of youth activism and technology in challenging entrenched power structures, while also acknowledging the challenges in translating digital movements into fundamental social change.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball announced the implementation of an automated ball/strike (ABS) challenge system for the 2026 season, following extensive testing in the minor leagues. This hybrid approach will allow batters, pitchers, and catchers to challenge up to two ball or strike calls per game, retaining the challenge if the call is overturned. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred emphasized that this system preserves the umpire's integral role while enabling corrections in high-leverage situations and maintaining game rhythm. Player preference for the challenge format over a fully automated system was a key factor, aiming to enhance accuracy and fan engagement without eliminating the human element entirely.</p>

          <p>YouTube announced a significant policy revision, allowing previously banned accounts, including those removed for Covid-19 or election-related misinformation, to apply for reinstatement. This change effectively rolls back prior lifetime bans for such offenses, aligning with updated Community Guidelines that now permit a wider range of content. The move follows increasing Republican pressure on tech companies to reverse Biden-era speech policies, with YouTube acknowledging "unacceptable and wrong" pressure from the Biden administration regarding specific content removal. This article highlights a notable shift in content moderation, aiming to balance free expression with platform integrity through a new, limited pilot program for reinstatement.</p>

          <p>President Trump's substantial increase in H-1B visa fees has created a significant opportunity for Canada to attract skilled workers now deterred from the United States. Prime Minister Mark Carney noted Canada's AI talent often migrates south, suggesting the visa changes could help retain them. The new $100,000 fee for H-1B applications has surprised tech companies and is expected to limit opportunities for highly educated foreigners. This article explores Canada's potential to become a natural destination for these workers, though experts caution about the country's own immigration system challenges and generally lower wages compared to the US.

          <p>Nvidia plans a massive $100 billion investment in OpenAI, providing the ChatGPT maker with substantial capital to build extensive data centers powered by Nvidia's advanced chips. This strategic partnership aims to deploy 10 gigawatts of power for future AI infrastructure, with the first gigawatt data center scheduled to go online in the second half of 2026. Nvidia, a dominant supplier of GPUs crucial for AI, has been involved in several large deals, prompting some concerns about "circular financing" and potential overestimation of demand. However, analysts largely view this as a strong indicator of massive unmet demand in the "4th Industrial Revolution," predicting a significant multiplier impact on Nvidia's revenue.

          <p>Car buyers are currently rushing to capitalize on federal EV tax credits, offering up to $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used electric vehicles, before their expiration on September 30. These credits, initially introduced under the Inflation Reduction Act, are being phased out by President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." This impending deadline has spurred record EV sales in August, with new EV sales up 17.7% and used up 59% year-over-year. Dealerships are also offering additional incentives to clear inventory, though experts anticipate a challenging sales landscape post-expiration, potentially leading automakers to shift focus back to gas and hybrid models.
