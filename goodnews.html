Hiller humorously thanked HBO for featuring 'sweaty, middle-aged people' alongside 'sexy teens' on their network. His win celebrates the hard-won success of a performer with a niche audience, highlighting the industry's often arduous path to recognition and the value of authentic storytelling.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 23:00:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul has formally endorsed Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, praising his courage and optimism to address New York City's challenges. Despite past disagreements, Hochul stated Mamdani shares her commitment to safe neighborhoods, affordable living, and confronting former President Trump's agenda. This endorsement from a moderate governor is significant for Mamdani, a democratic socialist who has recently softened some previous positions, including apologizing for calling the NYPD "racist." The move aims to unify the Democratic party, though other prominent state Democrats have yet to endorse a candidate.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California lawmakers have passed the 'No Secret Police Act,' Senate Bill 627, which prohibits most local and federal law enforcement officers from covering their faces during operations, including immigration enforcement. The bill, now awaiting Governor Gavin Newsom's signature, aims to enhance transparency and public trust in law enforcement. Supporters argue it will prevent impersonation and hold officers accountable, while critics, including the California Statewide Law Enforcement Association, contend it undermines officer safety and ignores operational realities. The legislation includes exemptions for specialized units and protective gear, but it has sparked debate regarding officer anonymity versus public accountability.</p>

          <p>Australia has approved a single-dose vaccine to protect koalas from chlamydia, a leading cause of death and infertility among the marsupials. Researchers at the University of the Sunshine Coast spent over a decade developing the vaccine, which is hoped to significantly reduce the disease's rapid spread. Chlamydia can cause blindness, starvation, and bladder damage in koalas, often leading to euthanasia. The vaccine, based on the Chlamydia pecorum protein, has shown to reduce infection signs and decrease death by 64% in trials. This development offers a crucial tool in conservation efforts for the beloved but threatened species.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brain fog, characterized by difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and mental slowness, is a common experience often linked to stress or busy lifestyles. While not a medical condition, it signifies an overstretched or tired brain. Medical experts suggest four strategies to combat it: accepting it as temporary, scheduling deliberate short breaks between tasks, and avoiding over-scheduling commitments. These 'firebreaks' allow the mind to reset, process information, and reduce stress, ultimately improving focus and mental clarity. Recognizing these signs and taking proactive steps can help alleviate cognitive fogginess.</p>
