        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 48-year-old disabled mother is hesitant to move in with her adult child due to concerns about losing or having her Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits reduced. The confusion arises from the strict rules governing SSI, a needs-based program for individuals with limited income and assets, as opposed to Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), which is not income-tested. According to the Social Security Administration (SSA), living arrangements can directly impact SSI benefits, and if someone else provides free shelter or pays rent, the monthly SSI payment may be reduced by up to one-third of the federal benefit rate.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 08:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a decline in religious affiliation among young people, college chaplains are experiencing increased demand and reimagining their roles to better serve students. Chaplains now address issues like housing insecurity, safety threats, and campus protests, offering guidance on faith and spirituality. Many chaplains embrace alternative forms of self-care, and counseling sessions are approached with greater openness. As students navigate personal growth, chaplains provide a sense of belonging, meaning, and purpose, especially for those lacking exposure to traditional religious practices.</p>

          <p>Following his reinstatement to Major League Baseball, the debate over Pete Rose's eligibility for the Baseball Hall of Fame has been rekindled, with some arguing his on-field achievements outweigh his gambling transgressions. Rose, baseball's all-time Hit King, was banned from the sport for betting on games while managing the Cincinnati Reds. Despite his actions, some argue that the Hall of Fame should focus on his playing career and not his character, citing other controversial figures already enshrined. The Classic Baseball committee is scheduled to meet in December 2027 to determine Rose's fate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boeing's new 777X aircraft will not feature engine chevrons, the shark-toothed designs previously used to reduce jet engine noise. Instead, the 777X utilizes advanced engine designs, such as the General Electric GE9X, which incorporate new materials and nozzle designs to minimize noise without sacrificing thrust. This shift reflects progress in aviation technology, as Airbus never used chevrons. While chevrons reduce noise by creating more vortices, they also decrease engine thrust. The GE9X engine's compact exhaust stream and honeycomb architecture disrupt sound waves, resulting in a quieter and more fuel-efficient flight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the CDC indicates a dramatic decline in RSV hospitalizations among babies, linked to the widespread availability of a vaccine given during pregnancy and a monoclonal antibody treatment for infants. Compared to pre-pandemic seasons, RSV hospitalizations in babies under seven months have decreased by as much as 56%, with newborns experiencing a drop of up to 71%. The study suggests that these preventative measures are highly effective in protecting young infants from severe illness, even amid a more severe RSV season. Researchers anticipate even larger reductions in RSV hospitalizations with increased use of these products.</p>

The Zidanku Silk Manuscripts, dating back to the Warring States Period, are considered the oldest ancient classics ever found in China. Volumes II and III were transferred from the National Museum of Asian Art in the United States after diplomatic efforts. The manuscripts were illegally excavated in 1942 and removed from China in 1946.</p>
