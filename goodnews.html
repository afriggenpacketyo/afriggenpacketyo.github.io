          <p>Marco Rubio has been appointed to multiple high-profile positions within the Trump administration, including Secretary of State, acting administrator of U.S.A.I.D., acting archivist for the National Archives, and interim national security advisor. This unprecedented accumulation of titles raises concerns about his ability to effectively manage all responsibilities, especially with Trump's unconventional governing style. The appointment was unexpected, even to State Department officials. Rubio's multiple roles highlight the trust placed in him by Trump and his close relationship with Susie Wiles, Trump‚Äôs chief of staff, though practical issues such as salary and time management remain unclear. This article provides an overview of the situation and raises questions about the potential conflicts of interest and effectiveness of Rubio in these roles.</p>

          <p>The article explores the growing trend of couples choosing to be child-free, driven by factors such as high costs, climate change fears, and career priorities. Sociology professor Amy Blackstone notes that people are raised to believe parenthood is their destiny, but more couples are consciously deciding against it. The Trump administration had even considered a "baby bonus" to encourage higher birth rates. Couples cite valuing their relationship and not wanting to change it as key reasons for their decision. While mostly confident, some express occasional thoughts about the future and family holidays.</p>

          <p>Santa Cruz has implemented a soda tax of 2 cents per ounce on sweetened beverages, defying a statewide ban signed in 2018. The tax applies to nonalcoholic drinks with added sweeteners and 40 or more calories per 12 fluid ounces. Councilmember Shebreh Kalantari-Johnson framed the campaign as a battle against the American Beverage Association, resonating with voters. The tax excludes certain beverages like those for medical use, infant drinks, and 100% natural juices. The American Beverage Association decried the measure as a burden on working families amid high prices.</p>
