          <p>The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant surge on May 10 after President Donald Trump announced a "total reset" in relations with China. Bitcoin briefly neared $105,000, and Ethereum approached $2,600 following Trump's statement on Truth Social, though both retreated somewhat afterward. The high-level trade talks in Geneva, Switzerland, mark the first meeting between officials since tariff hikes in April. Trump's vague announcement spurred market optimism, though details remain scarce, and the impact on trade relations is uncertain.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece on Fox News calls on President Trump to protect Christian Afghan refugees who face potential persecution or death if deported back to Afghanistan under Taliban rule. The author acknowledges Trump's commitment to border security and deporting violent criminals, but argues that carefully vetted, lawfully admitted refugees, especially those facing religious persecution, should be allowed to remain in the U.S. The article highlights the moral responsibility to welcome refugees and the support among evangelical Christians for providing refuge to those fleeing persecution. It urges Trump to override decisions by staffers and ensure fair adjudication of asylum requests for Afghan Christians.</p>

          <p>Mathematicians from Fudan University Shanghai Centre for Mathematical Sciences and the University of California Los Angeles have solved the 65-year-old Kervaire invariant problem. The breakthrough was achieved using major computational methods that could be applied to other problems in the field. This discovery proves the existence of manifolds of Kervaire invariant one in dimension 126, resolving a long-standing mystery in mathematics. The Kervaire invariant is a function that measures whether a smooth framed manifold can be converted into a sphere through surgery.</p>

          <p>Elissa Strauss argues that motherhood should be viewed as a Hero's Journey, challenging the traditional narrative that prioritizes independence and external adventures. She contends that caring for another person can be an epic undertaking, filled with life-altering trials and triumphs that lead to profound insights. By reframing motherhood in this way, Strauss seeks to elevate the value of caregiving and challenge the simplistic binaries often applied to mothers. She also proposes that recognizing care as a Hero's Journey could encourage greater investment in long-term connections and provide more practical support for parents and caregivers.</p>
