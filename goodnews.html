          <h2>Brazil's Rare Earth Exports to China Surge Amid Global Trade Shifts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 17:47:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the first half of 2025, Brazil's rare earth exports to China tripled, highlighting a significant shift in global supply chains influenced by U.S.-China trade tensions. According to a report by the China-Brazil Business Council, this increase is seen as part of China's strategy to diversify its access to critical minerals. While Brazil's overall exports to China decreased, its imports from China rose, narrowing its trade surplus to its lowest point since 2019. Analysts suggest that as major economies erect trade barriers, emerging markets like Brazil are absorbing the impact and adjusting their trade relationships accordingly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Netflix Exceeds Second-Quarter Earnings Expectations with 16% Revenue Growth</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 17:27:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix reported strong financial results for the second quarter of 2025, surpassing analyst expectations with a 16% year-over-year revenue increase to $11.08 billion. The company's net income grew to $3.1 billion, driven by member growth, higher subscription prices, and increased advertising revenue. In response to these positive trends and a weaker U.S. dollar, Netflix raised its full-year revenue forecast. However, the company's stock saw a slight dip in after-hours trading due to a warning that operating margins would be lower in the second half of the year because of higher content and marketing costs.

          <p>The U.S. Congress has passed the Genius Act, the first major legislation to regulate stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. The bill, which passed with broad bipartisan support, establishes a clear legal framework and consumer protections for the $250 billion market. Proponents, including President Trump and financial technology companies like Circle, argue this will make the U.S. a leader in payment innovation by enabling faster, cheaper transactions. The legislation allows banks and credit unions to issue their own stablecoins, and major financial institutions like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase are already exploring their integration.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto's successful 2025 season, which earned him an All-Star selection, is being attributed to the confidence he gained during a high-pressure playoff performance last year. After an inconsistent rookie season, Yamamoto delivered a crucial, five-scoreless-inning performance in a decisive Game 5 against the San Diego Padres, a moment he calls the most nervous of his career. That experience, combined with a better understanding of the league and a stronger offseason preparation, has made him the most dependable pitcher in the Dodgers' rotation. He has become a team leader in wins, starts, and innings pitched this season.</p>

Organizers and partner civil rights groups have laid out demands that include protecting voting rights, ending the targeting of minority groups, and stopping cuts to social programs.

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has overturned the 2017 fraud conviction of former HSBC trader Mark Johnson, resulting in a full acquittal after a nine-year legal battle. Johnson was convicted and jailed for allegedly manipulating foreign exchange rates in a practice known as 'front-running' before a large client trade. His defense, supported by an industry association, successfully argued that his actions constituted 'pre-hedging,' a standard industry practice for managing a bank's risk, and were not illegal. The case was notable as it followed a congressional report criticizing the government for not prosecuting HSBC executives in other major scandals.</p>

          <h2>A Historical Look at Air Travel Reveals It Was Never Truly a Golden Age</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 16:28:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article challenges the popular nostalgia for a "golden age" of air travel, arguing that the experience has always been fraught with difficulties. While early aviation was a marvel, it was also dangerous and uncomfortable, with unpressurized cabins and deafening engines. The supposedly glamorous mid-century era was more expensive, more hazardous, and segregated. The piece suggests that as air travel became more accessible through deregulation, it inevitably became more crowded and mundane, a process accelerated by post-9/11 security measures and cost-cutting by airlines. Ultimately, the "million tiny indignities" of modern flying are part of the natural evolution of a miracle technology becoming an everyday utility.</p>

          <p>Uber is advancing its autonomous vehicle ambitions through a new six-year partnership with electric vehicle maker Lucid and self-driving startup Nuro. The deal involves deploying over 20,000 robotaxis, with Uber investing $300 million in Lucid, whose stock surged 36% on the news. Nuro will provide its Level 4 autonomous driving system for Lucid's vehicles, which will be purpose-built for the Uber platform. The companies plan to launch the driverless service in a major U.S. city next year, creating a new market for Lucid and scaling up Uber's autonomous ride-hailing offerings.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British government has announced plans to introduce legislation that would lower the voting age for all UK elections from 18 to 16. The proposal is part of a broader package of democratic reforms by the new Labour government, which campaigned on the issue. If passed, the change would enfranchise approximately 1.6 million teenagers. While advocates argue that 16-year-olds who can work and pay taxes should have a say in government, critics question their maturity and political knowledge. The article notes that while a few countries and some U.S. cities have a lower voting age, such a move at the national level in the U.S. seems unlikely.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives passed the GENIUS Act, the first major cryptocurrency legislation in U.S. history, after a dramatic floor rebellion by a dozen right-wing Republicans nearly derailed it. The holdouts initially sank a procedural vote, demanding changes and a meeting with President Trump before ultimately agreeing to allow the bill to advance. The legislation, which regulates stablecoins, passed with significant bipartisan support and now heads to the president's desk. The tense, nearly 10-hour standoff highlighted deep divisions within the GOP and required a last-minute deal to secure passage, capping off a tumultuous "crypto week" in Congress.

          <p>The White House announced that President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common and benign condition, after he experienced mild swelling in his legs. A memo from the president's physician, read by the press secretary, stated that a comprehensive exam including ultrasounds ruled out more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis. The condition occurs when leg veins struggle to return blood to the heart and is common in people over 70. The White House also attributed recent bruising on the president's hand to frequent handshaking combined with aspirin use, concluding that the 79-year-old president remains in "excellent" overall health.</p>

          <p>Mark Zuckerberg and other Meta executives have settled a multi-billion dollar lawsuit brought by shareholders concerning the company's handling of user privacy violations, including the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The shareholders had sought $8 billion in damages, alleging that executives' failures led to massive fines and legal costs for the company. The settlement was announced in a Delaware court just as the trial was beginning, preventing Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg from having to testify under oath. The exact financial terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but it resolves the long-running legal dispute that began in 2018.</p>
