        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron reported a significant drop in its second-quarter profits, with net income falling by about 44% to $2.49 billion. The decline is attributed to lower crude oil prices and a $215 million loss related to its recent acquisition of Hess Corporation. Despite the profit hit, the company's adjusted earnings per share and revenue surpassed Wall Street expectations. Chevron anticipates the Hess deal will boost earnings starting in the fourth quarter and aims for $1 billion in cost reductions by the end of 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Vanguard Research Suggests Emergency Savings Protect Retirement Accounts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 06:15:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to new research from Vanguard, having an emergency fund acts as a "security blanket" that helps protect long-term retirement savings. The study found that 401(k) investors with at least $2,000 in emergency savings are significantly less likely to take loans or hardship withdrawals from their retirement plans. This is particularly crucial for hourly workers, who face more income volatility and are more prone to tapping into their 401(k)s early. Financial experts advise automating small, regular contributions to a liquid, high-yield savings account to build this buffer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a move to increase representation, the UK government has announced that its main civil service internship program will now be exclusively for university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The policy, driven by Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden, aims to make the civil service better reflect the country it serves. Successful interns will be fast-tracked for the Fast Stream graduate program. The change has drawn criticism from the Conservative opposition, who labeled it "leftist social engineering," but has been welcomed by civil service unions and social mobility advocates.</p>

          <p>In an innovative anti-poaching effort, scientists in South Africa have begun injecting a harmless radioactive substance into rhino horns. The initiative, known as the Rhisotope Project, aims to make smuggled horns easily detectable by customs officers using nuclear security systems at borders worldwide. After six years of research, tests have confirmed the process is safe for the rhinos but effective in tracking the horns, even inside large shipping containers. The project seeks to protect South Africa's large rhino population, which is heavily targeted by poachers for the illegal horn trade.</p>

          <h2>California Advances Hydrogen Energy Projects Despite Shifting Federal Policies</h2>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's rollback of federal support for renewable energy, Southern California is pursuing clean hydrogen projects as a key part of its climate strategy. A new facility in Vernon, developed by Avina, aims to become the country's largest clean hydrogen production and dispensing site for heavy-duty trucks. While federal tax incentives are slated to end, project developers are relying on state-level grants and regulations to drive progress. Proponents see green hydrogen as a vital, low-emission fuel source for decarbonizing hard-to-electrify sectors like freight transport.</p>

          <h2>Review Explores Ella Berman's Novel "L.A. Women" and its Depiction of Friendship and Rivalry</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of Ella Berman's new novel, "L.A. Women," praises its exploration of a complex female friendship set against the backdrop of 1960s and '70s Laurel Canyon. The story follows two writers, Lane and Gala, whose intertwined lives are a mix of support and rivalry, reflecting the cultural shifts of the era. The narrative centers on Gala's mysterious disappearance, which forces Lane to confront their tangled history and the exploitative nature of writing about real people. The reviewer notes the book's strength lies in its sensitive portrayal of how envy and ambition can warp personal relationships.</p>

          <h2>An Explainer on the Nature and Prevalence of Parasocial Relationships</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explains the concept of parasocial relationships, the one-sided connections people form with public figures like celebrities, influencers, and podcasters. These relationships, while not reciprocal, can feel intensely personal due to the illusion of intimacy created by mass media and social media. The piece traces the history of this phenomenon from 19th-century "Lisztomania" to modern-day stan culture, noting how it can become toxic when fans overstep boundaries. It concludes that while these relationships are here to stay, it is important for fans to remain mindful of the distinction between a public persona and a real person.</p>

          <h2>New Tax Law Introduces up to $2,000 Charitable Deduction for Non-Itemizers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 05:45:01 EDT</div>

          <p>A new tax provision signed into law by President Trump will allow filers who do not itemize to claim a charitable deduction starting in 2026. This new tax break is worth up to $1,000 for single filers and $2,000 for married couples filing jointly, but it only applies to cash donations. Previously, only the 10% of filers who itemize could deduct charitable gifts. Financial experts suggest that taxpayers planning smaller year-end donations in 2025 might consider delaying them until January 2026 to take advantage of the new benefit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Praises Donald Trump's Unconventional Focus on Aesthetics and Architectural Beauty</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A columnist argues that while much of what Donald Trump says can be dismissed, his focus on aesthetics is a refreshing quality in a political leader. The article highlights Trump's executive order promoting classical architecture for federal buildings and his vocal criticism of wind turbines for spoiling scenic landscapes in Scotland and the U.S. The author contrasts this with other politicians who seem to disregard beauty as a policy consideration. The piece suggests that having a leader unashamed to debate style and call out ugliness is a welcome, if unusual, trait.</p>
