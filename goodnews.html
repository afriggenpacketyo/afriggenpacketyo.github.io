          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 09:05:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Gallup survey reveals that 62% of U.S. adults aspire to be their own boss, yet only a fraction pursue entrepreneurship due to common barriers like finances, fear of failure, and lack of business knowledge. Experts advise against waiting for 'perfect' savings, suggesting a 2-6 month expense goal and testing ideas as a side hustle. For those concerned about startup costs, service-based businesses like consulting can leverage existing skills with lower overhead. Building a solid business structure, understanding your target market, and seeking mentorship are crucial steps to overcome knowledge gaps and foster resilience against the inevitable setbacks in the entrepreneurial journey.</p>

          <p>Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek has reportedly conducted internal evaluations to assess the 'frontier risks' of its AI models, according to an informed source. This development aligns with Beijing's efforts to raise awareness of potential threats to public safety and social stability within China's rapidly growing AI industry. Unlike their U.S. counterparts such as Anthropic and OpenAI, Chinese AI companies have not typically publicized the findings of such risk assessments. Details regarding the timing or specific models involved in DeepSeek's evaluations remain undisclosed, as the company has not yet responded to requests for comment on this exclusive report.</p>

          <p>Despite an industry-wide oversupply of flights that has led to fare cuts and scaled-back growth plans for many airlines, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby expresses confidence in his company's aggressive expansion. United's domestic U.S. capacity is projected to grow by 5.7% in 2025, significantly outpacing rivals like Delta and American Airlines. Kirby attributes this success to United's strong product, network, and technology, asserting that the airline's brand loyalty makes it resilient in downturns and poised for upside during economic recovery. He believes that customers are actively choosing United, distinguishing it from airlines that treat air travel as a mere commodity.</p>

          <h2>Europe Prepares for Winter with Robust Gas Reserves Despite Geopolitical Uncertainties</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As autumn approaches, Europe's gas reserves stand at over 80%, providing a solid buffer for the upcoming winter, though slightly lower than previous years. The continent has diversified its energy supplies away from Russia, relying more on liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Norway, the U.S., and Qatar, alongside increased renewable energy adoption. Despite this internal resilience and stable global supply conditions, new uncertainties arise from U.S. President Donald Trump's pressure on Brussels to impose tariffs on buyers of Russian energy. While the expiration of the Ukraine-Russia gas transit deal had a muted impact, Trump's tariff threats could still introduce volatility, potentially leading to temporary price spikes or localized shortages. Europe aims for full energy independence from Russia by 2027.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated his confidence that a trade deal with China is nearing completion, anticipating further talks before reciprocal tariffs take effect in November. Bessent noted that discussions have become increasingly productive, suggesting China now perceives a trade deal as achievable. This comes after President Trump's initial tariff announcements and subsequent suspensions, with the latest pause on reciprocal tariffs extended to November 10. The U.S. trade deficit with China is projected to narrow significantly, aiming for fair trade. Bessent highlighted concerns from U.S. trading partners about Chinese goods flooding their markets, underscoring the broader economic implications of these negotiations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have unearthed what could be the world's oldest known mummies in Southeast Asia, dating back up to 12,000 years. The discovery challenges previous timelines for human mummification, which were largely attributed to the Chinchorro people 7,000 years ago. Researchers found human remains in crouched positions with cuts and burn marks across various sites in China and Vietnam, suggesting the bodies were smoke-dried over fires by ancient hunter-gatherer communities. This practice likely allowed people to maintain spiritual connections with ancestors, reflecting a deeply human desire for loved ones to remain present. The findings contribute significantly to the study of prehistoric funerary practices and highlight the ancient, widespread nature of mummification.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed that President Donald Trump's readiness to let TikTok go dark in the U.S. was the pivotal factor in reaching a deal framework with China. Trump's clear stance that national security would not be compromised for a deal ultimately turned the tide in negotiations. While the commercial terms between ByteDance and new investors were largely settled months ago, China paused the deal after Trump's tariff announcements in April. The September 17 deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok's U.S. operations looms, with a formal extension pending, as Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to finalize the agreement soon.</p>

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasized the law's importance in ending "the culture of cover-ups," drawing lessons from tragedies like the Grenfell Tower fire and the Post Office Horizon scandal. The bill aims to fundamentally change the balance of power, ensuring the state is accountable to its citizens and preventing future injustices.</p>

          <p>Amid a cooling job market and slowed hiring, workers are increasingly "hugging" or clinging to their current positions, with the "quits" rate at its lowest sustained level since 2016. While some of this behavior is out of necessity, career experts warn against complacency, as it can put jobs at risk. Employers are also holding onto staff, partly due to past difficulties in finding workers and current economic uncertainties. To stand out, workers are advised to actively seek growth opportunities, take on more responsibility, and build professional networks. This strategic approach, dubbed "pivoting in place," can prepare individuals for future opportunities when the job market eventually thaws.</p>

          <p>China's largest coffee chain, Luckin Coffee, is expanding into the U.S. market, opening five locations in New York City to challenge Starbucks on its home turf. Luckin's model relies on mobile app orders and aggressive discounting, often offering 30-50% off, aiming to build brand awareness despite initial stores operating at a loss. This strategy contrasts with Starbucks' focus on profitability per store. Luckin's history includes an accounting fraud scandal in 2020, leading to delisting and bankruptcy, but it has since re-emerged with new leadership and rapidly scaled its operations, surpassing Starbucks in China with over 26,000 locations globally.</p>

Early analysis from the REDEFINE 1 trial showed that a once-weekly Cagrilintide monotherapy injection helped patients achieve an average weight reduction of 11.8% over 68 weeks. The drug, a long-acting amylin analogue, mimics a hormone to increase satiety and demonstrated a "well-tolerated" profile with mostly mild to moderate gastrointestinal side effects. Investors are particularly interested in the improved side-effect profile compared to existing GLP-1s, as Novo Nordisk continues its search for effective and tolerable weight-loss solutions amidst increasing competition and supply constraints.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle maker Rivian has commenced construction on its $5 billion plant in Georgia, a crucial step for the money-losing company to achieve profitability and mass-market scale. This groundbreaking occurs despite President Donald Trump's successful push to roll back EV tax credits, which will eliminate up to $7,500 in savings for buyers. Rivian's CEO expresses confidence in selling EVs based on their superiority, not just incentives. The Georgia plant is essential for producing smaller, more affordable R2 and R3 models, aiming for 200,000 vehicles annually by 2028. However, the company faces slowing EV sales growth, intense competition, and concerns from some local residents regarding environmental impact.</p>
