          <h2>Intelligence Memo Contradicts Claims of Venezuelan Government Control Over Tren De Aragua Gang</h2>

          <p>A newly declassified U.S. intelligence memo reveals that the U.S. intelligence community does not believe Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro controls the Tren de Aragua (TDA) gang, contradicting claims made by President Trump. The memo, obtained by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, indicates that while some members of the Maduro regime may tolerate or work with TDA, there is no evidence of widespread, organized cooperation or direction of the gang's activities, including the movement of migrants to the United States. The memo also challenges claims about the gang's power and reach, describing TDA as decentralized and unlikely to coordinate large-scale human trafficking or migrant smuggling.</p>

          <p>DoorDash reported record first-quarter revenue, driven by strong demand for deliveries and grocery services, and announced plans to acquire Britain's Deliveroo for $3.9 billion and SevenRooms, a hospitality management software company, for $1.2 billion. Total orders increased 18% to 732 million, marking a quarterly record, and grocery delivery demand surpassed previous quarters. The acquisition of Deliveroo will expand DoorDash's operations to 40 countries, while the purchase of SevenRooms aims to enhance its offerings to merchants and improve in-store sales and customer relations. DoorDash's revenue rose 21% to $3.03 billion, although this fell short of Wall Street expectations, and net income was $193 million.</p>

          <p>Senator Thom Tillis, a key Republican, announced his opposition to President Trump's nomination of Ed Martin as U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, citing Martin's support for criminal defendants in the January 6th Capitol riot cases. Tillis's decision is likely to prevent Martin's nomination from advancing out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Republicans and Democrats are evenly split. Martin is currently serving as interim U.S. attorney for D.C., but his term is set to expire on May 20. The U.S. Attorney's Office in D.C. prosecuted the January 6th cases before Trump issued blanket pardons to defendants in the cases on his first day back in the White House in January.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly rejected President Trump's repeated suggestions that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state during an Oval Office meeting. Carney stated that Canada is "not for sale" and "won't be for sale, ever," countering Trump's romanticized view of merging the two countries. Despite the disagreement, Trump insisted that the rejection would not hinder trade negotiations and reiterated his stance by saying, 'never say never.' Their meeting, the first since Carney's Liberal Party won the federal election, addressed strained U.S.-Canada relations due to tariffs and border tensions.</p>

          <p>At Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting, Warren Buffett advised young people to prioritize the quality of their associations over starting salaries when choosing a career path. Buffett emphasized that the people one works with and admires are enormously important, as they shape habits and influence life's trajectory. He encouraged attendees to find jobs they enjoy and work for individuals they respect and can learn from, rather than focusing solely on lucrative trades or high-paying fields. Buffett noted that he preferred to work for himself, but if working for someone else, it should be with people who are wonderful to work with.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has ruled that the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang was unlawful, marking the second such ruling. Judge Hellerstein granted a preliminary injunction in the case of two plaintiffs who were pulled off planes to El Salvador and transferred back to New York from Texas. He stated that the administration's invocation of the AEA lacked justification and violated the Constitutional requirements of due process.
