          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology, the world's largest battery manufacturer, saw its shares jump over 11% in their Hong Kong trading debut. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), reportedly making it the largest global listing in 2025. CATL plans to use 90% of the raised funds to build a factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients including Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. The company has faced challenges including punitive tariffs from the U.S. and EU on Chinese EVs and was placed on a U.S. watchlist over suspected links to China's military, allegations it denies.</p>

          <p>China's central bank reduced its key lending rates by 10 basis points, marking the first reduction in seven months, as part of Beijing's efforts to stimulate economic growth. The 1-year loan prime rate was lowered to 3.0% from 3.1%, and the 5-year LPR to 3.5% from 3.6%. This decision followed moves by state-backed commercial lenders to reduce deposit rates, creating room for monetary easing. Economists anticipate further policy easing, with forecasts of additional lending rate reductions by year-end, supported by a stable yuan and easing trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent EU deal underscores the UK's complex relationship with its European neighbors post-Brexit. While the government touts improved trading ties, some critics argue that the agreement involves accepting 'dynamic alignment' with EU rules, sacrificing some sovereignty for easier trade. The BBC article emphasizes that ongoing negotiations will determine the deal's costs, defense cooperation, youth travel, and professional qualification recognition. The deal is viewed as a 'reset' by the government, but the UK's relationship with the EU remains uneasy, with future trajectories potentially varying under different leadership.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration on Monday allowed construction to restart on a huge wind farm off the coast of Long Island, a month after federal officials had issued a highly unusual stop-work order that had pushed the $5 billion project to the brink of collapse.\nIn a statement, Gov. Kathy Hochul, Democrat of New York, said she had spent weeks pressing President Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to lift the government‚Äôs hold on the wind farm.\nThe project, known as Empire Wind, is being built by the Norwegian energy giant Equinor and when finished is expected to deliver enough electricity to power 500,000 New York homes.</p>
