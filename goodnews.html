          <p>A new exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, titled "Wohnkomplex," examines the cultural and social legacy of the Plattenbau, the prefabricated concrete housing blocks common in the former East Germany. Initially promoted as a socialist utopia to solve post-war housing shortages, these buildings later became symbols of dystopia and social transformation following German reunification, associated with unemployment and rising extremism. The exhibition uses art to explore these multifaceted narratives, reflecting the collective memory of millions who lived in these complexes and prompting a re-evaluation of this divisive architectural heritage. It aims to foster understanding of a significant period in the country's history.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Chinese Encounters with America," profiles twelve Chinese individuals whose lives were shaped by their experiences in the United States, highlighting a past era of optimism in bilateral relations. Co-editors Deborah Davis and Terry Lautz argue that as the U.S. and China now find themselves in a period of intense competition, these stories serve as a reminder of the shared interests and benefits that once arose from cooperation. The book explores how figures from science, diplomacy, and the arts adapted their American experiences to contribute to China's modernization, underscoring a period of mutual understanding that has since faded away.</p>

          <p>China has released a new documentary, "Shenzhou 13," which offers the public an unprecedented look at life aboard the Tiangong space station, filmed entirely by the astronaut crew in ultra-high-definition 8K format. The film follows astronauts Zhai Zhigang, Wang Yaping, and Ye Guangfu during their six-month mission and has captured the imagination of science fiction fans, including acclaimed author Liu Cixin. Liu, author of "The Three-Body Problem," praised the film for bringing science fiction visions to life and expressed excitement for China's future space exploration goals, such as a planned lunar landing in 2030.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California state legislature has passed a bill that would permit colleges and universities to offer preferential admission to applicants who can prove they are descendants of people enslaved in the U.S. before 1900. Authored by Assemblymember Isaac Bryan, the legislation is part of a broader package of bills aimed at addressing the legacy of slavery and systemic racism. Supporters argue the bill is narrowly tailored to focus on lineage rather than race to comply with Proposition 209, which banned affirmative action. However, opponents contend that lineage serves as a proxy for race and the measure will likely face significant legal challenges.</p>

          <h2>German Language Sees Surge in Popularity Among Turkish Youth Seeking Opportunities Abroad</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 05:49:00 EDT</div>

          <p>The German language is experiencing a surge in popularity in Turkey, second only to English, as a growing number of young people view it as a pathway to higher education and career opportunities in Germany. Driven by a difficult economic situation and stressful working conditions in Turkey, students are increasingly enrolling in German courses at universities and high schools. Education experts note a significant trend of graduates from elite Turkish high schools choosing to attend German universities, fueling demand for German language instruction and creating a shortage of qualified teachers in Turkey.</p>

          <h2>Colleges Add Football Programs to Boost Male Enrollment, But Long-Term Gains Are Debated</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small colleges across the U.S., such as Roanoke College in Virginia, are adding or reviving football programs in an effort to increase overall enrollment, particularly among male students. Facing a demographic decline in college-age students and a widening gender gap on campus, administrators hope the sport will attract more applicants and enhance school spirit. However, research indicates that while adding football can cause an initial one-year spike in male enrollment, these gains typically fade within a few years. Despite this, schools see the investment as a strategy to create a livelier campus and appeal to a different pool of potential students.</p>

          <p>With teenagers increasingly using generative AI tools like ChatGPT for everything from homework to mental health support, child development experts are urging parents to engage in open conversations about the technology. They recommend starting discussions early, exploring AI's capabilities and limitations together, and teaching kids to fact-check AI-generated information. While AI can be a helpful learning aid, experts also warn of significant risks, as chatbots can provide unsafe responses to sensitive topics like self-harm and may not recognize serious mental health conditions, highlighting the need for parental guidance and clear household rules.</p>

          <p>Colombia's highest court has ruled that Meta violated the right to freedom of expression by deleting the Instagram account of well-known adult film actress Esperanza Gómez. The Constitutional Court found that the company removed her account, which had over five million followers, without clear justification and applied its nudity policies inconsistently compared to other similar accounts. The ruling states that social media posts are constitutionally protected and ordered Meta to create more transparent mechanisms for users to challenge moderation decisions, marking a significant decision on content moderation and user rights.</p>

          <p>Boxing experts are offering split predictions for the highly anticipated fight between Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez and Terence "Bud" Crawford. Crawford's supporters point to his technical brilliance, adaptability, and reach advantage, believing he can outbox the aging Canelo and win on points, despite moving up two weight classes. Conversely, those backing Álvarez argue that his size, power, and experience at super-middleweight will be insurmountable for Crawford, predicting that Canelo's strength and ability to control the fight's pace will ultimately lead him to victory in the Las Vegas showdown.</p>

          <p>Following days of deadly youth-led anti-corruption protests that toppled the previous government, Nepal has appointed former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki as its interim prime minister, the first woman to hold the position. The "GenZ" protests erupted after the government imposed a social media ban but quickly grew to address broader economic grievances, leading to the dissolution of parliament. With Karki, known for her strong anti-graft stance, now in charge, calm has returned to Kathmandu and new elections have been scheduled for March 5th, marking a pivotal moment for the nation.</p>

          <p>In a new initiative aimed at both boosting birth rates and retaining scientific talent, Shanghai has introduced a subsidy program for female researchers returning to work after having a child. The program, initially launching at the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, will provide a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (US$7,010) to 20 new mothers who hold doctoral degrees. This policy attempts to address two of China's major priorities by providing targeted support to women in a critical professional field, encouraging them to continue their careers after starting families.</p>

          <p>A potential friendly match between Portugal and the United States next March could mark Cristiano Ronaldo's first appearance in the U.S. in over a decade, fueling speculation about the reasons for his long absence. The article suggests his avoidance of the U.S. may be linked to a sexual assault allegation from 2009, which was legally resolved but could have created public relations and legal risks. A return under the Trump administration, which has shown favor to Ronaldo, could be seen as a strategic move to re-engage with the American market ahead of the 2026 World Cup.</p>
