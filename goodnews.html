        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's planned agreement to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius has been temporarily halted by a High Court injunction, filed by two Chagossian women. The deal would allow the UK and US to continue using a military base on the archipelago for 99 years, but would also involve billions in payments from British taxpayers to Mauritius. The legal challenge argues that the government failed to consult properly with the Chagossian people, who have a close connection to the islands. A government spokesperson declined to comment on the ongoing legal case, emphasizing the deal's importance for national security.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has surged to a new record high, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. The price increase is occurring despite a recent drop in U.S. stock markets, with investors potentially seeking alternative stores of value. Positive developments on the regulatory front, such as the GENIUS Act, and a pro-crypto agenda from President Trump have contributed to the rally. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a notable bitcoin skeptic, has also announced that the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>
