          <h2>East German Toy 'Tiemi' Gains Collector Interest Amid Modern Collectible Craze</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 03:29:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the history of the Tiemi, an East German version of the popular 1980s Monchhichi doll. Created in the German Democratic Republic as an alternative to the Western toy, the Tiemi was produced in the toy-making town of Sonneberg and became popular throughout the Eastern Bloc. Following German reunification, production ceased, turning these dolls into sought-after collector's items. The piece draws a parallel to the current craze for collectibles like Labubu, highlighting a cycle of nostalgia and the value placed on authenticity and historical uniqueness in the toy market.</p>

          <h2>Barclays Exceeds Second-Quarter Profit Forecasts Driven by Investment Banking Strength</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 03:26:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British bank Barclays reported second-quarter pre-tax profits of £2.5 billion, surpassing analyst expectations and prompting the announcement of a £1 billion share buyback. The strong performance was largely driven by a 10% year-on-year income increase in its investment banking division, which benefited from market volatility and robust trading income. Despite challenges like a drop in advisory fees and looming US capital rule changes, the bank affirmed it is on track with its three-year strategic plan to deliver higher returns. The results reflect a broader trend of banks posting strong earnings amid recent market turbulence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Manchester United Reportedly Eyeing Watkins and Sesko for Striker Role</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 03:06:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United has identified Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko as top targets to reinforce their striking options, though any move depends on the club offloading other players first. Acquiring either player presents challenges, as Aston Villa is reportedly unwilling to sell Watkins and has placed a high price tag on him, while Newcastle is also competing for Sesko. The club acknowledges the need to sell players to fund new acquisitions, a process that may extend until the transfer deadline. United is weighing its options carefully amid these market complexities.</p>

          <p>Chinese academics are urging Beijing to actively shape its international narrative by leveraging new cultural symbols and engaging more with scholars across Asia. The goal is to create a discourse that reflects Asian values, such as "harmony and diversity," to counterbalance the long-standing dominance of Western perspectives in global communication. Experts suggest that as US global engagement shifts, China has an opportunity to take a leading role in defining international norms, particularly in emerging fields. This strategy aims to align China's soft power with its economic growth and increase its influence within the Global South and Brics bloc.</p>

          <p>India has become the leading exporter of smartphones to the U.S., with its share of imports jumping to 44% in the second quarter, a significant rise from 13% a year prior. This shift reflects a broader trend of manufacturing supply chains moving away from China amid ongoing trade uncertainties. The surge is primarily driven by Apple's strategy to increase iPhone production in India, with total Indian-made smartphone shipments to the U.S. soaring by 240%. In contrast, China's share of the U.S. market fell from 61% to 25% during the same period, signaling a major realignment in global electronics manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

These facilities are designed to help thousands of European AI startups overcome the lack of computing capacity, a major obstacle to their growth.

The call, which lasted about 45 minutes, signals Beijing's effort to reset and improve relations that had become strained under the previous, more US-aligned government.

This national scheme follows various pilot programs by local governments aimed at encouraging more births. The initiative addresses the high cost of raising children in China, which is a significant factor in the country's shrinking and rapidly aging population, even after the one-child policy was abolished.</p>

          <p>Reports suggest that a planned U.S. stopover for Taiwanese leader Lai Ching-te en route to South America may have been canceled or altered, a move that could ease tensions with Beijing. According to the Financial Times, Washington informed Lai he could not stop in New York, while other reports indicate the trip was merely delayed, with potential stops in Texas. Taiwan's Presidential Office cited domestic typhoon recovery efforts and regional developments as reasons for the change in travel plans. The decision is significant as such "stopovers" are often viewed by Beijing as a provocation, and avoiding one could pave the way for a potential meeting between Presidents Xi and Trump.</p>
