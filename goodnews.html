        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced that ten Israeli hostages are expected to be released from Gaza very soon. This development is part of a broader effort to secure a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, a proposal that includes the return of these hostages and the remains of eighteen others. In exchange for the releases, Israel would free an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement comes amidst ongoing diplomatic efforts, including a recent visit by the Mossad director to Washington to discuss the potential relocation of Palestinians from Gaza.</p>

          <p>Argentine actor Juan Pablo Di Pace, known for his roles in “Mamma Mia!” and “Fuller House,” has made his directorial and screenwriting debut with the film “Before We Forget.” The movie explores a first love between two young men at an Italian film school, drawing from Di Pace's own personal experiences. Co-directed with his childhood friend Andrés Pepe Estrada, the film is described not as a genre piece but as a tender story about the heart and memories. Di Pace, who publicly came out in 2019, aimed to create a universal love story where the characters' gender is incidental.</p>

          <h2>Vietnam Veteran Realizes Wartime Dream by Building a Carousel of Happiness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 20:43:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retired Marine Cpl. Scott Harrison, who endured the Vietnam War, has brought to life a vision that helped him survive: a carousel in a mountain meadow. During the war, a music box from his sister inspired daydreams of this peaceful image, providing a mental escape from the brutality. After struggling with PTSD for years, Harrison began building the Carousel of Happiness in Nederland, Colorado, in 1986, a project that took 26 years to complete. Now a nonprofit, the carousel has delighted over a million visitors and has been instrumental in Harrison's own healing journey.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major regulatory framework for cryptocurrency in the United States, specifically targeting the $250 billion stablecoin market. The legislation, which received bipartisan support, creates consumer protections and allows banks and credit unions to issue their own stablecoins backed by U.S. dollars. Supporters believe this will facilitate faster and lower-cost financial transactions, strengthening the dollar's role in the digital economy. The administration views this as a significant step toward integrating digital currencies into the mainstream financial system, calling it a massive validation for the crypto community.

          <p>Shares of Block, the fintech company founded by Jack Dorsey, surged more than 10% in extended trading following the announcement that it will join the S&P 500 index. Block is set to replace oil producer Hess, which was recently acquired by Chevron. This inclusion is significant as it often leads to a stock rally due to fund managers rebalancing their portfolios to reflect the benchmark index's new composition. Despite being down 14% for the year, Block's addition brings more technology weight to the S&P 500, reflecting the sector's growing market capitalization. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The leaders of Israel and Syria have agreed to a ceasefire, according to a U.S. envoy, following a series of Israeli airstrikes in Damascus. The agreement, reportedly backed by Turkey and Jordan, was announced by Tom Barrack, the U.S. ambassador to Turkey and point man on Syria. Israel had conducted the strikes stating it was defending the Druze minority community after deadly clashes in southern Syria. The ceasefire marks a significant de-escalation in a volatile region, especially after the recent toppling of Bashar al-Assad's regime by Islamist forces led by Ahmed al-Sharaa.</p>

          <p>Following a medical evaluation for mild leg swelling, President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a condition his physician described as "benign and common." The White House doctor, Sean P. Barbabella, confirmed that ultrasound tests and blood work showed no signs of more serious issues like blood clots, declaring the president to be in excellent health. CVI affects the veins' ability to return blood to the heart, causing pooling in the legs, and is common in adults over 70. Treatment typically involves lifestyle changes like compression, elevation, and exercise.</p>

          <p>The 'California Forever' project, a controversial plan by Silicon Valley billionaires to build a new city in Solano County, has announced its intention to create a 2,100-acre manufacturing hub. Dubbed the “Solano Foundry,” the site would focus on defense, robotics, aerospace, and other frontier technologies, aiming to create over 35,000 manufacturing jobs. The project's CEO, Jan Sramek, pitched the plan as a way to bring high-tech research and production back together in California. However, the proposal faces skepticism from local community groups who question the necessity of building an entire new city for this purpose.</p>

The change follows a ProPublica report detailing the Pentagon's dependence on Chinese engineers, who were supervised by U.S.-based "digital escorts," raising national security and cybersecurity concerns. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the previous arrangement unacceptable and announced a review of similar systems. Microsoft stated the move was a response to these concerns and reaffirmed its commitment to providing secure services to the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>Pest control experts and entomologists report that the United Kingdom is experiencing a significant increase in wasp populations this summer, likely due to a very warm and dry spring. While scientific data is still pending, anecdotal evidence points to a strong year for social wasps, which can be a nuisance at picnics and in gardens. Despite their unpopularity, experts emphasize the crucial ecological role wasps play as apex predators and natural pest controllers. To coexist peacefully, the public is advised to avoid agitating the insects and to distract them with a small amount of a sugary substance placed away from human activity.</p>

          <p>A new theatrical production in Liverpool, titled "The Legend of Rooney's Ring," reimagines the lives of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen as a fantasy saga inspired by "The Lord of the Rings." Written by Helen Serafinowicz, co-creator of "Motherland," the show is an affectionate, comedic homage to the famous couple. The plot is loosely based on a 2004 tabloid story about Coleen allegedly throwing away her engagement ring, merging the urban myth with a classic quest narrative. The play is presented as a deliberately over-the-top and lighthearted tribute to the couple's resilience in the public eye.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland's respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccination program is being expanded to include premature babies, who will be offered a long-acting injection starting this autumn. RSV is a highly infectious virus that can cause serious respiratory illness, especially in young children, and is a leading cause of hospitalization for infants. The new Nirsevimab injection offers about 80% protection with a single dose, a significant improvement over the previous multi-dose treatment. This initiative aims to protect vulnerable infants who are born too early to benefit from the maternal RSV vaccine given during pregnancy.</p>

The girl had been abducted by men attempting to force her into marriage and was missing for a week. According to reports, three lions chased off her captors and then stood guard over her until she was found by police. Wildlife experts at the time speculated that the girl’s whimpering may have resembled the sound of a lion cub, which could explain the pride's protective behavior. The event is still remembered in Ethiopia as a miraculous intervention.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered an interaction between a specific gut bacteria molecule and a genetic variant that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. The study found that in individuals with a faulty version of the OTUD3 gene, the body cannot properly regulate an immune-activating protein called STING. This leads to an overreaction to harmless gut bacteria, causing chronic inflammation in the colon. This breakthrough helps explain the unpredictable nature of the disease and opens the door for more precise, personalized therapies that target this specific inflammatory pathway rather than suppressing the entire immune system.</p>
