          <p>Cole Hauser, known for his role as Rip Wheeler on the popular series "Yellowstone," recently shared some strange experiences with fans since his rise to fame. He revealed that some "older ladies," particularly after having a few drinks, have become overly familiar and have grabbed him inappropriately. Despite these odd encounters, Hauser noted that most fans have been respectful. The actor is also set to reprise his role in an upcoming "Yellowstone" spin-off, continuing the story of his character alongside Kelly Reilly's Beth Dutton.</p>

          <p>English Premier League clubs have set a new spending record, with their total outlay for the summer transfer window exceeding £3 billion. This figure, significantly higher than last summer's £1.96 billion, surpasses the combined spending of the top leagues in Germany, Spain, France, and Italy. The deadline day was highlighted by major deals, including Alexander Isak's British record £125 million move to Liverpool. The spending spree reflects the league's immense financial power, with even newly promoted clubs investing heavily to compete.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool shattered spending records this summer with a £415 million outlay, a stark contrast to former manager Jurgen Klopp's previous comments about financial ceilings. The club's aggressive transfer strategy was fueled by a combination of factors, including saved funds from the previous year, significant commercial growth, and over £200 million in player sales. This financial power allowed them to capitalize on their recent title success, acquiring top talent like Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak. The tragic death of player Diogo Jota also necessitated unforeseen changes to the team's forward line.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a group of 10 Eurasian countries including China, Russia, and India, has formally decided to establish a new development bank. The initiative aims to provide an alternative to the U.S. dollar-dominated global financial system and reduce associated risks for member nations. Analysts suggest the bank will accelerate key infrastructure projects and insulate the region from Western economic pressures. This move represents a significant step in strengthening economic cooperation and creating a financial institution independent of Western control. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New Dating of Ancient Greek Skull Reshapes Understanding of Human Evolution</h2>

          <p>A landmark study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a significant human fossil discovered in a Greek cave, to be at least 286,000 years old. Using advanced uranium-series dating techniques, researchers placed the skull firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era, resolving decades of debate over its age. The fossil, likely belonging to the species *Homo heidelbergensis*, provides evidence that more primitive human populations coexisted with early Neanderthals in Europe. This finding challenges linear models of human evolution, suggesting a more complex and overlapping history of different human groups in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Increased solar activity has created a strong possibility that the Northern Lights will be visible across much of the UK in the coming days. The Met Office stated there is a "decent chance" for sightings as far south as the Midlands, a rare occurrence. This phenomenon is caused by a coronal mass ejection from the sun, sending charged particles that interact with Earth's magnetic field. While visibility depends on clear, dark skies away from light pollution, the event could offer a memorable celestial display for many residents.</p>

          <p>At 38, Novak Djokovic continues to break age-related records at the US Open, but questions remain about his physical durability through the grueling tournament. Despite playing himself into good form, Djokovic has required medical attention for various physical issues in nearly every match, casting doubt on his ability to withstand two weeks of best-of-five-set contests. His late-career success is unprecedented, but recent struggles in major tournaments highlight the challenge he faces. He now prepares to face Taylor Fritz, against whom he holds an undefeated record, in a significant test of his physical resilience.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has signed 23-year-old Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp in a deal worth an initial €21 million. Lammens has agreed to a five-year contract with the club, which is seeking to address inconsistencies in its goalkeeping department. The young keeper, who has yet to earn a senior cap for Belgium, is highly regarded for his shot-stopping ability and pro-active style. The move comes after United's current goalkeepers, Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana, have failed to consistently impress since their arrivals in 2023.</p>

          <p>Naomi Osaka delivered a commanding performance at the US Open, defeating defending champion Coco Gauff 6-3, 6-2 in a highly anticipated fourth-round match. Playing with renewed confidence and authority, the four-time major champion capitalized on Gauff's struggles, particularly with her forehand, which produced numerous unforced errors. The victory marks Osaka's most significant win since returning from maternity leave and moves her into a Grand Slam quarter-final for the first time since 2021. For Gauff, the loss was a disappointing end to a summer marked by inconsistency.</p>

Sancho's move provides the 25-year-old winger with another opportunity to revitalize his Premier League career after previous loan spells. These deadline-day acquisitions are seen as crucial reinforcements for Villa, who have had a slow start to their season and needed to add creativity and energy.</p>

          <p>Benny Safdie's new film, "The Smashing Machine," stars Dwayne Johnson in a dramatic role as pioneering MMA champion Mark Kerr. The movie, based on a 2002 documentary, explores the crisis Kerr faced after his first loss, confronting substance abuse and relationship turmoil. Johnson's performance is noted as a perfect physical casting, and he effectively portrays the fighter's vulnerability, supported by Emily Blunt as his girlfriend. While the film doesn't reach the tragic depths of similar sports dramas, it offers a solid and insightful look into the psychological pressures of a combat sports icon.</p>
