          <p>A Soviet-era space probe, Kosmos 482, originally intended for Venus, reentered Earth's atmosphere and crashed into the Indian Ocean after being stranded in Earth's orbit for 53 years due to a launch vehicle malfunction. The probe, part of the Venera program, was designed to deliver a lander to study Venus's surface and atmosphere. Space agencies had been tracking the probe's descent due to concerns about potential dangers upon reentry, given its sturdy construction designed to withstand Venus's harsh environment. Roscosmos confirmed the spacecraft no longer exists after its fiery reentry.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily halted the Trump administration's government overhaul, citing that Congress did not authorize large-scale staffing cuts and agency restructuring.
