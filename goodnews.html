          <p>Loretta Swit, best known for her role as Maj. Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan on the TV series "M*A*S*H," has died at the age of 87 at her home in New York City from what is believed to be natural causes. Swit's portrayal of Houlihan, a foil to Alan Alda's Capt. Benjamin Franklin "Hawkeye" Pierce, earned her two Emmy Awards and multiple Golden Globe nominations during the show's 11-season run on CBS. As the series progressed, Swit sought to develop Houlihan's character beyond the "Hot Lips" nickname, emphasizing her intelligence and portraying her as a real person undergoing constant development and change. The actress's career spanned both stage and screen, but her role in "M*A*S*H" remains her most iconic achievement, remembered for its blend of comedy and drama set against the backdrop of the Korean War. The optimism score is 90.</p>

          <p>Algerian boxer Imane Khelif is barred from competing in an upcoming World Boxing women's competition until she undergoes a mandatory sex test, according to an announcement made by the organization. World Boxing's decision to adopt mandatory sex tests aims to safeguard athletes, especially given the physical risks associated with Olympic-style boxing. Khelif, who was previously disqualified from the International Boxing Association for failing a gender eligibility test, was slated to return to the sport at the Eindhoven Box Cup in The Netherlands. The new policy includes an appeals process and support for boxers with adverse test results. The optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk stated he expects the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to achieve $1 trillion in cuts "over time," despite falling short of that goal during his tenure. President Trump praised Musk's work, but the White House has said DOGE's efforts have saved roughly $170 billion, and an analysis suggested DOGE's actions could cost the government $135 billion. Musk defended DOGE's work and said he would continue visiting the White House as an advisor to the president. The president praised a court decision reinstating tariffs imposed under an emergency powers law. The optimism score is 60.</p>
