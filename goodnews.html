          <h2>Google Offers Buyouts to Employees Across Multiple Divisions</h2>

          <p>Google has offered buyouts to employees in several divisions, including knowledge and information (K&I), central engineering, marketing, research, and communications. This move is part of Google's ongoing efforts to reduce headcount since the layoffs of 12,000 employees in 2023, with the "voluntary exit program" applying to U.S.-based employees. The K&I unit, which houses Google's search, ads, and commerce divisions, underwent a reorganization in October, and finance chief Anat Ashkenazi emphasized cost-cutting measures to support increased AI infrastructure spending in 2025. Google is also revamping its internal learning platform to focus on AI tool training for employees. The memo sent out by Google executive Nick Fox indicated that employees who are not meeting expectations may want to take the buyout, while those who are excited by their work and doing well should remain with the company. Optimism regarding the company's future is somewhat tempered by the layoffs.</p>

          <p>UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel stated that Commerzbank's current share price is too high for a potential takeover offer. UniCredit has acquired a 28% stake in Commerzbank since September through derivatives and has ECB authorization to hold up to 29.9% of the lender. Orcel indicated that UniCredit would not proceed with an acquisition offer at a premium to Commerzbank's current share value, as it would not provide value for their investors. Shares of the German bank have surged 76% year-to-date, benefiting from a broader rally of German equities following Berlin's fiscal policy changes. Orcel emphasized that UniCredit is far from a merger bid and would first seek a constructive solution to opposition from the German government. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia announced partnerships with European countries and companies to expand its infrastructure and software presence in the artificial intelligence sector. CEO Jensen Huang highlighted key European partnerships at Nvidia's GTC event in Paris, emphasizing Nvidia's role as an infrastructure company that can help countries build data centers using its GPUs. Nvidia seeks to embed itself in national-level AI infrastructure, particularly as U.S. export restrictions impact revenue in China. Key partnerships include Mistral, which will build an "AI cloud" using Nvidia Grace Blackwell chips, and infrastructure projects in Italy and Armenia. The company is also working with telecommunications firms like Orange and Telefonica, focusing on "sovereign AI" with data centers located regionally within the EU. The expansion will significantly increase AI computing capacity in Europe over the next two years.</p>

Masaaki Okawara, president of Ohkawara Kakohki Co., and two other men will receive about 166 million yen ($1.15 million) in damages, with the court recognizing their arrests and indictments as illegal. The investigation involved the export of spray-drying apparatus suspected of being used in biological weapons production, but prosecutors withdrew the indictment in July 2021. A Tokyo police investigator testified that the case was "fabricated," and a former investigator cited ambition as the motive for building the case.

Head coach Montse Tome cited Hermoso's performances for Tigres and the availability of other players in her position as reasons for the omission.

          <p>Seattle is grappling with balancing the need for more housing with the preservation and growth of trees to combat climate change. Trees provide cooling shade, absorb carbon pollution, and reduce stormwater runoff, but are often seen as obstacles to development. The Bryant Heights development showcases how to build density while saving trees, with architects integrating 86 housing units around existing mature trees. Seattle's updated tree protection ordinance aims to preserve trees on private property during development, with developers generally supporting the code for its predictability and flexibility. The city is working to reverse canopy shrinkage by planting more trees in parks and public areas, and increasing tree replacement requirements for development.</p>

States are developing insurance discount programs, modeled after Alabama's, to encourage homeowners to strengthen their houses. Alabama's FORTIFIED Roof program provides discounts of 20% to 35% on the wind portion of insurance for roofs that meet specific standards. California offers smaller discounts for wildfire-resistant upgrades, but some experts argue that these discounts are not enough to motivate homeowners.
