          <p>Indiana Fever's Sophie Cunningham publicly called on the WNBA commissioner to increase player pay during ongoing contract negotiations between the league and the players' union. Her statement reflects a broader sentiment among players, many of whom have been vocal about their desire for better compensation and have used events like the All-Star game to protest. The Women’s National Basketball Players Association (WNBPA) is negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement, with several prominent players calling the league's current proposals disrespectful and unacceptable.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that the U.S. will likely extend the upcoming August 12 trade deadline with China, signaling a continuation of negotiations rather than an immediate escalation of tariffs. This development suggests a more constructive phase in the trade relationship, with talks scheduled to be held in Stockholm to work out the details of a potential extension. Bessent expressed hope that the discussions could also address other key issues, including China's manufacturing output and its economic support for Russia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that he will let Jerome Powell serve out his term as Federal Reserve chair, which ends in May 2026, stating that Powell "is going to be out pretty soon anyway." This comment suggests a de-escalation after weeks of relentless attacks on Powell for not cutting interest rates and floating the idea of firing him. While Trump continued his criticism, his willingness to wait out Powell's term could reduce uncertainty in financial markets and ease a potential legal and political battle over the Fed's independence.</p>
