        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising credit card debt and delinquencies, understanding payment timelines is crucial for consumers to avoid significant financial damage. While issuers may offer an unofficial grace period of a few days, a payment is officially reported as late to credit bureaus after 30 days, which can harm credit scores. The consequences escalate further at 60 and 90 days, with potential penalty APRs and more aggressive collection efforts. The article advises proactive communication with lenders and exploring options like hardship programs or balance transfers to mitigate the negative impacts of falling behind on payments.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration will now permit Boeing to issue its own airworthiness certificates for some new 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner aircraft, reversing restrictions imposed after previous safety crises. This authority was revoked for the 737 MAX in 2019 following two fatal crashes and for the 787 in 2022 due to production defects. The FAA stated the decision reflects confidence in Boeing's improved production quality and will allow inspectors to focus on other areas of surveillance. The move is a significant step for Boeing as it works to recover from intense regulatory scrutiny and stabilize its manufacturing processes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sinclair announced it will resume broadcasting "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on its ABC affiliate stations, following a temporary preemption of the show. The decision comes after Disney returned the program to its network, having suspended it over comments Kimmel made regarding conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Sinclair, which owns about 40 ABC affiliates, stated that it had proposed measures to ABC to strengthen accountability and viewer feedback, though these were not adopted. The company emphasized that its decision to preempt the program was an exercise of its free speech rights as a broadcaster, independent of government influence.</p>

The day began with a surge of American optimism, as Bryson DeChambeau nearly drove the first green, leading to an early win on the hole. However, the European pairs quickly silenced the boisterous New York crowd with steady and precise play. Teams led by Rory McIlroy and Jon Rahm secured decisive victories, leaving the American side rattled and in need of a significant comeback in the afternoon matches to regain momentum on home soil.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Monthly Costs for Home Equity Loans Have Decreased Following Federal Reserve Rate Cut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 13:43:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cost of borrowing against home equity has slightly decreased following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, making these loans a more affordable option for homeowners. A new analysis shows that the monthly payment on a $150,000 home equity loan is now lower than it was earlier in the year. For example, a 10-year loan currently has an average rate of 8.34%, resulting in monthly savings of about $16 compared to rates from February. While the reduction is modest, it reflects a favorable trend for borrowers considering tapping into their home's value for large expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Costco reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, but failed to fully impress investors due to some weaker metrics. The company's same-store sales growth of 5.7% fell short of the estimated 5.9%, marking the second consecutive quarter of underperformance in this area. A slight dip in membership renewal rates and a gross margin miss also contributed to a more than 2% drop in the company's stock price. Despite these concerns, analysts noted strong points, such as a 14% growth in membership fees and continued market share gains in a challenging retail environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Dutch government has announced it will return over 28,000 fossils, including the historically significant "Java Man" bones, to Indonesia. These fossils, discovered in 1891 by Dutch anthropologist Eugene Dubois when Indonesia was a Dutch colony, are among the first known remains of Homo erectus. The decision follows a recommendation from an independent committee which concluded the fossils were likely removed against the will of the local population. This repatriation is part of a broader effort by the Netherlands to reckon with its colonial past and return culturally significant artifacts to their countries of origin.</p>

          <p>As retirees face concerns about outliving their savings, a strategy known as the "rule of thirds" is gaining attention as an alternative to traditional withdrawal methods. The approach involves converting one-third of retirement savings into a guaranteed lifetime income product, such as a fixed annuity, to cover essential expenses. The remaining two-thirds of the portfolio can then be invested for growth or used for flexible spending and emergencies. This method aims to provide a balance of financial security and flexibility, reducing stress from market volatility while potentially allowing for higher overall withdrawal rates.

This move has made the U.S. visa one of the most competitively priced "golden visas" globally, sparking immediate interest from wealthy individuals, particularly from China and India. The program, which promises residency in "record time" in exchange for the fee, is expected to generate substantial federal revenue. However, it faces potential legal challenges as it uses workarounds of existing immigration law, and applicants may face long waits due to existing backlogs.</p>
