          <p>Japan's parliament has enacted a law requiring 300 to 400 major companies to participate in a carbon emissions trading system starting in fiscal year 2026. The law targets companies producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually, across industries like steel and car production, accounting for nearly 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Under the system, companies receive emission allowances and must purchase carbon credits for emissions exceeding their limits, incentivizing emissions reduction. While designed to lower emissions, the system may lead to price increases for consumers as companies pass on decarbonization costs.</p>

This decision likely reflects the need for venture capital firms to gain liquidity after a period of meager returns.

Proponents argue that protection wanes and vaccines may protect against long COVID, while others suggest children's immune systems retain protection longer.
