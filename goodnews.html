          <p>New Zealand's star batter Kane Williamson will not participate in the upcoming T20 series against England as he continues his recovery from a long-term injury. However, he is expected to be available for the subsequent three one-day internationals. Captain Mitchell Santner is set to return to lead the team after recovering from abdominal surgery, and all-rounder Rachin Ravindra is also back in the squad. The three-match T20 series is scheduled to begin in Christchurch on Saturday, October 18th, marking a key fixture in the international cricket calendar.</p>

          <p>Matt Cross, a newcomer to the event from Lincolnshire, has been crowned the overall World Conker Champion at the 60th annual competition in Northamptonshire. He defeated women's champion Mags Blake in the final round of the unique British contest, which involves players attempting to smash their opponent's horse chestnut. This year's event saw heightened interest following a cheating scandal in the previous year. Organizers overcame fears of a cancellation due to a shortage of quality conkers by sourcing them from across the UK and Europe, including from the royal estate at Windsor Castle.</p>

          <p>The Denver Broncos defeated the New York Jets 13-11 in a defensively dominated game played in London. The Jets' offense struggled profoundly, managing only 82 total net yards and allowing quarterback Justin Fields to be sacked nine times. Despite their offensive woes, the Jets held a slim lead in the third quarter after a safety. A late 27-yard field goal by Wil Lutz put the Broncos ahead, and a final sack on fourth down sealed the victory for Denver, extending their winning streak to three games while the Jets remain winless.</p>

India had set a formidable total, powered by an opening stand of 155, but Healy's masterful innings anchored the Australian response.

          <p>To cultivate mental strength in children, parents should avoid certain common behaviors, according to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 families.
