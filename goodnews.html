          <p>In 2025, older workers (ages 60-63) can contribute up to $11,250 more to their 401(k)s than younger workers, thanks to the Secure 2.0 Act.  This raises the maximum deferral limit to $34,750 for these savers.  However, not all 401(k) plans have implemented this change.  Financial planners highlight this as a valuable tool for tax-advantaged retirement savings, though many workers may not be able to take full advantage (not investment advice).</p>
