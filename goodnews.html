          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 06:45:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark has enacted a new law requiring women to be included in the military conscription lottery system alongside men when they turn 18. This policy change extends the service period from four to eleven months and aims to increase the number of annual service members to 6,500 by 2033. The move follows similar policies in neighboring Norway and Sweden and comes as Denmark increases its defense spending to meet NATO targets amid heightened security concerns in Europe. Previously, military service for Danish women was voluntary.</p>

          <p>A U.S. military commander has proposed reassigning 200 of the 4,000 California National Guard troops currently deployed in Los Angeles back to wildfire-fighting duties. The deployment, ordered by the Trump administration to manage protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has been controversial and legally challenged by Governor Gavin Newsom. State officials had warned the move would deplete firefighting resources during a peak wildfire season. This potential shift addresses concerns that the Guard's firefighting capacity was significantly reduced by the Los Angeles assignment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chelsea's recent transfer activities, including the pursuit of Brighton's Jo√£o Pedro, reflect head coach Enzo Maresca's goal of creating a more versatile and unpredictable attack. Maresca's system often eschews traditional overlapping full-backs in favor of numerical superiority in the midfield, which can sometimes isolate wingers. By acquiring players with different profiles like Jo√£o Pedro, who can drop deep and link play, the team aims to overcome struggles against defensive low blocks. This strategy is about adding new dimensions to the offense and ensuring the squad has multiple ways to break down opponents.</p>

          <p>Internet infrastructure company Cloudflare will now block AI crawlers from scraping website data by default, a significant move to protect content creators.

The company argues that AI scraping deprives publishers of traffic and ad revenue, breaking the traditional internet model. This policy shift could substantially impact the ability of AI firms to gather the vast amounts of data needed to develop their large language models.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece analyzes the successful New York City mayoral primary campaign of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, suggesting it holds valuable lessons for the national Democratic party. The author argues that Mamdani's victory was built on a practical socialist platform focused on affordability, moral integrity on issues like the Israel-Palestine conflict, and a powerful grassroots volunteer movement that overcame massive spending by his opponent. The campaign's success in mobilizing a diverse coalition of young, working-class voters demonstrates a path forward for progressives that doesn't rely on fear-based politics or compromising on core values.</p>

          <p>Residents of Leavenworth, Kansas, are actively resisting an effort by the private prison firm CoreCivic to reopen a local facility to house immigration detainees. The facility, which closed in 2021, has a troubled history of understaffing, violence, and alleged abuses, prompting opposition from a coalition of locals, including former prison employees and a Catholic convent. Despite the town's pro-prison reputation, city officials have sued CoreCivic to block the reopening, arguing the company must obtain a new permit. The conflict highlights a local battle over corporate accountability and the boom in private detention under current federal immigration policies.</p>

          <p>China has announced new tax breaks designed to encourage foreign companies to reinvest their profits within the country, aiming to boost investor confidence amid trade tensions with the U.S. and E.U. Under the new policy, foreign firms reinvesting profits into local operations can deduct 10 percent of the reinvested amount from their onshore taxes. This incentive, which can be applied retroactively to the start of 2025, is part of a broader government effort to signal openness and stabilize foreign investment flows.

          <p>The University of California is exploring a systemwide shift from its current quarter-based academic calendar to a semester system, a move that would align most of its campuses with UC Berkeley, UC Merced, and the majority of U.S. universities. Proponents argue a common calendar would simplify course transfers, systemwide collaboration, and access to internships. However, the proposal faces criticism over the significant cost, estimated between $288 million and $371 million, and concerns from faculty about increased workload. The potential impacts on student performance and university finances are currently being studied by a UC working group.</p>

          <p>In West Texas, a collaborative effort is underway to protect the Greater Big Bend International Dark Sky Reserve, the largest of its kind in the world. As light pollution increasingly obscures night skies elsewhere, astronomers, conservationists, and local communities in this region have worked to implement dark-sky friendly lighting policies. This includes convincing cities, counties, and even oil and gas operators to use shielded, amber-tinted lights. The initiative not only preserves the ability for scientific research at the McDonald Observatory but also protects wildlife and supports a growing astro-tourism economy.</p>
