        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A measure in President Trump's budget reconciliation bill aimed at restricting federal payments to abortion providers is facing potential opposition from moderate House Republicans. Representative Mike Lawler expressed concerns about the definition of groups providing abortion services, warning of a "hornet's nest." The measure seeks to redirect funds from "big abortion" to federally qualified health centers. With a narrow three-vote margin in the House, Republicans can't afford much dissent. The bill also targets Medicaid dollars going to states that provide healthcare to illegal immigrants and repeals certain Biden administration green energy subsidies.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reported making substantial progress in trade talks held in Geneva, Switzerland, with both sides describing the discussions as productive and constructive. The meetings, attended by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, mark the first formal negotiations since President Trump increased tariff rates on Chinese goods. While details of the agreement are forthcoming, experts anticipate potential tariff cuts. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala of the WTO hailed the talks as a significant step forward, urging both nations to continue developing solutions to mitigate tensions and restore confidence in the global trading system.</p>

          <p>The Argentine Supreme Court has discovered documentation associated with the Nazi regime, including propaganda material, among its archives. The material, found during preparations for a museum of historical documents, includes postcards, photographs, and propaganda aimed at spreading Adolf Hitler's ideology in Argentina during World War II. The boxes are believed to be related to a shipment sent by the German embassy in Tokyo in 1941. The court has ordered the preservation and analysis of the material, which may eventually be displayed at the museum.</p>

          <p>Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad argues that President Trump's tariffs will negatively impact the U.S. more than targeted countries. He suggests that tariffs on goods like iPhones will increase costs for American consumers, ultimately harming the U.S. economy. Mahathir believes ASEAN nations can withstand the tariff impact through intergroup trade and business with countries other than the United States. He advocates for peaceful resolution rather than retaliation to the U.S. tariffs, emphasizing the importance of dialogue and negotiation to address concerns.</p>

          <p>Fresh & Ready Foods, an L.A.-based company, has voluntarily recalled several premade food items after federal regulators discovered a strain of listeria on its equipment. This strain is linked to a 2024 outbreak that sickened at least 10 people. The recalled products, including sandwiches and protein snacks sold under multiple brands, were distributed in California, Nevada, Arizona, and Washington. The company initiated the recall as a precautionary measure, and no illnesses have been directly linked to the recalled food. Consumers who purchased the affected items are advised to dispose of them immediately.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to sign an executive order mandating that the U.S. pay the same price for certain drugs as other nations, reviving a policy previously blocked by courts. The order would direct the Department of Health and Human Services to tie Medicare payments for drugs administered in doctor's offices to the lowest price paid by other countries. The plan aims to lower healthcare costs for Americans, though it is expected to face strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry. Critics argue that such measures could hinder innovation and the development of new medicines.</p>

Prime Minister Ishiba's government seeks to secure funds for child-rearing steps, partly from medical system savings. Proposed changes to out-of-pocket caps for high medical costs have sparked backlash, leading to a freeze on envisioned hikes.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced an executive order aimed at lowering some drug prices in the United States by aligning them with what other wealthy countries pay. The proposal is what he calls a ‚Äúmost favored nation‚Äù pricing model. The plan will most likely be subject to challenges in court, and it is not clear whether it will pass legal muster, especially without action by Congress. The pharmaceutical industry bitterly opposes the idea, which would almost certainly cut into its profits, and has been lobbying against it as discussions of the policy have regained steam in Washington in recent weeks.</p>
