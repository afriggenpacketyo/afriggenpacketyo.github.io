        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Republican-led House passed a bill to codify President Trump's executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the 'Gulf of America,' with a vote of 211 to 206. The legislation, introduced by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, directs federal agencies to update documents and maps accordingly. Democrats criticized the measure as a waste of taxpayer money, while Republicans argued it promotes American pride. The bill's future in the Senate is uncertain, requiring bipartisan support to overcome a filibuster, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune has not yet committed to bringing it to a vote.</p>

          <p>The UK and US have reached an agreement to reduce tariffs on specific goods traded between the countries, though this is not a comprehensive trade deal. Tariffs on UK car imports to the US have been cut to 10% for up to 100,000 vehicles annually, while tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the US have been scrapped. Discussions on pharmaceuticals are ongoing, and there were no changes to the UK's digital services tax. The US has previously demanded the import tax be cut to 2.5%, and Chancellor Rachel Reeves has indicated she is open to such a cut.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates announced that he will double his charitable giving to $200 billion over the next 20 years, motivated by global challenges and Andrew Carnegie's views on wealth.

Gates emphasized that philanthropy cannot compensate for government aid cuts and expressed concern about wealthy countries' commitment to supporting the world's poorest people.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price climbed above $100,000 for the first time since February, driven by optimism surrounding a trade agreement between the U.S. and the United Kingdom. The cryptocurrency's rise began overnight and continued after President Trump announced the agreement. Analysts suggest that market uncertainty and a pro-crypto administration are contributing to Bitcoin's resilience and safe-haven status. Rising tensions between India and Pakistan, along with the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates, are expected to further test Bitcoin's resilience.</p>

          <p>In an Atlantic article, Arthur C. Brooks discusses the rise of loud egos in modern society and its correlation with declining well-being. He proposes cultivating a "quiet ego," defined as a self-identity that is neither excessively self-focused nor excessively other-focused, as a countercultural strategy for happiness. Quiet ego involves virtues like charity, humility, self-awareness, and hope, and is associated with better mood balance, superior life satisfaction, and a greater sense of life‚Äôs meaning. Brooks suggests practical steps for acquiring these virtues, including asking what others need and how to improve one's surroundings, and affirming the possibility of being wrong and detaching from emotions.</p>
