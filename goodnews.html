        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford Motor Company reported an 8.2% increase in its third-quarter U.S. sales, largely propelled by strong demand for its electric vehicles and large SUVs. Sales of all-electric models surged by over 30% to a new quarterly record, while its broader category of electrified vehicles, including hybrids, grew by 20%. The automaker's performance was bolstered by consumers rushing to purchase EVs before federal incentives expired in September. CEO Jim Farley anticipates a potential short-term decline in EV market share now that the incentive program has concluded.</p>

          <p>Former American League MVP Mo Vaughn offered his perspective on why the New York Mets, who once held the best record in baseball, failed to make the postseason. Vaughn suggested to Fox News Digital that the team may have lacked the sharp, fine-tuned concentration required after an exhausting run to the National League Championship Series the previous year. He believes the team is talented enough to rebound, asserting that the experience of missing the playoffs will instill a renewed sense of urgency and focus for the upcoming season. Vaughn also commended Juan Soto for his outstanding individual performance during his first year with the team.</p>

CEO Zach Witkoff, speaking alongside co-founder Donald Trump Jr., stated the debit card aims to connect crypto assets with daily spending and is expected to roll out in late 2025 or early 2026. The firm is also exploring the tokenization of real-world assets like oil and timber. This expansion occurs as the company's stablecoin, USD1, has grown to become the fifth-largest globally, amidst a broader embrace of cryptocurrency by the Trump administration.</p>

This prolific performance makes him the fastest player this century to score 100 goals for a club in one of Europe's top five leagues, achieving the milestone in just 104 games. His current goal tally surpasses the best nine-game starts of superstars like Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, and former Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski.

          <p>The Tate Britain museum is hosting the largest-ever UK retrospective of the pioneering 20th-century photographer Lee Miller, celebrating her multifaceted career. The exhibition traces her journey from a sought-after Vogue model in New York to a key figure in the Surrealist movement in Paris, where she was a collaborator and muse to Man Ray. It also highlights her courageous work as a war correspondent for Vogue during World War II, where she uniquely blended photojournalism with a surrealist artistic sensibility. Her iconic photographs, including a self-portrait in Hitler's bathtub, captured the human suffering of the war with profound empathy.</p>

          <p>As of today, every general practitioner's practice in England must provide patients with the ability to book appointments online throughout the workday, from 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. This government-mandated change is designed to end the '8am scramble' where patients overwhelm phone lines seeking appointments. The new system will allow patients to request non-urgent appointments, describe symptoms, and ask for callbacks online. Despite the rollout, some patients have reported difficulties accessing the service, and the British Medical Association has raised concerns about a potential "online triage tsunami" overwhelming staff.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an economic environment marked by persistent inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn returns that can outpace rising costs. Current high-yield CDs provide competitive interest rates that can be locked in for a specific term, offering protection against market volatility. The article notes that online banks often provide higher rates than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions due to lower overhead costs. It also explains the phenomenon of an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently offer better returns than long-term ones. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) present an affordable borrowing option compared to high-interest personal loans or credit cards. With the average homeowner holding over $300,000 in equity, these products offer access to large sums at relatively lower rates. As of late September 2025, average rates for home equity loans range from approximately 8.19% to 8.34%, while the average HELOC rate is around 7.88%. These rates are expected to decrease if the Federal Reserve implements further rate cuts later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent drug-pricing agreement with Pfizer could reduce the impact of his administration's threat to impose widespread pharmaceutical tariffs. The deal includes a three-year exemption from such tariffs for Pfizer in exchange for voluntary price reductions and a $70 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing. This agreement sets a precedent for other major drugmakers, many of which have already announced new domestic investments, to negotiate similar exemptions. The deal focuses on tying prices for Medicaid to lower international levels, a provision analysts believe is manageable for most large pharmaceutical companies. (not investment advice)</p>
