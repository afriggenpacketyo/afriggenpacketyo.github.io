          <p>Panelists at CNBC's East Tech West conference emphasized the growing need for nations to develop "sovereign AI" to maintain strategic autonomy and address unique cultural and linguistic needs. They argued that current prominent AI models are predominantly English-based, creating a gap for other languages and cultures. To counter this, experts proposed leveraging open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing services like Amazon Web Services. This approach would democratize AI development, allowing countries, particularly in digitally savvy regions like Southeast Asia, to build their own ecosystems and prevent falling behind in a rapidly growing technological field.</p>

          <p>A private survey revealed that China's factory activity among export-oriented manufacturers unexpectedly grew in June, contrasting with official data that showed a contraction. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI registered 50.4, surpassing expectations and indicating an improvement in market conditions for the eighth time in nine months. This divergence is attributed to differences in survey timing and company coverage, with the Caixin survey focusing on smaller, export-oriented firms. Despite the expansion in production, challenges remain, including a decline in new export orders, weak employment, and an intensifying price war that is squeezing profit margins.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has successfully pushed through significant housing reform legislation aimed at accelerating construction by reducing environmental review standards. By tying the legislation to the state budget, Newsom compelled lawmakers to pass bills that exempt most urban housing projects from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). This move sidestepped opposition from some labor groups by requiring union-level wages only for specific large-scale projects. Development experts believe these changes could be the most substantial reforms to CEQA in its history, potentially unlocking numerous stalled housing projects across the state to address its severe housing crisis.</p>

          <p>A top U.S. military commander has proposed reassigning some of the 4,000 California National Guard troops currently deployed in Los Angeles to help prepare for the state's wildfire season. The deployment, ordered by the Trump administration to address protests, has been controversial and legally challenged by California officials who warned it could impede wildfire response. The request from U.S. Northern Command suggests moving 200 Guard members from Los Angeles to wildfire duty elsewhere in the state. This comes as California anticipates an early and active fire season, with state officials previously noting that the Guard's firefighting force was understaffed due to the L.A. deployment.</p>

This type of low-level, horizontal cloud is detached from other cloud formations and appears to be rolling on a horizontal axis. The unusual and dramatic sight was captured in numerous photos and videos by amazed locals and tourists who were seeking relief from the high temperatures by the sea, prompting discussion among weather enthusiasts.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has identified a naturally occurring compound, betaine, which is produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise and may help slow the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine acts as a messenger that prevents inflammation and aging in multiple organs by inhibiting a specific enzyme. These findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms behind the anti-aging benefits of physical activity. The study suggests that simulating the effects of exercise, potentially through targeting this pathway, could lead to new anti-aging strategies.</p>
