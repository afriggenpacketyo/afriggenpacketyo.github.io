          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery announced it is expanding its strategic review and is now open to a sale after receiving unsolicited interest from multiple parties. This news caused the company's shares to jump significantly in premarket trading. The move comes as WBD continues to navigate financial challenges, including over $40 billion in debt from the 2022 merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery Inc. CEO David Zaslav stated the review aims to identify the best path to unlock the full value of the company's assets, while still proceeding with its previously announced plan to separate into two distinct companies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new medical technology combining a tiny implantable chip with specialized glasses has shown significant success in restoring central vision for patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In a multi-country trial, over 80% of participants experienced notable vision improvement, allowing them to read words and numbers again. The system works by using a camera on the glasses to transmit visual data to the chip implanted in the retina, which then converts the images into electrical signals for the brain. While the surgery is complex, the technology represents a major breakthrough for a leading cause of sight loss in older adults.</p>

          <p>Social Security recipients will continue to receive their monthly benefit checks during the U.S. government shutdown, as the program's funding is mandatory and not subject to annual appropriation battles. However, customer service functions at the Social Security Administration (SSA) could be significantly disrupted. With nearly 10% of its workforce expected to be furloughed, services such as benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and the issuance of replacement Medicare cards may be halted. Additionally, the shutdown could delay the release of key inflation data, potentially postponing the announcement of the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for beneficiaries.</p>

          <p>In an economic environment of persistent inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a way for savers to protect their money's buying power, with many accounts providing returns that outpace the current inflation rate. This article provides an overview of current national average CD rates for various terms, while noting that top online banks offer significantly higher rates. To secure the best returns, savers are advised to compare offers from online banks and consider short-term CDs, which currently feature higher yields due to an inverted yield curve.

          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and HELOCs present an affordable borrowing option compared to high-interest personal loans and credit cards. As of October 20, 2025, average rates for 10-year home equity loans are around 8.28%, while the average HELOC rate is 7.84%. Home equity loans offer a lump sum with a fixed rate, whereas HELOCs provide a variable-rate revolving line of credit. While these products offer lower rates and potential tax benefits, homeowners must remember that their property serves as collateral, risking foreclosure if payments are not made.

          <p>In southwest Madagascar, a region suffering from extreme poverty and collapsing coral reefs due to overfishing, a novel conservation project is building artificial reefs to restore fish populations. The initiative, led by the nonprofit Reef Doctor, aims to improve food security for coastal communities without imposing fishing restrictions, which have historically failed. By sinking limestone structures and seeding them with marine life, the project creates new habitats for fish, crabs, and other organisms. Researchers are studying the project's impact, viewing it as a public health intervention designed to link ecosystem restoration directly with improvements in human nutrition and well-being.</p>

The proposed reforms, expected to save firms nearly £6 billion annually, include simplifying the company merger process and removing lengthy reporting requirements for over 100,000 small businesses. The announcement comes ahead of next month's Budget and aims to make the UK a more attractive destination for global investment. However, business groups have expressed caution, stating the true test will be whether the government avoids raising employer taxes in the upcoming budget.</p>
