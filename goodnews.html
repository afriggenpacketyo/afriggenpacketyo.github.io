          <p>Canada has rescinded its planned Digital Services Tax on U.S. technology firms, paving the way for the resumption of trade talks with the United States. The move came after President Trump suspended negotiations, calling the tax a "blatant attack." The 3% levy would have retroactively hit major tech companies like Google and Amazon. This retreat is seen by some analysts as a victory for the White House and a way to advance negotiations on broader economic and security issues. (not investment advice)</p>

Violators of the ban face fines, although the current rules do not extend to e-cigarettes, a point of criticism for some who believe it weakens the measure's impact on youth.</p>

          <p>Homicide rates across the U.S. are experiencing a dramatic decline, with analyses showing a drop of at least 14% in 2024. While policing strategies contribute, researchers point to a broader primary driver: the societal recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The restoration of public services, community programs, and local government employment, all of which were severely disrupted in 2020, is believed to be a key factor in interrupting cycles of violence and reducing the number of murders.</p>

          <p>This story from the "My Unsung Hero" series recounts an act of kindness from 1990 that has stayed with Karen de Boer for over three decades. As a college freshman, she overslept and missed the bus for a crucial choir performance. Her hallmate Pam, with whom she had a tense relationship, offered to drive her an hour to the church. De Boer reflects on this unexpected gesture not just as a car ride, but as a profound gift of forgiveness that has influenced her life ever since.</p>

          <p>This article provides guidance from oncologists, patient advocates, and cancer survivors on how to effectively support a friend or loved one with a cancer diagnosis. Key advice includes the importance of simply reaching out, listening without offering comparisons or platitudes, and making specific, practical offers of help rather than a vague "let me know." Experts stress that social isolation is a common and painful side effect, and that continued support is vital even after treatment ends.</p>
