          <p>A dramatic rescue occurred at sea when a young child fell overboard from the Disney Dream cruise ship as it was returning to Florida. The child's father immediately jumped into the water after her, keeping her afloat until a rescue boat was launched from the ship. Passengers watched and cheered as the ship's crew swiftly retrieved both the father and child from the ocean within minutes. Disney Cruise Line commended its crew for their quick and effective response, highlighting the success of their safety protocols in ensuring the guests' safe return.</p>

          <p>As the Glastonbury Festival ends for another year, thousands of attendees have begun their journey home from Worthy Farm in Somerset. Following the final headline performance by Olivia Rodrigo, a large team of volunteers has commenced the extensive cleanup of the 900-acre site. Organizers have urged festival-goers to take all their belongings with them to minimize waste, a recurring issue from previous years. The site will now be prepared for a fallow year in 2026, with the next festival scheduled for 2027.</p>

          <p>Moderna announced that its experimental mRNA-based influenza vaccine demonstrated a stronger immune response than an existing flu shot in a late-stage clinical trial. The positive results are a significant step for the company, potentially leading to regulatory approval for the standalone flu vaccine. This success also clears a path for Moderna's combination vaccine, which targets both influenza and Covid-19 in a single shot. The company plans to file for approval for both products later this year, aiming to enter a multi-billion-dollar market and simplify vaccination for patients and healthcare providers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alexandra Horowitz, who leads the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, explains that understanding dogs requires appreciating their primary sense: smell. In an interview, she describes how dogs experience a world of information through their noses, perceiving time and space differently than visually-oriented humans. For a dog, the fading scent of its owner in a room is a way of marking the passage of time. Horowitz argues that by trying to understand this olfactory world, for instance by smelling what our dogs smell on a walk, we can move beyond our human-centric assumptions and appreciate the unique mystery of their experience.</p>

          <p>With its simple menu focused on chicken fingers, Raising Cane's has surpassed KFC in annual US sales to become the nation's number three chicken chain, behind only Chick-fil-A and Popeyes. The company's strategy of maintaining a limited menu and operating its own restaurants rather than franchising has fueled rapid growth, with system sales doubling since 2021 to $5.1 billion. Founder Todd Graves aims to make the chain a top 10 restaurant brand overall. The chain's success highlights a broader consumer trend towards chicken and the effectiveness of a focused, efficient operational model in a competitive fast-food market.</p>

          <p>Trade talks between Canada and the United States are set to resume after the Canadian government rescinded its planned Digital Services Tax on U.S. technology firms. The move came after President Trump called the tax a "blatant attack" and suspended negotiations. The 3% levy would have applied to revenue from Canadian users of companies like Google and Meta, creating a significant retroactive bill. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Trump spoke by phone, agreeing to restart negotiations toward a new economic and security relationship, with a Canadian official stating the tax's removal will allow for vital progress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study has identified a link between age-related hearing loss, or presbycusis, and a deficiency in a specific protein within the inner ear. Researchers, using single-cell resolution to study primate cochleae, characterized the cellular and molecular patterns of aging that lead to hearing decline. The study, published in Nature Aging, also found that the common diabetes medication metformin could slow the progression of this hearing loss in monkeys. These findings provide a new foundation for developing potential treatments and personalized medicine for one of the most common conditions affecting older adults.</p>

          <p>After decades of research, several companies, including Elon Musk's Neuralink and competitors like Synchron and Precision Neuroscience, are close to launching commercial brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). These surgically implanted devices are designed to help people who have lost the ability to move or speak by translating their brain signals into commands for a computer or smartphone. Early products will likely allow users with paralysis to control a cursor or generate synthesized speech with their thoughts. While Neuralink is the most well-known, other firms are using less invasive technologies that may gain FDA approval sooner, heralding a new industry for assistive technology.</p>

A government-backed foundation announced a project to use AI to revitalize 100 classic kung fu films, creating new animated versions and immersive experiences to reintroduce them to global audiences. This initiative highlights China's eagerness to leverage AI for cultural influence and technological advancement, even as it raises concerns in the U.S. about artistic integrity and potential job displacement.
