          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 23:55:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A massive spending bill championed by President Donald Trump has cleared a critical procedural vote in the U.S. Senate following a dramatic session with last-minute vote changes. The measure advanced 51-49 after several Republican holdouts reversed their opposition, narrowly avoiding the need for a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President. The bill now faces further debate, including a Democrat-forced full reading of the 940-page text, before a final vote on its passage can occur.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate voted to begin debate on a massive spending package after a tense, prolonged vote, though its final passage remains uncertain. The procedural motion succeeded only after a last-minute vote change by a Republican senator. In a separate development, a federal judge permanently blocked a Trump Administration executive order targeting the law firm Susman Godfrey, ruling the effort to punish firms representing the president's political enemies was blatantly unconstitutional and a threat to the rule of law.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new partnership with supermarkets and food manufacturers in England to encourage consumers to make healthier choices. Under the plan, retailers will voluntarily implement strategies such as offering promotions on healthy food or redesigning store layouts to help tackle rising obesity rates. While the government hopes this will improve national health and relieve pressure on the NHS, critics note the lack of specific targets and the mixed success of previous voluntary industry initiatives.</p>
