          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials have reached an agreement on a trade framework following high-level talks in London, awaiting approval from President Trump and President Xi. The agreement aims to implement the Geneva consensus and de-escalate trade tensions, which had escalated due to accusations of violating the Geneva trade agreement. If approved, the framework signals a commitment to continue dialogue, though the uncertainty of concrete agreements remains. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will brief President Trump on the deal. Optimism remains cautiously optimistic as both countries navigate complex trade dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Chancellor's Spending Review promises increased spending for Scotland in areas such as defense, computing, and carbon-capture technology. The review allocates ¬£250m for the Royal Navy's nuclear submarine base on the Clyde, ¬£750m for a supercomputer in Edinburgh, and funding for the Acorn Project in St Fergus, which focuses on carbon capture and storage. The review, covering the next few financial years, allocates day-to-day and capital spending, excluding funds spent by Holyrood. The Labour government is front-loading extra funds, but some departments may face real-term cuts as defense and the NHS take priority.</p>
