          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to cancel $2.2 billion in research funding for Harvard University, ruling the action was unlawful. U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs concluded that the administration used allegations of antisemitism on campus as a "smokescreen" to target the university for political reasons. While the judge's order restores the funding, she also noted in her decision that Harvard has been "plagued by antisemitism" and should have addressed the issue more effectively. The ruling safeguards critical research projects but also serves as a sharp critique of both the university's handling of campus climate and the administration's motives.</p>

          <p>Canadian tennis player Felix Auger-Aliassime has reached the semi-finals of a Grand Slam for the first time since 2021 after a hard-fought victory over Alex de Minaur at the US Open. Auger-Aliassime overcame a first-set loss to win the match 4-6, 7-6 (9-7), 7-5, 7-6 (7-4). The match was characterized by nerves from both players, featuring a high number of unforced errors and double faults. For Australia's de Minaur, the loss marks his sixth time reaching a Grand Slam quarter-final without being able to advance to the next stage.</p>

The company will open a tonic bar inside Kith Ivy, an exclusive new members-only lifestyle and fitness club located in the West Village. While in-person service will be restricted to club members, who reportedly pay a $36,000 initiation fee, other New Yorkers will be able to order drinks for delivery via Postmates and Uber Eats. This move marks a significant step for the luxury grocer as it tests the market beyond its established West Coast base.</p>

          <p>A renewed effort to prohibit members of Congress and their immediate families from owning or trading individual stocks is gaining traction with the introduction of a new bipartisan bill, the Restore Trust in Congress Act. The legislation combines several previous proposals and is supported by a diverse group of lawmakers, from progressive Democrats to conservative Republicans. The bill would mandate that lawmakers sell their individual stocks shortly after taking office and would impose a 10% penalty on any violations. Supporters are pushing for a floor vote by the end of the month, signaling that public pressure may be reaching a critical point for congressional leadership.</p>

The sale will be conducted at a $500 billion valuation, a substantial jump from the $300 billion valuation set during its last fundraising round. This type of transaction, known as a tender offer, provides liquidity for employees and early stakeholders without the company needing to go public. Notable investors participating in the purchase include SoftBank, Thrive Capital, and T. Rowe Price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An agreement has been negotiated to prevent approximately 98,000 voters in North Carolina from being removed from the rolls, marking a victory for Democrats and voting rights groups. The Justice Department had sued the state's board of elections to compel the removal of voters who registered without providing a driver's license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number. Under the new consent order, these voters will be allowed to cast a provisional ballot and provide the missing information at the polling place. The agreement, which still requires a judge's approval, settles the lawsuit and ensures the affected individuals can still participate in future elections.</p>

          <p>American Eagle's stock soared over 20% after the retailer reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations and highlighted the success of its recent marketing efforts. The company described its controversial but popular campaign with actress Sydney Sweeney as its "best" to date, noting it drove a significant uptick in customer engagement and sales. A partnership with Travis Kelce also proved highly successful, leading to increased brand awareness and new customer acquisition. In light of this positive momentum, the company re-issued its full-year guidance, now expecting comparable sales to be approximately flat, an improvement from previous forecasts.

          <p>Macy's stock price jumped 20% after the department store chain reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that significantly exceeded analyst expectations and raised its full-year financial guidance. The company attributed the strong performance to improved sales trends, particularly at its 125 revamped stores, and saw growth across its Macy's, Bloomingdale's, and Bluemercury brands. CEO Tony Spring noted that the consumer remains resilient and that the company is well-positioned to manage the impact of tariffs. The positive results mark a notable turnaround after the retailer had slashed its guidance in the previous quarter amid economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the price of gold surged to a new all-time high of around $3,549 per ounce, the value of physical gold investments, like the bars sold at Costco, has significantly increased. An ounce of gold purchased from the retailer in September 2024 for about $2,679 would now have an unrealized gain of approximately $870, representing a 32.5% increase in value. Investors are often drawn to gold during periods of economic uncertainty, and current momentum is fueled by inflation concerns and geopolitical tensions. However, sellers should expect to receive slightly less than the spot price from dealers and must account for taxes on their profits. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Paleontologists have gained new insights into a bizarre, heavily armored dinosaur named Spicomellus that lived over 165 million years ago in what is now Morocco. Recently unearthed remains reveal that the car-sized herbivore possessed an elaborate defense system, including three-foot-long neck spikes and ribs with spikes fused directly to the bone, a feature never before seen in any vertebrate. This discovery challenges previous understandings of ankylosaur evolution, suggesting their armor was more complex and developed earlier than previously thought. Scientists believe the elaborate spikes served a dual purpose for both defense against predators and attracting mates.</p>
