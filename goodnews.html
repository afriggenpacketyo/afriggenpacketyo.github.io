          <p>Columbia University has agreed to a $200 million settlement to resolve claims from the Trump administration that it discriminated against Jewish students. While not admitting wrongdoing, the university acknowledged that Jewish students and faculty have faced unacceptable incidents and that reforms are necessary. The agreement, which includes oversight by a federal monitor, will restore hundreds of millions in federal grants that had been threatened. The university will also provide certain information about foreign students to immigration authorities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite record-high median home prices, the U.S. housing market is showing early signs of a shift that could benefit homebuyers. According to real estate firm Redfin, there were 34% more sellers than buyers in May, the highest rate since 2013, leading to increased housing inventory. However, experts note it remains a seller's market overall, as homeowners with low interest rates are hesitant to sell, keeping prices elevated. For prospective buyers, this changing dynamic may present opportunities, especially for homes that have been on the market longer or require renovations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Browns' unveiling of a new alternate helmet took an unexpected turn when a videographer fell into Lake Erie during the presentation. The event, staged on a large float on the lake, was meant to showcase the new helmet design for the upcoming season. The videographer was quickly rescued with a flotation device and a jet ski, but the incident provided a moment of dark humor for a franchise often associated with misfortune. The article playfully speculates if the mishap could be an omen for the team's 2025 season, which is already clouded by pessimism.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice has issued a landmark advisory opinion stating that countries have a legal duty to prevent significant environmental harm from greenhouse gas emissions. This ruling, prompted by a campaign led by the island nation of Vanuatu, affirms that polluters can be held accountable under international law and may be required to pay reparations. While not legally binding, the decision is seen as a major victory for climate justice advocates and could set a powerful legal precedent for climate litigation worldwide. The court emphasized that existing treaties, including the Paris Agreement, impose strong obligations on nations to protect the climate.</p>

          <p>NASA has successfully launched two TRACERS satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket to study the interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. The mission aims to improve understanding and prediction of "space weather," which can disrupt GPS, communication satellites, and power grids on Earth. The twin spacecraft will fly in tandem, allowing for precise measurements of how energy from the sun couples with our planet's magnetosphere. The launch also deployed several other small satellites for various research purposes, including testing 5G communications in space and measuring Earth's energy balance.</p>

          <p>In a pair of significant legal rulings, a federal judge in Tennessee has ordered the release of Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia from criminal custody, while another judge in Maryland has barred ICE from immediately detaining him. The Maryland order requires the Trump administration to provide 72 hours' notice before any attempt to deport him to a third country. These decisions are a rebuke to the administration's previous actions, which included what a court called his unlawful deportation. Abrego Garcia, who faces human smuggling charges to which he has pleaded not guilty, will be returned to supervised release in Maryland.</p>

While the feature may result in longer wait times due to a smaller pool of female drivers, it can also be pre-booked.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The word "OK" is one of the most universally recognized terms on the planet, an American invention with a surprisingly playful history. Scholars trace its origin to a Boston newspaper in 1839, where it appeared as a joke abbreviation for a deliberate misspelling of "all correct" as "oll korrect." The term gained widespread popularity during President Martin Van Buren's 1840 reelection campaign, as his nickname "Old Kinderhook" conveniently matched the initials. Its simplicity and versatility made it perfect for the telegraph age and its use has since spread globally, becoming an indispensable part of modern communication.</p>
