          <h2>China's Exports Surge Despite US Tariffs, Fueled by Southeast Asian Demand</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 01:37:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced a surprising surge in April, growing by 8.1% year-over-year, despite the impact of US tariffs. This growth was primarily driven by a significant increase in shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which offset a sharp decline in exports to the United States. While exports to the US fell by over 21%, exports to ASEAN countries jumped by 20.8%, with Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand showing strong growth. Some analysts believe this surge may be due to transshipment through third countries or contracts signed before the tariffs were announced, anticipating a potential weakening in trade data in the coming months.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States, under President Trump, has shown a renewed interest in acquiring Greenland, driven by its strategic geographic location and the changing dynamics of the Arctic. Greenland's position makes it crucial for monitoring routes between Russia and the US, especially in the context of increasing global transport speeds. As the Arctic warms and becomes more accessible, Russia is expanding its presence and economic activities in the region, prompting the US to consider strengthening its own Arctic interests. The author suggests exploring a "Compact of Free Association" model, similar to agreements with Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau, to balance US interests with international concerns.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade deal with Britain, which aims to lower the burden of tariffs and potentially deliver a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The agreement includes increased access for US agricultural products to the UK market and reduced non-tariff barriers. However, the 10% tariff imposed on UK imports remains in place, with limited exceptions for vehicle imports. The deal is seen as a vindication of Starmer's approach to Trump and could boost trade between the two countries.</p>

Tungsten, known for its hardness and high melting point, is crucial for various industries, including defense and clean energy. China dominates the global tungsten mining industry.</p>

          <p>Some Chinese academics are calling for a revision of World War II history, advocating for the starting point to be shifted to 1931 with Japan's invasion of Manchuria, rather than Germany's 1939 invasion of Poland. They argue that this perspective would recognize China's significant role in the war against fascism. This year marks the 80th anniversary of the end of WWII, and the call for a revised historical narrative underscores the importance of acknowledging China's contributions.</p>

In return, the Trump administration has agreed to arrangements such as allowing Britain to export 100,000 cars per year into the U.S. market with only a 10 percent tariff, offering a partial exemption from his new 25 percent auto levies. Japan and the European Union on Thursday reaffirmed the importance of their collaboration in maintaining "free and rules-based multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core," at a time U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies are shaking global economies.</p>
