          <h2>Astronomers Discover Massive Planet Orbiting a Small Star, Challenging Planet Formation Theories</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 11:05:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international team of astronomers has discovered a massive gas giant planet, named TOI-6894b, orbiting a small red dwarf star, TOI-6894, which is only 20% the mass of our sun. This discovery is puzzling because current planet formation theories, such as core accretion, suggest that low-mass stars should not be able to host such large planets due to insufficient gas and dust. The planet, which has a radius slightly larger than Saturn but only half its mass, orbits its star in just over three days and is surprisingly cold at under 150 degrees Celsius. The James Webb Space Telescope is scheduled to observe the planet, which may reveal ammonia in its atmosphere, offering further insights into this intriguing celestial body. The optimism score for this discovery is relatively high due to the potential for groundbreaking findings about planet formation. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is urging continued surveillance of norovirus outbreaks due to the emergence of a new strain, GII.17, which drove an unusually early wave of infections last year. This new strain displaced the previously dominant GII.4 strain, raising concerns about whether norovirus season could begin earlier again this year. Several countries experienced shifted or larger waves of norovirus after GII.17 surged to dominance, but it remains uncertain if this trend will persist. The CDC is monitoring outbreaks through its CaliciNet laboratory database, and experts caution that there is no clear evidence proving GII.17's emergence caused the change in norovirus seasonality. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the future behavior of the virus and the need for continued monitoring.</p>

          <p>Liverpool Football Club is reportedly targeting Florian Wirtz and Milos Kerkez to bolster its squad, continuing a significant spending spree. Wirtz is seen as a key acquisition for new manager Slot, with Liverpool prepared to pay a club-record transfer fee for the German international. The club is also looking to strengthen its left-back position with the addition of Kerkez from Bournemouth, although no agreement has been reached yet. The potential arrival of Kerkez raises questions about the future of existing left-backs Andy Robertson and Konstantinos Tsimikas, with Tsimikas being the expected departure. The optimism score is high, reflecting the positive sentiment surrounding potential team improvements and new signings.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that leprosy existed in the Americas for thousands of years before European colonization, caused by a different bacteria species called Mycobacterium lepromatosis. Researchers analyzed ancient remains from Canada and Argentina, finding that the bacteria spread rapidly across the Americas. This discovery challenges the previous belief that Europeans brought leprosy to the Americas via Mycobacterium leprae. The findings highlight the complex relationship between pathogens and humans throughout history and may improve understanding of modern leprosy cases.

While some have welcomed the investment, others have raised concerns about the ongoing running costs of the new transport networks.
