          <p>King Charles is scheduled to deliver the Speech from the Throne in Canada, marking the opening of the 45th session of Canada's parliament, at the invitation of Prime Minister Mark Carney. This marks the first time a king has opened a new session of parliament and the first time any monarch has delivered the speech since 1977. Carney's invitation is seen as a strategic move to underscore Canada's sovereignty amidst strained relations with the United States under President Trump. The visit includes meetings with Canadian leaders and participation in ceremonial events, highlighting the enduring relationship between Canada and the Crown.</p>

          <p>An Austrian court overturned former Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's conviction for giving false testimony to a parliamentary inquiry. Kurz, a former rising star among European conservatives, had previously received an eight-month suspended jail sentence. The three-judge panel acquitted Kurz, who resigned as chancellor in 2021, after twice heading a governing coalition in Austria with different parties. Further details surrounding the case and the reasoning behind the acquittal are expected to emerge as the story develops.</p>

          <p>Ghost Town Village, formerly known as Ghost Town in the Sky, a wild-west themed amusement park in Maggie Valley, North Carolina, may be revived by a potential buyer from Florida. The current owner, Jill McClure, inherited the property and aims to sell it for entertainment purposes rather than housing. The potential buyer envisions a family-friendly venue featuring country music, rodeos, and festivals. The park has been closed since 2009 due to disrepair, infrastructure issues, and the decline in popularity of the "wild west" theme, and entering the abandoned property is illegal.</p>

Former players like Reggie Theus and Michael Ray Richardson emphasize the personal connections and hometown feel that smaller cities offer, contrasting it with the glitz and glamour of larger markets. While big markets attract free agents with nightlife and entertainment, small markets foster closer relationships among teammates and a unique connection with the local community.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article addresses the common misconception about shrimp being unhealthy due to its cholesterol content, explaining that dietary cholesterol has less impact on blood cholesterol levels for most people than saturated and trans fats. Shrimp is low in saturated fat and offers essential nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids, selenium, and vitamin B12. Eating one or two servings of shrimp per week can fit into a heart-healthy diet, especially when prepared in lighter ways such as grilling or saut√©ing with olive oil, rather than frying or drowning in creamy sauces. Consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice.</p>

          <p>Food apps that rate the healthfulness of packaged foods are increasingly popular, but nutrition experts advise using them with skepticism. While apps can help consumers decode nutrition labels and nudge them toward healthier choices, different apps may provide conflicting scores for the same product. Experts recommend opting for apps that assess overall nutrient content rather than focusing solely on individual ingredients, and to consider the amount of an ingredient rather than its mere presence. They also caution against overreacting to app ratings and suggest verifying information with ingredient lists and simple math to assess a food's healthfulness.</p>

The Justice Ministry's ordinance revision aligns the family registry with Japan's residence registry, a move welcomed by Taiwan and criticized by Beijing. People from Taiwan who previously registered their place of origin as China can now change it to Taiwan. This decision aims to avoid confusion associated with marriage or divorce between Japanese and foreigners and reflects Japan's non-governmental working relations with Taiwan.</p>

Opta's 'supercomputer' also failed to foresee Liverpool's victory, initially giving Manchester City an 82.2% chance of winning the title. Five BBC pundits, including Fara Williams, accurately predicted the top-four teams, but only one team, Chelsea, was in the correct position in those predictions.
