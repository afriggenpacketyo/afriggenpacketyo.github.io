        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that while parenthood gives life meaning, it does not necessarily increase life satisfaction, especially for mothers. The research, based on data from the European Social Survey, found that parents generally feel their lives are more fulfilled compared to childfree individuals, but their overall life satisfaction is often lower. The study also highlights that family policies and gender equality play a significant role in parental satisfaction, with Scandinavian countries showing smaller differences in satisfaction between parents and non-parents due to robust support systems. The findings suggest that societal support and equitable gender roles can greatly impact the well-being of parents. </p>
