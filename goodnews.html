          <p>Irish golfer Shane Lowry looks back on his triumphant 2019 Open win at Portrush, describing the 24 hours leading up to his final round as one of the toughest periods of his life. He credits his previous failure at the 2016 U.S. Open for teaching him to play aggressively to win, rather than passively trying not to lose. Lowry emphasizes the importance of celebrating major victories due to their difficulty and expresses that while he is content with his career, he remains driven to achieve more.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has indicated a readiness to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK job market shows further signs of slowing down. He stated his belief that the path for rates is downward, citing signs that businesses are adjusting employment and offering smaller pay rises. With the UK economy contracting in recent months and job vacancies falling, many economists now anticipate the Bank will cut its 4.25% rate at its upcoming meeting in August.

          <p>The price of Bitcoin has surged to a new record, breaking past the $122,000 mark in a rally fueled by significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This milestone is also supported by increasing institutional adoption and positive sentiment surrounding upcoming U.S. legislation aimed at providing a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets. Analysts suggest that long-term institutional buying could propel the cryptocurrency's value even higher, although potential U.S. Federal Reserve policy changes remain a risk.
