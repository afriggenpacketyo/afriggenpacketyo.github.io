          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was awarded the Charlemagne Prize in Aachen, Germany, for her role in maintaining European unity and resilience. The award recognizes her leadership during challenging times, including the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Von der Leyen's tenure hasn't been without controversy, as she faced criticism over transparency regarding text messages with Pfizer's CEO about vaccine procurement. She also faced scrutiny for awarding contracts without proper oversight during her time as Germany's defense minister, with some blaming her for inadequate improvements to the German military's readiness.</p>

          <p>A bill requiring the display of the Ten Commandments in Texas public school classrooms has been praised by 40 Days for Life President Shawn Carney as a step in the right direction. The bill, awaiting Governor Greg Abbott's signature, mandates that each classroom feature a legible copy of the Ten Commandments. Carney argues the commandments represent a foundational moral code and dismissed concerns about violating the First Amendment, referencing Moses in the U.S. Capitol. He frames the bill as a response to a secular mentality and hopes it will encourage greater moral formation nationwide.</p>

          <p>The Big Cat Sanctuary in Smarden, Kent, announced the birth of a rare snow leopard cub, nicknamed Little Lady, born on May 10th. The birth is the result of months of dedicated work by the sanctuary's primary trainer, Simon Jackaman, who built trust with the mother, Laila, enabling her to participate in ultrasound sessions voluntarily. Celebrity chef Paul Hollywood, a charity ambassador, expressed his heart-warming joy at Laila becoming a mother for the fourth time. The successful birth contributes to the conservation efforts for this endangered species.</p>

          <p>Nvidia shares experienced a significant jump in premarket trading following the company's strong earnings report, which sparked a rally in semiconductor stocks worldwide. Despite facing headwinds from U.S. export restrictions to China, Nvidia's positive financial results boosted investor confidence in the broader semiconductor industry. Companies like Tokyo Electron, SK Hynix, and ASML also saw gains, while Nvidia acknowledged a $4.5 billion write-off due to China export curbs. The U.S. continues to impose restrictions, requiring licenses for companies shipping goods to China, but Nvidia's earnings alleviated concerns about demand for its AI-related GPUs.</p>

          <p>Conflict resolution facilitator Priya Parker suggests using "magical questions" to cut through small talk and reveal people's personalities in group settings. These questions, designed to spark curiosity and elicit responses, help individuals feel like part of a group. Examples include asking about the first concert someone attended or a gift they deeply loved. Parker emphasizes the importance of attunement and presence when introducing these questions, advising people to "read the room" and be mindful of the context.</p>

          <p>Financial markets worldwide have responded positively to a U.S. court ruling that blocked President Donald Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs on imports. U.S. stock futures jumped, oil prices rose, and the U.S. dollar gained against the yen and euro. The court found that Trump exceeded his authority by invoking an emergency-powers law to justify the tariffs. While the White House has appealed the ruling, investors are taking heart after months of turmoil caused by Trump's trade war, hoping for a more stable economic environment.</p>

          <p>The UK government has detailed its plans for reforming the pension industry, including the creation of ¬£25 billion "megafunds" to boost economic growth. The plans involve consolidating local authority and defined contribution pension schemes, with a focus on local investments. While the government is using a voluntary agreement with pension firms, it is also introducing a legislative back-stop to ensure progress. The government claims these reforms will improve returns for workers and drive investment in clean energy and high-growth businesses. (not investment advice)</p>
