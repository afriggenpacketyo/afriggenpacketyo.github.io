        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS is exploring the potential of ketamine as a treatment for severe depression, with plans to establish a clinic offering the drug as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This move follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors. The initiative aims to provide an additional option for patients who have not responded to traditional treatments, though concerns remain about the drug's misuse and potential side effects. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the potential benefits of a new treatment option, but also the need for careful regulation and monitoring.</p>

The MSCI World index experienced only a slight decline, and safe havens traded mixed. Analysts suggest that the market sees the attack on Iran as a relief, reducing the nuclear threat in the region. While acknowledging the gravity of the situation, experts do not see it as a systemic risk to global markets.

          <p>NATO's ambitious goals for increased defense spending and troop levels are placing heavy demands on Germany's military, the Bundeswehr. While Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged financial resources, achieving the target of 5% of GDP for defense spending is a significant challenge. The Bundeswehr also needs to recruit tens of thousands of additional soldiers, with the potential reintroduction of compulsory military service under discussion. The article explores the implications of these goals for Germany's military capabilities and its role within NATO. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the potential for increased military strength, but also the challenges in meeting NATO's demands and the political debates surrounding defense spending.</p>
