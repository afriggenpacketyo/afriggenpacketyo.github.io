          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Columbia University pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, who was arrested by ICE agents in New York City in March. Judge Michael Farbiarz denied the government's motion to stay the ruling for seven days, asserting that the government failed to prove Khalil's release would cause irreparable harm or that he posed a flight risk. Khalil's attorney argued that his detention was retaliatory for his protected speech and viewpoint, referencing his leadership in Columbia's encampment protests against the war in Gaza. The ruling supersedes an immigration judge's decision in Louisiana to deny Khalil's asylum request and keep him detained. </p>
