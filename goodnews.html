          <p>Early in-person voting has commenced in New York and New Jersey for several closely watched elections, including the New York City mayoral race and the New Jersey gubernatorial contest. In New York, the mayoral race features Democrat Zohran Mamdani, Republican Curtis Sliwa, and independent candidate Andrew Cuomo, creating a contentious three-way battle. Meanwhile, New Jersey voters are deciding between Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli for governor.

          <p>Left-wing independent candidate Catherine Connolly is poised to become the next president of Ireland after her main rival, Heather Humphreys of Fine Gael, conceded the election. While vote counting is still ongoing, polls consistently showed strong support for Connolly, a 68-year-old former barrister and lawmaker. Known for her outspoken views, Connolly garnered backing from several left-leaning parties, including Sinn Féin. She will succeed Michael D. Higgins, who served the maximum two terms, and will become the third woman to hold the largely ceremonial but influential role.</p>

Glenn, who was in third place after the short program, delivered a strong free skate to move into the top spot. Her U.S. teammate, world champion Alysa Liu, finished in second place, marking her first time on a Grand Prix podium. The event is a key competition in the Grand Prix series leading up to the final in December and serves as a crucial test for skaters ahead of the upcoming Winter Olympics.</p>

          <p>The popular passive investment strategy of buying S&P 500 index ETFs, like Vanguard's VOO, is reportedly losing some of its appeal among investors seeking better diversification. Financial experts note that the S&P 500 has become heavily concentrated, with the technology sector now accounting for over 35% of the index. In response, some traders are turning their attention to small-cap stocks, as seen in the recent record highs of the Russell 2000 index. This shift suggests a broadening of investment interest beyond the large-cap tech giants that have dominated the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese state media has emphasized President Xi Jinping's direct and personal leadership in drafting the country's upcoming 15th five-year plan. According to reports from Xinhua and People's Daily, Xi personally headed the drafting team, pouring "a great deal of heart and blood" into the process and playing a "decisive role." This narrative highlights Xi's consolidation of power and central role in shaping China's future economic and social development. The plan was reportedly based on extensive investigations during his tours across the country and underwent multiple revisions by the Politburo Standing Committee.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, former Vice President Kamala Harris suggested she is considering another run for the presidency in 2028, stating that her political career is "not done." While not making a formal decision, she expressed confidence that a woman will eventually be president and dismissed current polls that show her with low favorability. Harris also used the interview to criticize President Trump, labeling him a "tyrant" who is weaponizing the justice system. Her comments, made during an international tour for her book, are the clearest indication yet of her future political ambitions.</p>

          <p>A certified child life specialist and licensed therapist advises parents on how to say "no" to children in a way that fosters connection rather than conflict. The article suggests turning "no" into a teachable moment by providing alternatives, such as saying "gentle hands" instead of just "stop." Explaining the reasoning behind rules, offering choices within set limits, and maintaining consistency are also key strategies. By using boundaries to teach emotional regulation and self-control, parents can build trust and help children develop crucial life skills that extend far beyond their childhood years.</p>

          <p>With an early flu season underway in England, the National Health Service (NHS) is urging parents to get their children vaccinated, especially during the half-term school break. Health officials report that flu cases and hospitalizations are increasing, particularly among children, who are considered significant spreaders of the virus. Most children are offered a quick and painless nasal spray vaccine. The vaccination campaign aims to protect children from serious illness and reduce the overall community spread of the virus, which health experts warn can be unpredictable and deadly.</p>

          <p>Two-time Olympic soccer gold medalist Abby Wambach offers unconventional parenting advice, urging parents not to attend their children's sports practices. She argues that a parent's absence allows children to develop internal motivation, resilience, and the freedom to take risks and make mistakes without feeling watched. By not being present, parents can avoid inadvertently making their children's motivation dependent on external approval. Wambach suggests this approach helps kids become self-starters, a valuable trait for success later in life, and encourages parents to focus on sportsmanship over performance during games.</p>

          <p>A surge in gold prices, up over 50% in the last year, is reigniting a modern-day gold rush in California's rivers. Prospectors are finding gold dust, flakes, and even nuggets in areas made more accessible by low water levels, echoing the state's famous 19th-century history. One builder, Manny Goza, claims to have paid for his house with gold he found over several years. While the work is grueling and returns are uncertain, the allure of striking it rich is drawing renewed attention, supported by financial titans who are also advocating for gold as a key portfolio diversifier.
