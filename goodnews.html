        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by researchers at the Tokyo University of Agriculture suggests that cats use their sense of smell to distinguish their owners from strangers. The research found that cats spent twice as long smelling samples from strangers compared to their owners and favored their right nostrils when sniffing strangers' scents. Personality traits also influenced how cats interacted with odors, with neurotic male cats repeatedly returning to smell tubes. While the study suggests a cat's sense of smell aids in recognizing humans, it does not conclude that smell is the most important mechanism.</p>
