        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) reveals a significant global decline in fertility rates, with many individuals unable to have their desired number of children due to financial constraints and lack of suitable partners. The UNFPA surveyed 14,000 people across 14 countries, finding that one in five respondents have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children. Financial limitations were cited by 39% of respondents as a barrier to parenthood, with the highest response in Korea (58%) and the lowest in Sweden (19%). The agency is shifting focus to address low fertility issues, recognizing the real crisis is people being unable to create the families they want.</p>

          <p>The UK government has pledged ¬£14.2 billion towards the construction of the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk, aiming to boost economic growth and transition to clean energy. The project is expected to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes, aligning with the government's goal to eliminate fossil fuels from the energy grid by 2030. However, critics like Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C, condemn the investment, arguing it's a costly mistake that will burden consumers and divert funds from other priorities. The investment decision is the latest in a series of announcements ahead of the government's Spending Review.</p>
