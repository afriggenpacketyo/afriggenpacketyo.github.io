          <p>Donald Trump is spending the second day of his visit to Scotland on his Turnberry golf course amidst a significant security presence. His trip also includes scheduled meetings with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to discuss transatlantic trade, as well as UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney. While the visit has drawn protests, it is focused on both personal leisure and key diplomatic discussions regarding trade tariffs and international issues like the situation in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Two years after initiating a contentious divorce, "Real Housewives of Atlanta" personality Kim Zolciak and former NFL player Kroy Biermann are rebuilding their lives separately. Biermann has transitioned from professional sports to a new career in crane and rigging sales in Atlanta. Meanwhile, Zolciak has moved into a new home, announced new television projects, and has reportedly reconnected with her parents after a long estrangement. The developments suggest a new chapter for both individuals following a prolonged and public separation.</p>

          <p>China has identified a new, super-large zirconium deposit, which is estimated to contain around 2 million tonnes of zirconium dioxide. This significant discovery, the first of its kind in a terrestrial basin in the country, effectively increases China's total reserves of the mineral by a factor of five. Zirconium is a critical material for advanced technologies, particularly in the manufacturing of components for hypersonic weapons like scramjet engines and thermal protection systems. The find could have major implications for the country's strategic and military manufacturing capabilities.</p>

Described by her players as calm, direct, and emotionally intelligent, she balances a ruthless desire to win with a protective, maternal approach to her team. Her tactical pragmatism, consistency in selection, and ability to handle pressure have been hallmarks of her tenures with both the Netherlands and England. Wiegman's leadership, which combines tactical acumen with a deep understanding of the human side of management, is credited as a primary reason for her teams' consistent success.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Examine Why U.S. Stock Market Reaches Record Highs Amid Tariff Threats</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread concern over President Trump's threatened tariffs, U.S. stock markets like the S&P 500 have been surging to record highs. This analysis suggests the rally is driven by several factors, including a more resilient economy and better-than-feared corporate earnings reports. Furthermore, many investors seem to believe in the "TACO trade" (Trump Always Chickens Out), speculating that the president's eventual actions on tariffs will be less severe than his initial threats. While this has buoyed the market, some experts remain cautious, warning that higher import costs will eventually impact the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the wake of Paramount-owned CBS cancelling "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," prominent comedians have launched a potent satirical counter-offensive. Jon Stewart on "The Daily Show" and the creators of "South Park" delivered sharp commentary questioning the motives behind the cancellation, which some see as a politically-driven move to silence a Trump critic. Colbert himself has also used his monologue to push back, promising his "gloves are off" for his remaining time on air. The response demonstrates how satirists can use their platforms to directly challenge corporate and political pressures in real time.</p>
