        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A second man has been charged with conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life, following fires at properties linked to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The charges relate to a vehicle fire and fires at two addresses, one being Starmer's private home and another his former residence. Stanislav Carpiuc, a Romanian national, is accused of conspiring with Roman Lavrynovych, a Ukrainian national, to damage property by fire, potentially endangering lives. Lavrynovych previously denied similar charges, and Carpiuc has been remanded in custody until their joint appearance at the Old Bailey. Relevant context includes that the fires occurred at properties linked to the Prime Minister, raising concerns about potential political motivations.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's CFO, Ted Decker, announced that the retailer does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, leveraging its scale and supplier partnerships to absorb potential cost increases. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's anticipated price hikes in response to tariffs. Home Depot reaffirmed its full-year sales forecast, anticipating a 2.8% growth in total sales and a 1% increase in comparable sales. Decker noted that Home Depot has diversified its import sources, reducing reliance on any single country outside the U.S. to below 10% by next year, and also mentioned that the company caters to a more affluent U.S. consumer who tends to be employed and to have benefited from the sharp increase of property values since 2019.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has secured trade deals with the European Union and the United States, demonstrating Britain's ability to engage with both major trade partners post-Brexit. However, these agreements required concessions, reflecting Britain's diminished position and the challenges of operating between global trading blocs. While the EU deal could generate significant benefits by 2040, it adds only marginally to Britain's GDP, whereas Brexit had a far greater negative impact. To finalize these deals, Starmer allowed European trawlers to fish in British waters and granted greater access to American agricultural products.</p>

While widespread support from Democrats is expected, the bill faces challenges in passing due to Republican control of Congress.

          <p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has issued new recommendations urging doctors to treat pain during in-office gynecological procedures, such as IUD insertions and cervical biopsies. ACOG directs clinicians to have "upfront and thorough" conversations with patients about potential pain and offer pain management options, such as a paracervical block. The new guidelines seek to prevent negative experiences that can lead to patient distrust and worsen pain. The guidelines also acknowledge historical inequalities in treating pain, noting that Black patients and women have historically received less analgesia.</p>

          <p>Axial Seamount, an active undersea volcano off the Pacific Coast, could erupt by the end of this year, according to scientists. Located about 700 miles northwest of San Francisco, the volcano has erupted three times since its discovery and is the best-monitored underwater volcano in the world. Eruptions at Axial Seamount are not explosive and pose no tsunami risk, but they offer scientists an opportunity to predict volcanic eruptions weeks to months in advance. The volcano inflates between eruptions, and scientists expect it to erupt again based on the current rate of inflation.</p>

          <p>A California appeals court has ruled that the Temecula school district must immediately set aside its ban on critical race theory while litigation proceeds. The court found the ban unconstitutionally vague, as it employed ambiguous language and lacked definitions, potentially causing teachers to self-censor. The appeals panel reversed the trial court's ruling, stating that the resolution was unclear in scope and irreconcilable with state-mandated educational requirements. A separate part of the lawsuit, regarding parent notification of gender identity issues, was deemed no longer relevant due to state law.</p>
