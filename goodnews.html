          <p>David H. Souter, a Republican appointed to the Supreme Court by President George H.W. Bush, passed away at 85, after serving 19 years. Initially viewed as a conservative, Souter surprised many by becoming a key member of the court's liberal wing, disappointing conservatives who had hoped for a reliable right-wing vote. The article highlights his preference for solitude and intellectual pursuits over Washington's social scene, ultimately leading to his early retirement to return to New Hampshire. During his time on the court, Justice Souter emphasized the importance of courts accepting their responsibility for creating a just society and viewed the Constitution as a charter of ordered liberty whose meaning could evolve over time. Justice Souter's passing marks the end of a life dedicated to public service and intellectual rigor, remembered for his independent thought and commitment to the rule of law.</p>

          <p>The Costume Institute's new exhibition, "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style," curated by Monica L. Miller and Andrew Bolton, examines 300 years of Black sartorial history. The exhibition showcases garments, accessories, paintings, videos, and sketches, juxtaposing contemporary designs from brands with Black leadership, such as Louis Vuitton and Balmain, with historical pieces. The article highlights the exhibition's exploration of how clothing has been used by Black individuals as a tool for expression, resistance, and identity formation, particularly in the face of historical oppression and cultural appropriation. The review emphasizes the exhibit's success in illustrating how Black Americans have transformed garments into symbols of success and cultural innovation, reclaiming and remixing styles to assert their identity and freedom.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK and the US have reached an agreement to reduce tariffs on certain goods traded between the two countries, including cars, steel, and aluminum, although most UK goods entering the US will still be subject to President Trump's blanket 10% tariffs. The deal cuts tariffs on cars to 10% for a limited quota, scraps tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the US, and opens the UK market to US beef and ethanol. However, the UK's 2% digital services tax remains a point of contention, and what will be agreed on pharmaceuticals is still unknown. The UK government said it had agreed to work on a digital trade deal, but the US government said it was disappointed that the UK was unwilling to fully address the tax.</p>

          <p>Following a recent trade deal between the UK and the US, the government has assured the public that hormone-treated beef from the US will not be allowed into the UK market. The government insists that existing food standards will remain unchanged and that border checks will be implemented to test for hormone traces in meat. The UK stopped allowing hormone-produced beef in 1989, when the practice was banned across the EU after it declared it unsafe. The trade deal includes an agreement for the UK to allow up to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef imports from the US tariff-free, and in exchange, the UK will also be able to sell more beef to the US at a lower tariff.</p>
