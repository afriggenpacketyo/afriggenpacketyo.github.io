          <p>Dan Richards contrasts the diverging paths of night train travel in Europe and the United States, noting Europe's renaissance of sleeper trains driven by climate concerns and the EU's plans to expand high-speed rail. The article criticizes America's car-centric culture and underinvestment in public transportation, leading to congestion and mental health issues. The author advocates for revitalized railways as a sustainable alternative, emphasizing the community and connection fostered by train travel. The piece argues that America's focus on niche transportation projects distracts from the need for consistent vision, funding, and nationwide rollout of proven transit systems.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to fund infrastructure projects in Africa, marking a shift from direct government loans under the Belt and Road Initiative. This model involves granting Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for construction financing. The shift is evident in projects like Nairobi‚Äôs mega-highway and Zambia‚Äôs Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway. During Kenyan President William Ruto‚Äôs visit to China, he sought PPP funding to extend the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to the Ugandan border, with Chinese firms contributing 40% of the cost and gaining exclusive operating rights for 25 years.</p>
