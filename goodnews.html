          <p>President Trump displayed a trade agreement with the United Kingdom at the G7 summit, standing alongside Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The agreement, signed with the U.K., was briefly dropped by Trump, who jokingly blamed the wind, and the White House later clarified that the agreement was indeed with the United Kingdom. When questioned about differences between this agreement and one signed in May, Trump said there weren't many, and he praised Starmer's performance as Prime Minister. The agreement includes details on steel and aluminum, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick determining quotas for tariff-free entry. Despite the minor mishap, the event highlighted ongoing trade relations between the U.S. and the U.K.</p>

          <p>Zhang Chaoyang, a pioneer of the Chinese internet, is advising college graduates to consider starting businesses instead of pursuing graduate degrees. Citing his personal experience, Zhang suggested that his postgraduate degree did not significantly contribute to establishing and managing his company. He proposed that graduates gain practical know-how by working at a company before venturing into entrepreneurship. Zhang obtained a PhD in physics from MIT and founded Internet Technologies China, later known as Sohu.com, which became the first mainland internet company to secure venture capital funding.</p>

          <p>The Edmonton Oilers are traveling to Miami, hoping to end Canada's Stanley Cup drought, which dates back to 1993. Despite Canadians making up about 40% of NHL players, American teams have dominated the league's top prize for over three decades. The Oilers face concerns about history repeating itself after a recent loss to the Florida Panthers gave the Panthers a series lead. The repeated losses have united Canadians, with many rallying behind the Oilers as "Canada's team," especially amid heightened tensions between Canada and the US. The outcome of the series is seen as a symbolic victory for either nation.</p>

          <p>The Arizona Humane Society (AHS) rescued a pit bull terrier named Rainbow Brite, found painted to resemble a leopard, along with her nine puppies. The dogs were discovered tethered outdoors in 99-degree weather, prompting a call to AHS. Rainbow Brite's owner surrendered the dogs, stating they could no longer care for them. The shelter stabilized Rainbow Brite and transferred her and her puppies to a calming space dedicated to pregnant and nursing dogs. The animal family will soon be available for adoption, after they are spayed/neutered, vaccinated and found new homes.</p>

          <p>A Shell survey reveals that drivers are becoming more reluctant to switch to electric vehicles (EVs), with the trend more pronounced in Europe than in the United States. The main obstacle is cost, with EVs being up to 30% more expensive than internal combustion engine cars. In Europe, 41% of respondents said they would consider switching to an electric car, compared to 48% last year, while in the United States, the number fell to 31%. The survey also indicated that European drivers are less satisfied with the pace of improvement in public charging infrastructure compared to drivers in China and the United States.

Summer is peak season at Yosemite, with many campgrounds opening in the next few weeks. The reservation system, introduced in 2020, was temporarily halted earlier this year but has since been reinstated, although reservations fill up very quickly.</p>

The LAPD will maintain a strong presence in the downtown area to ensure the safety of residents, businesses, and demonstrators. This change reflects a shift towards normalcy after days of unrest.</p>

          <p>With the Biden administration declaring Juneteenth a national holiday just four years ago, the bill had sailed through Congress with very little opposition. The holiday became part of a wider nationwide movement of diversity, equity and inclusion efforts across the government, academia and even in commerce. Now, under President Trump many of those initiatives have been banned or rolled back. NPR is asking its audience what it means to be celebrating the holiday at this moment in history.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration's termination of over $1 billion in research grants at the National Institutes of Health was "void and illegal." The judge stated that the cuts, targeting research with perceived connections to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), represented unlawful discrimination. The judge ordered that previously awarded grants be reinstated to the organizations and states that filed the lawsuit. The move came amid efforts to cut 10,000 jobs from federal health agencies. The ruling only applies to some of the grants mentioned in the lawsuit, with further claims to be decided after additional evidence is presented.</p>
