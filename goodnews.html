          <p>China is initiating recruitment programs aimed at attracting Chinese-born researchers currently working in the United States, offering competitive postdoctoral positions with salaries approaching $100,000 per year for three years. This initiative comes amid funding cuts and perceived declining academic freedom in the US, particularly following Donald Trump's return to the White House. The offers are designed to appeal to researchers considering returning to China due to financial and political challenges in the US, with some scientists already making moves to finalize their decisions. The programs reflect China's effort to bolster its scientific capabilities by leveraging talent abroad.</p>

          <p>Despite recent investment deals between the US and Saudi Arabia, China's established position in the region remains strong as the two economic giants vie for influence. China's prowess in manufacturing and infrastructure building continues to be formidable amid intensifying competition in the Gulf's hi-tech sectors. Analysts suggest that while the US aims to strengthen its relationship with Gulf states, China's deep entrenchment ensures that the competition for influence ultimately benefits Saudi Arabia.

The judge cited the need to disrupt the chilling effect on protected speech, noting that the government did not provide sufficient evidence for its claims. Khan Suri, a citizen of India, was targeted for his pro-Palestinian activism, with immigration officials revoking his J-1 student visa based on alleged ties between his father-in-law and Hamas.

Carney stated that the invitation did not help Canadians, who were facing comments from Trump about making Canada the 51st US state. Carney emphasized that Canada is "not for sale, ever" and highlighted the importance of reaffirming Canada's sovereignty, noting that his invitation for King Charles III to attend the opening of Canada's Parliament was intentional.</p>

The move aims to attract more moviegoers as the box office recovers from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. AMC CEO Adam Aron cited improved box-office results in the fiscal second quarter as the reason for implementing the discount. The initiative will test whether it cannibalizes higher-priced attendance on other days, and could help drive attendance, increase concession sales and expose audiences to trailers for new films.</p>
