          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, formed over the central Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday. Forecasters predict the system will remain over open waters for several days, potentially intensifying into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend. While its current track carries it north of the Caribbean, it could reach Bermuda next week. The National Hurricane Center notes high uncertainty in its path, but officials at NOAA had previously predicted a busier-than-average season.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index reached a new record high on Thursday, driven by real estate and technology sectors, while other Asia-Pacific markets showed mixed trading. This followed the Federal Reserve's expected benchmark rate cut on Wednesday, framed by Chairman Jerome Powell as a "risk management cut." The Fed indicated potential for two more cuts this year, with additional reductions in 2026 and 2027. HSBC anticipates the Bank of Japan will maintain steady policy rates but forecasts a 25 basis point hike in October. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the U.S. Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of the year, analysts anticipate China's central bank will likely pursue only moderate easing despite increased room for action. On Thursday, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the yuan's midpoint rate at 7.1085 against the U.S. dollar, a slight depreciation. Experts suggest the PBOC's slower rate cut pace compared to the Fed will narrow the interest rate gap, easing capital outflow pressures and supporting the yuan. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite his name appearing on prospective coaching lists, Lynn signed a contract extension with USC in January, making him one of college football's highest-paid assistants.

          <p>Northrop Grumman's Cygnus XL cargo ship, carrying over 11,000 pounds of supplies, is scheduled to rendezvous with the International Space Station on Thursday morning. This comes after two premature engine shutdowns on Tuesday, caused by a conservative safeguard in the software settings, which forced a delay. NASA announced the issue has been resolved, and astronaut Jonny Kim will use the station's robotic arm to capture the upgraded cargo ship. This mission marks the maiden flight of the larger Cygnus XL, designed to deliver significantly more cargo.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume naturally fermented fruit with an alcohol content equivalent to nearly two human alcoholic beverages per day. Scientists measured the alcohol in the fruit chimps eat, finding an average of 0.3% by weight. While chimps don't get drunk, this steady low dose supports the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, suggesting primates' attraction to alcohol stems from ancestral fruit-eating habits. This article highlights that other animals also seek this natural buzz, connecting human alcohol preference to evolutionary dietary patterns.</p>
