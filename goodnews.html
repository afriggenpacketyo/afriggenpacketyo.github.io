          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 04:52:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed a plan that would allow banks and card providers to set their own limits for contactless payments, potentially removing the current £100 cap. This change would align traditional card payments with digital wallets on smartphones, which already have no transaction limit. While the move is intended to reduce 'payment friction' for larger purchases like a big grocery shop, it has raised concerns about fraud among some consumers. The FCA has stated that providers would be liable for any fraudulent losses and would be expected to have robust risk-prevention systems in place.</p>

          <p>Following Angela Rayner's resignation over a tax dispute, the race to become the next deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party is underway. Several prominent MPs have declared their candidacy, including Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, left-wing MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy, and former Commons leader Lucy Powell. Each candidate is presenting a different vision for the party's future, from uniting the broad voter coalition to advocating for a change in the government's direction. The winner will be chosen by a vote of party members and announced on October 25th, shaping the future leadership dynamic of the ruling party.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The chief inspector of constabulary for England and Wales has called for police to stop recording 'non-crime hate incidents,' arguing the current practice places officers in an 'invidious position' regarding free speech. Sir Andy Cooke stated that police should focus on criminality and separate what is offensive from what is illegal, suggesting intelligence can be gathered in other ways. This recommendation comes after public debate over several high-profile cases where individuals were visited by police for social media posts that did not break the law, raising concerns about a chilling effect on open expression.</p>

This strong performance reassured investors who had been concerned by weaker-than-expected sales in the previous quarter. Analysts noted the report demonstrated a 'meaningful acceleration' in the company's trading momentum. The positive news from the fast-fashion giant helped lift European stock markets more broadly on Wednesday. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team at the Chinese University of Hong Kong has developed an AI-automated robotic arm designed to act as a 'third hand' for surgeons during operations. The system can perform routine tasks such as retracting tissue, picking up gauze, and clipping blood vessels, allowing the human surgeon to focus on more critical aspects of the procedure. This innovation is intended to help alleviate the strain on surgeons caused by a growing clinical demand from an aging population and could potentially reduce wait times for operations by increasing surgical efficiency.</p>

          <p>Despite a string of poor results in the Premier League, an analysis of Manchester United's underlying statistics suggests their performances have been stronger than their points tally reflects. The team has taken the most shots in the league over the last 10 games while conceding among the fewest. However, they have been highly inefficient, scoring seven goals fewer than expected and conceding four more, based on the quality of chances. This data points towards issues with player finishing and goalkeeping, or simply bad luck, rather than a fundamental failure of the team's tactical system.</p>
