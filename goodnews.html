          <p>A small meteorite that crashed through a homeowner's roof in McDonough, Georgia, has been identified as being 4.56 billion years old, predating Earth by about 20 million years. A University of Georgia geologist analyzed the fragments, tracing their origin to the breakup of a large asteroid between Mars and Jupiter 470 million years ago. This marks the 27th meteorite recovered in Georgia, with scientists proposing to name it the McDonough Meteorite after the city it landed in.</p>

The tech giant's success came after it pledged an additional $100 billion in U.S. investments, securing an exemption from President Trump's newly announced 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. The week's market movements were heavily influenced by tariff news, including a 25% increase on India's tariff rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has detected North Korea removing some of its propaganda loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border, a potential sign of de-escalation. The move follows South Korea's own dismantling of its speakers, which had broadcast anti-Pyongyang messages and K-pop songs across the border. These psychological warfare tactics had recently intensified tensions, and their removal could be a step toward easing friction, though the North's intentions remain unconfirmed and future military drills could reignite hostilities.</p>

          <p>A development team has invested over $104 million to convert the abandoned 19th-century St. John's College campus in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood into a luxury apartment building. The project, named The Hartby, preserves the historic structure's architectural bones while creating 205 modern units, including 62 designated for affordable housing. The developers secured a 99-year ground lease from the adjacent church, turning a derelict property into a source of income for the church and new housing for the community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Australian scientist, Karl Kruszelnicki, reiterates the long-held scientific view that there is no mystery behind the Bermuda Triangle. He argues that the high volume of air and sea traffic in the notoriously tricky-to-navigate area means that, on a percentage basis, the number of disappearances is not unusual. This explanation, supported by institutions like NOAA and Lloyd's of London, points to a combination of violent weather, navigational challenges, and human fallibility, rather than any supernatural phenomena.</p>

Speaking at a panel, she shared her personal experience of realizing her own phone habits were mirrored by her kids, leading to a loss of connection. Robbins advises parents to create physical distance from their devices and get curious about their children's online activities rather than being judgmental, fostering better phone-life balance.</p>

          <p>According to a new Charles Schwab survey, Americans believe a net worth of $2.3 million is required to be considered wealthy in 2025, a decrease from last year's $2.5 million benchmark. The amount varies significantly by region, with residents in the West citing a $3 million threshold, while those in the South believe $1.8 million is sufficient. Despite the lower national figure, nearly two-thirds of respondents feel that achieving wealth is harder now due to inflation and economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>
