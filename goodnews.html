          <p>A New York appellate court has nullified the nearly half-billion-dollar penalty imposed on Donald Trump in his civil fraud case. The judges ruled that while Trump was liable for inflating property values to secure loans, the fine was excessive and potentially unconstitutional. This decision is a significant legal victory for Trump, who hailed it as a "total victory" against a "Political Witch Hunt." However, the court upheld non-monetary penalties, including a ban on Trump serving as a company director in New York for three years.</p>

          <p>Ghanaian dancehall artist Shatta Wale, whose real name is Charles Nii Armah Mensah, was granted bail after being taken into custody for questioning about a Lamborghini Urus. The investigation, led by Ghana's Economic and Organized Crime Office (EOCO), is linked to a US probe into a crime network. The vehicle was allegedly purchased with proceeds from a $4 million crime involving a Ghanaian national currently jailed in the US. Wale claims he bought the car for $150,000 from an unknown individual and denies any connection to the convicted criminal.</p>

          <p>Apple has raised the monthly subscription price for its Apple TV+ streaming service to $12.99 in the U.S. and other markets, a $3 increase. This marks the third price hike for the service since its launch in 2019 at $4.99 per month. The move follows similar price increases from competitors like Netflix and Peacock as streaming companies seek greater profitability amid rising content production costs. While Apple does not release viewership numbers, reports suggest the service has been operating at a significant financial loss despite growing its subscriber base.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As interest rates remain elevated, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) continue to be an attractive option for savers seeking stable, predictable returns without market risk. This article outlines the potential earnings on a $25,000 deposit across various CD terms, from a 3-month CD yielding around $269 to a 5-year CD earning about $5,250 at current top rates. Unlike savings accounts with variable rates, a CD's interest rate is fixed for its entire term, offering protection against rate declines. The choice of term depends on the saver's financial goals and how long they can afford to lock away their funds. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. increased by 2% in July from the previous month, defying expectations of a decline. The rise is attributed to a slight dip in mortgage rates during May and June when these sales contracts were likely signed. Housing inventory also grew by nearly 16% year-over-year, reaching its highest level since May 2020, which is helping to ease pressure on prices. The median home price saw a marginal annual increase of 0.2%, suggesting the market may be reaching an inflection point with affordability showing slight improvement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent fundraiser popularized the concept of "moral offsetting," where individuals who eat meat donate to anti-factory farming charities to counteract the harm of their consumption. The organization FarmKind promotes this idea, likening it to carbon offsets and calculating that a $23 monthly donation can offset the suffering of the average American's annual meat consumption. The strategy is rooted in pragmatism, acknowledging that few people are willing to go vegan but may be willing to contribute financially to improving animal welfare. However, the article explores the ethical debate surrounding this approach.</p>

          <p>This article examines the Baha'i faith as a source of practical wisdom for achieving happiness, regardless of one's own religious beliefs. Originating in 19th-century Persia, the faith emphasizes principles such as finding purpose in adversity, seeking spiritual over physical happiness, and understanding that serving others is key to one's own well-being. The author distills five key lessons from Baha'i teachings, including embracing discomfort as a catalyst for growth and trusting in a positive future. The piece suggests these tenets offer a robust alternative to modern, transient self-help trends.</p>

          <p>Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic exposed the continent's heavy reliance on imported vaccines, Africa is slowly building its own pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity. New facilities are being established in countries like South Africa, Senegal, Rwanda, and Kenya, aiming to produce vaccines for diseases such as yellow fever, malaria, and cholera. Despite this progress and renewed political commitment, Africa still produces only 0.1% of the world's vaccines. Initiatives like the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA) are being launched to provide funding and help local producers become competitive over the next decade.</p>

          <p>Ethel Caterham, a British woman recognized as the world's oldest living person, celebrated her 116th birthday on Thursday. Born in 1909, she is the last living subject of King Edward VII and has lived through two World Wars and the COVID-19 pandemic. Caterham, who resides in a care home in Surrey, was marking the occasion quietly with her family. She inherited the title of world's oldest person in April following the death of the previous holder. When asked previously about her secret to longevity, she credited it to never arguing with anyone.</p>

          <p>The European Union and the United States have outlined a framework trade deal that will set a 15% tariff on approximately 70% of EU exports to the U.S., including cars, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors. This rate is significantly lower than the 30% President Trump had previously threatened but higher than the pre-existing 2.5% tariff. The deal also includes a commitment from the EU to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy products by 2028. However, Europe's wine and spirits industry was not granted an exemption, a point of major disappointment for producers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an interview, writer-director Alex Russell discusses his first feature film, "Lurker," which explores the toxic dynamics of obsessive fandom and male social hierarchies. The movie centers on the relationship between a rising music star and a fan who dangerously integrates himself into the artist's inner circle. Russell, who also wrote for shows like "Beef" and "The Bear," explains that he drew on his own experiences as an outsider to craft the story. He aimed to create a film that examines the unspoken jealousies between men and the unsettling nature of seeking validation.</p>

          <h2>US-EU Trade Deal Caps Tariffs on Pharmaceuticals and Semiconductors at 15%</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 11:28:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to limit tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors from the European Union to 15% as part of a broader trade deal. This decision averts previously threatened tariffs that could have reached as high as 250% on pharmaceuticals, a move that would have heavily impacted major European exporters. The agreement provides significant relief and predictability for these key sectors. However, to secure a lower 15% tariff on cars, the EU must first pass legislation to eliminate its own tariffs on various U.S. industrial and agricultural goods. (not investment advice)</p>
