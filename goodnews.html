          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, causing near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue warnings. The storm, driven by strong winds and dry soil conditions, created hazardous driving conditions and affected air travel. This event is unusual for the region, with the last significant dust storm occurring during the Dust Bowl era. The dust storm formed near Bloomington, Ill., at about 4:30 p.m. local time when thunderstorms in central Illinois generated a push of whipping and howling winds with speeds up to 70 miles per hour. </p>
