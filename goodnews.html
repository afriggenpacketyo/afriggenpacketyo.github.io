          <p>Dollar General's shares experienced a surge after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly results and raised its outlook. The discount retailer is attracting more middle- and higher-income consumers, who are seeking value amid concerns about the impact of tariffs on consumer spending. CEO Todd Vasos stated that the company has been working to mitigate the effects of tariffs by reducing its exposure to China and minimizing price increases. The company has also focused on improving the customer experience by reducing employee turnover and optimizing its product selection, with store traffic and market research showing growth across multiple income bands.

          <p>An advertising war has commenced in the Arizona Republican gubernatorial primary, more than a year before the election.

President Trump has endorsed both Biggs and Taylor Robson, highlighting the competitiveness of the primary race.
