          <p>After a four-day strike, NJ Transit engineers approved a new deal, bringing an end to New Jersey's first rail strike in decades, with full train service expected to resume on Tuesday. The agreement, deemed fair and fiscally responsible by both NJ Transit President Kris Kolluri and BLET General Chairman Tom Haas, includes concessions related to work rules that will offset wage increases. While trains will not run on Monday to allow for safety checks and equipment repositioning, commuters are advised to work from home if possible, and NJ Transit rail tickets will be cross-honored on bus and light rail lines. The strike caused significant disruption, impacting over 100,000 daily riders and leading to crowded conditions on alternative transportation options.</p>

          <p>With inflation persisting, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer an opportunity to earn returns that outpace inflation, with FDIC or NCUA insurance on balances up to $250,000 providing a safe investment option. While national average CD rates range from 1.69% to 2.00% APY, top CDs offer significantly higher returns, particularly from online banks, with short-term CDs (six months to one year) often providing the best rates. Investors can maximize their savings by considering short-term CDs and laddering their CDs to take advantage of the inverted yield curve, ensuring they lock in competitive rates while saving for the long term.
