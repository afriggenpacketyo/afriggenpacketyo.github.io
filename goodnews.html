          <h2>Nvidia Denies Sending GPU Designs to China Amid Export Restrictions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 10:50:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia has refuted reports that it is sending GPU designs to China for modification in response to recent U.S. export curbs. A spokesperson clarified that Nvidia is not altering GPU designs to comply with export controls. The Financial Times had reported that CEO Jensen Huang discussed a potential R&D center in Shanghai with the city's mayor to assess ways to meet U.S. restrictions while catering to the local market, but Nvidia maintains that production and design will continue outside of China. This move comes as the U.S. government has tightened restrictions on the export of advanced technology to China.</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament in the UK have voted to allow staff to opt out of participating in the assisted dying process. The bill, currently under consideration, would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales, expected to die within six months, to seek assistance to end their own lives. The approved changes ensure that no one is forced to help with the process against their wishes, providing protections to any staff who might be involved. Further debates and voting on additional potential changes are scheduled for a later date, followed by a vote on whether to pass the bill to its next stage.</p>

          <p>Hyeseong Kim's performance has brightened the Dodgers' locker room, energized the lineup, and transformed the offense with his speed. Despite the impending return of Tommy Edman and Teoscar Hern√°ndez from the injured list, the Dodgers are being urged to find a way to keep Kim on the roster. His ability to get on base has significantly improved Shohei Ohtani's run production, and his speed creates stress for opposing pitchers. Kim's positive impact on the team dynamic and overall performance makes him a valuable asset that the Dodgers should prioritize keeping in Los Angeles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The annual TV upfronts week revealed the continued dominance of live sports, particularly the NFL, in attracting large audiences and advertising dollars. Streaming services like Netflix and Amazon are gaining traction with advertisers, driven by the increasing number of subscribers who are comfortable with ads. Traditional TV networks are emphasizing live sports, such as the NBA, to combat the shift of younger viewers to streaming for scripted series and movies. Movie stars are also playing a more prominent role in upfront presentations as streaming blurs the lines between series and original movies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report suggests that individuals and small businesses may bear some of the costs associated with grid upgrades needed to support large electricity users, such as data centers. The report found that payments from large energy users may not fully cover the cost of new infrastructure, potentially leading utilities to spread the remaining expenses to other ratepayers or absorb them themselves. Rapid growth in data centers and increased use of electric vehicles are straining electricity grids, contributing to rising electricity rates. Some states, like Texas, have policies to protect individuals and small businesses from higher rates.</p>
