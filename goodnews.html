          <p>Philadelphia Phillies' designated hitter Kyle Schwarber made baseball history by hitting four home runs in a single game against the Atlanta Braves, becoming only the 21st player to achieve this feat. In his final at-bat, he had a chance to become the first player ever to hit five, but he popped out against a position player, infielder Vidal Bruján, who was pitching in the lopsided game. This outcome averted a potential controversy, as a record-breaking fifth home run against a non-pitcher might have been viewed as illegitimate by some. The event highlights the increasing and sometimes criticized practice of using position players to pitch in blowouts.</p>

          <p>The ancient practice of yoga has become a significant instrument of India's soft power and cultural diplomacy on the global stage. Spearheaded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, the establishment of the International Day of Yoga has elevated the practice into a symbol of India's cultural identity and heritage. Through collaborations with international organizations like the WHO and various cultural exchanges, India promotes yoga not just for wellness but as a non-controversial tool to build people-to-people connections. However, the practice faces criticism in the West for over-commercialization and cultural appropriation, sometimes detaching it from its spiritual roots.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Crystal Palace is reportedly working to sign two new central defenders before the transfer window closes, a move that would likely facilitate the sale of their captain, Marc Guehi, to Liverpool. The Premier League champions have been in talks for a £35 million transfer for the England defender, who has indicated he will not sign a new contract. While Palace manager Oliver Glasner publicly stated Guehi must stay, the club is reluctant to lose him on a free transfer next summer. Palace is actively pursuing replacements, with talks for Toulouse's Jaydee Canvot at an advanced stage.</p>

          <p>Kokichi Akuzawa, a 102-year-old man from Japan, has set a new Guinness World Record as the oldest person to climb the nation's highest peak, Mount Fuji. He broke his own previous record, which he set at the age of 96. Akuzawa completed the ascent over three days, overcoming significant health challenges earlier in the year, including hospitalization for heart failure. His preparation involved daily walks and weekly climbs on a smaller mountain. Despite the difficulties of the high-altitude climb, he successfully reached the 12,388-foot summit with encouragement from his daughter.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba's U.S.-listed stock jumped 10% after the company reported better-than-expected net income for its fiscal first quarter, largely driven by strong performance in its cloud computing unit. Revenue for the cloud division grew 26% year-over-year, fueled by robust demand for artificial intelligence services, which have seen triple-digit growth for eight consecutive quarters. While the company's overall revenue slightly missed forecasts, the accelerated growth in its key cloud business and a revival in e-commerce have been well-received by investors. The company continues to invest heavily in AI and instant commerce to compete in the Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of the Interior has drafted a proposal to expand its list of critical minerals, adding 51 commodities including copper, lead, silicon, and silver. This initiative is designed to guide federal investment and streamline permitting to reduce reliance on foreign sources, particularly China, and prevent potential supply chain disruptions. By designating these minerals as critical, the U.S. government aims to encourage domestic production and processing essential for key industries like semiconductors, automotive manufacturing, and renewable energy. The list helps inform strategic decisions on securing resources vital for economic and national security.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent data shows that the median price for condominiums and co-ops in the U.S. has fallen by 2.1% over the past year, in contrast to a slight increase in single-family home prices. This price drop is largely attributed to an oversupply of condos on the market, particularly in states like Florida and Texas. However, real estate experts caution that lower sale prices do not necessarily make condos a bargain. Rising costs for HOA dues, insurance premiums, and new building reserve requirements can significantly increase the total cost of ownership, sometimes making them as or more expensive than detached homes in the long run.

          <p>German striker Nick Woltemade, 23, has completed a high-profile transfer to Newcastle United in the Premier League for a reported record fee of €85 million from Stuttgart. Known for his rare combination of height and technical skill, Woltemade gained prominence last season with 17 goals and a key role in Stuttgart's German Cup victory. His stock rose further after a strong performance in the U21 European Championship. The move is seen as a major acquisition for Newcastle and a disappointment for Bayern Munich, who also sought to sign the promising young forward as Germany seeks to develop new top-tier strikers.</p>
