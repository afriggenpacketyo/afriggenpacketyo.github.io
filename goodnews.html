          <p>The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor Organization (ITER) is showcasing fusion energy technology at the World Exposition in Osaka. ITER is a France-based organization building an experimental nuclear fusion reactor. The exhibits explain the fusion energy process and the experimental reactor being built in southern France. The project involves China, India, Japan, South Korea, Russia, the United States, and the European Union and aims to demonstrate the scientific and technological feasibility of fusion energy, which scientists believe is still decades away from practical application.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey in Japan reveals that approximately 60% of Japanese citizens believe that the spread of unverified information on social media platforms during elections should be regulated by law. This sentiment arises amidst growing concerns about partisan online posts influencing election outcomes, such as the Hyogo gubernatorial election. The survey also highlights divided opinions on revising Article 9 of the Constitution, which renounces war, with equal proportions supporting and opposing the change. Additionally, the survey indicates significant support for allowing married couples to keep separate surnames and recognizing same-sex marriage.</p>

          <p>China has passed the Private Economy Promotion Law to bolster its private sector, set to take effect on May 20. The law aims to provide legal recourse for private firms and protect them from arbitrary fines and asset seizures. Observers and entrepreneurs are closely monitoring the law's implementation to see if it effectively curbs administrative powers and protects businesses from local government actions. The 78-article law is hailed by state media as evidence of Beijing's commitment to revitalizing the non-state economy.</p>

Carney stated the King's visit underscores Canada's sovereignty. Carney will visit the White House on Tuesday, amid strained relations between the two countries due to trade disputes and Trump's comments about making Canada the 51st US state. Carney said he will strengthen relationships with reliable trading partners and offered an olive branch to political rivals.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled against President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie, deeming it unconstitutional and an attack on the legal system. Judge Beryl Howell stated that the order imposed punitive measures on the firm for representing clients that Trump dislikes. The ruling permanently blocks the executive order, which had suspended security clearances and barred attorneys from accessing government buildings. Perkins Coie welcomed the ruling, affirming core constitutional freedoms.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is walking back President Trump's announcement that he was renaming Veterans Day as "Victory Day for World War I." The White House now says it will be an additional proclamation, not a full replacement. Trump had also announced his intention to designate May 8 as "Victory Day for World War II". Establishing a federal holiday or a patriotic or national observance requires the passage of a law, according to the Congressional Research Service.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>There has been a significant increase in autism diagnoses, but the reasons behind this rise are complex. Factors contributing to the increase include changes in diagnostic criteria, greater awareness, and better identification of autism in women and adults. The definition of autism has broadened over time, encompassing a wider range of individuals, including those with higher functioning and those who were previously misdiagnosed with other conditions. This has led to a greater diversity of autistic people being recognized and supported.</p>
