        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jannik Sinner has advanced to his first Wimbledon final by defeating Novak Djokovic in a decisive straight-sets victory. The 23-year-old Italian's win prevents the 38-year-old Djokovic from securing a record 25th Grand Slam title, with Djokovic attributing the loss to the effects of age. Sinner will now face defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in a highly anticipated rematch of their recent five-set French Open final. This upcoming final continues a trend where at least one of the two young stars has competed in the last six Grand Slam men's singles finals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit from the state, allowing the case to proceed. The lawsuit alleges that the social media platform intentionally uses addictive design features to exploit its younger users for commercial gain, such as increased ad exposure and purchases on TikTok Shop. The judge ruled that the state's claims focus on the app's allegedly dangerous features, not user-generated content, a legal strategy also being used against other tech companies like Meta. This case adds to the legal pressures on TikTok, which already faces a potential U.S. ban pending a divestiture by its parent company, ByteDance.</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles Dodgers Announce Kobe Bryant Bobblehead Giveaway for August Game</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 15:32:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have unveiled a new bobblehead featuring the late Lakers legend Kobe Bryant, which will be given to the first 40,000 fans at their game on August 8. The design appears to be inspired by a 2009 press day where Bryant, dressed in his full Lakers uniform, posed with a baseball bat. This promotional item continues the Dodgers' tradition of honoring the basketball icon, who, along with his daughter Gianna and seven others, died in a 2020 helicopter crash. The team has previously paid tribute to Bryant with special jersey giveaways in 2023 and 2024.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to federal drug trafficking and criminal enterprise charges in a Chicago court. As part of the plea agreement, he admitted to running a major fentanyl trafficking operation for the Sinaloa cartel's "Los Chapitos" faction. To potentially receive a sentence less than life in prison, Guzman Lopez must provide "substantial assistance" to the U.S. government, with the final sentencing decision resting solely with the judge. His guilty plea marks a significant development, as he is the first of El Chapo's sons to strike such a deal with federal prosecutors.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high, briefly topping $118,000, driven by a massive influx of institutional investment into cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, Bitcoin ETFs experienced their largest single-day inflow of the year, totaling $1.18 billion, which fueled the rally. The upward trend was also supported by a wave of short liquidations, where traders betting against Bitcoin were forced to buy back in, further pushing up the price. This market excitement reflects growing investor confidence, influenced by expectations of more dovetailed U.S. Federal Reserve policies and potential crypto-friendly legislation from Congress.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United has successfully completed the signing of winger Anthony Elanga from Nottingham Forest for a significant £55 million fee. The 23-year-old Sweden international is expected to bolster Newcastle's attacking capabilities as the team prepares for its return to the Champions League. Elanga had a productive season with Forest, contributing six goals and eleven assists, and expressed his excitement about joining Newcastle's ambitious project. While Forest was reluctant to sell the player, who joined them from Manchester United in 2023, the substantial offer from Newcastle proved too compelling to decline.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Treasury reported an unexpected budget surplus of $27 billion for June, a rare occurrence largely driven by a significant surge in tariff collections. Customs duties for the month were 301% higher than the previous year, contributing to a 13% overall increase in government receipts compared to June 2024. Despite this monthly surplus, the fiscal year-to-date deficit stands at $1.34 trillion, up 5% from the prior year. Persistently high interest payments on the national debt remain a major financial challenge, totaling $84 billion for the month, underscoring the ongoing fiscal pressures facing the government.</p>

          <p>Homeowners looking to quickly access their home equity this July have several accelerated options for obtaining a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). Applying with a fully online lender can significantly speed up the process, as their digital platforms often feature automated verification and virtual appraisals. Another fast-track method is to apply for a "low-doc" or "no-doc" HELOC, which minimizes paperwork but may come with higher rates. Homeowners might also find a quicker path by applying with their existing mortgage lender, who already has their financial information on file, potentially streamlining the underwriting and approval timeline.
