          <p>The US Federal Reserve is expected to maintain current interest rates, despite mounting fears of an economic slowdown and pressure from President Trump for a rate cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell faces a delicate situation, balancing inflation concerns with political demands. Recent data showing a healthy increase in April payrolls may support the Fed's decision to stand pat. Uncertainty remains a dominant factor for central banks globally, especially with potential tariff changes impacting future economic conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Local traders across Africa's commercial hubs are increasingly adopting China's yuan to facilitate transactions with the world's second-largest economy, bypassing the US dollar. In Nairobi's Eastleigh market, traders use logistics companies that provide Kenyan Shilling-yuan conversion services, enabling payments in local currency while these firms handle yuan transactions with Chinese sellers. This localized system streamlines trade, allowing African traders to procure goods from Chinese sourcing hubs like Guangzhou and Yiwu more efficiently. This trend reflects a broader shift in financial dynamics, with the yuan gaining traction as a viable alternative to the dollar in certain African markets.</p>
