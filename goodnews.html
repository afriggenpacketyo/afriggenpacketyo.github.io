          <h2>Chinese Researchers Develop Less Invasive Brain-Computer Interface Technique</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 00:00:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has announced the first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted via blood vessels, a method that avoids open-skull surgery. This minimally invasive technique, performed on a 67-year-old paralyzed patient, reportedly helped him regain some limb movement. Unlike Elon Musk's Neuralink, which requires cranial surgery, this approach involves inserting a stent electrode through a neck vein into the brain's vascular network. The procedure is said to reduce surgical risks and significantly shorten the patient's recovery time, marking a potential new direction for BCI technology.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Kansas City Royals 5-4, securing their position as the team with the most wins in Major League Baseball. Despite a performance their manager described as not their best, the team managed to clinch the victory. Key moments included a leadoff home run and a game-tying triple by Shohei Ohtani, a two-run homer from Max Muncy, and Mookie Betts' go-ahead single. The bullpen successfully held off a late Royals rally, sealing the win with a game-ending double play and improving the Dodgers' record to 52-31.</p>

          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has publicly stated that the club has no intention of selling 19-year-old defender Josh Acheampong this summer, despite interest from other clubs. Maresca emphasized his belief that Acheampong has the potential to become a top defender for Chelsea and that the best plan is for the academy product to remain with the team. Sources close to the player have also dismissed suggestions that he is frustrated at the club. Acheampong, who signed a new five-year contract last year, is considered a key part of the club's long-term plans.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that a Japanese-style diet, rich in rice, miso soup, fish, and soy products, is associated with a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age people. The research, conducted by the Japan Institute for Health Security among nearly 12,500 employees, found that those who adhered to a traditional Japanese diet were less likely to exhibit such symptoms. Researchers suggest that specific nutrients, such as those in seaweed and the omega-3 fatty acids in fish, could be linked to improved mental well-being. The findings may inform public health measures for preventing depression.</p>

          <p>Authorities have successfully captured the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans six weeks ago. Antoine Massey, 33, was arrested peacefully at a local residence, leaving only one fugitive, Derrick Groves, still at large from the May 16 jailbreak. The escape, which officials have called the worst in recent state history, occurred due to a faulty cell door and poor infrastructure. At least 16 individuals have also been arrested for allegedly aiding the inmates during their time on the run.</p>

          <p>Scientists are reviving a century-old idea known as phage therapy as a potential weapon against antibiotic-resistant superbugs. The technique uses bacteriophages, a type of virus that specifically preys on and kills bacteria, to treat infections. This article follows a journalist who successfully collected a phage from his home that was able to kill a patient's recurring urinary tract infection in a lab setting. While research was largely eclipsed by antibiotics, the growing crisis of antimicrobial resistance is reigniting interest, with UK regulators now creating pathways to support the development of these promising treatments.</p>

          <p>The European Space Agency's new Biomass satellite is providing the first-ever views beneath the dense canopies of the world's rainforests. Launched two months ago, the satellite uses a special P-band radar frequency that can penetrate thick foliage and clouds, which has been a limitation for previous satellites. These pioneering images are allowing scientists to measure the amount of carbon stored in tree trunks and to identify previously hidden deforestation. The ultimate goal is to create a global 3D map of the world's forests to better understand their vital role in mitigating climate change.</p>

          <p>Molly Schafer, a quiet high school senior in Waunakee, Wisconsin, found a unique way to reconnect with her classmates after years of social anxiety left her feeling isolated. Over the course of the year, she spent approximately 600 hours painting detailed portraits of 44 students she used to be friends with in her younger years. She then gifted the paintings to each student, an act that was met with amazement and some regret from her peers for not having reached out sooner. Schafer's project became a powerful lesson in taking initiative to bridge social divides.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has permanently blocked a Trump administration executive order targeting the law firm Susman Godfrey, calling it "unconstitutional from beginning to end." This is the fourth such ruling against the president's campaign to punish elite law firms for representing clients he opposes or for employing lawyers he dislikes. The orders have sought to suspend security clearances and end government contracts. In each of the four lawsuits brought by different firms, judges have found the executive orders to be a violation of constitutional rights and an attack on the legal system.</p>
