          <p>Twelve-time NBA All-Star Chris Paul has reportedly agreed to a one-year, $3.6 million deal to return to the Los Angeles Clippers for his 21st season. Paul, 40, previously played for the Clippers for six seasons, becoming the franchise's all-time leader in assists and steals per game. His return adds a veteran presence to a roster that recently acquired Bradley Beal, John Collins, and Brook Lopez. Paul, a future Hall of Famer, holds career averages of 17.0 points and 9.2 assists.</p>

          <p>A growing number of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder, are reporting significant improvements in their symptoms after using GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. While not officially approved for PCOS, these medications, known for promoting weight loss and improving insulin sensitivity, appear to indirectly address the condition's metabolic roots. Anecdotal evidence and small-scale studies suggest the drugs can help regulate menstrual cycles, reduce testosterone levels, and aid in weight management for PCOS patients. However, experts emphasize the need for larger clinical trials and note that insurance coverage remains a major barrier for many.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase has made significant leadership changes in its advanced technology research group, which focuses on emerging fields like quantum computing. Marco Pistoia, who led the group since 2020, and his deputy Charles Lim have both departed the bank. To fill the top role, JPMorgan has hired Rob Otter, who was the global head of digital technology and quantum computing at State Street. This reshuffling occurs as major tech and finance firms race to commercialize quantum technology, which promises revolutionary advances in computation for various industries.</p>

          <p>Domino's Pizza reported a 3.4% increase in U.S. same-store sales, outperforming estimates by successfully attracting diners across all income levels, including the low-income cohort. CEO Russell Weiner stated the company sees the current economic headwinds as an opportunity to gain market share from competitors by leaning into value-driven promotions. The success of its deals, like the $9.99 "Best Deal Ever," contrasts with other fast-food chains struggling with sluggish traffic as consumers opt to eat at home. However, the company's earnings missed expectations due to a charge related to its China licensee. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As college costs continue to escalate, many students rely on federal loans, but these come with specific annual and lifetime borrowing caps that may not cover the full price of attendance. The maximum amount a student can borrow depends on their dependency status, year in school, and whether they are an undergraduate or graduate student. For example, a dependent first-year undergraduate can borrow up to $5,500, while the aggregate limit for all undergraduate loans is $31,000. When these limits are reached, students often turn to private loans to bridge the remaining financial gap.</p>

          <p>A new company, The Ether Machine, is set to trade on the Nasdaq with the goal of becoming the largest public vehicle for institutional investment in ether. Unlike simple buy-and-hold strategies, the company plans to differentiate itself by focusing on generating yield through staking, a process that contributes to the Ethereum network's security. Co-founder Andrew Keys argues this makes ether a more "productive" asset than bitcoin, as the associated ETFs do not currently offer staking yields. The company follows a growing trend of firms creating public proxies for ether accumulation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of the Truth Social app, has purchased approximately $2 billion in bitcoin and related securities as part of a new corporate treasury strategy. The move signals a pivot towards becoming an investment firm and follows the company's previously announced plan to create a large reserve of the cryptocurrency. CEO Devin Nunes stated the purchase aims to ensure the company's "financial freedom" and protect it from discrimination by financial institutions. This strategy emulates that of companies like MicroStrategy, which hold large amounts of bitcoin on their balance sheets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are trying new strategies to help superstar Mookie Betts break out of a career-worst slump at the plate. After giving him an unexpected day off, manager Dave Roberts moved Betts to the leadoff spot in the batting order, a position he has held for much of his career. The hope is that changing his mindset to simply getting on base will help reset his mechanics and ease the frustration of a season where his batting average and power numbers are significantly below his usual standards. Betts acknowledged his struggles, stating he is in a process he has never been through before.</p>

          <p>Design software company Figma has updated its IPO prospectus, revealing plans to sell approximately 37 million shares at a price range of $25 to $28 each. This could result in a fully diluted valuation of up to $16.4 billion and generate as much as $1 billion in proceeds for the company and its selling shareholders. The move comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was scrapped due to regulatory hurdles. Figma's public offering is a significant event in a tech IPO market that has been slow since late 2021. (not investment advice)</p>

The recommendation comes as children now spend significantly more time watching YouTube than all public service broadcasters combined. Ofcom has proposed a six-point plan, which includes suggesting the government consider legislation to ensure public service content is easily discoverable on major online platforms to help it reach younger audiences.</p>
