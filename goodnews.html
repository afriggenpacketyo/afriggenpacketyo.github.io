          <p>India's central bank exceeded market forecasts by reducing its benchmark policy rate by 50 points to 5.5%, the lowest level since August 2022. This marks the third consecutive rate cut since February, driven by a significant softening of inflation and concerns about slower growth amid global uncertainty. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra emphasized that the Indian economy remains strong and stable, despite holding the full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%. While acknowledging potential impacts from weather and tariffs, the RBI anticipates continued moderation in commodity prices, signaling a shift to a neutral monetary policy stance with limited room for further easing.

          <p>The government has prohibited six water companies from awarding bonuses to senior executives due to failures in meeting environmental and consumer standards. The ban, backdated to April 2024, affects Anglian Water, Southern Water, Thames Water, United Utilities, Wessex Water, and Yorkshire Water. Regulator Ofwat can now reclaim bonuses already paid or enforce action against these firms, including share awards and cash payments. Environment Secretary Steve Reed stated that the public is angered by executives profiting from pollution and emphasized the need for these companies to rebuild trust with their customers. The new measures are part of the beefed-up Water Act, which aims to end the practice of rewarding poor performance.</p>

          <p>Overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector is causing producer prices to remain deflationary, leading to a surge of cheap exports into global markets. This situation is creating anxiety in Asia as local industries fear being squeezed out, while steep tariffs deter Chinese exports to the U.S. However, the influx of low-cost Chinese goods offers a silver lining for inflation-hit economies by lowering costs for consumers. This could provide relief to central banks as they balance lowering living costs and reviving growth amidst rising trade tensions, potentially paving the way for more rate cuts across Asia.

The event honors the dwindling number of surviving veterans and remembers the thousands of Allied troops who died during the invasion.

          <p>New research by PwC challenges common myths about AI's impact on jobs and wages, finding that AI actually makes people "more valuable, not less." The 2025 AI Jobs Barometer report analyzed over 800 million job ads and thousands of company financial reports, revealing that both jobs and wages are growing in AI-exposed occupations. The report challenges the notion that AI leads to decreased job numbers or exacerbates inequalities, suggesting that it enriches jobs by freeing up employees for more complex tasks. The productivity boost from AI can create a "multiplier effect" on the available workforce, benefiting countries with declining working-age populations. (not investment advice)</p>
