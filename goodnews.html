          <p>Tight end Darren Waller delivered a vintage performance, scoring two touchdown passes, to help the Miami Dolphins secure their first win of the 2025 season against the New York Jets. This marked Waller's impactful return to the league after a year off, showcasing his former Pro Bowl form with key catches. However, the Dolphins' victory was overshadowed by a gruesome knee injury suffered by star receiver Tyreek Hill in the third quarter, raising concerns he might be out for the season. The Jets' offensive struggles, compounded by 13 penalties and three turnovers, ultimately sealed their defeat in a frustrating night.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is set to deliver a pivotal speech at the Labour Party conference, asserting that Britain stands "at a fork in the road" and urging a choice between Labour's vision of "renewal" and "decency" versus the "decline and division" he attributes to Reform UK. This address, intended as his clearest statement of political creed, aims to galvanize support amid recent leadership challenges, including ministerial resignations and unfavorable opinion polls. Starmer will acknowledge that Labour's path is "long" and "difficult," requiring tough decisions, but promises a future of dignity and respect by uniting the country around common economic and social goals.</p>

          <p>Zijin Gold, the international unit of China's largest mined gold producer, saw its shares surge over 60% on its Hong Kong trading debut, raising nearly $3.2 billion in the world's second-largest initial public offering this year. The successful listing was well-timed, coinciding with gold prices reaching fresh all-time highs due to strong safe-haven demand and global economic uncertainty, which has boosted valuations for gold miners. This listing is part of a wider restructuring by its parent company, Zijin Mining, to sharpen its focus on gold operations outside China. The article notes this IPO builds on a resurgence in Hong Kong's market. (not investment advice)</p>

Reid, who had her right foot amputated, explains that she only requires one shoe for her carbon-fiber blade, leading to significant waste and cost from buying pairs she doesn't fully use. Her campaign emphasizes that while brands display inclusive imagery, their sales practices fall short for athletes and individuals with disabilities. The article notes that this issue also impacts thousands of people with different sized feet, who are currently forced to purchase two pairs.</p>

          <p>Zhimin Qian, a Chinese national also known as Yadi Zhang, has been convicted in the UK for her central role in what is believed to be the world's largest single cryptocurrency seizure, valued at over £5.5 billion ($7.4 billion). Qian pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring and possessing the bitcoin, which stemmed from a large-scale scam in China between 2014 and 2017 that defrauded over 128,000 victims. This conviction is the culmination of a seven-year international probe into a global money laundering network, as Qian had evaded justice for years, fleeing China and attempting to launder stolen funds by purchasing UK property. The Crown Prosecution Service is working to return funds to victims.</p>

          <p>An opinion article proposes that Hong Kong could serve as China's strategic gateway to the United Nations, suggesting the city could host the UN's Asia headquarters. This move, the article argues, would support the UN's reform efforts and align with Beijing's vision for global governance, which emphasizes "sovereign equality" and "people-centered" leadership. Hong Kong's distinct advantages, including its common law system, official English language status, and low corporate taxes, position it uniquely for such a role. By strengthening its international engagements and building on existing institutions like the International Organisation for Mediation, Hong Kong could effectively bring the world to China.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily suspended the Trump administration's plan to eliminate 532 jobs, representing the vast majority of its remaining staff, at the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees Voice of America (VOA). Judge Royce Lamberth cited the administration's "concerning disrespect" for the court, as it had failed to comply with previous orders to restore VOA programming. The Trump administration, which had labeled VOA "radical propaganda," had previously signed an executive order effectively shutting down the broadcaster and placing most full-time employees on leave. The lawsuit argues that these cuts would severely hamper VOA's statutory mission to serve as an authoritative global news source and combat authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>Mumbai is preparing for the imminent inauguration of its long-delayed Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA), an infrastructure project designed to significantly alleviate congestion at the city's current overworked airport. NMIA, located 40km from the old commercial center and connected by India's longest sea-bridge, is envisioned as India's first fully digital hub airport, aiming to handle 90 million passengers annually. However, the article highlights major challenges, particularly regarding last-mile connectivity, as travel times from some Mumbai suburbs can be extensive. Aviation experts caution that without improved integration and revised transfer policies, NMIA's ambition to rival global hubs like Singapore and Dubai may be difficult to achieve.</p>

Critics, including conservative influencers, are framing the choice as "woke culture" infiltrating American institutions, citing Bad Bunny's predominantly Spanish-language music, past political endorsements, and immigration activism. The article places this reaction within a broader pattern of conservative condemnation against diverse Super Bowl performers, including Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar. Despite the political furor, Bad Bunny remains Spotify's most-streamed male artist, affirming his immense global popularity and cultural impact.</p>

          <p>Charlie Javice, founder of the fintech startup Frank, has been sentenced to just over seven years in prison for defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Javice was convicted of grossly overstating Frank's customer base, claiming more than five million students when the actual figure was under 300,000, which led JPMorgan to acquire her company for $175 million. During her sentencing, Javice expressed deep remorse for her actions, but the judge underscored the importance of deterrence for others. Beyond the prison term, she faces $22.36 million in forfeiture and $287 million in restitution to JPMorgan, highlighting the severe consequences of corporate fraud in the tech and finance sectors.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to "keep calm and carry on," predicting that a looming government shutdown would not significantly impact the stock market, citing historical data that shows stocks often perform well afterward. While acknowledging the unsettling nature of the first full shutdown since 2013, Cramer distinguished it from a debt ceiling default, which is more severe. His main concern is that a shutdown would delay the release of crucial economic data, complicating the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates. However, he ultimately downplayed this concern, suggesting delayed data collection is not a major reason for market worry. (not investment advice)</p>

Instead of focusing on increased production, the MIIT emphasizes optimizing industrial structure and achieving a 5% average annual growth in value-added output. The article also highlights efforts to advance exploration of critical metals like copper and lithium, and enhance recycling, as processing fees have depressed smelter margins.
