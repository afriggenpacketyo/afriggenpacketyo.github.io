          <p>President Trump announced a delay in implementing a 50% tariff on European Union goods, pushing the start date from June 1 to July 9 to allow time for negotiations. This decision followed a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who expressed a desire for serious trade talks. Trump initially threatened the tariffs due to frustrations with the EU's trade practices, causing market instability. The delay aims to facilitate a potential agreement and avoid further economic disruption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>King Charles III is set to deliver a significant speech in Canada's parliament, expected to support Canada in its disputes with the U.S. President Trump. This marks the royal couple's first trip to Canada since Charles's reign began, with the King meeting Prime Minister Mark Carney, recently elected on an anti-Trump platform. The speech, written with input from the Canadian government, will likely convey a message that Canada is independent and not subject to U.S. influence, serving as a symbolic gesture of solidarity.</p>

This shift aims to increase training for young adults and those needing to retrain, with 120,000 more opportunities promised. Funding for Level 7 apprenticeships, equivalent to a master's degree, will be eliminated for those over 21, potentially impacting advanced NHS training and professional qualifications. The government intends to use increased charges on employers hiring from outside the UK to fund 45,000 training places.</p>
