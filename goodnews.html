          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended to land on Venus in 1972 but stranded in Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction, re-entered Earth's atmosphere and splashed down in the Indian Ocean. The spacecraft's return evokes the Cold War space race and the Soviet Union's ambitious Venera program, which achieved firsts in exploring Venus. While the re-entry itself is not unusual, it serves as a reminder of the vast archive of space debris orbiting Earth and the ingenuity required to explore other planets during the early space age. The Venera program ended in the mid-1980s and was a point of pride for the U.S.S.R.</p>

          <p>A 4.1-magnitude earthquake in Tennessee was felt across the southern United States, including in Atlanta and parts of North Carolina. The earthquake originated near Greenback, Tennessee, and prompted over 23,000 reports to the USGS. While no major damage or injuries were immediately reported, the event served as a reminder of earthquake preparedness. The southeastern US carries a significant earthquake risk, particularly around the New Madrid and Eastern Tennessee seismic zones, with the region's geology causing earthquakes to be felt over larger distances.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his new memoir, "Who Knew," media executive Barry Diller discusses the importance of instinct over data in decision-making, particularly in creative fields. Diller recounts his experiences at ABC, where he championed the "Movie of the Week" concept, emphasizing that research and data cannot predict public appetite. He highlights the success of "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker" as examples of projects greenlit based on instinct and a compelling story. Diller argues that too much information can overload and obscure the essence of a good idea.</p>

          <p>In his new book, "The Afterlife of Malcolm X," journalist Mark Whitaker explores the enduring impact of Malcolm X on America, focusing on the artistic choices made in Spike Lee's 1992 biopic.

Lee's film aimed to convey Malcolm's premonition of his death, using dialogue, music, and camera techniques to create a haunting and poignant atmosphere.
