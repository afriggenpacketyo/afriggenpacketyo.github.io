          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers stated that they denied access to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents who requested entry to the stadium's parking lots, while ICE denied ever being present. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) clarified that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) vehicles were briefly in the parking lot, unrelated to any enforcement activities, which BBC Verify confirmed some agents appeared to be wearing CBP badges. In response to recent immigration enforcement and protests in Los Angeles, the Dodgers announced a $1 million donation to support affected immigrant families, with player Kik√© Hern√°ndez expressing solidarity with the community. Recent intensified ICE activity in Los Angeles is part of President Donald Trump's wider crackdown on immigration.</p>

          <p>Pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil was released from ICE custody in Louisiana after a federal judge granted bail, a decision criticized by the Trump administration. Khalil, a green card holder married to an American citizen, had been detained since March. The Department of Homeland Security argued that an immigration judge had denied Khalil bond and ordered his removal, superseding the district judge's authority. Khalil's attorney asserted that he was being punished for speech protected by the First Amendment, and his bail conditions include surrendering his passport and restricting domestic travel.</p>

          <p>As summer approaches, the appropriateness of wearing shorts in the office remains a contentious topic, with many companies relaxing dress codes but still expecting professional attire. Stylists emphasize that context is crucial, with shorts generally deemed too casual for client-facing roles in industries like law and finance. While some companies have no explicit dress codes, others advise monitoring colleagues' attire to avoid looking out of place. The type of shorts also matters, with tailored, formal shorts being more acceptable than beach, sports, cargo, or denim shorts, though some companies embrace more creative expressions of clothing.</p>

Readers are drawn to the genre's guaranteed happy endings, focus on female pleasure, and exploration of tropes like "enemies to lovers." While attitudes toward romance are improving, some believe sexism still prevents the genre from being fully accepted in the mainstream. Romance readers are often voracious consumers, buying multiple editions of their favorite books and forming strong communities, challenging the perception that the genre is not serious business.</p>

          <p>The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague is expected to focus on increasing defense spending by European allies, driven by pressure from President Donald Trump. Despite potential compromises and disagreements on trade and Russia, Secretary General Mark Rutte aims to present a united front and avoid conflict with the US. While some European nations are already boosting their defense spending, many may struggle to meet the new target of 3.5% of GDP, with creative accounting potentially obscuring the true extent of the increases. The summit's brevity and limited agenda are seen as efforts to manage divisions and cater to Trump's preferences.</p>
