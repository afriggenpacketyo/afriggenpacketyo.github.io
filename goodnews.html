          <p>Max Verstappen secured victory at the Italian Grand Prix, but the race was marked by a controversial team order from McLaren. The team instructed Oscar Piastri to allow his teammate Lando Norris to pass him for second place late in the race. The situation arose after a slow pit stop for Norris, caused by a wheel gun fault, dropped him behind Piastri, reversing their on-track positions. McLaren justified the order by citing a similar situation in a previous race, though Piastri expressed his disagreement before complying, reigniting debates about fairness in team racing.</p>

          <p>Millions of mobile phones across the United Kingdom emitted a siren sound and vibrated as part of a national test of the emergency alert system. The test, which occurred around 3:00 PM on Sunday, was intended to ensure the system's readiness for genuine national emergencies like severe weather or public safety threats. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the test a success and an important step in public safety. Various public events, including sporting matches and theatre performances, paused or made announcements to accommodate the nationwide alert.</p>

The vehicle, identified as a Dallara GP2 car, was seen driving on the D4 motorway before police followed it to a property and made the arrest. Previous attempts to identify the driver were unsuccessful because he always wore a full racing helmet. The owner now faces a fine and potential license suspension for operating a vehicle unfit for public roads.</p>

This feat marks the world's longest open-water crossing in such a vessel, aiming to highlight the potential of fungal materials as a biodegradable alternative to plastics used in marine equipment. The material, known as AquaFung, is lightweight and buoyant, similar to styrofoam, but environmentally friendly. Shoemaker's project, supported by the arts organization Fulcrum Arts, is part of a nascent movement exploring innovative uses for mycelium.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's elimination of the "de minimis" tariff exemption for purchases under $800 is causing concern among some small businesses that rely on international imports. However, this article argues that the panic may be misdirected, as the majority of small businesses are service-based and will not be directly affected. The larger threat to the economy, it suggests, is not the price increases from tariffs but a potential slowdown in the labor market and a decline in consumer spending power. As long as income and wealth remain strong, the economy can likely absorb the tariff-related costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comprehensive new study analyzing data from nearly 15 million people across Denmark, Taiwan, and the United States reveals that romantic partners often share the same psychiatric diagnoses. Researchers examined nine disorders, including depression, anxiety, and ADHD, and found this trend of "spousal correlations" has been consistent for over half a century. The pattern holds across different cultures and generations, suggesting that people with similar mental health challenges may be drawn to each other. Researchers theorize this could be due to shared understanding, similar environments, or the limiting effects of social stigma.</p>

While disappointed, the team's performance has stoked hope for the future, with young stars like 22-year-old flanker Freda Tafuna shining throughout the tournament.

          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleep habits in infancy is one of the most crucial things parents can do for their child's long-term development. Good "sleep hygiene" supports the physical, mental, and emotional growth necessary for babies to become healthy and resilient adults. Dr. Golshevsky advises creating a soothing environment with white noise, swaddling, and gentle movement, rather than complete silence and stillness. He also recommends that parents create a flexible routine and learn to interpret their baby's cues to address needs like hunger or discomfort.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents an argument that solar energy, often associated with left-wing environmentalism, should be embraced by right-wing survivalists and preppers. Unlike fossil fuels, which rely on a complex and vulnerable supply chain, solar power offers true energy independence and self-sufficiency. Solar panels are durable, require minimal maintenance, and can be paired with batteries to provide a reliable power source for a home, bunker, or electric vehicle indefinitely. The author suggests that the individualistic and resilient nature of solar power aligns perfectly with a conservative, self-reliant worldview, making it a superior choice for preparing for societal disruption.</p>
