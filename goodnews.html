          <h2>UK Government Announces Major Revisions to Infected Blood Scandal Compensation Scheme</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 23:43:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is implementing "substantial changes" to the compensation scheme for victims of the infected blood scandal, which affected an estimated 30,000 people in the 1970s-90s. The move follows a highly critical report by the public inquiry's chair, who described the previous payment speed as "profoundly unsatisfactory." Key changes include allowing compensation to be passed to a deceased victim's estate and a commitment of an additional £1 billion. While victims' groups cautiously welcomed the news, they noted that some key issues still require further consultation.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Tariffs May Inadvertently Push Other Nations Toward Economic Liberalization</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while widely criticized, President Trump's universal tariffs could have an unintended positive consequence for the global economy. The author suggests that the economic pressure from these tariffs is exposing hypocrisy and forcing countries like Canada, China, and those in the European Union to confront and dismantle their own long-standing internal trade barriers. These domestic protectionist policies have been a significant drag on their own economies. The tariff crisis may therefore be acting as a catalyst for much-needed internal reforms and economic liberalization abroad.</p>

          <p>Texas officials have successfully accounted for most of the more than 160 people who were initially reported missing after the devastating July Fourth floods along the Guadalupe River. The Kerr County judge stated that only three individuals remain unaccounted for, with most of the missing being tourists who had safely returned home. The flash floods killed at least 135 people, primarily in Kerr County, where the river rose dramatically. The sharp revision in the number of missing people is common in the chaotic aftermath of large-scale disasters as authorities work to verify initial reports.</p>

          <p>Musician Billy Joel says he is feeling "good" two months after announcing his diagnosis with Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH), a rare brain condition. Speaking on a podcast, the 76-year-old singer acknowledged he still struggles with his balance but that his condition is being managed. NPH, which involves a build-up of fluid in the brain, forced Joel to cancel numerous concert dates earlier this year to undergo specific physical therapy. Despite the "brain disorder" label, the "Piano Man" singer conveyed a positive outlook on his health and recovery process.</p>
