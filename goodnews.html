          <p>A three-day strike by NJ Transit engineers has come to an end after the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen approved a tentative deal.

          <p>A 60 Minutes report examines the lasting toll of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan on veterans, their children, and their spouses. About 600,000 American veterans have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. Some symptoms of PTSD are, in a sense, contagious: some family members living with veterans who have been diagnosed, like children and spouses, often experience similar symptoms, such as anxiety and depression.</p>

          <h2>Notre Dame Rebuilt, Reverently Restored After 5 Years</h2>

          <p>Since the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris opened its doors last December, nearly 30,000 visitors a day have streamed through, to see for themselves the remarkable rebirth of the great gothic church. Notre Dame was nearly destroyed by a devastating fire in 2019, and at the time, hardly anyone imagined that it could be rebuilt and restored within just five years. The workers and craftspeople who have pulled all this off are known as "compagnons," and their work is celebrated on huge banners overlooking the River Seine.</p>

          <p>Cajun and Zydeco music, the sounds of southwest Louisiana, are experiencing a remarkable revival. Cajun music ‚Äî and its cousin from across the way, Zydeco, resists easy description, but it is intoxicatingly catchy, often sung in French, and enjoying a most unlikely renaissance. These sounds are sourced from the unique blend of people that converged on Cajun country over the centuries.</p>

          <p>Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang is set to open the Computex trade show in Taiwan on Monday, where he is expected to discuss the company's advancements in artificial intelligence server systems, cloud computing products and robotics. The Santa Clara, California-based company has used its presence at Computex to launch new graphics cards for video games. At Computex last year, Huang sparked "Jensanity" in Taiwan, as the public and media breathlessly followed the CEO, who was mobbed by attendees at the trade show.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan, a centrist mayor, won the presidential election in Romania, defeating George Simion, a nationalist aligned with President Trump. Simion, who had been seen as the front-runner, had called for national protests should the final count show him as the loser. Dan's victory will likely calm fears in Europe's political mainstream that Romania might oppose help for Ukraine and cozy up to Moscow.</p>
