          <p>The United States and China have formalized a framework for a trade deal, building on previous agreements made in Geneva and London. The pact reportedly centers on easing U.S. access to Chinese rare earth minerals, which are crucial for high-tech manufacturing, in exchange for the U.S. canceling a series of restrictive measures. The deal also addresses China's efforts to control the flow of fentanyl precursors. This development comes amid economic pressures on both nations, with the U.S. economy contracting and Chinese factory profits declining due to the ongoing trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 2025 Wimbledon draw has been revealed, featuring an all-British first-round match between Emma Raducanu and teenage wildcard Mimi Xu. The tournament includes 23 British players in the singles draws, the most since 1984, but many face difficult paths. British men's number one Jack Draper is in a section that could see him face seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals. Several other British players, including Katie Boulter and teenagers Hannah Klugman and Mika Stojsavljevic, have been drawn against high-seeded opponents in their opening matches.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Men's National Team has successfully navigated the Gold Cup group stage with three wins, demonstrating resilience and depth despite the absence of key players. Malik Tillman has emerged as a breakout star, scoring three goals and showing that the team can generate offense without Christian Pulisic. The tournament has also highlighted an open competition for the starting goalkeeper position between Matt Freese and Matt Turner. While the team has shown it can win, the absence of injured players like Folarin Balogun and Antonee Robinson underscores the need for their return for future success.</p>

          <p>Following significant backlash from health experts and Democratic lawmakers, the Trump administration has restored federal funding for HIV prevention and surveillance programs. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health that it would receive its nearly $20 million grant, averting the termination of contracts with 39 local providers. Critics had warned that the funding freeze was reckless and could lead to a spike in new HIV infections. While the restoration is seen as a victory, advocates remain concerned about future budget proposals that aim to eliminate this funding entirely.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's "Operation Midnight Hammer" strike against Iran's nuclear facilities was a decisive and necessary action, fully consistent with his "America First" foreign policy. The author, who was in Israel during the initial conflict, recounts the danger posed by Iranian missiles and frames the U.S. intervention as a defense of core American and Israeli interests. The article dismisses critics who view the strike as an interventionist departure, defining "America First" as a pragmatic realism that avoids nation-building but acts forcefully when required. The author cites high support among MAGA Republicans as evidence that the action aligns with the president's base.</p>

          <p>Charlie English's new book, "The CIA Book Club," is reviewed as a thrilling account of how literature was used as a weapon during the Cold War. The book focuses primarily on Poland, detailing how the CIA funded the smuggling of forbidden books like George Orwell's "1984" to undermine Soviet propaganda and support resistance movements. The reviewer praises the book's suspenseful narrative and its documentation of an important oral history of Polish resistance. While the book powerfully illustrates how stories can be a form of rebellion, the review notes it doesn't fully deliver on its subtitle's promise to cover the broader Cold War effort beyond Poland.</p>

          <p>Bruce Springsteen's new box set, "Tracks II: The Lost Albums," is reviewed as an epic act of pop archiving that collects 83 previously unreleased songs. The set organizes the material into seven distinct "lost albums," aiming to reshape the public's understanding of his career, particularly his ambivalence toward stardom in the 1980s and his experimental work in the 1990s. The review compares the project's scope to Peter Jackson's "Get Back" and notes its timely arrival ahead of a new biopic. The collection is seen as a reclamation of Springsteen as a challenging songwriter who was constantly pushing himself creatively even at the height of his fame.</p>

          <p>The recent conflict between Iran and Israel has once again highlighted the vulnerability of global energy supplies that depend on fossil fuels and volatile geopolitical regions. This article explains that energy security, defined as uninterrupted access to affordable power, is crucial for modern economies. Experts argue that transitioning to homegrown renewable energy sources like wind and solar can provide a more stable and secure power supply, shielding countries from price shocks and import disruptions. While the green transition presents its own challenges, such as mineral dependencies and grid stability, these are seen as manageable compared to the inherent risks of fossil fuel reliance.</p>

          <p>China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, is scheduled to travel to Europe for high-level talks in Brussels, Germany, and France. The visit is part of Beijing's ongoing effort to strengthen its relationships with European nations as a counterweight to the United States. The talks come at a time of strained EU-China relations due to trade frictions, such as a recent EU ban on some Chinese medical device purchases, and Europe's concerns over China's close ties with Russia. Wang is expected to engage in strategic dialogue with EU officials and meet with his foreign minister counterparts in Germany and France.</p>

          <p>Tokyo's Nikkei Stock Average rose for a fourth consecutive day, closing above the 40,000 mark for the first time in several months. The market rally was driven by easing concerns over potential U.S. tariffs and a reduction in geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Investor sentiment was boosted by a White House announcement that President Trump might extend a pause on "reciprocal" tariffs. The positive market movement also saw the U.S. dollar strengthen against the yen, as investors moved away from safe-haven assets. (not investment advice)</p>
