          <h2>Japan Grapples with 'Toilet Panic' Preparedness Following Noto Peninsula Earthquake</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the devastating Noto Peninsula earthquake, Japan is facing scrutiny over its preparedness for maintaining sanitary toilet facilities during disasters, as damaged sewage systems led to unsanitary conditions and a phenomenon known as 'toilet panic.' The article highlights that while necessities like food and water are prioritized, the importance of functional toilets is often overlooked, leading to potential health crises. Many people are unfamiliar with using portable toilets, exacerbating the problem, thus educators are beginning to teach children about their use in emergency situations. Experts urge people to stockpile portable toilets at home and workplaces to ensure sanitation in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, as it can take weeks to install temporary toilets. These measures aim to prevent the spread of disease and ensure people do not avoid using the toilet due to unhygienic conditions.</p>

          <p>European startup founders are pushing back against pressure to adopt China's '996' work culture, which involves working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week. Venture capitalists have sparked debate by suggesting that European companies need to embrace overwork to compete globally, but many founders argue that this approach is unsustainable and detrimental to employee well-being. They emphasize that Europe's most successful companies have thrived through innovation and a focus on sustainable work cultures rather than excessive hours. Founders also contend that Europe needs more funding and resources to support its startups, enabling them to hire enough talent and avoid burnout. The discussion highlights the clash between different work philosophies and the importance of work-life balance in the European tech scene.</p>

          <p>AI scientist De Kai proposes a new approach to artificial intelligence, suggesting that AI systems should be 'parented' to ensure their ethical and beneficial development. De Kai argues that AI should not be viewed as a technological arms race but as a change to the social climate, akin to climate change. In his book, 'Raising AI,' he advocates for treating AI as children that learn from their environment, emphasizing the importance of being conscientious about the data and interactions AI systems are exposed to. This perspective aims to guide AI development by instilling positive values and ethical considerations from the outset.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to launch a registration system to encourage people to maintain connections with rural areas facing depopulation, with the goal of attracting over 10 million users in the next decade. This initiative is part of Prime Minister Ishiba's efforts to revitalize regional economies and reverse the trend of people moving to major cities like Tokyo. The system would involve registering via a smartphone app and receiving certificates, providing users with information on local events and services. While the program aims to attract tourists and those who donate through the hometown tax system, some officials are skeptical about its ability to foster regional growth.</p>
