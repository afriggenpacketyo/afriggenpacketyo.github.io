          <p>Anduril, a defense technology company, has topped the 2025 CNBC Disruptor 50 list, highlighting the increasing interest and investment in the defense tech sector. The list showcases 50 companies challenging the status quo and utilizing technologies like AI to transform industries. Several other defense tech companies, including Flock Safety, Saronic Technologies, and Shield AI, also made the list, demonstrating a broader trend. This growth is fueled by increasing defense spending and a focus on modernizing military capabilities, and the sector is expected to accelerate due to a surge in funding. Anduril's recent $2.5 billion funding round at a $30.5 billion valuation exemplifies this trend, reflecting a significant shift in investment towards defense technology.</p>

          <p>Chinese solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturers are actively seeking solutions to address persistent price wars and financial losses within the industry, driven by overcapacity and declining demand. Executives are gathering in Shanghai for the SNEC PV+ Photovoltaic Power Conference and Exhibition to discuss strategies for overcoming these challenges. The industry installed approximately 278 gigawatts of solar PV capacity in China last year, accounting for almost 60% of global additions, however, excess capacity has contributed to a significant drop in solar module prices. Industry leaders emphasize the need for government-business collaboration to manage supply and promote technological innovation to improve profit margins and ensure sustainable growth.

          <p>Scientists are helping Yosemite's native turtles recover by removing invasive bullfrogs, which prey on various species, including turtle hatchlings. A near-total eradication of bullfrogs from habitats within Yosemite National Park led to the striking recovery of the Northwestern pond turtle. Researchers conducted night surveys to remove adult bullfrogs and day surveys to target egg masses, removing an estimated 16,000 bullfrogs across two sites. After several years, they observed the first small pond turtle hatchlings and juveniles, along with a comeback of certain snake and newt species, suggesting a potential tool for reversing species decline and restoring freshwater ecosystems.</p>
