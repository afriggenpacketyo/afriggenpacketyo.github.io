          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the House budget bill, calling it the "largest cut in spending in at least 30 years," while dismissing concerns about rising federal deficits. This statement comes in response to a Congressional Budget Office analysis suggesting the bill's tax provisions could increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next decade. Johnson asserted that the bill will stimulate the economy by raising wages and incentivizing business expansion and U.S. manufacturing. Republican senators have expressed reservations about the bill, signaling potential changes in the Senate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following former President Joe Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis, experts are questioning the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines that recommend against routine prostate cancer screening for men over 70. Dr. Marc Siegel argues that all men over 45 should be screened, citing advancements in treatment options and a high number of preventable deaths. Dr. Shawn Dason acknowledges the potential risks of over-treatment but emphasizes the importance of discussing screening options with healthcare providers, especially for men in good health with a reasonable life expectancy.</p>

          <p>Conservationists are debating the merits of protecting entire ecosystems rather than focusing solely on individual endangered species, particularly in light of the Trump administration's efforts to weaken the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The current act's emphasis on saving individual species can be inefficient and reactive, prompting some to advocate for a native ecosystem-protection act that would safeguard larger areas and multiple species simultaneously. While challenges exist in defining and categorizing ecosystems, this approach could provide a more comprehensive and sustainable method for biodiversity conservation.</p>
