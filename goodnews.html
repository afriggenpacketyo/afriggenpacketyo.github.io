          <p>A private survey indicated that China's factory activity unexpectedly expanded in June, contrasting with official data that showed a third consecutive month of contraction. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index rose to 50.4, driven primarily by a rebound in export orders as businesses may have front-loaded shipments to avoid potential U.S. tariffs. This divergence highlights different segments of the economy, as the private survey focuses more on smaller, export-oriented firms. The data suggests a mixed but recovering manufacturing sector amid ongoing trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law significant housing legislation aimed at accelerating construction by reducing environmental review standards. The new laws, AB 130 and SB 131, exempt most urban housing projects from the lengthy California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) process, a move long sought by developers but opposed by some labor and environmental groups. Newsom forced the legislation through by tying it to the state budget, a strategy seen as a demonstration of his political strength. Experts believe these reforms to CEQA could be the most substantial in its 55-year history, potentially unblocking numerous stalled housing projects across the state.</p>

          <p>A U.S. military commander has proposed reassigning some California National Guard troops from their controversial deployment in Los Angeles to assist with wildfire preparations. The request involves moving 200 of the 4,000 troops deployed by the Trump administration to address protests, a move that Governor Gavin Newsom had legally challenged. The state had previously warned that the Los Angeles deployment was depleting its firefighting resources ahead of an expected active wildfire season. This potential shift highlights the ongoing tension between federal and state authorities over the use of the National Guard for different emergencies.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have discovered that betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, can slow the aging process. The study, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine acts as a messenger that prevents inflammation and organ aging by inhibiting a specific enzyme. This breakthrough sheds light on the molecular mechanisms behind the health benefits of physical activity. The findings could also lead to new anti-aging strategies that simulate the effects of exercise, offering potential therapeutic applications for promoting longevity and health.</p>

While China's coffee industry is now valued at over $42 billion and consumption continues to grow rapidly, the sustainability of this rural cafe craze is uncertain.

Finney-Smith had been an important contributor for the Lakers, valued for his defensive versatility.

He argues these investors are rewarding companies like Robinhood and Reddit for their disruptive potential, while punishing more conservative firms that focus on stock buybacks. According to Cramer, this has created an "idea market" driven by compelling stories and future growth potential rather than traditional metrics or Federal Reserve policies. This shift in investor behavior is contributing to the strong performance of a specific host of growth-oriented stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated that the company has not yet seen significant price increases for its products despite widespread U.S. tariffs on imports. He attributed this stability to mitigation strategies, including forward-buying by Amazon and its third-party sellers deploying inventory in advance. Jassy explained that the competitive nature of Amazon's marketplace, with over two million sellers, also helps keep prices down, as some sellers will absorb costs to gain market share. This suggests that, for now, consumers on the platform have been largely shielded from the direct financial impact of the ongoing trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>
