          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy anticipates that the company's corporate workforce will shrink in the coming years as it increasingly relies on generative AI tools. In a memo to employees, Jassy stated that AI agents will automate tasks, requiring fewer people for certain jobs while creating demand for new roles. Amazon is investing heavily in AI, with plans to build numerous AI agents to streamline operations and improve customer experiences. While some employees express concern about the intensified work environment driven by AI, Jassy envisions AI freeing up human workers for more creative and strategic tasks.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer explained that he quickly picked up papers dropped by US President Donald Trump at the G7 Summit to prevent intervention from White House security. Starmer feared that anyone else stepping forward might face unwanted attention from the security team, given the strict rules surrounding proximity to the president. Starmer also noted the UK-US trade deal signed at the summit provided significant relief for Jaguar Land Rover workers and their supply chain, removing tariffs on the aerospace sector and cutting levies on car exports. The deal, however, did not address steel import charges, which remain under negotiation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales have voted to decriminalize abortion, marking a significant change to abortion laws in nearly 60 years. The new law will prevent women who terminate their pregnancies outside of the current legal framework from being criminally investigated, although it will still penalize those who assist women in obtaining abortions outside the legal framework. The amendment was backed by major abortion providers and numerous MPs, while facing opposition from anti-abortion groups. The new clause will not change any law regarding the provision of abortion services within a healthcare setting, including but not limited to the time limit, telemedicine, the grounds for abortion, or the requirement for two doctors' approval.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik, convicted of murdering her husband in 2001, had her conviction overturned after spending two decades in prison, fighting for her freedom and maintaining her innocence. New testing of evidence, including blood found in the couple's bedroom, revealed inconsistencies and foreign male DNA. Despite her conviction being overturned, the District Attorney's office decided to retry her, but the charges were dropped as the jury was about to be assembled. Dorotik is now working to rebuild her life and advocate for other incarcerated women, having filed a civil suit against the County of San Diego.</p>
