          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that major technology companies like Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are not over-investing in artificial intelligence, but are actually underspending. He argues that the race for AI dominance is a "winner-take-all" situation, justifying massive capital expenditures, which are projected to reach a combined $320 billion in 2025. Citing Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased investment in cloud infrastructure, Cramer suggests that spending is crucial for developing the most accurate and profitable AI, potentially leading to a near-monopoly for the victor.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua could be in line for a massive contract extension, potentially worth over $100 million, following the upcoming season. After a record-setting rookie year and another strong season, Nacua has become one of the NFL's best bargains on his fifth-round rookie deal. Recent lucrative extensions for other young receivers, like Garrett Wilson's $90 million guaranteed deal, have set a high market precedent. While Nacua remains focused on the present, his performance has positioned him for a significant payday as he becomes eligible for an extension in the offseason. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Why the Biden Administration Did Not Release the Epstein Files</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 18:40:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analytical article examines the reasons why the Biden administration did not release the complete set of files related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, despite political pressure. It explains that releasing such information, particularly secret grand jury testimony, is legally complex and requires exceptional court approval that is rarely granted. The government's primary role is to prosecute crimes, not to publicly release investigative materials that could violate privacy or compromise investigations. The article suggests that even if the Biden administration had wanted to release the files, it likely would have been blocked by the courts.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson stated he is "very bullish" on Republicans' chances in the 2026 midterm elections, predicting they will expand their majority in the House. He dismissed historical trends where the president's party typically loses seats, pointing instead to GOP opportunities in districts currently held by Democrats but won by President Trump. Johnson also defended the recently passed tax cut bill against low public approval, predicting voters will feel its economic benefits and "vote accordingly."

          <p>The demand for workers with artificial intelligence skills is surging, with the number of job postings mentioning AI growing at a much faster rate than the overall economy. According to a Brookings Institution report, AI-related job listings have increased by over 100% in the last year alone. These roles are not just for advanced AI engineers but are increasingly found in fields like marketing, finance, and HR. While still a small fraction of the total labor market, these jobs tend to offer higher salaries, paying an average of 28% more than similar non-AI roles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has issued an order that, for now, preserves the ability of individuals and groups to sue under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The court blocked a lower appellate court ruling from the Eighth Circuit that had uniquely barred such private lawsuits. The case originated in North Dakota, where Native American tribes challenged a redistricting map for diluting their voting strength. While a temporary victory for voting rights advocates, the issue is far from settled, as the court is set to rehear a similar case from Louisiana that could ultimately determine the future of these crucial enforcement provisions.</p>
