          <p>The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam is displaying a 200-year-old condom as part of an exhibition on 19th-century prostitution and sexuality. The condom, thought to be made from a sheep's appendix, features an explicit print and the inscription "Voil√† mon choix." The museum notes that the object embodies both the lighter and darker sides of sexual health in an era fraught with fears of unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. The condom is believed to have been a souvenir from a brothel.</p>
