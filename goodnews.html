Her chances were boosted after her main rival, Belgian Olympic champion Nafi Thiam, unexpectedly withdrew from the competition after the penultimate session. Johnson-Thompson heads into the final two events, the javelin and 800m, trailing the American leader Anna Hall. The British athlete expressed some frustration over a narrowly fouled long jump but remains focused on securing a medal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Artificial intelligence is being increasingly adopted in the workplace to combat employee burnout by automating repetitive tasks and managing workloads, potentially saving companies thousands per employee annually. Tools like ChatGPT can act as assistants, reducing cognitive load and allowing for early intervention when stress is detected. However, some studies suggest that frequent AI users may experience higher rates of burnout, as efficiency gains often lead to increased workloads rather than relief. The challenge lies in integrating AI to support well-being without inadvertently adding to the pressure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has proposed a new community policing strategy that would establish police counters in public venues like supermarkets, shopping centers, and libraries. The party argues this move would increase police visibility, build public confidence, and make it easier for citizens to report crimes. To fund the initiative, the Lib Dems suggest abolishing the elected Police and Crime Commissioner roles, which they claim would free up significant funds. This policy announcement comes as the party seeks to address concerns over declining police presence in local communities.</p>

Despite their ordeal, during which they reportedly suffered from poor health, the couple expressed a desire to return to Afghanistan to continue their charitable work.</p>

          <p>France's women's rugby team is preparing to challenge England in the World Cup semi-final, facing a team with a dominant statistical record. England's Red Roses are on a 31-test winning streak and have defeated France in their last 16 encounters. Despite the daunting numbers, France has often pushed England closer than any other team, known for their volatile and inspired style of play. However, France will be without several key players due to suspension and injury, making their quest for a first-ever World Cup final appearance an even greater challenge.</p>

          <p>With the school year starting, parent WhatsApp groups have become a ubiquitous feature of school life, serving as a source of both vital information and significant stress.

          <p>Early in-person voting has commenced in Virginia's gubernatorial election, pitting Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears against former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger.

          <p>U.S. Northern Command is collaborating with private companies to test and demonstrate various counter-drone systems at Eglin Air Force Base. The initiative aims to find effective ways to detect and neutralize unauthorized drones near sensitive military installations, which have seen hundreds of incursions. Technologies being tested range from acoustic detection systems to interceptor drones that capture threats with nets or explosives. The effort reflects growing concern over the potential for small, commercially available drones to be used for surveillance, smuggling, or as weapons.</p>
