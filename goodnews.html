          <p>Legendary pitcher Clayton Kershaw made his final regular-season start at Dodger Stadium, receiving multiple standing ovations from a sellout crowd one day after announcing his retirement. The emotional evening celebrated his 18-year career, a journey marked by both regular-season dominance and postseason struggles that ultimately forged a deep bond with fans. Kershaw pitched 4⅓ innings in a game the Dodgers won 6-3 against the San Francisco Giants, a victory that also secured their 13th consecutive postseason berth. The event served as a heartfelt farewell and a thank you to the veteran, who has become a beloved icon for the city and franchise.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As schools resume, parent-run WhatsApp groups have become a central, yet often contentious, tool for communication. While many find them useful for reminders about school events and organizing teacher gifts, others are opting out due to the high volume of messages, competitive parenting displays, and the potential for online arguments. Some parents express concern that these groups foster unnecessary anxiety and disproportionately burden mothers with school-related administrative tasks. This article examines the dual nature of these digital forums, highlighting their capacity for both community-building and creating social stress, as shared through the experiences of various parents and a former headteacher.</p>

          <p>Defending champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson is in third place and contending for a medal with two events remaining in the world heptathlon championship in Tokyo. After recording a 6.42m long jump, she sits 167 points behind the American leader, Anna Hall, heading into the final session which includes the javelin and 800m events. The British athlete expressed some frustration over a narrowly fouled long jump attempt that would have significantly improved her position but remains focused on securing her third world title. The competition is tight, with Ireland's Kate O'Connor close behind in fourth and Olympic champion Nafi Thiam still a threat.</p>

          <p>At its largest-ever arms fair, Taiwan has highlighted its dual-strategy approach to national defense by unveiling two major projects. The exhibition featured the island's first locally developed anti-ballistic missile system, the Chiang-Kong, designed to intercept threats at altitudes up to 70 kilometers. Alongside this push for self-reliance, Taiwan also showcased a cruise missile co-developed with an American defense firm, signaling deepening cooperation with the United States. This year's Taipei Aerospace and Defence Technology Exhibition underscores Taiwan's efforts to bolster its deterrent capabilities in response to increasing military pressure from Beijing.</p>

          <p>U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) is collaborating with private companies to test and develop advanced counter-drone systems amid a rise in incursions over sensitive military facilities. During a recent demonstration at Eglin Air Force Base, various technologies were showcased, including acoustic detection systems and interceptor drones that capture hostile drones with nets. With an estimated 8,000 drones in U.S. airspace at any time and over 350 incursions reported at military sites in 2024, the Pentagon aims to establish rapid response teams to neutralize drone threats. The initiative seeks to defend against potential surveillance, smuggling, or weaponized drone attacks.</p>

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released after being detained by the Taliban for nearly eight months in Afghanistan. The couple, who had lived and worked in the country for decades, were emotionally reunited with their daughter in Doha, Qatar, following Qatari-mediated negotiations. Their family had previously raised alarms about the couple's deteriorating health and harrowing detention conditions. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the news, thanking Qatar for its vital role in securing their release. The Taliban stated the couple had broken Afghan laws but never specified the reason for their detention.</p>

          <p>A landmark global agreement to protect marine biodiversity in international waters is set to become law after reaching the required 60-nation ratification threshold. The High Seas Treaty, two decades in the making, will officially take effect in January, enabling the creation of marine protected areas in waters beyond national jurisdiction. Environmental groups have hailed this as a monumental achievement, providing a legal framework to conserve and sustainably manage the high seas, which cover over two-thirds of the ocean. The treaty is a critical step toward the global goal of protecting 30% of the world's oceans by 2030 to combat overfishing, pollution, and climate change.</p>

          <p>Recent threats of regulatory action against ABC following comments made by host Jimmy Kimmel have raised questions about the authority of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The FCC, an independent government agency, is responsible for regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. While it holds significant authority over local broadcast stations, including the issuance and renewal of licenses, it is legally barred from engaging in censorship or preventing the broadcast of a particular viewpoint. However, the requirement that stations must broadcast in the "public interest" provides the agency with broad and sometimes ambiguous enforcement leeway.</p>

          <p>Residents in South Central Texas are reporting a noticeable increase in porcupine sightings, an animal more commonly associated with the western part of the state. Recent encounters in areas like San Antonio and near the Medical Center suggest the species is expanding its range, a trend that has been observed since around 2016. While not aggressive, these "prickle pigs" are drawn to salty items like sweaty backpack straps and can be destructive to trees. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department notes their preference for rocky areas but acknowledges their growing presence across the state, prompting discussions about their potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>

          <p>Chinese companies are increasingly turning their attention to Southeast Asia as a key export market, using a trade fair in Nanning as a gateway to the region. Faced with saturated markets and slowing demand in Europe and the United States, many exporters see significant growth potential in Southeast Asia's rapidly expanding economies and large, young consumer base. This strategic pivot reflects a broader shift in global trade dynamics, as Chinese businesses seek new opportunities to expand their overseas footprint. An electric scooter manufacturer, for example, noted that while the West is nearing saturation, Southeast Asia offers immense untapped potential.</p>
