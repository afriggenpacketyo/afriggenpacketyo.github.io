        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With CD accounts maturing in a fluctuating interest rate environment, savers are faced with important decisions regarding rollovers. Banks typically auto-renew CDs at current rates, which may be lower than previous yields, prompting savers to consider their options. Experts advise comparing rates and exploring alternatives like high-yield savings accounts or investments, rather than automatically rolling over CDs. While rollovers offer convenience, a proactive approach ensures that funds remain competitive and aligned with financial goals, especially given the expectation of further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.

          <p>A framework agreement for TikTok will involve new investors alongside existing investors in ByteDance, with Oracle retaining its cloud deal with the platform, according to sources. The deal, expected to finalize within 30 to 45 days, follows concerns from lawmakers about potential Chinese government access to American user data. Commercial terms have been in place since March, but the Chinese put it on hold after Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff blitz, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Oracle has been a potential investor or buyer for months, with the White House previously selecting them to handle TikTok's data collection and software updates.</p>

While a U.S. buyer for TikTok has not been named, Oracle is a leading contender to acquire the social media app, with reports suggesting it will continue its cloud deal with TikTok. The deal aims to address concerns about TikTok's ownership and data security, with Oracle potentially handling data collection and software updates.

          <p>The Federal Reserve's upcoming rate decision is highly anticipated, with economists predicting the first cut of 2025 amidst economic uncertainty. While the labor market shows signs of distress, inflation is creeping higher due to tariffs, creating conflicting pressures on the Fed. President Trump's calls for rate cuts add to the complexity, but the Fed insists its decisions are data-driven and independent. The Fed's dual mandate to maintain low inflation and full employment requires balancing these competing goals, with economists closely watching inflation and jobs data to determine the appropriate course of action.
