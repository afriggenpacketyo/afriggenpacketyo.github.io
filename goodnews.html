        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a psychiatrist who has worked with over 3,000 young adults, parenting doesn't need to be complicated. The article suggests trusting your instincts and cultural traditions, rather than over-relying on influencers or clickbait. Parents should focus on enjoying the process and supporting their child's individual interests, rather than obsessing over developmental milestones. The most important thing is to be your real self and provide love and attention, as children need to learn how to manage their own emotions. The advice is intended to alleviate anxiety and encourage a more intuitive approach to parenting.</p>

Norris acknowledged mistakes in his final run, preventing him from surpassing Piastri's time, while Verstappen finished third, noting that Turn One was problematic for him.</p>

          <p>Ukraine urgently needs access to the ‚Ç¨300bn of frozen Russian assets, primarily held in Euroclear, to bolster its fight against Russia. Confiscating these funds would shock Putin, undermine domestic support for the war, and provide Ukraine with a psychological boost. While some fear that seizing the assets would undermine Europe's reputation as a safe haven for investors, the author argues that the situation with Russia is an extreme case and should not deter the EU from taking decisive action. The author also notes that military spending is the focus and governments are promising to ramp up their commitments.</p>
