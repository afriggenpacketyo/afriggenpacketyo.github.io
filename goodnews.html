          <p>A growing number of Labour MPs are questioning Chancellor Rachel Reeves' economic policies, particularly her welfare cuts, proposing alternative solutions such as wealth taxes and relaxed fiscal rules. A leaked memo revealed disagreements within the government, with Deputy PM Angela Rayner suggesting tax rises while Reeves focuses on welfare cuts. Some MPs advocate for restoring the 50p top tax rate and increasing capital gains tax, while others call for revising the Office for Budgetary Responsibility's remit. The article highlights increasing unease within Labour ranks as poll ratings decrease.</p>

          <p>A study reveals that UK employees work from home more than most global counterparts, averaging 1.8 days a week remotely. Hybrid working patterns have become dominant in advanced economies, particularly in English-speaking countries. Despite some companies implementing return-to-office mandates, home working levels have stabilized in the UK since 2023. A separate poll found that less than half of workers would comply with a full-time return to the office, with women and parents most likely to resist, which could mean some companies will have to adapt.</p>

          <p>Research suggests that the sensitivity of human teeth can be traced back to the exoskeletons of ancient armored fish. Scientists analyzed fossils and found similarities between the structures of ancient fish armor and vertebrate teeth. This suggests that early vertebrates used their armor to sense their environment, and our teeth inherited that ability to sense pain and temperature. The findings help explain why we experience toothaches and how our skeletons evolved.</p>
