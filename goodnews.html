          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, enabling taxpayer funds to support private school tuition for eligible students. The bill allocates $10,000 per year for most private school students, with increased support for students with disabilities and home-schooled students. Supporters, including former President Trump, hailed the bill as a victory for students and parents, while Democrats criticized it as detrimental to public schools. Critics argue that the program primarily benefits wealthier families already in private schools, diverting resources from the underfunded public education system.</p>
