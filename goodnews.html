          <p>David Hogg stepped down from his position as a Democratic National Committee (DNC) vice chair, citing a fundamental disagreement with the party's leadership regarding the role of the vice chair. Hogg will now focus on his PAC, Leaders We Deserve, which supports aligned candidates in Democratic primaries. DNC chair Ken Martin acknowledged Hogg's contributions and respected his decision, despite escalating tensions. Hogg's departure leaves Malcolm Kenyatta as the sole candidate for the male vice-chair role, with a second ballot opening for the other vice-chair position.

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration cannot deport or detain Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist arrested by immigration officers in March. Judge Michael Farbiarz paused the injunction until June 13 to allow the government time to appeal, meaning Khalil remains detained until then. The judge cited the lack of compelling interest in keeping Khalil in custody and noted that his career and reputation are being damaged. Khalil's arrest was part of a crackdown on international students protesting the Israel-Gaza war, and his case has drawn significant attention. The optimism score for this article is 55.</p>
