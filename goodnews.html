          <h2>Japan to Explore "Blue Carbon" for CO2 Capture and Storage Offshore</h2>

          <p>The Japanese government is set to initiate "blue carbon" research, focusing on capturing carbon dioxide through cultivated sea plants and storing it in the deep sea, aiming to accelerate decarbonization efforts. Coastal and ocean plants like mangroves and kelp are known to absorb and store more carbon than terrestrial vegetation, making them a key component of this initiative. The Environment Ministry will collaborate with the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology and Eneos Corp. to study seaweed behavior at considerable depths and assess the environmental impact of such projects. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon, significantly increasing its carbon capture capabilities.</p>

          <p>Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar's visit to China is expected to emphasize the growing defense and security cooperation between the two nations. Analysts suggest this visit, Dar's first overseas trip since military tensions with India, will likely be viewed by New Delhi as a show of support for Islamabad. Lin Minwang from Fudan University notes that recent skirmishes have highlighted the effectiveness of Pakistan's Chinese-made fighter jets and missiles, which could lead to deeper military collaboration.

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, rose over 18% in their Hong Kong trading debut, driven by investor confidence in the company's ability to capitalize on the booming electric vehicle market. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), reportedly making it the largest offering this year globally. CATL plans to allocate 90% of the funds raised to construct its upcoming factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients such as Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. The company's expansion into Europe coincides with increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU, which have placed punitive tariffs on EVs made in China.</p>

The Japanese government will launch offshore "blue carbon" research to capture carbon dioxide using sea plants and store it in the deep sea. Honda Motor Co. announced a 30% cut to its electric vehicle technology investment plan through fiscal 2030 due to lower-than-expected growth in the EV market. Additionally, Japan's farm minister faced criticism for saying he doesn't need to buy rice due to receiving it from supporters, amid rising rice prices. The digest also covers international news, including a phone call between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Putin that ended with little progress on a Ukraine cease-fire.</p>

          <p>A memorial bust of Jim Morrison, the lead singer of The Doors, which was stolen from his grave in Paris 37 years ago, has been recovered by French police. The statue was found during an unrelated investigation conducted by the financial and anti-corruption arm of the police. The bust, carved by Croatian artist Mladen Mikulin, was placed at Morrison's grave in the P√®re-Lachaise cemetery to mark the 10th anniversary of his death but disappeared in 1988. It remains unclear whether the bust will be returned to the grave.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's Europa League final against Tottenham is being portrayed as a pivotal moment for the club, with qualification for the Champions League at stake. Failure to win could result in missing out on over ¬£100m in revenue from tickets, broadcast money, and sponsor bonuses. This is particularly significant given United's recent financial struggles, including an annual loss of ¬£113m and debts exceeding ¬£1bn. While both United and Spurs stand to benefit from Champions League participation, the financial boost is arguably more crucial for United to address their debt and comply with Premier League profit and sustainability rules.</p>
