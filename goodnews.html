          <p>An opinion article advocates for China to shift its economic strategy from export dominance to becoming the world's largest importer within the next five to ten years. This move, discussed ahead of the 15th five-year plan, aims to foster a consumption-driven economy and address existing structural imbalances. Such a transformation would have significant geopolitical and economic implications globally, marking a pivotal evolution in China's development. This strategic reorientation is seen as crucial for China's ambition to become a modern socialist country.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Oregon issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard to Portland. The judge, a Trump appointee, found the president's determination that the situation warranted federal military intervention was "untethered to the facts," noting that protests were generally small and uneventful. This ruling, set to expire October 18, emphasizes the importance of balancing federal and state powers and the military's role in domestic law enforcement. Oregon officials hailed the decision as a "healthy check on the president."</p>
