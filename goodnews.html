          <p>A major power outage impacted southeastern France, disrupting the final day of the Cannes Film Festival and prompting a police investigation into possible arson. The outage affected approximately 160,000 households after a high-voltage line fell, hours after a fire at an electrical substation near Cannes weakened the grid. Despite the disruption, Cannes Film Festival organizers confirmed that all scheduled events, including the Palme d'Or ceremony, would proceed as planned using an independent power supply. Traffic lights were affected, causing traffic jams, and some shops remained closed until power was restored around 3 p.m. local time.</p>

          <p>President Trump delivered a commencement address at West Point, congratulating cadets and taking credit for rebuilding the U.S. military. He criticized past foreign policy decisions involving military interventions and nation-building. Trump emphasized the administration's focus on eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs from military academies, highlighting the removal of critical race theory from the curriculum. He also claimed a new peacetime recruiting record, though data suggests enlistments began rebounding before his administration. Trump's address followed Vice President Vance's speech at the U.S. Naval Academy, which emphasized a shift away from 'forever wars'.</p>

          <p>Shoaib Bashir's impressive six-wicket haul led England to a decisive victory over Zimbabwe by an innings and 45 runs in their one-off Test match. The off-spinner's performance at Trent Bridge broke Zimbabwe's resistance, dismissing them for 255 in their second innings. Despite England's win, their seam bowling was not entirely impressive on the third morning, and they collectively lacked penetration on a lifeless surface. Bashir's achievement made him the youngest England bowler to reach 50 Test wickets and the fourth to secure three five-wicket hauls before turning 22.</p>

Investors have responded positively, with Gilead's stock price rising by 6% over the past week, outperforming broader market declines.

          <p>The measles outbreak in Texas is showing signs of slowing down, but health officials warn of increasing cases in other states and emphasize the importance of maintaining vaccination efforts. Although Lubbock, Texas, has not reported new cases recently, officials caution that the outbreak is not yet over. Wastewater analyses indicate a potential decrease in infections in El Paso and Lubbock, but the danger remains due to travel and potential introduction of measles to vulnerable communities. Public health officials stress the need for vaccination campaigns to close vaccine gaps.</p>
