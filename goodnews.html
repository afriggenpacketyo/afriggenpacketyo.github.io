          <p>China's campaign to manage high levels of local government debt has seen its first major success, with Inner Mongolia being removed from a list of 12 high-risk jurisdictions. The autonomous region's exit was revealed in a local budget review, signaling progress in Beijing's efforts to control financial risks. This development comes after the central government directed these regions in September 2023 to restructure their debt. The move is a positive step in stabilizing local finances, which have been strained by declining revenue from land sales. (not investment advice)</p>

The company's overall revenues grew by 13% year-on-year, reaching 76.86 billion Danish kroner ($11.92 billion). Despite the strong performance of Wegovy, its sales of 19.53 billion kroner were slightly below analyst expectations.

          <p>Driven by a booming domestic coffee culture and a zero-tariff policy, China is strengthening its trade ties with major African coffee-producing nations like Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Uganda. This strategy aims to secure new supply chains and lock in supplies amid global trade uncertainties. Chinese companies, such as the rapidly expanding Cotti Coffee, are leading this initiative by signing deals for large-scale bean procurement and investing in local processing facilities. The move reflects China's broader effort to diversify its sources of key agricultural commodities while supporting economic development in Africa.</p>

With Norris closing in on Piastri's lead, Brown acknowledged that tension will likely grow but believes the mutual respect and open communication within the team will prevent a destructive rivalry. He stated that while he expects them to "swap paint again," he is positive they will never deliberately run each other off the track.

          <p>Dodgers infielder Max Muncy made a powerful return from a knee injury, hitting two home runs and driving in four runs in a 12-6 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. Muncy, who had been sidelined since early July, provided an immediate spark to a Dodgers lineup that had struggled in his absence. His four-hit performance demonstrated a swift recovery from an injury he initially feared could be season-ending. The dominant offensive display, which also included two home runs from Teoscar Hernández, signaled a potential turning point for the team's recently slumping offense.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks continued their recent strong performance, defeating the Indiana Fever 100-91 and snapping Indiana's five-game winning streak. The Fever were playing without their star rookie Caitlin Clark, who remains sidelined with a groin injury but was actively coaching from the bench. The Sparks, now winners of seven of their last eight games, were led by Kelsey Plum and Rickea Jackson, who each scored 25 points. With their roster finally healthy, the Sparks are gaining momentum and moving closer to securing a playoff position.</p>

          <p>The NFL and ESPN have reached a preliminary, nonbinding agreement for ESPN to acquire several NFL media assets, including the NFL Network and NFL Fantasy. As part of the deal, the NFL will receive a 10% equity stake in ESPN, which is majority-owned by Disney. The arrangement, which still requires final negotiations and regulatory approval, would integrate NFL Network into ESPN's upcoming direct-to-consumer streaming service. This move is seen as a major step to bolster ESPN's content offerings while giving the NFL a significant ownership position in the sports media giant.</p>

The potential deal would allow current and former employees to sell their shares, with existing investor Thrive Capital possibly leading the round.

The continued surge in valuation reflects intense investor interest and OpenAI's dominant position in the generative AI market, fueled by the massive success of ChatGPT. (not investment advice)</p>

These "successors" are taking on the vital role of conveying the human horror of nuclear weapons to new generations.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of the state prison in Norco by fall 2026. The decision is driven by a significant decline in the statewide inmate population and is expected to save the state $150 million annually. The facility, which houses nearly 2,800 inmates, will not release anyone early; instead, inmates and staff will be transferred to other locations. The closure raises questions about the future of the property, which originally opened in 1928 as the luxurious Lake Norconian Club hotel, a historic landmark some hope to see restored.</p>

          <p>Japanese rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki, who has been on the injured list with a shoulder impingement since an underwhelming start to the season, is showing signs of a potential comeback. The 23-year-old has progressed to facing live hitters and is scheduled for a simulated game, after which a minor-league rehab assignment is possible. The Dodgers are encouraged by adjustments he has made to his delivery and his improving fastball velocity, which has reached 96 mph in bullpen sessions. While his role is uncertain, a healthy Sasaki could provide valuable pitching depth for the team's postseason push.</p>

          <p>As China formulates its next five-year plan, a debate is emerging among its economists about whether to establish official targets for consumption. Proponents, like Chang Xiuze from a state-affiliated think tank, argue for including the "household consumption rate" as a key metric to monitor and assess, noting China's rate was a low 39.6% in 2023. This push reflects a broader strategic goal to boost domestic demand and rebalance the economy away from its reliance on investment and exports. However, other scholars question the feasibility of using such metrics as operational policy goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta, the parent company of WhatsApp, announced it has removed 6.8 million accounts in the first half of the year for their involvement in global scams. Many of these accounts were linked to criminal organizations in Southeast Asia that often use forced labor to conduct fraudulent activities like fake investment schemes. In response to the growing threat, WhatsApp is rolling out new security features to alert users of suspicious activity, such as being added to a group by an unknown contact. The company is working to proactively detect and shut down these operations before they can defraud users.</p>
