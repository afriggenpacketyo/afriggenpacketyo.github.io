          <p>Shohei Ohtani's three-run home run in the ninth inning propelled the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 14-11 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks in a high-scoring game.

          <p>The UK's Labour Party, led by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, is preparing to introduce new measures aimed at reducing net migration, which reached 728,000 last year. The proposed changes include requiring employers to invest in UK skills before hiring overseas workers, particularly in the IT and telecommunications sectors. Visa restrictions are likely to be tightened for nationalities with a high risk of overstaying and claiming asylum, such as Pakistan, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka. Migrants may also face longer waiting periods before they can apply for permanent residency, potentially extending to ten years. The government is reviewing the application of the "right to family life" in immigration cases, aiming for a clearer legal framework.</p>

          <p>Former New Labour cabinet member Lord Mandelson, now the UK's ambassador to the US, has described the recently agreed UK-US trade deal as a foundation for expanding trade opportunities between the two nations. The deal aims to reduce or eliminate tariffs that had been imposed by the Trump administration on certain UK imports, including cars, steel, and aluminum. While the UK's Digital Services Tax was discussed during negotiations, Lord Mandelson clarified that its removal was not part of the agreement. Despite ongoing pressure from the US to abolish the tax, the ambassador emphasized that the current arrangement serves British national interests.</p>

Akihito abdicated the Chrysanthemum Throne in April 2019, becoming the first Japanese monarch to do so in approximately 200 years, marking a significant transition in the country's imperial history.</p>

          <p>As US tariffs on Chinese goods reach prohibitive levels, Chinese companies are increasingly moving their manufacturing operations to Vietnam to circumvent the levies. This shift has led to a surge in Chinese exports to Southeast Asia and a rush to find Vietnamese partners. While Vietnam offers advantages such as a shared border and a young workforce, it also faces challenges in managing the influx of Chinese businesses and navigating trade relations with the US. E-commerce platforms like Shein and Alibaba are facilitating this transition, while some Chinese companies are exploring ways to conceal the origin of their products.</p>

The legal saga erupted late last year when Lively accused Baldoni, along with his team, of orchestrating a smear campaign against her after she reported on-set sexual harassment.
