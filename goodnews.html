          <h2>Scientific Guidance on Overcoming Smartphone Addiction</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 07:07:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Studies indicate a growing prevalence of smartphone addiction, which is linked to negative mental health outcomes like depression and anxiety, as well as physical issues such as sleep disturbances. Scientists suggest that overcoming this behavioral addiction requires a multi-faceted approach rather than a single quick fix. Recommended strategies include creating physical distance from the device, reducing notifications, and using self-control apps. Experts also emphasize the importance of understanding the root causes of the addiction, which can sometimes be a coping mechanism for other mental health challenges, and suggest therapies like CBT.</p>

          <p>Auburn University men's basketball coach Bruce Pearl has addressed rumors that he might run for a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama, suggesting he may not pursue a political career. Pearl questioned whether he could have a greater impact as a senator compared to his current role as a coach, where he focuses on mentoring and educating young people. He expressed skepticism about his ability to effect change within Washington's dysfunctional political environment. A fervent supporter of Israel and former President Trump, Pearl's name was floated as a potential candidate to replace Sen. Tommy Tuberville.</p>

          <h2>New U.S.-Built Naval Facilities in Philippines Could Bolster Manila's Position in South China Sea</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 07:01:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has completed the construction of new naval facilities at Oyster Bay in the Philippines, intended to enhance the maintenance and repair capabilities for the Philippine military's small watercraft. The U.S. embassy has clarified that the site is not a military base, emphasizing that all U.S. military activities are conducted in full coordination with its ally. However, analysts suggest the development will directly strengthen the Philippine Navy's operational capacity in its territorial disputes with China. The move is also seen as potentially paving the way for shared use of naval facilities by U.S. forces in the future.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people are anticipated to participate in over 1,500 'Good Trouble Lives On' events across all 50 U.S. states. The day of action, coinciding with the fifth anniversary of Congressman John Lewis's death, aims to protest the Trump administration and advocate for civil rights. Organized by dozens of advocacy groups, the events will include rallies, marches, and voter registration drives. The protests' demands focus on ending the administration's crackdowns on civil rights, voting rights, and marginalized communities, as well as opposing cuts to social programs like Medicaid and SNAP.</p>

          <p>For decades, Russ Miller, known as the 'River Cowboy,' has dedicated himself to removing thousands of discarded tires from Kentucky's rivers. Miller's grassroots efforts began in the 1980s and led to the formation of the cleanup group Friends of Red River, which tackles the pervasive issue of illegal tire dumping. Each year, an estimated one million of Kentucky's four million waste tires are unaccounted for, often ending up in waterways. While state-level resolutions now acknowledge the problem, volunteers like Miller continue to perform the grueling work of extracting tires and other trash from the state's scenic rivers.</p>

          <p>The social-gaming platform Roblox has launched an age-verification system as part of its new 'trusted connections' feature, allowing older users to engage in less-filtered chats. Users aged 13 and over can use facial-analysis software or a government ID to verify their age, granting them access to private, unfiltered conversations with other verified users they know and trust. The company stated this move is designed to provide more age-appropriate features and create a space for teens and adults to communicate openly on the platform. All conversations will still be monitored for critical safety harms.</p>

          <p>Once seen as a novelty, foldable smartphones are becoming a more appealing and viable alternative to the standard slab-of-glass design that has dominated the market for over a decade. Companies like Samsung, Motorola, and others are releasing new iterations of folding and flip phones that offer users more versatility, from compact devices for basic tasks to phone-tablet hybrids for more immersive experiences. While some tech leaders predict the smartphone's demise in favor of AI pins or AR glasses, the evolution of foldable technology suggests the smartphone will remain a central gadget for the foreseeable future, bridging the gap to what comes next.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have detailed the remarkable seed dispersal mechanism of the squirting cucumber, a toxic relative of the common cucumber. The fruit builds up internal fluid pressure until a slight disturbance causes it to burst, launching its seeds at speeds up to 30 miles per hour and distances of nearly 40 feet. Micro-CT scans and high-speed video revealed that the fruit orients itself at a perfect ballistic angle for maximum distance. The seeds are also coated in an incredibly strong adhesive, suggesting they are designed to stick to whatever they hit, potentially aiding further dispersal.</p>
