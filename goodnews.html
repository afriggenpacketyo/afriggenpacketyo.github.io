          <p>China's retail landscape is being reshaped by a fierce rivalry in the instant commerce sector, primarily between on-demand giants Meituan and Alibaba. This competition has led to significant consumer subsidies, with meal deals costing as little as one or two dollars and deliveries promised within 30 minutes. The battle has expanded beyond food delivery, as platforms now offer rapid dispatch for high-value items like Apple's latest iPhones. This evolution signifies a major transformation in Chinese retail, pushing both online and physical stores to adapt to new consumer expectations for speed and convenience.</p>

          <p>Boxers Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez and Terence "Bud" Crawford are set for an era-defining fight in Las Vegas, with both weighing in at 167.5 pounds. Crawford, who is moving up two weight classes, is aiming to become the first male boxer to be an undisputed champion in three different divisions. The bout pits Álvarez's power and experience at super middleweight against Crawford's undefeated record, speed, and tactical intelligence. While many pundits are tipping Crawford to win, questions remain about whether he can maintain his athleticism and precision at a higher weight against a naturally larger champion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the nights grow longer, several notable celestial events will be visible this autumn, beginning with the astronomical equinox on September 22. The day prior, Saturn will be at its closest point to Earth, appearing at its brightest and biggest in the sky, visible to the naked eye as a non-twinkling star. Later in the season, the Orionid meteor shower, originating from Halley's Comet, will peak around October 22. Viewing conditions for the Orionids are expected to be ideal, as the peak coincides with a new moon, minimizing light pollution and offering clear views of the fast-moving meteors.</p>

          <p>Three elderly nuns, aged 82 to 88, have defiantly fled a Catholic care home and returned to their former convent in the Austrian Alps. The nuns, who are the last remaining members of the Kloster Goldenstein convent, say they were moved to the home against their will late last year. With assistance from former students and a locksmith, they regained access to their apartments, which had been left without electricity or water. Despite disapproval from church authorities, who cite health concerns, the nuns are determined to live out their days in the home where they spent most of their lives.</p>

          <p>Gustavo Dudamel has officially begun his role as the music and artistic director designate of the New York Philharmonic, opening the orchestra's new season. His first program featured works with strong New York connections, including Bartók’s Piano Concerto No. 3 and Charles Ives’ Symphony No. 2, famously premiered by the orchestra under Leonard Bernstein. The concert also included a world premiere by Leilehua Lanzilotti, continuing a tradition Dudamel started in Los Angeles. The performance signals a new era for the orchestra, with hopes that Dudamel's celebrity and artistry can recapture the widespread attention the Philharmonic once commanded.</p>

Key advice includes understanding that nearly everyone feels nervous about making friends and that it's important to find social activities that suit one's own preferences, not just clubbing. Students also recommend joining societies to meet like-minded people, especially if you miss freshers' week. For commuting students, planning and organization are crucial, while all new students are encouraged to prioritize their mental health and not be afraid to ask for help.</p>

          <p>Apple is investing $2.5 billion in its long-time partner Corning to manufacture all glass for iPhones and Apple Watches at a factory in Kentucky. CEO Tim Cook praised Corning's innovative "ceramic shield" technology for its durability, thinness, and lightness, calling the U.S. facility a great place for the investment. Corning's CEO, Wendell Weeks, stated that Apple's funding will help triple the plant's production and increase its workforce by 50%.

          <p>The California legislature has passed Senate Bill 79, a landmark housing bill designed to override local zoning laws and permit denser, taller residential buildings near public transit hubs. The bill, which now goes to the governor, allows for buildings up to nine stories high adjacent to major train and bus lines, including in single-family neighborhoods. Proponents argue the measure is a necessary step to address the state's severe housing shortage and affordability crisis. Critics, including the Los Angeles City Council, have condemned it as a one-size-fits-all mandate that strips local control over community development.</p>
