          <p>The FBI has arrested Benjamin Song, a 32-year-old former U.S. Marine Corps reservist, in connection with a July 4th attack on an ICE detention center in Alvarado, Texas. Song had been a fugitive for nearly 11 days after allegedly participating in an organized assault with a group of about a dozen individuals. According to the criminal complaint, Song is accused of firing AR-15-style rifles at federal and local law enforcement officers, injuring one. He now faces multiple federal charges, including attempted murder of a federal officer, as authorities continue their investigation into the coordinated attack.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a new trade agreement with Indonesia, which will see Indonesian goods face a 19% tariff, a level lower than the previously threatened 32%. In exchange, the deal reportedly includes significant purchase commitments from Indonesia, including $15 billion in U.S. energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural products, and 50 Boeing aircraft. Trump stated the agreement provides the U.S. with full market access to Indonesia, marking another bilateral deal struck by the administration to reshape trade relationships. The specifics regarding the timeline for these purchases and the implementation of the new tariff rate have not yet been detailed.</p>

          <p>The long-standing public health practice of adding fluoride to drinking water is facing renewed challenges across the United States, with states like Arkansas considering repeals of their mandates. While proponents, including the CDC and American Dental Association, cite over 70 years of research showing fluoride's effectiveness in preventing tooth decay, opponents raise concerns about potential health risks at high levels. This debate has intensified following a National Institutes of Health report suggesting a link between high fluoride exposure and lower IQs in children, a conclusion some medical groups have questioned due to its limitations.</p>

          <p>Bob Becker, an 80-year-old from Florida, has made history by becoming the oldest person to officially complete the Badwater 135, a grueling ultramarathon through Death Valley. He finished the 135-mile race, which includes three mountain ascents in extreme heat, in just under the 48-hour cutoff time. This was Becker's sixth time participating, and he succeeded after a previous attempt three years ago where he finished just 17 minutes over the time limit. Becker, who only began running in his late 50s, attributes his success to focused training, a dedicated support crew, and a mindset of never stopping.</p>

          <p>At a summit in Pittsburgh, President Trump announced that 20 leading technology and energy companies will invest over $90 billion in Pennsylvania to develop a new artificial intelligence economy. The plan includes building energy-intensive data centers and an innovation hub to train workers for AI and energy sector jobs, leveraging the state's natural gas and nuclear resources. The announcement, which follows a major Amazon investment, was touted as the largest in the state's history and aims to create tens of thousands of jobs. The event drew both high-profile industry leaders and protests from activists concerned about its focus on fossil fuels.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced the withdrawal of 2,000 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, halving the military force deployed there last month amid protests against federal immigration sweeps. The deployment was initiated by President Trump against the wishes of California's governor and LA's mayor, who sued to stop what they called an unconstitutional overreach. The administration stated the troops were necessary to protect federal personnel and property during the large-scale ICE operations. Following the withdrawal, approximately 2,000 National Guard members and 700 U.S. Marines will remain in the city.</p>

          <p>Alexander Torres, who spent over 20 years in prison for a murder he did not commit, will receive a $14 million settlement from Los Angeles County. Torres was convicted based on shaky witness testimony, despite having a cast that made firing a gun unlikely and multiple witnesses placing him at his mother's birthday party. A judge declared him factually innocent in 2022 after a review prompted by the California Innocence Project and the D.A.'s Conviction Integrity Unit. The settlement resolves his lawsuit claiming sheriff's detectives failed to disclose exculpatory evidence and used suggestive identification procedures.</p>

          <h2>UK Health Review Recommends Renaming Physician Associates to 'Assistants' to Avoid Confusion</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 19:02:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should have their job titles changed to "assistants." The goal is to prevent patient confusion and clarify their distinction from fully qualified doctors. The review, prompted by safety concerns and a heated debate over the roles, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges. While created to ease doctors' workloads, the report found a lack of clear vision for how these roles should be integrated, sometimes leading them to fill gaps beyond their training without adequate supervision.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of House members has reintroduced the DIGNITY Act, a comprehensive immigration reform bill aimed at addressing border security and the status of undocumented immigrants. The bill proposes a "Dignity Program" that would offer a seven-year path to legal status for immigrants who have been in the U.S. for at least five years, pass background checks, and pay restitution. The reintroduction comes as the Trump administration's mass deportation program faces legal challenges and protests. Proponents argue the legislation provides a necessary alternative to the current cycle of amnesty versus deportation, benefiting families and the economy.</p>

          <p>The world-famous Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set to close in 2027 for an ambitious five-year renovation project costing £50 million. The historic Victorian glasshouse, which opened in 1848, requires extensive repairs due to rusting ironwork caused by its internal tropical rainforest environment. The project involves replacing 16,000 panes of glass and carefully relocating 1,300 plants, some of which are centuries old. A key goal of the makeover is to upgrade the heating system to air and water source heat pumps, making the landmark building net-zero in emissions.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an advert for Trip drinks for making unauthorized health claims that its product can help people feel calm and reduce anxiety. The watchdog found that the ad's language, including phrases like "crafted for calm," implied benefits that are not permitted on the national register for food and supplement marketing. The ruling also noted that claims about the drink's ingredients reducing stress hormones were in breach of advertising codes. Trip, a popular non-alcoholic CBD brand, stated it has removed the claims while it seeks further advice.</p>
