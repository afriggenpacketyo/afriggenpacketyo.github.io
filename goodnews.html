          <p>A small clinic in Buffalo, New York, is demonstrating remarkable success in treating Hepatitis C, a disease affecting millions of Americans. La Bodega, a clinic at Erie County Medical Center, employs a model that provides diagnosis and treatment in a single visit, curing about 98% of its more than 7,000 patients. This approach contrasts with the slow national progress in treating the disease, despite curative drugs being available for over a decade. The clinic's success, which significantly reduces long-term medical costs, is now inspiring a bipartisan federal bill aimed at eliminating Hepatitis C nationwide.</p>

          <p>ESPN is reportedly finalizing a major deal with the National Football League to acquire key media properties, including the NFL Network and the popular RedZone channel. In exchange for these assets, the NFL would receive an equity stake in ESPN potentially worth billions of dollars, estimated to be as high as 10%. The agreement, which would also grant ESPN more regular-season games and access to the NFL's fantasy football operations, is expected to be announced soon. This strategic partnership comes as ESPN prepares to launch its direct-to-consumer streaming service and would require regulatory approval before completion.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate successfully advanced a package of three government spending bills late Friday, breaking a partisan stalemate and taking a crucial step toward avoiding a potential government shutdown. The bills, which fund military construction, veterans' affairs, agriculture, the FDA, and the legislative branch, passed after leaders found a path forward despite various roadblocks. This marks the first time since 2018 that the chamber has passed appropriations bills before September. The legislation now moves to the House, where it faces resistance from Republicans who object to the spending levels, setting the stage for further negotiations ahead of the September 30 funding deadline.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles-based band Ozomatli, known for its long history of social activism, has announced it will perform at a large-scale protest this Saturday at Grand Park. This performance is part of a series of demonstrations organized to oppose the current administration's policies, particularly concerning immigration and human rights. The group, which recently performed at another protest from the back of a truck, views its music as a tool for mobilization and expressing solidarity with affected communities. In a statement, the band called for people to join them to "make this moment important" in a critical time for democracy.</p>

          <p>India and China are showing signs of a diplomatic thaw after years of heightened tensions following a deadly border clash. New Delhi recently resumed issuing visas to Chinese citizens, a move Beijing welcomed, which followed China's decision to allow Indian pilgrims back into Tibet. Direct flights between the two nations, suspended during the pandemic, are also expected to resume soon. These measures suggest a potential move past the deep-seated mistrust that has defined their relationship. However, analysts caution that the unresolved Himalayan border dispute remains a significant obstacle to a full normalization of ties between the two Asian powers.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers Bolster Roster with Bullpen and Outfield Additions at Trade Deadline</h2>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made several moves to strengthen their roster ahead of the trade deadline, acquiring right-handed relievers Brock Stewart and Paul Gervase and outfielder Alex Call. Manager Dave Roberts stated that while not blockbuster trades, these additions raise the overall floor of the ballclub. Stewart, a former Dodger, returns as a high-leverage relief option, while Call provides versatile depth in the outfield. The front office hopes these new players will complement the existing star-studded core, which they believe must perform more consistently for the team to succeed in the final stretch of the season.</p>

          <p>At an internal meeting, social media giant ByteDance revealed that the median service length for its current employees is 2.9 years. The Beijing-based company, which owns TikTok and its Chinese counterpart Douyin, shared the data to counter online speculation that its average staff tenure was much shorter. According to sources at the town hall, about half of the firm's 120,000 employees have been with the company for over three years. These figures suggest that ByteDance has a relatively stable workforce compared to the high turnover rates often seen in China's demanding tech industry.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Secretary has indicated that recent negotiations with Chinese officials in Stockholm have advanced trade talks between the two nations. In a social media post, the secretary expressed optimism about the path forward, stating that the discussions have laid the groundwork for a potential deal that would benefit both countries. This positive signal comes after a period of tense trade relations. However, the administration has delivered mixed messages, and it remains unclear if specific agreements, such as an extension of the current pause on new tariff increases, have been finalized.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals who have been living and working legally in the U.S., some for decades. The judge found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing that the administration's decision was "preordained" and potentially motivated by racial animus. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling and stated its intention to appeal.</p>

          <p>An Ohio woman is engaged in a unique legal battle with a car dealership that repossessed her vehicle just one month after she purchased it. After the repossession, Tiah McCreary discovered that Taylor Kia of Lima had failed to renew its business trade name with the state. Seizing the opportunity, she registered the name for herself and then sued the dealership for fraud and for using what was now legally her trade name. An appeals court recently sided with McCreary, ruling that the trade name dispute is a separate issue from the car purchase and can be heard in court.</p>

          <p>Former Wales winger Louis Rees-Zammit has announced his decision to end his pursuit of an NFL career and return to rugby union. After spending 18 months with the Kansas City Chiefs and Jacksonville Jaguars through the NFL's International Player Pathway Program, the 24-year-old did not play in a regular-season game. Rees-Zammit stated he has received "a load of interest" from rugby clubs and expects to find a new team soon.

          <p>Veteran wide receiver Keenan Allen is reportedly meeting with the Los Angeles Chargers to discuss a potential reunion with his former team. Allen, a six-time Pro Bowl selection, was traded to the Chicago Bears last year as a salary-cap casualty after 11 seasons with the Chargers. The potential signing makes sense for Los Angeles, which is in need of an experienced receiver following the recent retirement of Mike Williams. A return would reunite Allen with quarterback Justin Herbert, with whom he had a productive on-field partnership for several seasons.</p>
