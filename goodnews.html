          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 15:09:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CoreWeave's CEO, Michael Intrator, addressed concerns about the company's capital expenditure plans, emphasizing that the substantial investment is driven by significant demand from major hyperscalers for AI infrastructure. In its first earnings report since going public, CoreWeave projected a substantial capital expenditure for the year, exceeding analyst expectations, which Intrator attributes to the company's success in securing contracts and meeting urgent client needs. He also reassured investors that financing remains robust, with lenders continuing to support the company's growth. The company has a growing list of clients, including Microsoft and Nvidia, and recently signed a deal with OpenAI for a five-year commitment of nearly $12 billion, followed by an additional $4 billion deal.</p>

          <p>A second air traffic control facility in Colorado experienced a 90-second communications outage, raising safety concerns after recent disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport. Controllers in Colorado used another frequency to relay instructions to pilots, ensuring aircraft remained safely separated, and the FAA is investigating the incident. This outage follows telecommunications failures at a Philadelphia facility that affected flights at Newark. Federal officials are working to upgrade the aging technology and install a third fiber-optic line at the Philadelphia facility to minimize future disruptions, but the Transportation Secretary, Sean Duffy, said the technology is in desperate need of upgrading.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement to lift sanctions on Syria, the country is experiencing a wave of optimism, but uncertainty remains regarding the extent and conditions of the relief. The end of US sanctions could bring economic relief and reconstruction, potentially encouraging the return of Syrian refugees. However, it is unclear if the sanctions relief will be limited to specific sectors or subject to certain conditions, and Trump has urged Syria to do several things, including signing onto the Abraham Accords and removing foreign terrorists. The article explores the potential impact of these changes on Syria's stability, relations with Israel, and the return of refugees.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article suggests three insurance policies that seniors should consider this spring to enhance their financial protection: Medicare supplemental insurance, long-term care insurance, and whole life insurance. Medicare supplemental insurance can cover costs not fully covered by traditional Medicare, while long-term care insurance can help with expenses related to nursing homes or in-home care. Whole life insurance offers a cash component and provides benefits to beneficiaries after death, and the article emphasizes that prices for these policies generally increase with age, making it advantageous for seniors to explore their options sooner rather than later.

          <p>A new genetics study has traced prehistoric human migration from Asia to North and South America, providing insights into the ancestral origins of Indigenous groups. The study suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers. Researchers sequenced genomes from various ethnic groups and found that the early settlers split into groups that became isolated in different environments, leading to genetic and cultural diversity, and the researcher cited an "urgent case" involving the Kaw√©sqar people of Patagonia, whose population and 6000-year-old cultural heritage is in danger of disappearing.</p>

Powell's remarks suggest the Fed is prepared to maintain higher interest rates to manage inflation and support employment, and he noted the likelihood that tariffs will slow growth and boost inflation.</p>

Additionally, investors were disappointed by the lack of planned share buybacks for the remainder of the year, as management is prioritizing debt reduction. The company needs to clear the air on this Harkey incident and deliver a quick resolution, as the market tends to punish exploration and production firms like Coterra when there are doubts about the quality of their inventory.

Smith seeks to emulate Joe Rogan's influence, aiming for widespread media ubiquity and impact, while remaining a sports-talker. Smith's approach involves addressing diverse political viewpoints, often challenging Democratic narratives, and leveraging his existing platform to engage a broader audience. Smith's political thrill-seeking, and its wide embrace across the political industrial complex, says as much about the overlapping worlds of news and entertainment as it says about him.</p>
