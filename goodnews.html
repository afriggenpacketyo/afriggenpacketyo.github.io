The win marks Sri Lanka's first of the tournament and moves them level on points with India and New Zealand. Conversely, the defeat eliminates Bangladesh from the competition after their fifth consecutive loss.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-20 13:02:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Metropolitan Police in London has announced a policy change to no longer investigate non-crime hate incidents, aiming to focus officer resources on actual criminal matters. This decision was revealed as the force dropped its probe into "Father Ted" creator Graham Linehan, who was arrested on suspicion of inciting violence through social media posts. The new policy is intended to provide clearer direction for officers and reduce ambiguity in policing online debates. Non-crime hate incidents are acts perceived as hostile but do not meet the legal threshold for a criminal offense.</p>

          <p>Millions participated in the nationwide "No Kings" demonstrations, which, despite predictions of violence from some Republican leaders, were largely peaceful and even jubilant in tone. The article suggests these protests mark a shift in the anti-Trump movement, characterized by a mix of principled opposition and irreverent humor, uniting a broad and diverse coalition. Unlike the more self-serious resistance of Trump's first term, this movement appears to be a popular front focused on restoring democratic norms. The peaceful nature of the events defied attempts to cast the opposition as violent extremists.</p>

          <p>A new art exhibition in Los Angeles is showcasing 18 decommissioned Confederate monuments, including a statue of General Robert E. Lee from Charlottesville that has been melted down into bronze ingots. The "Monuments" exhibit juxtaposes these controversial historical artifacts with contemporary art to confront the legacy of white supremacy and the "Lost Cause" ideology. The show, curated by Hamza Walker, aims to reframe the narrative surrounding these figures who fought to preserve slavery. It presents a powerful artistic response to the ongoing national debate over historical memory and public symbols.</p>

          <h2>Pundit Argues Recent Outbursts May Not Derail Katie Porter's Gubernatorial Campaign</h2>

          <p>Despite recent controversy over her irritable behavior in an interview and a leaked video of her berating a staffer, an opinion article suggests it may be premature to count out Katie Porter's campaign for California governor. While acknowledging that female candidates are often held to a higher standard, the author posits that voters may forgive her temper if they value her reputation as a "whiteboard warrior" and a fighter for consumers. The incidents have given rivals an opening and cemented her reputation as a difficult boss, but they have also raised her profile in a previously quiet race.</p>

          <h2>European Clinical Trials Suggest Cannabis is More Effective Than Opioids for Low Back Pain</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-20 12:09:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two major European clinical trials have found that a full-spectrum cannabis oil was more effective than a placebo for treating chronic low back pain and offered better relief with fewer side effects than opioids. One study showed patients using the cannabis tincture experienced better pain relief and sleep compared to those on opioids. These findings are considered "groundbreaking" by some researchers, as large-scale clinical trials on cannabis are difficult to conduct in the U.S. due to its legal status. The German company behind the drug hopes for European approval soon, providing a new evidence base for medical cannabis.</p>

          <p>Shares of steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs jumped significantly after the company announced it is exploring the possibility of mining for rare earths at two of its sites in Michigan and Minnesota. CEO Lourenco Goncalves stated that geological surveys show potential for commercially viable deposits, aligning the company with the U.S. national strategy for critical mineral independence. This move comes as the U.S. seeks to reduce its reliance on China, which dominates the global rare earth supply chain and recently announced new export controls on the crucial materials.

          <p>Despite facing significant challenges from tariffs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions, the U.S. automotive industry has proven more resilient than many analysts initially predicted for 2025. While costs and chaos persist, industry sales and production have held up better than expected, leading some firms to upgrade their sector outlook from negative to neutral. Automakers are navigating a difficult balancing act, with tariff costs being partially offset by deregulation and stable consumer spending. However, headwinds remain, including slowing demand, stress in subprime auto lending, and uncertainty surrounding the EV transition. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>McVitie's Penguin and Club bars are now labeled as "chocolate flavour" instead of chocolate, as the manufacturer has reduced the cocoa content in their coating. The change was prompted by a dramatic surge in cocoa prices, driven by poor harvests in West Africa, forcing owner Pladis to use cheaper alternatives like palm or shea butter. Under UK regulations, a product must contain at least 20% cocoa solids to be legally classified as milk chocolate. The company states that consumer sensory testing shows the new coating delivers the same taste as the original.</p>

          <p>The annual Medicare open enrollment period is underway, allowing beneficiaries to adjust their coverage through December 7. While the ongoing federal government shutdown is not halting the process, experts advise beneficiaries to be cautious and potentially wait before finalizing their 2026 plans, as access to information and support staff via the 1-800-Medicare hotline may be delayed. This year, it is particularly important for individuals to review their options, as some private Medicare Advantage plans are changing their provider networks and prescription drug coverage, which could significantly impact out-of-pocket costs.</p>

          <p>Rangers has appointed former Sheffield Wednesday manager Danny Rohl as its new head coach, concluding a lengthy search following the dismissal of Russell Martin. The 36-year-old German signed a two-and-a-half-year contract and stated he is ready to embrace the "huge expectations" at the club. The appointment comes after talks with other candidates, including former manager Steven Gerrard and Kevin Muscat, were unsuccessful. Rangers currently sit sixth in the Scottish Premiership, and the club's leadership expressed confidence that Rohl's experience can help restore momentum and success.</p>

          <p>For the first time, Japan has approved the over-the-counter sale of an emergency contraceptive pill, a significant step for women's reproductive health in the country. The "morning-after" pill, which was previously available only by prescription, will now be accessible at pharmacies where it must be taken in the presence of a pharmacist. This move follows years of debate and a successful trial sale, bringing Japan in line with over 90 other countries where the medication is available without a prescription. Campaigners have long argued that prescription requirements created barriers for many women.</p>
