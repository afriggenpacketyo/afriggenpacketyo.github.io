          <p>Israel's Prime Minister has ordered a halt to offensive military actions in Gaza, permitting only defensive measures in a significant de-escalation. This decision follows Hamas's conditional acceptance of a U.S.-proposed peace plan, which Israel is treating as a basis for negotiation. An Israeli negotiating team is preparing to depart, possibly for Cairo, with the release of all hostages being a top priority. The move is being made in full coordination with the U.S. administration to advance the peace process.</p>

          <p>Italian researchers have proposed a controversial theory that Venice's famous bronze Lion of St Mark was originally a Chinese tomb guardian from the Tang dynasty. Stylistic comparisons and lead isotope testing suggest the statue's materials and features align with Chinese artifacts from over 1,000 years ago. The study speculates it may have been transported to Venice by the family of explorer Marco Polo, though some Chinese scholars dispute this surprising origin story.</p>

          <p>The film "The Smashing Machine," starring Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, chronicles the tumultuous life of former MMA heavyweight champion Mark Kerr. The article details Kerr's rise to dominance in the late 1990s, his subsequent fall due to opioid addiction and alcoholism, and his long road to sobriety. The project, based on a 2002 documentary of the same name, revives a connection between Kerr and Johnson that began decades ago and offers the retired fighter a second chance at public recognition.</p>

          <p>The airline industry is grappling with the transition to sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) as a key strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. While EU and UK mandates require a growing percentage of SAF use, some airline executives express deep skepticism about meeting these targets due to supply and cost issues. Despite challenges, including policy shifts and production hurdles, proponents insist SAF is essential and that progress is being made, albeit in what is described as a "lumpy transition."</p>

          <p>Renowned mountain athlete Kilian Jornet has successfully climbed the 73 highest mountains in the contiguous United States, all above 14,000 feet, in just 31 days. The "States of Elevation" project involved Jornet cycling between the peaks across six states and then running up each one. This feat is equivalent to a daily marathon and Tour de France stage. The endeavor showcases Jornet's extreme endurance and his artistic approach to finding "the most aesthetic line" through the American wilderness.</p>

          <p>Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected former Economic Security Minister Sanae Takaichi as its new president, making her the likely next prime minister. This marks a historic moment, as she is set to become the country's first female leader in a nation with significant gender inequality. Takaichi, a conservative, replaces the outgoing prime minister as the LDP seeks to regain public trust after recent election losses. A parliamentary vote will formally confirm her role.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, poised to become Japan's first female prime minister, is an ultra-conservative figure within the male-dominated Liberal Democratic Party. An admirer of Margaret Thatcher and a protégé of former leader Shinzo Abe, she supports traditional gender roles, opposes same-sex marriage, and holds revisionist views on wartime history. While her election is historic, her conservative stances raise concerns among experts that she may not advance women's rights and could complicate relations with neighboring countries.</p>

Her leadership comes as the party seeks to recover from scandals and election defeats, but her hardline conservative views may challenge party unity and broader popular appeal.</p>

          <p>With Sunderland's return to the Premier League, former manager Peter Reid looks back on "Premier Passions," a 1998 BBC documentary that chronicled the club's dramatic 1996-97 season.

          <p>The first supermoon of 2025, known as the Harvest Moon, is set to appear on the night of October 7th. A supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides with its closest approach to Earth, making it appear larger and brighter than usual. This event will be the first of three consecutive supermoons in the last quarter of the year. The name "Harvest Moon" is given to the full moon closest to the autumn equinox, which traditionally provided extra light for farmers.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests President Trump's decision to accept Hamas's conditional response to his peace plan is a pragmatic, deal-making move aimed at ending the two-year conflict. Despite the response falling short of full acceptance, Trump framed it as a breakthrough and immediately called on Israel to halt its bombing of Gaza. This puts significant pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and reflects Trump's desire for a diplomatic victory, driven by evolving U.S. public opinion and his foreign policy goals.</p>
