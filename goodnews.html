          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, has formed over the central Atlantic. Current forecasts predict the storm will intensify into a hurricane over the weekend but is expected to remain over open waters, tracking north of the Caribbean. While the system may pass east of Bermuda next week, it is not projected to pose a direct threat to land. This season has been quieter than initially predicted by NOAA, with Gabrielle being one of few named storms to form.</p>

A trade fair in Nanning is serving as a key platform for these exporters to connect with buyers from the region, which is seen as having immense potential due to its large population and fast-growing economies. This strategic shift reflects a broader trend of Chinese businesses seeking new growth opportunities and diversifying their international footprints beyond traditional Western markets.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has thrown out a $15 billion defamation lawsuit filed by President Trump against The New York Times, criticizing the complaint as an improper "political document" rather than a serious legal filing. The judge ruled that the 85-page suit was excessively long and filled with language unsuited for a legal complaint. While the case was dismissed on procedural grounds, Trump's legal team has been given 28 days to file an amended, more concise complaint that adheres to professional standards.</p>
