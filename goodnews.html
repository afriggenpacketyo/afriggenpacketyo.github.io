          <p>President Trump underwent a scheduled follow-up evaluation at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, just six months after his annual physical. His physician, Capt. Sean Barbabella, stated that advanced imaging, laboratory testing, and preventive health assessments were successfully completed, confirming his excellent overall health, with his cardiac age appearing approximately 14 years younger than his chronological age. The visit also included his annual flu and an updated COVID-19 booster vaccination, as he prepares for an upcoming trip to the Middle East following a peace deal announcement. This article notes previous health readouts, including minor sun damage and scarring from a 2024 assassination attempt, and a recent diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency.</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed timeline of the months-long efforts to broker the Israel-Hamas peace deal, culminating in a ceasefire and initial hostage release. Key moments included Hamas accepting a new ceasefire proposal in August 2025, subsequent "wordsmithing" of a 20-point plan by U.S. officials with Qatari and other Arab leaders, and an apology from Israeli Prime Prime Minister Netanyahu for a strike in Doha. The negotiations intensified in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, where the deal was separated into two phases: a hostage-prisoner swap and an "almost permanent ceasefire" pending further discussions on Gaza's future governance and demilitarization. The process, driven by President Trump's team, aimed to address the widespread impact of the conflict on Gazans and build trust among distrustful parties.</p>

          <p>Maria Corina Machado, a leading figure in Venezuela's pro-democracy movement, expressed that her Nobel Peace Prize signifies to her fellow Venezuelans that "we are not alone" in their struggle. Machado, known as Venezuela's "Iron Lady," has challenged authoritarian leaders for over two decades, leading a massive political movement despite living in hiding due to threats from President Nicolas Maduro's regime. The Norwegian Nobel Committee recognized her for "keeping the flame of democracy burning amidst a growing darkness," an achievement she humbly attributes to the entire society. She believes the award offers crucial protection and globally highlights the importance of Venezuela's fight for freedom, expressing gratitude to President Trump for his support.</p>

Historically, Hong Kong has thrived by meeting the mainland's financing demands, and this trend presents a new "tremendous opportunity" for the city. Wang, also an adviser to the Hong Kong Chief Executive, emphasized the necessity for the city to design specialized financial frameworks focusing on technology sectors to support the capital requirements of global companies. This strategic alignment is crucial for maintaining its premier status in the global financial landscape and leveraging its unique position.</p>

          <p>California has designated the giant garter snake as its new state reptile, a move aimed at raising awareness and bolstering conservation efforts for the endangered species. This semi-aquatic snake, native to the Central Valley, faces extinction due to habitat destruction and climate change, despite adapting to artificial waterways like irrigation canals. Conservationists, like Michael Starkey of Save the Snakes, hope this official recognition will inspire public action and future generations to protect the species, drawing parallels to Hawaii's Nēnē goose, which rebounded after similar state recognition. The article highlights the urgency, noting that California's grizzly bear became the state animal only after its extinction in the region.</p>

          <p>An Oklahoma high school girls basketball team, the Academy of Classical Christian Studies, voluntarily returned its division championship trophy after their coach, Brendan King, discovered a scoring error. After a buzzer-beater seemingly secured their victory, King reviewed game tape and realized his team had actually lost by one point. Despite league rules stating the score was final, the team unanimously decided to appeal their own win, believing it "would have felt wrong" to keep the trophy. This unprecedented act of sportsmanship, lauded by the opposing Apache High School, is celebrated as a powerful teaching moment about integrity and character, bringing hope that "there are still good people in this world."</p>

          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old military horse from the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, has retired to a sanctuary after sustaining injuries during a chaotic incident in central London. Quaker was one of five horses spooked by construction work in April last year, leading them to bolt through the streets, colliding with vehicles and causing injuries to both animals and service personnel. Quaker suffered bleeding and a small break, necessitating surgery and subsequent rehabilitation at the Horse Trust sanctuary in Buckinghamshire. While four other horses returned to duty, Quaker's welfare necessitated permanent retirement, ensuring he can enjoy a peaceful life. The Horse Trust, founded nearly 140 years ago to aid London's working horses, provides a permanent home for former military horses.</p>

The operation, which took place on February 24 near the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea, also led to the arrest of seven suspects. This massive interdiction marks the largest single maritime drug seizure in the Asia-Pacific region in recent years, demonstrating strengthened cooperation among the three nations in combating illicit drug trade. Representatives from their respective anti-drug agencies have since met to discuss further collaboration and deepen efforts to dismantle the networks of drug trafficking syndicates operating behind the scenes.</p>

Passports bearing Queen Elizabeth II's coat of arms will remain valid until their expiry. This change aligns with the gradual introduction of the King's insignia on various national items since his ascension in 2022, utilizing existing stocks to ensure a smooth transition. The new passports will also incorporate updated anti-forgery security features, enhancing their global security and trustworthiness.</p>

          <p>Apple is in late-stage discussions to acquire key talent and technology from Prompt AI, a computer vision startup, in a move to bolster its AI research and development. Prompt AI, founded in 2023, developed the Seemour app, which adds sophisticated detection capabilities to home security cameras. While the technology was effective, the business model proved unsustainable, leading to the app's retirement. This acquisition, an "acqui-hire," is typical for Apple, which historically prefers smaller team acquisitions over large ones. The talent and technology from Prompt AI are expected to be integrated into Apple's HomeKit smart home division, potentially enhancing its computer vision capabilities, especially given its recent focus on Vision Pro.</p>

          <p>Navan, a developer of corporate travel and expense software, has set its initial public offering (IPO) price range, expecting a market capitalization of up to $6.5 billion. The company anticipates selling shares at $24 to $26 each, a valuation about $3 billion less than its private valuation in 2022, which reflects current market conditions. Navan's IPO contributes to a resurgence in tech IPOs this year, following a three-year drought, despite the recent government shutdown impacting SEC operations. The Palo Alto-based company, founded in 2015, reported a $38.6 million net loss on $172 million in revenue for the July quarter, marking a 29% year-over-year increase, and is a recognized disruptor in its sector.

          <p>This article offers an in-depth analysis of President Trump's unconventional diplomatic approach that led to the Israel-Hamas peace deal. Leveraging strong ties with Israel and Arab nations, Trump's team, including Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, orchestrated a 20-point plan for a ceasefire and prisoner swap, despite initial Israeli hardliner resistance. The article highlights Trump's "bellicosity in service of peace" and his willingness to pressure Netanyahu, particularly after an Israeli strike in Qatar. While acknowledging the "exhaustion factor" on both sides, the article details the complex negotiations, the role of international mediators, and the plan for an "International Stabilization Force" in Gaza, though challenges remain for lasting peace.</p>
