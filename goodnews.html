        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The architectural and urban planning ideals long championed by King Charles are reportedly inspiring a new generation of towns set to be developed in England. Government officials have outlined plans for 12 new towns that will prioritize walkability, environmental sustainability, and "gentle density" housing like terraces instead of high-rise buildings. This approach aligns with the King's philosophy, which once drew criticism but is now seen as mainstream, emphasizing community-focused design and harmony with the local environment. Proponents argue this shift moves away from car-centric, isolating designs toward creating more humane and connected living spaces.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Oberlin, Ohio high school is offering a program called "Men's Work" to provide a unique space for teenage boys to openly discuss their struggles and challenge modern definitions of masculinity. Led by the founder of the organization Hey Brother, the sessions aim to counteract harmful online messaging from the "manosphere" and address the societal pressures young men face. Research indicates that teen boys are significantly less comfortable than girls discussing their mental health, making such initiatives critical. The program encourages emotional expression and provides positive male role models to help students navigate their feelings in a healthy and constructive way.</p>

          <p>During a recent Philadelphia Phillies game, a 9-year-old boy named Jameson Pennings demonstrated remarkable generosity after catching a coveted foul ball. After cherishing the ball for several innings, he learned that a nearby fan, Donna Morey, was celebrating her 80th birthday at the game. Realizing she might not have many more opportunities to attend a game, Jameson decided to give her his prized possession as a birthday gift. The heartwarming gesture, which surprised both his parents and the recipient, has been celebrated as a symbol of kindness and selflessness in a moment of pure sports joy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed his administration to declassify all federal records pertaining to the 1937 disappearance of aviator Amelia Earhart. The enduring mystery of what happened to Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, during their attempt to circumnavigate the globe has captivated the public for decades. This move follows a request from a lawmaker representing the Northern Mariana Islands, citing theories that Earhart may have been taken into custody by the Japanese on the island of Saipan. While most historians believe she crashed in the Pacific Ocean after running out of fuel, the declassification aims to shed light on any classified government information about the incident.</p>

          <h2>Thousands of Lightning Strikes Illuminate Southern California Amid Forecasts of Rain</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 20:11:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Southern California experienced a dramatic weather event as thousands of lightning strikes were recorded over a 48-hour period. The National Weather Service reported at least 2,000 strikes from the Channel Islands to the Central Coast, with most of the thunderstorm activity occurring over the Pacific Ocean. This unusual electrical storm is attributed to a slow-moving low-pressure system that has trapped moisture in the region. Forecasters anticipate that this system will bring the potential for more wet weather, including isolated showers and thunderstorms, to the area over the weekend, with the highest chances for rain in interior valleys and mountains.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Comic Con is launching the "Stan Lee Experience," featuring an AI-powered holographic avatar of the late comic book icon. The interactive exhibit will allow attendees to ask questions and engage with the digital likeness of Stan Lee, which has been trained on decades of his interviews, writings, and public appearances. The project, developed by companies Proto Inc. and Hyperreal, aims to preserve Lee's legacy and his celebrated interactions with fans. While described as an avatar rather than a true hologram, the technology uses a large language model to generate responses in Lee's voice and style, offering a new way to connect with his creative universe.</p>

          <p>Police in Attleboro, Massachusetts, have determined that a couple fabricated a story about finding an abandoned Yorkshire Terrier puppy on the side of the road. The husband and wife had left the 6-month-old dog at a convenience store, claiming it was in a cage with a "free" sign. An investigation using surveillance footage revealed the wife had received the dog from a coworker, but her husband refused to keep it. While no charges will be filed, the incident sparked concern for the animal's welfare; the puppy was found to be in good health and will be put up for adoption.</p>

          <p>Team Europe delivered a stunning performance on the opening day of the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black, securing a commanding 5.5 to 2.5 lead over the United States. The European squad won both the morning foursomes and afternoon fourball sessions, asserting their dominance early in the competition on American soil. Key players like Jon Rahm and Tommy Fleetwood were instrumental in securing crucial points, while top American players, including world number one Scottie Scheffler, ended the day without a win. This strong start gives Europe a significant advantage as they aim to win the Ryder Cup away from home for the first time since 2012.</p>

          <p>The upcoming APEC summit in South Korea is being viewed as a crucial stage for international diplomacy, particularly concerning tensions on the Korean peninsula. With both the U.S. and Chinese presidents expected to attend, the event could facilitate high-level talks, potentially including a summit between the U.S. and North Korea, with China and South Korea acting as mediators. This analysis comes after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's recent visit to China, which is seen as a strategic move to re-engage with multilateral diplomacy. The back-to-back hosting of APEC by South Korea and then China presents a unique opportunity to foster regional cooperation.</p>

          <p>Sinclair and Nexstar, two of the largest owners of local TV stations, have announced they will resume broadcasting "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on their ABC affiliates. The companies had preempted the late-night show for nearly a week following controversial comments made by the host about a conservative activist's death. This decision followed a temporary suspension of the program by Disney's ABC network. The broadcasters stated their decision was independent of government influence and came after receiving feedback from viewers and community leaders, ending a standoff that had raised questions about free speech and media influence.</p>
