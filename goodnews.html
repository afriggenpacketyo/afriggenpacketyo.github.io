          <p>A federal judge ordered Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts doctoral candidate, to be released on bail from immigration custody, citing concerns that her First Amendment and due process rights were violated. Ozturk was detained after the Trump administration revoked her student visa, reportedly due to an opinion piece she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. Judge Sessions emphasized the lack of evidence beyond the op-ed as justification for her detention, raising significant concerns about freedom of expression.

A Gaelic Players Association survey revealed that 70% of players experience discomfort wearing skorts, and 83% desire the option to wear shorts. While some argue it's a minor issue compared to broader concerns in women's sports, many players view the rule as sexist and uncomfortable.</p>
