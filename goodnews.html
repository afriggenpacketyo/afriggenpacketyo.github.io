          <p>NHS England will be the first country to roll out a gonorrhoea vaccine, primarily targeting gay and bisexual men with a history of multiple sexual partners or STIs. The vaccine, repurposed from a meningitis B vaccine, has a 30-40% effectiveness rate. This initiative aims to combat soaring gonorrhoea infection rates, which have reached their highest levels since 1918. The program could prevent 100,000 cases and save the NHS nearly ¬£8 million over the next decade, while also addressing concerns about antibiotic-resistant strains of the disease.</p>
