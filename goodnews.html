          <p>A new mural in Redondo Beach, California, is generating discussion by depicting the late Lakers icon Kobe Bryant in a Dodgers jersey instead of his traditional purple and gold. The artwork is part of a larger piece celebrating the Dodgers' 2024 World Series win and was created by artist Gustavo Zermeño Jr. While some fans have questioned the alteration of the iconic image, the artist explained it was a creative choice to honor both the Dodgers' victory and Bryant's famous Mamba mentality.</p>

After its parent company collapsed in 2020, the brand was bought by online retailer Asos but is now aiming to recapture its former glory and appeal to both nostalgic millennials and a new Gen-Z audience. Industry experts note the brand faces challenges in a competitive market but could fill a gap for a "London girl look" if it successfully revives its trendsetting edge.</p>
