          <p>The Scottish Parliament is set to vote on a bill that would legalize assisted dying for terminally ill adults, marking the third time such a proposal has been considered. The bill requires two doctors to assess a patient's mental fitness before allowing them to seek medical assistance to end their life. Supporters argue this is a progressive step to alleviate suffering, while opponents express concerns about safeguarding vulnerable individuals. The vote is expected to be close, with the Scottish government remaining neutral on the matter.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This week's inflation report will provide initial insights into the impact of President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs on U.S. prices. Economists anticipate a slight cooldown in inflation, despite initial fears of price hikes due to the tariffs, although many analysts expect a resurgence in inflation as retailers restock inventory with tariffed goods. The article notes that Trump has since paused some tariffs, including those on China, which is expected to reduce the average cost of tariffs per household. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that sustained tariffs could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth.</p>

          <p>News of temporary tariff cuts on Chinese imports has brought relief to U.S. businesses but also triggered a scramble to expedite shipments before the tariffs potentially rise again in 90 days.

While a 30% import tax is more manageable than the previous 145%, some of the cost will likely be passed on to consumers.

          <p>Fintech firms, which initially benefited from rising interest rates, now face a test as rates decline, raising doubts about the sustainability of relying on net interest income. Fintechs like Robinhood, Revolut, and Monzo saw profit boosts in 2024 due to higher net interest income, but lower rates may expose vulnerabilities in their business models. Some fintechs are diversifying revenue streams through services like crypto trading and subscriptions to reduce reliance on interest and card fees. ClearBank's shift from interest income to fee-based income highlights the potential impact of lower rates.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reached a trade agreement, leading to a 90-day pause with reduced tariffs.

The agreement includes slashing levies on 'de minimis' shipments and China removing a ban on airlines taking delivery of Boeing jets. Despite initial optimism, economists note that average tariffs remain significantly higher than before the trade turmoil began.</p>
