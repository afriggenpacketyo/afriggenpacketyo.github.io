        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hurricane Erin underwent rapid intensification, strengthening from a tropical storm into a powerful Category 5 hurricane before slightly weakening to a Category 4. This rapid growth is attributed to ideal conditions, including very warm ocean surface temperatures and low wind shear, factors amplified by climate change. While the storm's current trajectory is not expected to make landfall on the U.S. mainland, its outer bands are bringing heavy rain and strong winds to Caribbean islands like the Leewards and Puerto Rico. Forecasters continue to monitor its path closely as it moves northward.</p>

          <p>A derelict 19th-century Napoleonic fort on Thorne Island, off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been transformed into a unique £3 million party and event space. The new owner, a former software CEO, purchased the abandoned property in 2017 and spent nearly five years undertaking a challenging renovation that involved overcoming the lack of running water and electricity. Now equipped with 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and its own nightclub, the historic island fortress is back on the market, ready for a new chapter as a distinctive tourist destination or exclusive venue.</p>

          <p>As food prices continue to rise, many parents in the UK are finding creative ways to manage their budgets during the six-week school summer holidays. Families are sharing practical tips, such as meticulously planning meals, taking advantage of reduced "yellow sticker" items to stock their freezers, and organizing their refrigerators to minimize waste. These strategies have become essential for households, especially those who rely on subsidized school meals during term time. Community pantries that provide surplus food for a small fee have also become a lifeline for many struggling to make ends meet.</p>

          <p>In response to the growing scarcity of burial space in Los Angeles, the historic Hollywood Forever Cemetery has introduced a new five-story structure called the Gower Mausoleum. This vertical cemetery offers a modern solution by building upwards, providing permanent housing for approximately 13,000 people. The design emphasizes natural light and offers views of city landmarks, aiming to create a peaceful and comfortable space for visitors. The innovative mausoleum is part of the cemetery's broader effort to serve the community's evolving needs while remaining a landmark resting place for Hollywood legends and local residents alike.</p>

          <p>A group of GCSE students in the UK have opened time capsule letters they wrote to their future selves back in March 2021, during a national COVID-19 lockdown. The letters captured the anxieties and hopes of the then-11-year-olds, who were navigating a disrupted transition from primary to secondary school. Four years later, as they prepared for their exams, the students reflected on their personal growth, their pandemic experiences, and whether their younger selves' dreams and questions—from university ambitions to having a girlfriend—had come true. The exercise served as a poignant reminder of their resilience through a challenging period.</p>

          <p>Recent data indicates that Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share rising to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's declined to 49%. This shift is partly attributed to the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold and Z Flip series, which offer a new form factor beyond the traditional smartphone slate. Samsung's strategy of offering a wide range of devices at various price points, from budget-friendly models to premium foldables, is intensifying its competition with Apple in the high-end market.
