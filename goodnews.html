          <p>China's Sanxingdui Museum intends to feature its ancient artifacts in an international exhibition next year, utilizing immersive technology to overcome restrictions on transporting top national treasures. Deputy director Yu Jian confirmed that while state approval is pending, the museum is actively developing digital exhibitions, replicas, and high-quality photo displays for global showcases. This approach allows broader access to Sanxingdui's iconic collection, ensuring its cultural heritage can be shared worldwide without physically moving the most delicate pieces. The initiative highlights a modern strategy for cultural preservation and international engagement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article suggests that the Trump era could mark a significant shift in US-China relations, moving away from traditional ideological frameworks towards a more pragmatic approach. It critiques the Western "convergence theory" as an oversimplification, arguing that it fails to account for unique cultural contexts and power dynamics between nations. Instead, a "reverse convergence" is posited, where the US appears to adopt a similar stance to China on political legitimacy and matters of war and peace. This analysis suggests a future where the focus in bilateral relations might be less on differing political systems and more on practical governance strategies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK has successfully cultivated its first commercial rice crop, thriving amidst the country's hottest summer on record. This ambitious trial, led by ecologist Nadine Mitschunas and the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, aims to explore future food production methods in a changing climate. Nine varieties of rice, including basmati and risotto, were planted in mini paddy fields in Cambridgeshire. Beyond food security, the project also seeks to re-wet peat soils to lock away greenhouse gases, offering a potential solution to both agricultural and environmental challenges.</p>

          <p>Tech billionaire Larry Ellison and his son, Hollywood producer David, are rapidly establishing themselves as a new media dynasty, pursuing significant deals involving companies like TikTok, Paramount, and potentially Warner Brothers Discovery. Larry Ellison's close relationship with President Donald Trump has facilitated these ventures, with Oracle playing a key role in TikTok's data hosting and David Ellison acquiring Paramount. Their expanding influence includes control over major news outlets like CBS. Critics, however, raise concerns about a dangerous concentration of power and potential political influence over media, prompting calls for scrutiny from lawmakers and competition regulators.</p>

          <p>Two Indian researchers, Vikash Kumar and Sarthak Mittal, have been awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for their study on the impact of foul-smelling shoes on the user experience of shoe racks. Their humorous yet inventive scientific endeavor explored how the bacterium Kytococcus sedentarius causes shoe odor and developed a prototype UVC light-equipped shoe rack to sterilize footwear. The study found that just 2-3 minutes of UVC exposure effectively eliminated the smell-causing microbes. This delightful research highlights a common domestic problem with an innovative, scientific solution.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems has reached a confidential settlement in its $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit against Rudy Giuliani, stemming from his baseless claims of 2020 election rigging. Giuliani, a former personal lawyer to President Trump, had spearheaded efforts to discredit the election results, alleging without evidence that Dominion's systems were manipulated. This settlement follows similar agreements Dominion reached with Fox News and Newsmax. The lawsuit was part of numerous legal and financial setbacks for Giuliani, who has also been disbarred and faced other judgments for spreading election conspiracy theories.</p>

          <p>Tesla's new family-friendly EV, the Model Y L, has achieved stunning sales success in China, selling out through October just weeks after its August launch. Over 35,000 orders were placed on launch day, with new deliveries not expected until November. This strong demand is a significant boost for Tesla, which has faced sales challenges in other global markets due to political factors and increased competition. By expanding cabin space and lowering the price, the Model Y L is broadening its appeal, accelerating EV adoption, and contributing to reduced transportation pollution.</p>

          <h2>Expert Opinions Divided on Efficacy of Collagen Supplements for Skin Aging</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 18:37:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the effectiveness of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging, revealing a divided expert opinion. While some users report positive changes in skin, hair, and nails, consultant dermatologists remain skeptical about oral collagen's ability to reach and impact skin cells effectively, given its molecular structure and journey through the body. Topical collagen creams are deemed ineffective as they don't penetrate beyond the skin's outer layer. Industry-funded studies often suggest benefits, but independent research shows no significant effect. Experts recommend sunblock, a healthy diet, and quitting smoking as more impactful anti-aging strategies.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on 50 years of formal diplomatic relations between China and the European Union, examining China's remarkable technological and industrial transformation. Half a century ago, officials touring China observed it was at least 20 years behind in science, technology, and industry. However, China's subsequent policy of reform and opening up ushered in decades of rapid growth, fundamentally shifting its global standing. The article explores how China has since flipped the technology script with Europe, raising questions about whether it has now surpassed Europe in the race for a high-tech future.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party has pledged to commence construction on three new towns before the next general election, aiming to address the UK's housing crisis. A taskforce has identified Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as the most promising initial sites. This initiative is central to Labour's vision for economic growth, with a target of building 1.5 million new homes by 2029. Each new town will feature at least 10,000 homes, with 40% designated as affordable housing, and will be delivered by development corporations with special planning powers.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's global initiatives could provide the necessary reform for the United Nations, which its General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock describes as being at a "make-it-or-break-it moment." The article critiques the contradictions of some UN members, noting Germany's arms supplies to Israel despite calls for peace, and the US's dominant role in enabling the Gaza conflict. It suggests that while the UN faces a survival crisis, current power dynamics and the actions of key allies undermine its effectiveness. China's proposals are presented as a potential pathway to a more equitable global governance structure.</p>
