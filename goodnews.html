          <p>Jin Liqun, president of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), reflects on the bank's first decade, highlighting its role in addressing Asia's infrastructure needs. Established in 2016 with 57 founding members, the AIIB aimed to supplement existing multilateral development banks in promoting sustainable development. Over the past 10 years, the bank has financed over $60 billion in infrastructure projects, including healthcare support during the COVID-19 pandemic. With Asian countries requiring an estimated $3-4 trillion in infrastructure funding annually, the AIIB continues to play a crucial role in filling this gap.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on China to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical trade route for crude oil. This request comes after Iran warned it reserves all options to defend its sovereignty following U.S. strikes on its nuclear sites. Rubio emphasized that closing the strait would be "economic suicide" for Iran, as it relies on the waterway for oil exports to China. The U.S. Fifth Fleet is stationed in Bahrain to protect maritime trade in the Persian Gulf, but analysts warn of potential disruptions to shipping.</p>

          <p>Despite having the means to purchase homes outright, super-rich Americans like Mark Zuckerberg and Jay-Z often take out multimillion-dollar mortgages. This strategy allows them to maintain liquidity and keep cash available for other investments. For example, Jay-Z and Beyonc√© secured a $52.8 million mortgage for an $88 million estate, providing them with financial flexibility. By not tying up large sums in real estate, they can allocate capital to opportunities that offer potentially higher returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A woman installed a fence on her property to prevent her neighbor's children from disturbing her, but the neighbors are now complaining that they can't fit two cars in their driveway. The woman is wondering if she is being unreasonable for declining their request to move the fence. Mumsnet users overwhelmingly supported her decision, stating that her neighbors' parking issues are not her problem. Commenters noted that the neighbors were previously using her driveway for access and that managing their children's behavior would have prevented the need for the fence.</p>
