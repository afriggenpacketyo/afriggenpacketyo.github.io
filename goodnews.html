          <p>Following discussions with President Trump, Apple has committed to increasing its investment in U.S. manufacturing by an additional $100 billion over the next four years. This move, which brings Apple's total domestic investment pledge to $600 billion, is seen as an effort to avoid potential tariffs on its products, which rely on a global supply chain. CEO Tim Cook stated the new funds would support component production with 10 U.S.-based companies, though final assembly of devices like the iPhone will remain overseas for now. The announcement highlights the complex negotiations between tech giants and the administration amid ongoing trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A record number of 18-year-old students in the UK are likely to be accepted into their first-choice university this year, even if they narrowly miss their required grades. The head of the admissions service, Ucas, stated that universities are keen to enroll domestic undergraduates due to uncertainty surrounding international student numbers, which have been a crucial source of revenue. With domestic tuition fees rising for the first time since 2017, UK students offer financial stability to institutions facing financial pressures. This trend suggests a more competitive environment for universities and more favorable outcomes for local applicants.</p>

          <p>Dodgers' two-way star Shohei Ohtani delivered one of his best all-around performances of the season, but it wasn't enough to secure a win against the St. Louis Cardinals. Ohtani pitched four impressive innings, allowing only one run and striking out eight, while also hitting his 39th home run of the year. Despite his efforts, the Dodgers' bullpen faltered, giving up four runs in the final five innings, leading to a 5-3 loss. The article discusses the immense challenge of excelling at both pitching and hitting at the major-league level, a feat not consistently achieved since Babe Ruth.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 19:02:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial markets widely anticipate that the Bank of England will cut its key interest rate from 4.25% to 4% on Thursday, marking the fifth reduction since last August. This move would lower borrowing costs to their lowest level in over two years, potentially reducing mortgage payments for some homeowners but also decreasing returns for savers. The expected cut comes despite inflation remaining above the Bank's 2% target, as recent data indicates a cooling labor market with falling payroll numbers and slowing wage growth. The decision will be accompanied by new economic forecasts for the UK. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Archaeologists Find Evidence of People Resettling Pompeii After Volcanic Eruption</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 18:39:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New archaeological research suggests that survivors of the AD 79 eruption of Mount Vesuvius returned to live among the ruins of Pompeii. Evidence indicates that a 'precarious and grey agglomeration,' similar to a camp, was established in the devastated city and lasted until the 5th century. These settlers likely lived in the upper floors of buried homes, using the lower levels as cellars and salvaging valuable objects from the ruins. This discovery challenges the long-held belief that Pompeii was completely abandoned after the catastrophic event, revealing a forgotten chapter of resilience and survival in the city's history.</p>

          <p>Brian Robbins has stepped down from his role as co-CEO of Paramount Global and head of its film studio, just before the company's acquisition by David Ellison's Skydance Media is finalized. The move was anticipated, as Skydance had already announced its new leadership team for the studio. Robbins, who has led Paramount Pictures since 2021, oversaw major franchises like 'Top Gun: Maverick' and 'Mission: Impossible.' He was part of a three-person CEO office that guided the company through a tumultuous period of business pressures and sale negotiations. His departure marks a significant leadership change as the Redstone era at Paramount comes to an end.</p>
