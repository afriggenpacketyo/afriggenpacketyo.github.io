          <p>Bill Gates announced that the majority of his foundation's $200 billion endowment will be dedicated to addressing challenges in Africa over the next two decades, during a speech to African leaders in Addis Ababa. Gates emphasized the importance of partnership and innovation to boost health and development, focusing on primary healthcare, nutrition for mothers and children, and advancements in vaccines. He highlighted Ethiopia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe as examples of countries showing strong leadership in fostering innovation, while also noting the increasing commitment of the Gates Foundation to Africa, including establishing offices in multiple countries. This pledge occurs amidst concerns about cuts to US foreign aid and the potential impact on humanitarian crises in Africa. The article concludes with Gates urging other wealthy individuals to prioritize philanthropy to address societal issues, rather than accumulating personal possessions.</p>

          <p>South Korea's opposition party leader, Lee Jae-myung, is projected to win the country's snap presidential election, according to a Gallup poll cited by Yonhap. This win would set him up to be the country's next leader after the removal of President Yoon Suk Yeol. Lee currently holds a lead in opinion polling, with 49% of respondents favoring him, compared to 35% for his rival, Kim Moon Soo. Eurasia Group also predicts Lee is likely to pursue a more left-leaning agenda in office, with key watchpoints including a second supplementary budget and his approach to U.S. tariff negotiations.

          <p>The United Kingdom will build new nuclear-powered attack submarines and prepare its army for potential conflict in Europe as part of a significant boost to military spending. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that the UK "cannot ignore the threat that Russia poses" and pledged to undertake the most sweeping changes to British defenses since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The measures aim to send a message to Moscow and reassure Washington of Europe's commitment to its own defense. The plans include increasing production of submarines and weapons, investing in cyber capabilities, and developing new drone technology.</p>
