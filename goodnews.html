          <p>Army Sgt. Brian Lieberman received the Soldier's Medal for his heroic actions during a shooting at his apartment complex where he saved a 14-year-old girl's life. Lieberman, an Army medic, rushed into the line of fire to treat the wounded girl, using his combat medic expertise, even using grocery bags as a makeshift seal, and shielded her when the gunman returned to fire again. Lieberman credits his upbringing and his parents, a nurse and a paramedic/police officer, for instilling in him a sense of service and selflessness. He also humbly acknowledges his roommate's crucial role in providing medical supplies during the incident.</p>

          <p>Elton John, Dua Lipa, and over 400 British musicians, writers, and artists are urging the UK Prime Minister to update copyright laws to protect them from artificial intelligence. They are requesting the government to back an amendment to the Data (Use and Access) Bill, which would require developers to be transparent with copyright owners about using their material to train AI models. The artists argue that failing to provide this protection would essentially mean "giving away" their work to tech firms, potentially harming the UK's creative industries. Some argue that such proposals could hinder the UK's bid for growth.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft has been adrift in space for 53 years and is now slowly spiraling back towards Earth. Experts predict the re-entry will occur and that the spacecraft's heat shield may allow it to survive impact, posing a low risk of injury on the ground. If pieces of the spacecraft survive and are recovered, they legally belong to Russia.</p>

          <p>California public health officials have announced an annual quarantine on sport-harvested mussels along the California coastline due to naturally occurring toxins that can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid biotoxins. The quarantine, effective through October 31, warns against eating mussels that aren't commercially harvested, as these toxins are unpredictable and can rapidly increase. Symptoms of paralytic shellfish poisoning include tingling of the lips and tongue, loss of balance, and in severe cases, death. Commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt from the quarantine due to regular testing.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, was released from ICE custody after a federal judge ordered her release on bail. Ozturk was detained after her visa was revoked by the Trump administration due to a column she co-wrote criticizing the university's response to resolutions related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Judge Sessions criticized the government's lack of evidence against her and highlighted declarations attesting to her peaceful character. The Department of Homeland Security previously accused Ozturk of supporting Hamas, but the judge found no evidence of violence or advocacy for violence.</p>

Ozturk, a doctoral student from Turkey, was arrested for co-authoring an opinion piece critical of Israel's war. The ACLU, representing Ozturk, celebrated her release, emphasizing that no one should be imprisoned for expressing their beliefs.</p>
