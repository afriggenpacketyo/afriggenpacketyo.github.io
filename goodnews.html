          <p>Ethan Mollick, a leading expert from the Wharton School, candidly states that "no one knows anything" definitive about generative AI's future impact on jobs or its optimal use cases, even among top research labs. He stresses that the modern career landscape demands a shift from being rewarded for having answers to excelling at asking insightful questions and making swift decisions. This article underscores the critical importance of continuous, flexible learning and developing "softer skills" like empathy and agility in an AI-driven world. Mollick advises leaders and individuals to actively engage with AI tools, such as paying for subscriptions, to personally discover their utility and drive innovation rather than waiting for top-down directives.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets exhibited mixed performance on Wednesday, contrasting with losses seen on Wall Street, following the World Bank's upward revision of the region's growth forecast. Japan's Nikkei 225 remained largely stable, while Australia's ASX/S&P 200 experienced a decline. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index futures suggested a positive opening, as mainland China and South Korean markets were closed for holidays. This article contextualizes these movements against a backdrop of global economic uncertainty caused by U.S. tariffs and an ongoing U.S. government shutdown. Upcoming policy decisions from the Bank of Thailand and Reserve Bank of New Zealand are also anticipated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mattel's Barbie brand has launched a "Team Barbie" campaign, featuring four international rugby stars like two-time Olympian Ilona Maher, to inspire girls to maintain confidence and participation in sports. This initiative, coinciding with International Day of the Girl, seeks to address key reasons why girls disengage from sports, including body image concerns, self-doubt, and a scarcity of visible female role models. Research highlighted in this article reveals that only 53% of girls aged 6-14 feel confident in sports, and one in three stops playing by age 14. The campaign underscores Barbie's dedication to dismantling these barriers and showcasing empowering athletes to foster limitless potential in young girls.</p>

          <p>Former football star Herschel Walker has been confirmed by the Senate to serve as the U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas, making him the first Senate-approved ambassador to that nation in over a decade. President Trump nominated Walker last year, following his 2022 Republican Senate campaign in Georgia, where he lost to Raphael Warnock. Walker, a Heisman Trophy winner, previously played for a USFL team owned by Mr. Trump. This article notes his past campaign faced accusations of abortion payments, which he vehemently denied. His confirmation was part of a larger group of Trump nominees approved via a new Senate rule, occurring amidst the ongoing government shutdown.</p>
