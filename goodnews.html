        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin has surged to a new record high, exceeding $111,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership and corporate adoption. The rise comes amid easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, as well as Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, which has highlighted alternative stores of value. James Butterfill of CoinShares notes that the price surge is due to positive momentum, optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. This movement is diverging from U.S. equities, potentially signaling investors are seeking alternative stores of value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Millions of public sector workers in England, including nurses, doctors, and teachers, have been offered pay raises ranging from 3.6% to 4.5%. This decision follows the government's acceptance of recommendations from pay review bodies that exceeded the previously budgeted 2.8%. Unions had threatened action if pay awards were not increased, deeming 2.8% too low, however, the Treasury stated that any rises above this would need to be funded through savings from existing budgets. The education department has announced ¬£615m in additional funding to help cover the cost of pay rises this year.</p>

          <p>Taiwan‚Äôs newly inaugurated President William Lai delivered an address on Tuesday omitting any direct mentions of mainland China or cross-strait relations, a stark contrast to his previous assertive rhetoric. This shift is seen as a calculated effort to ease tensions and extend an olive branch to opposition parties, including the Beijing-friendly Kuomintang. Since taking office last year, Lai has consistently asserted Taiwan's independence and labeled Beijing a hostile force, but his recent tone suggests a move towards reconciliation and dialogue. He only mentioned Beijing when asked by reporters.</p>

He highlights the risk of losing ground to China in the electric vehicle market, which is currently dominated by Chinese manufacturing. Newsom emphasizes that overturning California's standards will destroy American manufacturing jobs and give China an advantage. He points to investments by Ford and Toyota in clean vehicle technology as evidence of the success of clean-car policies in driving competitiveness and economic growth.</p>

          <p>Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates are currently offering higher returns than the inflation rate, making them a viable option for savings.

Online banks often provide the most competitive rates, particularly for short-term CDs. Due to the inverted yield curve, short-term CDs (six months to one year) have higher interest rates than longer terms, making strategies like CD laddering beneficial for long-term savings.
