          <p>Charles Michel, former president of the European Council, urged the EU to manage its competition with China responsibly, emphasizing that their relationship should be based on its own merits and not influenced by other world powers. He highlighted the importance of stability and predictability despite differing traditions, cultures, and political systems. His comments come amidst easing tensions between Europe and China, with both lifting restrictions on reciprocal exchanges, marking 50 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations. Chinese President Xi Jinping has also called for a sound and stable relationship benefiting both sides.</p>

          <p>The Mexican government, under President Claudia Sheinbaum, is suing Google for renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America on its Maps service, following an order by former U.S. President Donald Trump. Sheinbaum stated that Google should differentiate between the parts of the gulf corresponding to U.S. territory and those corresponding to Mexico and Cuba. Google claims the changes align with its policy of following official U.S. government geographic designations. Mexico's Foreign Ministry had previously requested that Google not label Mexican territorial waters as the Gulf of America.</p>
