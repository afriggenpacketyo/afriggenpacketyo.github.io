          <p>OpenAI has successfully concluded a secondary share sale, raising $6.6 billion and valuing the company at a staggering $500 billion. This transaction allowed current and former employees to sell their stock, marking the company's second major tender offer in less than a year. Despite authorizing a larger amount, the lower participation is viewed internally as a strong vote of confidence in OpenAI's long-term prospects and continued investor interest, even at this elevated valuation. This cements OpenAI's position as the world's most valuable privately held company, surpassing SpaceX, amid intensifying competition for AI talent from companies like Meta. The article also notes the use of secondary sales as a strategy to retain talent without an IPO.</p>

          <p>Former Dallas Cowboys running back Sherman Williams, now head coach for Murphy High School, has spoken out after his team suffered a 100-0 loss to Williamson High School. Williams defended his team's spirit, stating all 39 players chose to continue despite being down 73-0 at halftime, emphasizing their dedication. This article notes controversy arose over whether Williams refused a running clock to shorten the game, a claim Williamson's coach corroborated, but Williams stated he wasn't asking for favors and would play until the clock hit zero. The former NFL player is in his first year as head coach at Murphy High School.</p>

          <p>Fair Isaac, the company behind the FICO score, saw its shares surge over 20% after announcing a new pricing model allowing mortgage lenders to license credit scores directly, bypassing credit bureaus. This strategic shift aims to eliminate unnecessary mark-ups on FICO scores, empowering lenders with more choice in pricing and distribution. This article notes that while Fair Isaac's stock soared, shares of major credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax declined significantly due to concerns about disintermediation. The Federal Housing Finance Agency director, who previously criticized FICO as a "monopoly," encouraged credit bureaus to take similar creative actions for market safety and competitiveness.

The film, "Sharon & Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home," captures his final three years, including his "humbling" farewell concert in Birmingham, where he struggled with emotions and physical limitations due to a spinal injury. This article highlights his desire to perform despite having to sit, and his family's perspective on his enduring strength, noting his daughter Kelly's sentiment that "Iron Man wasn't really made of iron." Osbourne, who had Parkinson's disease, also discussed recent health struggles like sepsis and a quirky addiction to Pink Lady apples.</p>

Endeavor Flight 5047, taxiing to its gate, struck the wing of Flight 5155, which was holding as instructed by air traffic control, raising questions about potential miscommunication. This article reports one flight attendant sustained minor injuries and was treated at a hospital, but airport operations were not impacted. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident, recovering flight recorders from both planes for analysis, with preliminary findings showing damage to Flight 5155's right wing and Flight 5047's nose and windscreen.</p>

          <p>YouTube TV and NBCUniversal have successfully negotiated a new distribution agreement, preventing a potential blackout that could have affected millions of customers. The resolution came after tense negotiations, where both companies held significant leverage due to NBCUniversal's popular network portfolio, including NBC-owned stations, CNBC, and MSNBC, and YouTube TV's growing subscriber base. This article notes that YouTube TV backed away from demands to include Peacock programming at no extra cost, indicating a compromise on deal terms. The smooth resolution contrasts with YouTube TV's recent standoff with TelevisaUnivision and a settled spat with Rupert Murdoch’s Fox Corp., highlighting the complexities of media distribution deals.</p>

          <p>Home equity loan costs have become less expensive following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cuts, making borrowing up to $90,000 more accessible for homeowners. A $90,000 loan now costs less monthly than earlier in the year and a year ago, with current 10-year rates at 8.34% ($1,108.18/month) and 15-year rates at 8.21% ($871.03/month). This article advises homeowners to consider these reduced costs but also to compare with Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), which currently offer rates under 8%. Borrowers are encouraged to weigh the benefits of securing funds now versus waiting for potential further rate cuts, given the risk of future closing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

The underwater object, visible in photos since 1938, is located about 400 miles southeast of Earhart's planned destination, Howland Island, where she and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared in 1937. This article highlights the team's plan to inspect, scan, and potentially recover the object in November, hoping to provide "smoking-gun proof" for a theory that Earhart was marooned there. Earhart, who worked at Purdue, intended to return the plane to the university after her historic flight, and President Trump recently ordered related records declassified.</p>

This article highlights the importance of early diagnosis and treatment, as many PCOS patients do not ovulate regularly, making "trying at home" ineffective without medical intervention.
