          <p>A minor league baseball game featured an unusual moment when a pitcher was called for a balk after being frightened by a loud thunderclap. During a game between the Norfolk Tides and the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp, Tides pitcher Roansy Contreras was in his delivery when the sudden boom of thunder caused him to stop abruptly. The umpire strictly applied the rules, calling a balk that allowed a runner from third base to score. Despite the bizarre run, the Tides went on to win the game 9-5.</p>

          <p>Police in Scotland have confirmed they are making preparations for a potential visit by President Donald Trump to his Aberdeenshire golf resort later this month. The purpose of the expected trip is to open a new course at the Trump International Scotland property. This would be his first visit to Scotland since his 2024 election victory, with his last presidential trip in 2018 drawing major protests. While a full state visit to the UK is anticipated for later in the year, this particular trip is focused on his private business interests.</p>

          <p>Telehealth company Hims & Hers Health has announced its expansion into Canada, where it will offer a generic version of the popular weight-loss drug semaglutide. This move is possible because Novo Nordisk's patent on its branded versions, Ozempic and Wegovy, is set to expire in Canada in January. The entry of Hims & Hers into the lucrative Canadian market signals increased competition and the potential for more affordable access to these highly sought-after treatments. The company is partnering with an approved manufacturer to ensure compliance with Canadian health regulations.</p>

          <p>The stock market saw a positive turn, driven by a rally in major technology stocks like Nvidia and Microsoft, the latter of which reached a new all-time high. Nvidia's market capitalization also briefly surpassed the $4 trillion mark, reflecting continued investor confidence in the AI sector. In other business news, Starbucks has reportedly received significant interest from nearly 30 firms looking to acquire a stake in its China operations, a move that could value the division at up to $10 billion. This potential spin-off is seen as part of a strategic turnaround plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Analysis of the first-ever samples returned from the far side of the moon by China's Chang'e-6 mission reveals new insights into lunar history. The research, published in Nature, suggests a massive asteroid impact over 4 billion years ago not only created the vast South Pole-Aitken basin but also fundamentally changed the composition of the moon's mantle deep below. The returned volcanic rocks are chemically different from any near-side samples, being depleted in elements like titanium and thorium. This provides a unique window into the moon's violent past and geological evolution.</p>

          <p>Scientists have found that using simple, evocative analogies can provide an immediate boost to running performance. A study with young soccer players from the Tottenham Hotspur academy discovered that focusing on external, environmental cues rather than internal body movements led to faster sprints. For instance, telling players to "accelerate like a Ferrari" or "sprint as if you are a jet taking off" was more effective than technical instructions. The research suggests that using relatable analogies can produce performance gains that would typically require weeks of physical training.</p>
