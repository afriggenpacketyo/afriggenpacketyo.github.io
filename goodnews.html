          <p>Pride Month concluded with large-scale marches in cities like New York, San Francisco, and Budapest, where celebration was intertwined with protest. In New York, the theme "Rise Up: Pride in Protest" highlighted opposition to recent U.S. policies targeting LGBTQ+ rights, particularly those affecting transgender individuals. The events also commemorated the 1969 Stonewall Riots, a pivotal moment in the fight for equality. In Budapest, tens of thousands defied a government ban on LGBTQ+ public events, demonstrating against Hungary's increasingly restrictive laws in a powerful display of resistance and solidarity.</p>

          <p>A young mountain lion cub that suffered a fractured skull and other severe injuries after being struck by a vehicle has been successfully released back into the wild. The San Diego Humane Society's wildlife center spent nearly five months providing intensive medical care while carefully preserving the cub's wild instincts to ensure its survival. The rehabilitation process focused on recovery with minimal human contact, allowing the animal to regain its strength and natural behaviors. The cub was eventually released in a remote area of the Santa Ana Mountains.</p>

          <p>Decades after being declared extinct, the Tasmanian tiger, or thylacine, continues to captivate enthusiasts who dedicate their lives to proving it still exists. These seekers spend significant time and money setting up trail cameras and searching for evidence in Tasmania's dense outback, fueled by anecdotal sightings and mysterious sounds. Parallel to this grassroots effort, a high-tech de-extinction project funded by investors aims to bring the creature back by genetically engineering the DNA of its closest living relative, the dunnart. While some scientists are skeptical, the enduring passion reflects a collective remorse for the animal's extinction.</p>

          <h2>Filmmaker Werner Herzog Reflects on His Unconventional and Extreme Approach to Cinema</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 19:20:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Acclaimed German director Werner Herzog, now 82, is known for a six-decade career of making uncompromising films that explore the edges of human sanity and the indifference of nature. In a recent profile, Herzog discusses his philosophy, from shooting "Aguirre, the Wrath of God" in the perilous Amazon to his belief that a filmmaker needs "good criminal energy" to succeed. He famously hauled a 340-ton steamship over a mountain for his film "Fitzcarraldo," rejecting special effects to capture a raw reality. This relentless pursuit of authentic, often dream-like imagery defines his unique and influential body of work.</p>

          <p>Located on a World War II anti-aircraft platform in the North Sea, the Principality of Sealand stands as the world's smallest self-declared state. Founded in 1967 by British pirate radio operator Roy Bates, the micronation has its own royal family, constitution, and a history filled with pirate skirmishes and a coup attempt. With a permanent population of one, Sealand has survived by adapting, from early ambitions of being a tax haven to more recent ventures in offshore data hosting. Today, it primarily funds itself by selling noble titles online, embodying a unique story of defiance and independence.</p>

          <p>Lena Herzog, a visual artist and photographer, offers a personal perspective on her husband, filmmaker Werner Herzog, particularly regarding his acting career and public image. She reveals that when they first met, he pretended to be a stuntman, and she finds his roles as villains in films like "Jack Reacher" amusing, seeing them as a caricature of his perceived wild-man persona. Lena believes he is unafraid to make fun of himself and that his public image as an obsessive artist is misleading. She describes the man behind the myth as a sweet, good person, providing a counterpoint to his intense cinematic reputation.</p>

          <p>Filmmaker Werner Herzog employs a unique and poetic process to create his documentaries, forgoing traditional methods like storyboarding or transcript analysis. Instead, he and his editor watch all raw footage only once, with Herzog taking notes and marking compelling shots with exclamation points to guide the edit. He then crafts his signature narration spontaneously, aiming to imbue images with philosophical questions and a dreamlike quality that transcends simple information. This approach, as seen in his work on films about elephants and the human brain, is designed to create memorable, emotionally resonant sequences that stay with the audience.</p>

With a finalist at every infield position and two in the outfield, the team could surpass the current record of five starting position players from a single team. Shohei Ohtani has already secured the starting designated hitter spot by leading all National League players in votes. Because votes do not carry over, all finalists have an equal chance to be elected during the 48-hour voting window.</p>

Mahboubi, who recently led a student trip to China, observed a warm and welcoming reception, indicating a desire for connection despite high-level political friction and increasing scrutiny of student visas.</p>

          <p>A proposal to mandate the sale of up to 1.2 million acres of public land in 11 Western states has been removed from the Republican tax and spending bill. The measure, championed by Senator Mike Lee of Utah, faced strong bipartisan opposition from lawmakers in both the House and Senate, as well as from conservation and recreation groups. Lee stated he withdrew the provision because he could not secure guarantees that the land would be sold only to American families and not to foreign or corporate interests. The move is seen as a victory for public land advocates. (not investment advice)</p>

Her return comes just days before England's opening Euro 2025 match against France, giving manager Sarina Wiegman a powerful and versatile attacking option.
