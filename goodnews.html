Ye emphasizes that business is business and that his company sees global opportunities despite geopolitical tensions, pointing to clients like Procter & Gamble and Watsons. He believes that the application of AI will vary between the U.S. and China, with Southeast Asia adopting scenarios from both markets. He also notes that AI can provide opportunities for content creation and marketing, and that the biggest challenge is complying with data privacy and security needs in every region.

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's upcoming IPO is notable for an unusual aspect: existing shareholders are selling more shares than the company itself. In its updated prospectus, Circle stated it would sell 9.6 million shares, while existing shareholders would sell 14.4 million shares, a trend seen previously with Facebook's IPO in 2012. While Circle didn't provide a reason, the high amount of insider sales likely reflects venture capital firms' need for liquidity after a period of meager returns. This move highlights the pressure on Silicon Valley's tech investors to secure exits and distribute funds back to their own investors. (not investment advice)</p>

Haliburton's triple-double, combined with Pascal Siakam's 30 points, propelled the Pacers to within one win of their second NBA finals appearance. The Pacers have maintained consistency, avoiding consecutive losses since March 10, and history favors them, as teams leading 3-1 in playoff series have a strong record of advancing.

          <p>Elon Musk, the leader of President Trump's "Department of Government Efficiency," expressed disappointment with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, criticizing it for increasing the budget deficit. Musk stated that the bill undermines the work his DOGE team is doing to cut government waste. The legislation is projected to add $3 trillion or more to federal budget deficits over the next decade through tax cuts that are only partially offset by spending reductions. Musk's criticism is notable given his close ties to the president and his role in identifying areas for government savings, even as real-time federal data shows the government spending more than it did last year.</p>

A study published in the Journal of Railway Science and Engineering indicates that minor imperfections in tracks and electromagnetic resonance can cause violent low-frequency vibrations in maglev cars traveling at 1,000 km/h. Researchers at China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) say they have developed a method to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, making the ride less unpleasant.

The administration claims it is punishing Harvard for antisemitism, but many see it as an attack on academic freedom.
