          <p>Following his selection as the first overall pick in the NBA Draft, Cooper Flagg is set to be tested in an unfamiliar role by the Dallas Mavericks. Head coach Jason Kidd announced his intention to play the 6-foot-9 forward at the point guard position during the upcoming Summer League. The goal is to make Flagg uncomfortable and push his development by expanding his skill set beyond his traditional role. The move is supported by team part-owner Mark Cuban, as Kidd aims to see how the young star responds to the challenge of running the offense.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly engaging in a direct and aggressive recruitment campaign to poach top artificial intelligence talent from competitors like Google and OpenAI.

This hands-on approach involves creating a secret list of desired candidates and reviewing academic papers to identify promising individuals. The strategy underscores the intense competition among tech giants for dominance in the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>The California Highway Patrol responded to an unusual report of a baby tiger on the side of Highway 166 in San Luis Obispo County. A concerned driver had called in the sighting along the remote stretch of road. However, upon investigation, the responding officer discovered the animal was not an exotic cat but a dead hawk. It remains unclear what led to the zoological misidentification by the caller. The incident serves as a reminder that owning exotic animals like tigers is illegal in California without special permits.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris secured a stunning pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix, outperforming the rest of the field by more than half a second. Norris described his lap as nearly perfect and said he felt like his "old self" behind the wheel, a feeling he has missed this season amidst struggles in qualifying. The performance was aided by recent car upgrades, including a revised front suspension designed to give him better feedback. His dominant qualifying run places him in a strong position for the race, ahead of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and his championship-leading teammate Oscar Piastri.</p>

Mandhana scored an unbeaten 112 from just 62 balls, propelling India to a formidable total of 210-5, their second-highest ever in the format. England's response faltered early, as they lost four wickets within the first seven overs and were eventually all out for 113.

          <p>An estimated 180,000 to 200,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, defying a government ban and creating what organizers called the largest Pride event in Hungary's history.

Budapest's mayor supported the event by declaring it a municipal parade, and it drew support from dozens of embassies and EU officials. The massive turnout is seen as a significant act of resistance against the government's repressive policies.</p>

The company noted that many of its products, such as Uncrustables, are already free from these additives. The decision reflects a broader industry trend towards cleaner ingredient labels.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions rugby team started their tour of Australia with a decisive victory over the Western Force, scoring eight tries in an impressive attacking display. However, the win was marred by a potential injury to Welsh scrum-half Tomos Williams, who left the field with a tight hamstring. Head coach Andy Farrell expressed concern, as an injury to Williams could leave the squad thin at a key position. The team's performance showed both promise in its ambitious, offloading style of play and areas for improvement, particularly in reducing first-half penalties.</p>
