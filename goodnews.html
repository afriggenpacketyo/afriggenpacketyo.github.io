          <p>Guangdong province, a major economic hub in southern China, plans to create a domestic version of the renowned Canton Fair to help its export-focused companies pivot to the internal market. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to strengthen China's economic self-reliance amid weakening external demand and global trade friction. The plan aims to involve around 20,000 enterprises in promotional activities and includes measures like encouraging e-commerce platforms to feature sections for domestic sales of export goods. However, some industry insiders are skeptical, noting that numerous similar events have failed to address the core challenges of sluggish consumer demand.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The discussion around privatizing the U.S. air traffic control (ATC) system has re-emerged, although the current administration is focused on a multi-billion dollar investment to modernize the Federal Aviation Administration. Proponents of privatization point to models like Canada's NAV CANADA, arguing it allows for more flexible investment in technology, while opponents raise concerns about safety, complexity, and potential disadvantages for smaller airports. Despite past pushes for privatization, many aviation industry groups are now unifying behind the government's plan to upgrade equipment and hire more controllers, viewing a fight over privatization as a distraction from needed modernization.</p>

          <p>NATO is significantly increasing its engagement with the commercial space industry as part of a new strategy, coinciding with a pledge from member nations to boost defense spending. The alliance, which recognized space as an operational domain in 2019, is now better positioned to leverage private sector capabilities for communication, navigation, and surveillance. This strategic shift has defense and space companies vying for contracts, especially with ambitious projects like the Golden Dome defense shield. The move also reflects Europe's desire to develop alternatives to services like SpaceX's Starlink, which has become critical in conflicts like the one in Ukraine. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>International legal efforts to hold Russia accountable for its war in Ukraine are advancing with the establishment of a new special tribunal. The Council of Europe and the Ukrainian government have signed an agreement to create this court, which will focus specifically on the "crime of aggression," aiming to prosecute high-ranking Russian leaders for the decision to wage war. This tribunal, likely to be based in The Hague, is designed to close a jurisdictional gap left by the International Criminal Court (ICC), which cannot directly prosecute Russian officials for aggression. The move is seen as a crucial step toward ensuring there is no impunity for the war's instigators.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. has reported that its global sales for May increased by 6.9 percent from the previous year, reaching a record 898,721 units for the month. The company attributes the strong performance to a surge in last-minute demand in the United States. This spike in sales was driven by consumer concerns that car prices would increase due to high tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. In contrast to the sales growth, Toyota's global production saw a slight dip of 0.7 percent, marking the first time in five months that production fell below the level of the same period in the previous year.

          <p>Chinese smartphone manufacturer Honor has taken a significant step toward an initial public offering (IPO) by completing its pre-IPO guidance filing with China's securities regulator. This move positions the company for a potential listing on the mainland's A-share market. The decision comes as the A-share market shows signs of recovery in the second quarter after a slow start to the year. According to consulting firm Deloitte, regulators' efforts to restore market confidence and improve the quality of IPO candidates are beginning to show success, fostering a more active market environment for companies like Honor.
