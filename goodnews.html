          <p>The 76-year-old pop icon Lulu has publicly disclosed her battle with alcoholism in her new memoir, "If You Only Knew," calling the revelation "liberating." Now nearly 12 years sober, she sought help in 2013 after confiding in her family, leading to a six-week rehab stay and commitment to Alcoholics Anonymous. Lulu described herself as a "highly functioning alcoholic" who hid her problem for years, even while performing on "Strictly Come Dancing." This article details her personal journey, influenced by her father's alcoholism, and her hope to break the generational pattern for her grandchildren.</p>

          <p>Nineteen-year-old Tyrique George, who nearly left Chelsea in the summer, delivered a standout performance in the Carabao Cup, scoring and assisting in a 2-1 victory against Lincoln City. Playing out of position as a lone striker, George's contribution was vital in preventing a potential upset and easing pressure on manager Enzo Maresca. This article highlights George's determination to secure his future at his boyhood club, contrasting with Chelsea's trend of selling academy graduates. His dedicated training regimen and recent form suggest he could be a significant option for the team's attack.</p>

          <p>Oregon state police believe they have identified the remains of "Oak Grove Jane Doe," a woman whose dismembered body parts were found along the Willamette River in April 1946, making it Oregon's oldest unidentified victim case. The cold case, which went dormant in the 1950s after critical evidence went missing, was revived by the state police's Human Identification Program. The remains were located under a headstone marked "Unknown Woman 1946" and are now undergoing advanced forensic testing. This article highlights the painstaking efforts to restore the victim's identity and bring closure to a nearly 80-year-old mystery.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's Hugo Ekitike scored the winning goal in a Carabao Cup match against Southampton but was sent off for a "stupid" celebration, according to manager Arne Slot. Ekitike, who removed his shirt after his 85th-minute goal, received a second yellow card, leading to his suspension from Saturday's Premier League game against Crystal Palace. The striker apologized on social media, attributing his actions to overwhelming emotion. This article details the costly disciplinary lapse, which comes despite Ekitike's excellent form since his £69m transfer, and emphasizes the learning experience for the young player.</p>

          <p>California is poised to pass legislation, Senate Bill 576, aimed at quieting loud commercial advertisements on streaming platforms like Hulu and Netflix. The bill, inspired by a new mother's frustration with disruptive ad volumes, would prohibit commercials from being louder than the content they accompany. While federal law (CALM Act) already regulates broadcast and cable TV ad volumes, streaming services were exempt. This article explains how sound engineers exploit legal loopholes to make ads seem louder and details the industry's initial opposition, which shifted after an amendment prevented private lawsuits, relying instead on regulatory enforcement.</p>
