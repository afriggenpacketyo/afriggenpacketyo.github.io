          <p>Former NFL quarterback Robert Griffin III weighed in on the viral "Phillies Karen" incident, where a fan aggressively demanded a home run ball from a father and his young son. Griffin sided with the family, stating that since the woman dropped the ball, she forfeited her claim to it, and humorously advised her to get "better hands." He also recounted an odd fan interaction from his own career, where a person who appeared to be in a wheelchair to get an autograph was later seen walking freely, highlighting the extreme lengths some fans will go for memorabilia.</p>

          <p>France staged a dramatic comeback to defeat Ireland 18-13 in the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals, securing their spot in the semi-finals. Ireland established a dominant 13-0 lead in the first half, but failed to capitalize further despite France receiving two yellow cards. A crucial defensive stand by the French at the end of the half proved pivotal. In the second half, France scored 18 unanswered points, with a key breakaway try from Joanna Grisez sealing the victory and ending Ireland's hopes of reaching their first semi-final since 2014.</p>

          <p>The Art Institute of Chicago is hosting a new exhibition, "Gustave Caillebotte: Painting His World," offering a fresh perspective on the lesser-known French Impressionist painter. While his peers focused on traditional subjects, Caillebotte's work distinctively centered on male figures in domestic and urban settings, sometimes in ways that scandalized the 19th-century art establishment. The exhibition explores the unique, and at times sensuous, nature of his paintings, inviting modern interpretations of his artistry and his focus on the male form, and solidifying his place within the Impressionist movement beyond his famous work, "Paris Street; Rainy Day."</p>

          <p>In Altadena, California, residents united by the tragedy of the destructive Eaton fire have created the Altadena Dining Club to support struggling local eateries. The initiative, founded by a resident who lost her home, provides a vital economic boost to family-owned restaurants that have seen a sharp decline in customers since the disaster. Beyond financial support, the weekly gatherings have fostered a strong sense of community, allowing neighbors and displaced residents to connect, share their experiences, and find mutual support while helping to rebuild the social and economic fabric of their town.</p>

          <p>Large timbers from a historic shipwreck, estimated to date back to the 1800s or earlier, have been discovered on Matanzas Beach in St. Johns County, Florida. Beach services staff found the fragments and collaborated with the St. Augustine Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program (LAMP) to preserve them. To protect the artifacts from sun damage and potential theft, one of the timbers was carefully reburied in wet sand after being documented. Researchers used GPS and photogrammetry to create a 3D digital model, which will allow for further study of Florida's maritime history.</p>

          <p>Historians Jill Lepore and Jeffrey Rosen explore the history and contemporary relevance of the U.S. Constitution, emphasizing that it was designed as a living document intended to be amended. The article notes that while the text has not been meaningfully changed in over 50 years, its interpretation by the Supreme Court constantly evolves. Rosen expresses concern that the system of checks and balances is failing, with Congress becoming passive and the courts wielding more power than the founders envisioned. Despite this, he argues the Constitution's core principles against tyranny remain timeless and essential for the nation's survival.</p>

          <p>Amazon is rolling out "Hear the Highlights," a new feature that uses artificial intelligence to generate short audio summaries of product information and customer reviews. The tool aims to simplify the shopping experience by distilling thousands of comments into concise clips, which could be particularly beneficial for visually impaired customers. However, critics raise concerns that these AI summaries might strip away the nuance and specific details found in human reviews, potentially blending authentic user experiences with marketing language and overlooking unique insights that shoppers rely on to make informed decisions.</p>

          <p>In preparation for the upcoming Ryder Cup at Bethpage, New York, Team Europe is using a novel training method: virtual reality headsets that simulate a hostile crowd by shouting abuse at the players. Rory McIlroy revealed that Captain Luke Donald introduced the technology to help desensitize the team to the intense pressure and name-calling expected from the American audience. McIlroy, who encouraged the simulation to "go as far as you want," acknowledged that while the VR experience is helpful, nothing can fully prepare them for the real atmosphere of the first tee.</p>

The Minnesota Lynx, driven by a "revenge tour" after a controversial loss in the 2024 finals, are seen as a top contender, led by MVP candidate Napheesa Collier and the league's best defense. The Las Vegas Aces, however, are entering the postseason on a 16-game winning streak and remain a formidable threat for a third title in four years.

          <p>This analysis examines the successful New York mayoral primary campaign of progressive Democrat Zohran Mamdani and considers what lessons the UK's struggling Labour party might learn. Mamdani's success is attributed to a sharp focus on economic issues like housing affordability, championing clear and compelling policies such as free bus transport, and crafting a strong narrative that picks a side against the wealthy elite. His savvy use of social media to connect with voters is contrasted with Labour's challenges in communicating a coherent vision and connecting with the public's primary concerns.</p>

          <p>In a remarkable act of bravery, surgeons at the Kyiv Heart Institute successfully performed a heart transplant on a 12-year-old girl, Kira Skliarova, during a heavy Russian missile and drone attack. The medical team, led by Dr. Borys Todurov, drove through the bombarded city to retrieve the donor heart from a 4-year-old who had died in an accident. The complex surgery was conducted as explosions shook the hospital, ultimately saving Kira's life and offering her a chance at recovery after years of severe heart problems.</p>
