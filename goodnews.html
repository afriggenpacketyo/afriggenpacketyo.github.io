        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, driven by strong performance in fixed income trading and investment banking. Despite the positive results, the bank's net earnings saw a 17% decrease compared to the same period last year, which had been inflated by a significant gain on Visa shares. CEO Jamie Dimon noted the U.S. economy's resilience but also pointed to significant risks from trade uncertainty and geopolitical conditions. The report sets the stage for other major banks to release their quarterly results.</p>

          <p>The BBC's latest annual report has once again named Gary Lineker as its highest-paid presenter, a position he has held for eight years, with earnings around £1.35 million. Former Radio 2 host Zoe Ball ranked second, though her salary decreased significantly after changing roles. The report was released amid confirmations of staff dismissals following a review of the corporation's culture and workplace conduct. It also noted a slight decline in license fee-paying households but an increase in perceived impartiality of its news coverage.</p>

          <p>A mid-year review of the best books of 2025 reveals a common theme of travel, displacement, and the transformative power of encountering the unknown. The selected works explore the concept that all stories are fundamentally about a person going on a journey or a stranger arriving in town. The recommended titles are divided into 'whimsical' and 'harrowing' journeys, featuring diverse narratives from a Shakespearean actress's New York walkabout to a real-life couple's four-month survival ordeal on a life raft. These books offer compelling explorations of how leaving home or being visited by outsiders can broaden and damage individuals.</p>

          <p>An exploration team has discovered the wreck of the Japanese destroyer Teruzuki, which was sunk by U.S. torpedoes during a pivotal World War II battle near the Solomon Islands. Found over 2,600 feet below the surface, the warship still contains armed depth charges, prompting caution from the research team. The discovery of the vessel, which played a key role in the naval battles off Guadalcanal, provides new insights into its final moments and maritime history. The find is particularly significant as no historical images of the Teruzuki exist, making this the first time it has been seen in over 80 years.</p>

          <p>Tesla has officially entered the Indian market, launching its Model Y electric SUV at a starting price of approximately $70,000, significantly higher than in other major markets. The launch coincides with the opening of Tesla's first showroom in Mumbai, with another planned for New Delhi. The steep price is largely attributed to India's high tariffs on imported EVs and luxury taxes, positioning the Model Y in the premium segment against brands like BMW rather than mass-market competitors. Analysts suggest this initial move is a 'soft launch' for Tesla to test the waters before committing to local manufacturing.</p>
