        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a tool used to measure and communicate the severity of air pollution and its associated health risks. The AQI uses a color-coded system ranging from green (good) to maroon (hazardous), with corresponding numerical values indicating the level of pollution. The index is calculated based on five major pollutants, including ground-level ozone and particulate matter, which pose the greatest threat to human health. As air quality worsens, the public is at risk of experiencing health impacts ranging from headaches and fatigue to more serious conditions like heart attack or stroke. Residents can use resources like AirNow.gov to find the AQI for their area and understand potential health risks and recommended precautions.</p>

          <p>A recent report indicates that job openings in the United States saw a surprising increase in April, totaling nearly 7.4 million, which is higher than economists' forecasts. Hiring and layoffs also rose during the month, suggesting a relatively stable labor market despite broader economic uncertainties. The ratio of available jobs to unemployed workers remained close to the March level, while worker confidence, as indicated by the number of people quitting their jobs, edged slightly lower. Federal Reserve officials are closely monitoring these data points to assess the impact of various factors, including tariffs, on the economy, as they consider future monetary policy decisions.

          <p>Anthropic's Claude 4 AI model has achieved a breakthrough by working continuously for seven hours, marking a significant advancement in AI capabilities. This feat is notable because AI models typically have limited memory and processing capacity, leading to performance degradation over extended periods. The ability to work for longer durations is attributed to an increased number of "tokens," which are units of data that AI models can process. While a 24-hour AI workday may be technically possible in the future, questions arise regarding the environmental impact and the cost of computing power required for continuous operation. The question remains whether the pursuit of an AI 24-hour workday is truly optimal for society.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve maintaining the federal funds rate and borrowing costs rising, homeowners are considering HELOCs as a lower-cost borrowing alternative. However, HELOCs have variable interest rates, making payments unpredictable. Experts advise borrowers to conservatively estimate their ability to repay, considering potential rate increases. It's crucial to know how much you need, stick to that amount, and decide if you can pay more than the minimum to reduce borrowing costs.

          <h2>Trump Administration Pauses Social Security Benefit Cuts for Defaulted Student Loans</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to garnish Social Security benefits for individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. The Education Department stated that the administration is committed to protecting Social Security recipients who rely on fixed incomes. This policy change provides older student borrowers more time to get current on their loans and avoid reduced benefit checks. Previously, the administration had announced it would resume collection activity on defaulted student loans, potentially impacting over 450,000 borrowers aged 62 and older. This offers a chance at financial stability.</p>
