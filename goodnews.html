        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government has brokered a peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda to end the conflict in eastern DRC, which is largely driven by competition over mineral resources. The agreement, which is set to be signed in Washington, aims to end the fighting and potentially bring billions of dollars of American investment into the region. Critics are skeptical of the deal's success, as the M23 rebel group, believed to be backed by Rwanda, is not a signatory and has not been involved in negotiations. If implemented, the deal could provide the U.S. access to critical resources and counter China's dominance in the region's cobalt reserves, but the success of the deal hinges on the M23 group adhering to the terms.</p>

          <p>This article emphasizes the importance of public pools for mental, physical, and social health, referencing historical perspectives and current needs. Swimming is presented as a mood-boosting exercise that offers a unique sense of buoyancy and embrace, providing a form of transcendence. The article highlights the historical role of pools as community hubs and the tragic impact of desegregation, which led to the decline of public pools and the rise of private alternatives. The author advocates for reinvesting in public pools to promote health, happiness, and community, especially in the face of increasingly hot summers. The author's tone is generally positive and hopeful.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 12:58:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wales will ban plastic wet wipes starting in December 2026 to reduce environmental harm caused by plastic and microplastic pollution. The ban, which follows a vote in the Senedd, makes Wales the first UK nation to implement such a measure, adding plastic wet wipes to a 2023 law prohibiting single-use plastic products. Medical-grade wipes are exempt, and the ban does not extend to business-to-business supply, with an 18-month transition period for manufacturers to adapt. Research has found that wet wipes pose a significant risk to the environment, contributing to sewage blockages and overspills, thus decisive action will encourage a shift towards reusable and non-plastic alternatives.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has suspended millions of dollars in funding to the Cook Islands, citing a lack of transparency regarding its strategic partnership agreements with China. The funding pause, amounting to an $11 million development assistance payment, is due to concerns over the scope of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership agreement signed in February, which covers deep-sea mining, regional cooperation, and economic issues. New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters stated that the agreements with China demonstrate a "gap in understanding" about the special relationship between the two countries, with New Zealand seeking to restore trust. The move underscores growing friction between New Zealand, Australia, and Pacific island nations as China expands its influence in the region.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has extended the deadline for TikTok's sale in the US for another 90 days, marking the third such delay. The video-sharing app has been under scrutiny due to concerns over its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, and potential national security risks. Trump, who had previously vowed to save TikTok, signed an executive order to postpone the enforcement of a law requiring the app to be banned unless sold. TikTok expressed gratitude for Trump's support in keeping the app available for its 170 million US users, as the situation remains fluid amid ongoing negotiations and regulatory hurdles.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, after a lengthy retrial, but was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol. The case involved accusations that Read hit O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die, while the defense argued she was framed in an elaborate coverup involving law enforcement. The first trial ended in a mistrial due to a hung jury, leading to the second trial which included testimony, evidence scrutiny, and legal battles over evidence and witness credibility. The case has drawn significant attention due to its complex narrative and allegations of misconduct, ultimately leading to Read's acquittal on the most serious charges.</p>

The UK also possesses military and strategic assets in the Middle East and Indian Ocean, including the Diego Garcia base, RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, and naval presence in the Gulf.

Anyone on means-tested benefits will automatically receive the discount, regardless of property size.

The cost of the expansion could be covered by raising fees on all customer bills, but the government says savings will be made by cutting energy companies' expenditure.

          <p>This article discusses the psychology of taking offense and suggests strategies for managing reactions to perceived insults. It references research on the stages of offense, common triggers, and differing reactions based on gender. The author argues that learning to be less offended is more beneficial than trying to control others' behavior, and recommends laughing off minor offenses, using the prefrontal cortex to manage emotions, and tuning out offense-making media. It is suggested that a proclivity to be offended can be associated with narcissism, urging sensitivity and empathy but also cautioning against assuming bad faith from those claiming offense.</p>

Edmunds learned about the coded messages in quilts 50 years ago and has been making quilts with these patterns ever since. The quilts conveyed messages to enslaved people about to escape, with patterns like the "monkey wrench" signaling the start of a journey and the "north star" indicating which direction to follow. While some doubt the use of quilts as codes due to a lack of written history, Edmunds and others believe the oral tradition and symbolism are significant.</p>

          <p>In Thai Town, strawberry Fanta, or "Fanta red water," is a ubiquitous offering at spirit houses, small shrines honoring spirits' claim to the land. This practice stems from a blend of animism, Brahmanism, and Buddhism, where spirits are appeased with various snacks and drinks, with red Fanta replacing blood sacrifices of the past. The sugary beverage is believed to be particularly appealing to spirits, especially child ghosts like Kuman Thong, who can grant wishes in exchange for offerings. The prevalence of Fanta is likely due to Coca-Cola's long-standing presence in Thailand, as the red soda is now a staple in these spiritual practices.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said the government will explore further protective measures on social media platforms following tennis player Katie Boulter's revelations about the abuse she receives online. Several England players are planning to give up social media for their upcoming European Championship defence in Switzerland due to the abuse. Starmer stated it was not right for female athletes to "adjust their own lives" because of such abuse and pledged to work with platform providers to implement further measures.</p>
