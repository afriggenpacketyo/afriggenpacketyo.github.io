          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney has robustly defended his "golden generation" teammates against recent comments by Steven Gerrard, who suggested their lack of international success stemmed from players being "egotistical losers." On his BBC podcast, Rooney countered that his team worked diligently and "didn't quite manage to get over the line," rejecting the notion of a superior attitude in current squads as disrespectful. He acknowledged the historical difficulty of fostering close relationships between rival club players like those from Liverpool and Manchester United. Rooney emphasized that despite not winning, the players always believed in their ability and gave their all for the team.</p>

          <p>Rhun ap Iorwerth, leader of Plaid Cymru, has declared his party is ready to replace Welsh Labour at the next Senedd election, promising a "new government, with new energy and new ideas." Labour has held power in Wales since devolution began in 1999, but recent opinion polls indicate Plaid Cymru is now a strong contender, vying with Reform UK for electoral dominance. Ap Iorwerth aims to position Plaid as the leading anti-Reform party, appealing to a broader electorate beyond its traditional Welsh-speaking strongholds. While not centering on independence, the party plans to offer "radical" yet fiscally responsible policies, including a payment aimed at tackling child poverty.</p>

In response, the Prince's Royal Foundation is committing £1 million over three years to establish a National Suicide Prevention Network across the UK, aiming to delve deeper into the root causes of suicide and enhance support systems. On World Mental Health Day, William articulated his ambition to forge a "bold, unified national response to the heartbreaking and preventable tragedy of suicide." Mannings' charity, 2wish, will be a key partner in this collaborative effort.</p>

          <p>UK newspaper headlines are overwhelmingly optimistic about the prospect of ending the war in Gaza, featuring sentiments like "Peace within reach" and "A moment of shared hope" after a tentative ceasefire deal. The Daily Mirror urges the US and its allies to ensure this agreement evolves into a comprehensive peace settlement, cautioning against potential derailment by either Israeli non-compliance or terrorist actions. The Daily Express and Daily Mail credit President Trump's "sheer force of personality" for compelling the accord. However, The Daily Telegraph highlights persistent sticking points, including Hamas's disarmament and the formation of an international stabilization force, suggesting challenges remain despite the initial positive reception.</p>

          <p>The identity of a woman whose body was discovered on a Dutch beach in 2004 has finally been established as 35-year-old German citizen Eva Maria Pommer, 21 years after her mysterious death. This breakthrough resulted from a crucial tip-off received during Operation Identify Me, an international police campaign designed to identify women who died under suspicious circumstances across six European countries. Ms. Pommer, previously known as "the woman with the German keys," was found without obvious signs of injury, and the precise cause of death remains under investigation. This success marks the fourth identification achieved through the campaign, offering closure for a long-standing mystery.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists from China and Spain have achieved a significant breakthrough, discovering that by adding salt to ice, it can generate electricity when subjected to bending. This novel phenomenon, termed flexoelectricity, allows salt-doped ice to produce an electrical response comparable to some of the most effective ceramic materials known for their electrical properties. This research opens exciting new avenues for harnessing clean power in cold environments, potentially leading to the development of low-cost energy sources. The finding builds upon the same team's previous work, which demonstrated ice's inherent ability to generate power through bending under non-uniform strain.</p>

          <p>The New York Giants delivered a commanding 34-17 defeat to the Philadelphia Eagles, marking the defending Super Bowl champions' second consecutive loss. Rookie running back Cam Skattebo starred with three rushing touchdowns, while fellow rookie Jaxson Dart contributed significantly with both passing and rushing efforts. The Giants' defense also played a pivotal role, sacking Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts three times and securing a crucial interception. Despite the Eagles' persistent efforts, including multiple "tush push" plays, Hurts' uncharacteristic errors and the defense's struggles contributed to their first back-to-back defeats since the 2023 regular season. This victory represents a significant upset for the Giants against their NFC East rivals.</p>

          <p>China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) have jointly published a policy paper outlining new measures to curb "disorderly price competition" within several key industries. These initiatives aim to mitigate price wars and self-destructive cost-cutting practices, which regulators believe are detrimental to industry development, product innovation, and quality. Authorities will guide industry associations in evaluating average production costs and assist companies in setting reasonable prices. Furthermore, regulators plan to closely monitor market competition, issue warnings for suspected price wars, and conduct cost investigations and price inspections, with violations facing legal enforcement.

She previously gained national attention for a public confrontation with President Trump regarding his administration's stance on transgender athletes.

While Southeast Asian economies might benefit from Japan's renewed drive for supply chain diversification, Takaichi's rhetoric focusing on strategic self-interest could make Tokyo's economic engagement more conditional.

A key return is the single-player campaign, a feature absent in the previous installment. While initial sales are projected to be strong, its long-term success depends on retaining players amidst fierce competition.
