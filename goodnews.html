        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party has committed to reinstating winter fuel payments to pensioners and scrapping the two-child benefit cap if they gain power, highlighting policy divisions within the Labour party. The party plans to fund these policies by cutting net-zero projects and asylum seeker hotels. This move follows pressure on Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to ease cuts to winter fuel payments and address the two-child benefit cap, a policy affecting an estimated 1.5 million families. The article suggests Reform UK is attempting to position itself as a viable alternative by addressing issues where Labour faces internal disagreements.</p>

          <p>Swarms of midges are causing distress at the World Exposition in Osaka, Japan, with visitors cringing as the insects land on food and surfaces. While the midges do not bite, inhaling dead ones can trigger asthma and allergic reactions, prompting health advisories. Experts believe the insects originate from the Water Plaza, where seawater is stored, and could persist through autumn. The expo organizer is actively spraying insecticide, treating rainwater accumulation areas, and installing insect repellent lights, with Osaka Gov. Hirofumi Yoshimura seeking assistance from an insecticide manufacturer.</p>

          <p>New York City beaches opened for the season with 280 certified lifeguards, a number short of the city's needs but an improvement from last year. City officials are optimistic that staffing will increase as summer progresses and students finish their classes, with 374 new lifeguards in training. Incentives such as increased hourly wages and signing bonuses are being offered to attract more lifeguards, and efforts have been made to improve lifeguard stations. Beachgoers expressed relief at the presence of lifeguards, which provides a sense of security, especially given past incidents of drownings when lifeguards were not on duty.</p>

Despite the disruption, festival organizers confirmed that all scheduled events, including the Palme d'Or ceremony, would proceed as planned, thanks to an independent power supply.

This move is seen as a demonstration of Canada's unique identity and traditions, distinct from the United States. The invitation comes at a time when Trump has undermined Canada's sovereignty and imposed tariffs that threaten its economic stability. While the monarchy's popularity among Canadians is varied, the invitation is a clear statement of support for the Crown.</p>

These churches also promote traditional gender roles, home-schooling, and large families, and are gaining traction online through podcasts and videos.

          <p>Arsenal's Women's Champions League victory has been celebrated as a near-miracle, defying odds and overcoming significant challenges. The team, after finishing third in the Women's Super League, had to navigate three qualifying rounds and played a record 15 games to lift the trophy. Written off as underdogs, they faced defeats against Real Madrid and Lyon but turned things around under interim manager Slegers, who is praised for "steadying the ship" at a difficult time. The team's resilience and determination led them to a historic victory.</p>

          <p>In Lecheng, Hainan, China's tropical southernmost island province, patients are accessing experimental drugs for cancer within a medical special zone. This zone allows patients to receive therapies still in clinical trials, including cutting-edge stem cell treatments and gene therapies, before they are widely available. A 50-year-old woman with early-stage lung cancer is among the first to receive the LK101 injection, a personalized mRNA vaccine designed to reduce the risk of relapse. The West China Lecheng Hospital provides state-of-the-art facilities and single-patient suites with views of tropical gardens.</p>

          <h2>New Rules Proposed to Address Unfinished Housing Sites</h2>

          <p>Under proposed new rules, developers who leave housing sites unfinished for extended periods could have their land transferred to local councils. The government aims to expedite housebuilding, requiring developers to commit to delivery time frames and submit annual progress reports. Those failing to meet targets may face penalties and denial of future permissions. Housing charity Shelter welcomed the plans, accusing developers of delaying construction to maintain high prices, while calling for increased social housing construction by councils.</p>
