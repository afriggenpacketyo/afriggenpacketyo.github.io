          <p>Washington Commanders quarterback Sam Hartman, currently a fourth-string player fighting for a roster spot, received a unique request during a training camp autograph session. A fan asked him to greet her mother, Susan, who she said finds him "super hot." The 26-year-old former Notre Dame standout handled the moment with humor, responding that he doesn't discriminate based on age and appreciates the support. Hartman, who went undrafted but signed with the Commanders, has gained attention for his distinctive look, contributing to his popularity among fans beyond his on-field performance.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues against framing China's advancements in green technology as a threatening "China Shock 2.0." Instead of disrupting existing industries, China is actively building new ones, particularly in electric vehicles, clean energy, and AI, which benefits the entire world. The author highlights that in 2023, China installed more solar capacity than the rest of the world combined and is a primary driver in reducing global clean energy costs. The piece concludes that China is not merely supporting the green transition but is effectively underwriting it, positioning itself as a leader for the 21st century.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The world-famous Barbie doll has its origins in a German character named Lilli, who first appeared in a 1952 comic strip in the Bild tabloid. Created to appeal to male readers, Lilli was a sexually suggestive character often interpreted as a high-class call girl. In 1955, she was turned into a plastic doll, which was primarily marketed to men as a gag gift. Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler discovered the Lilli doll in Switzerland, bought the rights, and redesigned her into Barbie, who debuted in 1959 and became a global phenomenon, while production of the original Lilli doll ceased.</p>

          <p>Applications to refinance home loans jumped 23% last week, reaching their highest level since April, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. This surge was largely driven by a renewed interest in adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), as their initial rates are more attractive than those for traditional fixed-rate loans. Overall mortgage application volume rose 10.9%, with the ARM share of applications reaching its highest point since 2022. The trend suggests homeowners are actively seeking savings amid fluctuating interest rates, even if it means taking on riskier loan products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team of scientists from the University of Science and Technology of China has developed the world's largest array of atoms for quantum computing. Led by physicist Pan Jianwei, the researchers used an AI-powered system to arrange over 2,000 rubidium atoms into perfect patterns with unprecedented speed. This achievement represents a significant breakthrough for atom-based quantum computing, an approach considered highly promising due to the stability and control of neutral atoms as qubits. The development overcomes a major hurdle that had previously limited such systems to arrays of only a few hundred atoms.</p>

          <p>Zach Cregger's new horror film, "Weapons," uses the mysterious disappearance of 17 children to explore the societal suspicion directed at single, childless women. The film centers on Justine (Julia Garner), the children's unmarried teacher, who becomes the prime suspect and scapegoat for a terrified community. This review analyzes how the movie taps into a long-standing cultural trope, seen in films from "Fatal Attraction" to the present, that portrays unmarried women as unstable and a threat to the natural order. Despite the harassment she faces, Justine emerges as the film's resilient heroine, determined to uncover the truth.</p>

          <p>GE Appliances has announced a massive $3 billion, five-year investment to expand its U.S. operations, which will create over 1,000 jobs. As part of this plan, the company will shift production of some refrigerators and water heaters from China and gas ranges from Mexico to its plants in states like Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. This move continues the company's strategy of reshoring manufacturing, a decision accelerated by U.S. tariffs on foreign goods. The investment will focus on modernizing plants and upskilling the American workforce to handle the increased domestic production.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Australia have identified a new species of prehistoric whale that lived 26 million years ago, piecing it together from a well-preserved skull found on Victoria's Surf Coast. Named Janjucetus dullardi after the local who discovered it, the creature was a small, dolphin-sized predator with sharp, slicing teeth. It belonged to the mammalodontids, a group of distant, smaller relatives of today's massive filter-feeding whales. The discovery provides a new window into the evolution of whales and highlights the region as a crucial site for understanding their ancient history.</p>

          <p>The reboot of the animated series "King of the Hill" returns to a suburban Arlen, Texas, that feels both familiar and, in today's climate, somewhat fantastical. This analysis suggests the show's focus on close-knit neighborly relationships and community support presents an idealistic vision that contrasts with the reality of modern social and political fragmentation. While the show touches on contemporary issues like lockdowns and technology-induced isolation, it largely avoids the deep cultural divisions of present-day America. This allows it to maintain its gentle, character-driven humor and champion a message of tolerance and communal responsibility.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 06:48:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time since the market turmoil caused by Liz Truss's mini-budget in September 2022, the average rate for a two-year fixed mortgage in the UK has fallen below 5%, now standing at 4.99%. Financial data firm Moneyfacts described this as a "symbolic turning point," indicating increased competition among lenders. This relief for homebuyers comes as 1.6 million fixed-rate deals are set to expire in 2025. However, with inflation forecasts ticking up, analysts believe that the Bank of England's base rate may hold steady, meaning further substantial drops in mortgage rates are unlikely.
