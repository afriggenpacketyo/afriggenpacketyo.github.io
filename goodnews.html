          <p>Toyota Industries Corp. experienced a significant stock decline after the Toyota Group announced a $33 billion deal to privatize the company, reflecting investor concerns about the offer's attractiveness. The deal, aimed at unwinding cross-shareholding ties amidst regulatory and investor pressure, involves creating a new holding company with investments from Toyota Group entities and chairman Akio Toyoda. Despite a special committee's requests for a higher offer, the final price was deemed below the valuation range suggested by independent financial advisors. While seen as positive for Toyota Group's long-term capital returns, the deal has raised questions about the immediate benefits for Toyota Industries shareholders (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce a ¬£15 billion investment in transport projects across the Midlands, North, and West Country, marking a shift from stringent Treasury rules that have historically favored London and the South-East. The funding will support tram, train, and bus projects in mayoral authorities, including extensions to tram networks in Greater Manchester and the West Midlands, as well as the development of the West Yorkshire Mass Transit program. This investment aims to address regional disparities and stimulate growth in areas facing economic challenges, with the announcement being part of a five-year funding allocation from 2027/28 to 2031/32. While welcomed as a watershed moment for improving transport, some warn that similar promises have been made before without delivery.</p>

          <p>Australia's economy grew at a slower-than-expected pace in the first quarter of the year, with a year-on-year growth of 1.3%, missing estimates of 1.5%. The Australian Bureau of Statistics attributed the soft growth to shrinking public spending, weakened consumer demand, and reduced exports, with extreme weather events impacting mining, tourism, and shipping. The Reserve Bank of Australia expects domestic GDP growth to pick up in 2025, but at a more gradual pace due to weaker global demand and uncertainty. Inflation in the country has eased to 2.4%, within the RBA's target range.</p>
