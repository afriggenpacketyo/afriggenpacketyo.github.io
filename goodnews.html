          <p>Shares of UnitedHealth Group experienced their largest single-day jump in five years, soaring 12% after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a new $1.6 billion stake in the company. The investment is seen as a significant vote of confidence in the embattled health insurer, which has faced a Justice Department investigation and a nearly 50% stock decline this year amid public backlash over rising healthcare costs. The news, combined with new positions taken by investors Michael Burry and David Tepper, has provided a potential trading floor for the stock and renewed investor optimism in the managed care sector.

          <p>Homeowners considering borrowing $100,000 from their home equity face a choice between a fixed-rate home equity loan and a variable-rate home equity line of credit (HELOC). With a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut anticipated in September, a HELOC might become the cheaper option due to its variable rate adjusting downward, though this also brings payment uncertainty. In contrast, a home equity loan provides a stable, predictable payment but may not fully capitalize on a lower-rate environment. The article advises borrowers to carefully consider their financial stability and long-term goals before making a decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is considering nearly a dozen candidates to replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair, each with distinct views on the central bank's direction. Most candidates, including former Governor Kevin Warsh and market strategist David Zervos, advocate for lowering the benchmark interest rate, with some calling for fundamental changes to the Fed's operations. In interviews, contenders have emphasized different priorities, from former St. Louis Fed President James Bullard's focus on independence to National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett's call for greater transparency. The selection comes at a critical time for U.S. monetary policy and economic strategy.</p>

The breaches exposed sensitive personal information, including Social Security numbers, for 73 million account holders and the call and text records for nearly all cellular customers. Eligible individuals, who are being notified via email, can claim up to $7,500 in compensation for documented losses traceable to the incidents.

          <p>A research team at Tianjin University in China has created a pilot production line for a new lithium battery with an energy density of over 600 watt-hours per kilogram. This capacity is double that of Tesla's advanced 4680 cells and four times that of BYD's Blade Battery, potentially revolutionizing the electric vehicle market by eliminating 'range anxiety.' The breakthrough, detailed in the journal Nature, surpasses Beijing's 'Made in China 2025' goals for battery technology. If successfully scaled, this innovation could significantly extend the driving range of EVs and has also demonstrated superior thermal and mechanical stability in safety tests.</p>

          <p>The insurance firm Gallagher is providing professional athletes with summer internships to help them prepare for careers after their sports tenure ends. The program, which began with NFL players and now includes members of the NWSL's Chicago Stars, offers paid business experience, mentorship, and skills development tailored to their demanding schedules. In return, Gallagher has found that the athletes' discipline, teamwork, and work ethic translate well to the corporate environment. The initiative aims to provide a crucial career pathway for athletes in fields where careers can be short and earnings unpredictable, with some interns later being hired as full-time employees.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered 31 shipwrecks at the bottom of Lake Constance in Germany, including what is believed to be a paddle steamer destroyed in a World War II air raid. The 'Wrecks and Deep Sea' project used sonar, divers, and remotely operated vehicles to survey the lake bed, uncovering a range of vessels from different eras. Among the finds is a remarkably well-preserved cargo sailing ship with its mast still intact, offering significant insights into historical shipbuilding. Officials are focused on documenting these underwater cultural monuments for research purposes rather than undertaking costly salvage operations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A record 226,000 18-year-olds in the UK have been accepted into their first-choice university, representing 82% of applicants with offers. This trend is partly driven by universities facing financial deficits due to frozen domestic tuition fees and a decline in international student enrollment, making them more eager to secure UK undergraduates. Consequently, even highly selective universities are actively recruiting through the Clearing system, sometimes offering financial incentives. While this is a positive outcome for students, it highlights the precarious financial state of many institutions and may have knock-on effects for universities that are less able to attract students.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Premier League club Bournemouth has entered into discussions with Liverpool to sign 19-year-old Scottish winger Ben Doak. Liverpool is reportedly seeking a £25 million transfer fee for the player, who has also attracted interest from other clubs, including Portuguese side Porto. Doak, who spent last season on loan at Middlesbrough, has made only ten appearances for Liverpool since joining from Celtic in 2022. Bournemouth is keen to negotiate a lower price as they look to rebuild their squad after selling several key defenders and agreeing to a £42.5 million deal to sell Dango Ouattara to Brentford.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A $100,000 deposit into a high-yield savings account with a 4.35% APY could earn approximately $4,350 in interest over one year, assuming the rate remains constant. However, these accounts have variable rates that are likely to decrease gradually in response to anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts later in the year. Despite this variability, high-yield savings accounts currently offer competitive returns without the withdrawal restrictions of Certificates of Deposit (CDs). Savers should weigh the potential for rate changes against the flexibility and current high earnings when deciding where to place a significant amount of cash. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have seen a 'substantial improvement,' with the average 30-year fixed rate dropping to 6.58%, down significantly from the nearly 8% peak in late 2023. This decline is creating a favorable environment for homeowners who purchased their properties in recent years with higher interest rates to consider refinancing. Experts suggest that homeowners with rates above 6%, and especially those at 7% or higher, could see significant savings. However, they advise considering the closing costs and ensuring they plan to stay in the home long enough to amortize these expenses before proceeding with a refinance.</p>

          <p>Associated British Foods (ABF), the owner of the Kingsmill brand, has agreed to purchase its rival Hovis from private equity firm Endless, a move that would create the UK's largest bread producer. The merger of the two currently loss-making businesses aims to achieve profitability through cost-cutting and increased efficiency. The deal is a response to declining sales for pre-packaged bread as consumer tastes shift towards specialty breads and lower-carbohydrate diets. The Unite union has warned against any negative impact on jobs or worker conditions, and the merger will require approval from the Competition and Markets Authority.</p>

While the percentage growth is high, the average dollar amount of equity remains one of the lowest nationally at $35,931. Overall, states in the South and Midwest have seen the largest gains, while Louisiana was the only state to experience negative equity growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In India's state of Bihar, where inadequate cold-chain infrastructure and extreme heat cause significant food waste, solar-powered cold storage units are emerging as a solution. These facilities allow small-scale farmers to preserve perishable produce like potatoes for longer, enabling them to sell at better market prices and avoid spoilage, which can account for up to 35% of their harvest. While companies are installing these off-grid systems, challenges remain, including the high upfront cost for individual farmers and the need for community-based models. State subsidies are available, but experts emphasize that successful implementation requires collaboration between government, NGOs, and farmers.</p>
