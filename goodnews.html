This move is part of a larger agreement where Google will provide up to $1.4 billion in additional financial backstop to fund the expansion of TeraWulf's Lake Mariner facility in New York. The deal, which aims to build out advanced artificial intelligence infrastructure, follows recent computing agreements with AI cloud provider Fluidstack. This series of positive developments has caused TeraWulf's stock to increase by approximately 90% over the last week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Labor Day, a federal holiday celebrating the American workforce, will be observed on Monday, September 1, 2025. The holiday, which originated from the labor movement's fight for better working conditions in the late 19th century, now unofficially marks the end of summer for many. Most major retailers, grocery stores, and fast-food chains will remain open, though some may have reduced hours. However, federal government offices, the U.S. Postal Service, banks, and the stock market will be closed in observance of the holiday, providing a three-day weekend for many workers across the country.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House proceeded without the open hostility of their previous encounter. The discussion, which included several European leaders, centered on Trump's proposals for a peace deal to end the war with Russia, though he offered few specifics beyond bypassing a ceasefire. Zelenskyy navigated the session by thanking Trump for his efforts and avoiding direct confrontation. The presence of European leaders appeared to moderate the talks, steering the conversation toward a unified front and placing the impetus for peace back on Russia.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A specific accounting practice known as the retail inventory method (RIM), used by major retailers like Walmart and Target, could temporarily distort their reported profitability as new tariffs on imported goods take effect. RIM uses an average cost-to-retail ratio across many items, which can initially overstate profitability when product costs rise suddenly. This accounting lag means that the immediate financial impact of tariffs may not be fully reflected in upcoming quarterly earnings reports. While this effect normalizes over time, it creates a temporary disconnect between a company's operational performance and its financial statements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Texas health officials have officially declared an end to a measles outbreak that infected over 700 people, the state's largest in three decades. The outbreak, which led to the deaths of two unvaccinated children and nearly 100 hospitalizations, was declared over after 42 days passed without a new reported case. The majority of infections occurred in children, with cases concentrated in an area with low vaccination rates. Despite the end of this specific outbreak, officials warn that the threat of measles persists due to declining vaccination rates and ongoing outbreaks elsewhere in the U.S. and globally.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While there is no strict legal age limit for purchasing an annuity, most insurance companies impose their own caps, typically between 80 and 85 years old for immediate annuities. The optimal age to buy an annuity depends on an individual's retirement strategy, health, and financial goals. Financial advisors often suggest considering them in one's late 50s or 60s to balance growth potential with favorable rates. Purchasing later in life, such as in one's 70s, can result in higher monthly payments due to shorter life expectancy, but may also limit product availability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of international support for Ukraine shows that the United States has been the largest single-country donor since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. According to the Kiel Institute, total U.S. aid committed between January 2022 and June 2025 amounts to $130.6 billion. However, when combining aid from all European nations and EU institutions, Europe's total contribution of $165.7 billion surpasses that of the U.S. This data provides context to ongoing discussions about burden-sharing among allies, clarifying that while U.S. support is substantial, the collective European effort is greater.</p>
