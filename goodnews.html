          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has expressed optimism about reaching a trade agreement with China, stating that "we have the makings of a deal" ahead of an August 12 tariff deadline. While technical details are still being finalized, the sentiment suggests a potential de-escalation of the trade conflict that has seen both nations impose significant tariffs on each other's imports. The ongoing negotiations are characterized as "tough," but this development points toward a possible pact that could stabilize economic relations between the two global powers.

          <p>An attempt to recall 24 opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers in Taiwan has failed, an outcome that analysts believe has temporarily eased cross-strait tensions with mainland China. The recall campaign, framed by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) as a move to "resist China, protect Taiwan," was closely watched by Beijing. A successful recall could have been interpreted as a rise in anti-China sentiment, potentially leading to a more confrontational stance from the mainland and creating new uncertainty in the region's delicate political balance.</p>

Despite this strong performance, the company experienced a loss of 226,000 broadband customers, reflecting ongoing industry-wide competition and a strategic pivot in its market approach. Growth areas included a record addition of 378,000 mobile customers and strong revenue from its film studios and theme parks, which helped offset a continued decline in pay-TV subscribers.

          <p>In a head-to-head clinical trial, Eli Lilly's popular diabetes drug Mounjaro was shown to provide cardiovascular benefits for patients with Type 2 diabetes, performing as well as the company's older treatment, Trulicity. The study's main goal was to prove Mounjaro was not inferior in reducing risks of heart attack, stroke, or cardiovascular death. The results strengthen the case for Mounjaro as a primary treatment choice, especially as it also showed additional benefits like a lower rate of death from any cause and greater kidney protection.</p>

          <p>The article explores the cultural phenomenon of Labubu dolls, small, bunny-eared creature figures from the company Pop Mart that have become a multi-million dollar craze. Their "cute-ugly" aesthetic, combining large baby-like eyes with sharp teeth and a mischievous grin, creates a polarizing reaction that fuels their desirability. The toys are sold in limited, high-demand "drops" and "blind boxes," adding a gambling-like thrill to collecting them. This scarcity and divisive nature are key to their success, creating an in-group of collectors who find joy in the chase and a sense of belonging.</p>

          <p>Moderna and BioNTech, the two companies that became famous for their mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, are now pursuing distinctly different corporate strategies. Moderna is doubling down on its mRNA pipeline, investing heavily in new vaccines, and recently announced a 10% workforce reduction to cut costs amid slowing sales. In contrast, BioNTech has used its vaccine profits to diversify through acquisitions, expanding into promising new cancer drug technologies. This strategic divergence is reflected in their stock performance, with investors appearing to favor BioNTech's broader, less risky approach. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An international scientific expedition led by China has discovered the deepest known life habitat on Earth, a thriving community of tubeworms and molluscs existing at depths of up to 9,500 meters in the Pacific Ocean. These organisms survive in total darkness through chemosynthesis, deriving energy from chemicals like methane and hydrogen sulfide seeping from tectonic plate faults, rather than from sunlight. Published in the journal Nature, this finding challenges existing models of life at extreme limits and suggests such ecosystems may be more common than previously thought.</p>
