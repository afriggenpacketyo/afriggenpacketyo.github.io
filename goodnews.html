        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Social media posts claiming Germany has canceled its Christmas markets for 2025 are false, according to a DW fact-check. While a few small, local markets have been called off for reasons like renovations or low vendor revenue, the vast majority of Germany's over 2,500 markets are scheduled to open as planned. The viral claims originated from a discreditable article that used unsubstantiated information and AI-generated imagery to paint a bleak picture of the country. Rising security costs are a genuine concern for organizers, but this has not led to widespread cancellations.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-25 04:04:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As winter approaches and daylight hours decrease, many in the UK, particularly in northern regions like Scotland, face challenges with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). This recurring seasonal depression is linked to reduced sunlight and can cause low mood, anxiety, and fatigue. In response, a new project in Orkney is providing "Wintering Well" boxes through libraries, which include therapeutic lamps and activity guides to help residents cope. The initiative, led by the University of Glasgow, aims to shift psychological attitudes toward winter by encouraging outdoor activity and creating comforting indoor light environments.</p>

          <p>Counting has begun in the Republic of Ireland's presidential election to determine the successor to President Michael D. Higgins. Voters chose between two main contenders, independent candidate Catherine Connolly and Fine Gael's Heather Humphreys, although a third candidate who withdrew late remained on the ballot. Connolly, a sitting TD, is backed by several left-wing parties, while Humphreys is a former senior cabinet minister. Early indications suggest that voter turnout might be low, potentially failing to surpass the record low set in the 2018 election.</p>

          <p>An angel investor who backed AI voice startup ElevenLabs in its infancy decided to invest after a single 30-minute meeting with co-founder Mati Staniszewski in 2022. At the time, voice AI was an overlooked market, but the investor was convinced by Staniszewski's technical expertise and deep understanding of the industry's core problems. This early belief paid off, as ElevenLabs, which specializes in advanced text-to-speech technology, has since achieved a valuation of over $6 billion. The story highlights the investor's strategy of identifying promising founders in non-hyped sectors before they become mainstream. (not investment advice)</p>

Tarling secured the top spot in the men's points race, marking the first British victory in the event since 2016. Shortly after, Charlton dominated the individual pursuit, becoming the first British man to win that world title since Bradley Wiggins in 2008. The victories, along with a bronze medal for Joe Truman in the 1km time trial, brought Great Britain's overall medal count to seven after three days of competition.</p>

          <p>Herbie Farnworth, who plays for the Dolphins in Australia's NRL, is being highlighted as a potential game-changer for England in the upcoming Ashes series against Australia. Regarded as one of the best centres in the world, Farnworth's skill and power are seen as a "cheat code" that could help England achieve its first series victory since 1970. Having moved from Lancashire to Australia as a teenager to pursue his dream, he has become a star player, earning accolades and the respect of his teammates. Farnworth remains modest about his status, expressing excitement to compete against Australia's top talent on home soil.</p>

His dominant play, which included 23 points in the first quarter alone, set the tone for the Lakers' decisive win and showcased his exceptional start to the season.</p>

          <p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Kuala Lumpur is set to tackle major regional security issues, including border tensions between Thailand and Cambodia and the ongoing civil war in Myanmar. US President Donald Trump is expected to attend and oversee the signing of a peace accord between Thailand and Cambodia, following a ceasefire brokered earlier this year. However, finding a solution for the crisis in Myanmar remains a significant challenge for the bloc, as diplomatic efforts to implement its Five-Point Consensus peace plan have so far been ineffective. The summit will also welcome Timor-Leste as its 11th member.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a potential meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump, China's ambassador in Washington has called for "shared prosperity" and cooperation between the two nations. Emphasizing that there are "1,000 reasons to get China-US relations right," the envoy urged the US to work with China based on principles of mutual respect and peaceful coexistence. The statement comes as high-level economic and trade delegations from both countries meet in Malaysia to address escalating trade tensions that have recently disrupted global markets. The potential summit is viewed as a key opportunity to de-escalate the conflict.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has officially endorsed Democratic assemblyman Zohran Mamdani for mayor of New York City, providing a significant boost to the frontrunner's campaign just before early voting begins. Jeffries cited Mamdani's focus on the city's affordability crisis and his commitment to being a mayor for all New Yorkers. The endorsement consolidates support for Mamdani within the Democratic party, contrasting with outgoing Mayor Eric Adams' recent endorsement of Mamdani's opponent, former Governor Andrew Cuomo. The move is seen as a key signal of party unity ahead of the general election.</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping's upcoming visit to South Korea for the APEC summit is being interpreted as a symbolic and carefully planned effort to reset strained diplomatic ties between the two countries. While major immediate breakthroughs are not expected, the visit itself marks a significant move toward improving the relationship. This will be Xi's first visit since 2014, a time that was considered a high point in Beijing-Seoul relations and led to a free-trade agreement. The current diplomatic landscape is more complex, but the meeting signals a mutual interest in stabilizing the bilateral connection.</p>

          <p>The Latino population in the United States has nearly doubled since 2000, growing from 35.3 million to 68 million and now constituting one in five Americans, according to a new Pew Research Center report. This growth, which accounts for over half of the total US population increase in that period, has been driven by both immigration and native births. The report also highlights that US Latinos are the nation's youngest major ethnic group, with a median age of 31, and that a large majority (79%) are US citizens. California and Texas are home to the largest Latino populations in the country.</p>
