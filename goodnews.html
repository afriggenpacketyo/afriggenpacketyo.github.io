          <p>Shares of Block, the fintech company formerly known as Square, surged over 10% after S&P Global announced its inclusion in the S&P 500 index. Block is set to replace Hess, which was recently acquired by Chevron, with the change taking effect on July 23. This addition reflects the growing influence of the technology sector within the benchmark index. Despite this positive development, Block's stock has underperformed this year, and the company issued a cautious outlook in its last earnings report, citing challenging macroeconomic conditions.

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel has touted the agency's success in dismantling a massive fraud scheme in Minnesota that stole over $250 million from a federal child nutrition program during the COVID-19 pandemic. The "Feeding our Future" scheme involved conspirators who falsely claimed to serve millions of meals to children, instead using the funds for personal luxuries. To date, 70 individuals have been indicted, with 38 pleading guilty. Patel emphasized the shamelessness of the crime and affirmed the FBI's commitment to holding those who exploit vulnerable populations accountable.</p>

          <p>Ten Americans who were detained in Venezuela have been freed and are returning to the United States following a complex three-way prisoner exchange. The deal involved El Salvador transferring 252 Venezuelan nationals, alleged gang members who were deported from the U.S., to Venezuela. In addition to the freed Americans, the Venezuelan government also released dozens of its own political prisoners. Secretary of State Marco Rubio credited President Trump's leadership for securing the release, stating that every wrongfully detained American in Venezuela is now free.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that a strong majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, favor the U.S. undertaking missions to return to the moon and eventually travel to Mars. Support is particularly high among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The survey also found that most people believe the 1969 moon landing was a worthwhile endeavor that contributes to national pride and technological advancement. These positive views on space exploration are broadly consistent across different political and ideological groups.</p>

          <p>The stock of online real estate company Opendoor experienced a massive 189% rally this week, largely driven by the enthusiastic support of hedge fund manager Eric Jackson. Jackson, who previously backed Carvana during its recovery, publicly announced his firm's position in Opendoor, predicting it could be a "100-bagger." Despite the company's ongoing financial losses and a recent proposal for a reverse stock split to maintain its Nasdaq listing, Jackson's social media influence has created a speculative frenzy around the stock. The company's fundamentals have not changed, highlighting the significant impact of retail investor sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler has taken the lead at the 153rd Open Championship, finishing the second round at ten under par.

English golfer Matt Fitzpatrick is just one shot behind at nine under, setting up an exciting weekend showdown. Despite Scheffler's downplaying of the significance of winning, his dominant performance suggests an air of inevitability as the tournament heads into its final 36 holes.</p>

          <p>Netflix's strong quarterly results, which showed double-digit revenue growth and a positive outlook, are being interpreted as welcome news for investors in Disney. Netflix's success in growing its member base while also implementing price hikes and expanding its ad-supported tier suggests a healthy market for premium streaming content. This provides a positive read-through for Disney, which is pursuing a similar strategy of raising prices and growing advertising for its Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ services. Analysts believe this demonstrates that consumers are willing to pay for quality content, bolstering Disney's path to streaming profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that gives it a significant stake in Guyana's vast offshore oil reserves. The deal was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the Stabroek Block oil development. Chevron's CEO expressed pleasure with the outcome, stating it affirms the industry practice that such rights do not apply to corporate-level mergers. The resolution removes major uncertainty that had been weighing on the transaction.</p>

          <p>The UK has imposed sanctions on 18 Russian military intelligence officers and three GRU units for conducting a "sustained campaign of malicious cyber activity." The Foreign Office alleges this campaign aimed to destabilize Europe and targeted UK infrastructure, media, and political institutions. This action is described as the most significant against Russian spies since the 2018 Salisbury poisonings. The move coincides with the EU imposing its 18th round of sanctions on Russia, further tightening economic pressure in response to the ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>
