          <p>Apple's shares experienced a dip after CEO Tim Cook expressed uncertainty regarding the potential impact of tariffs beyond June, despite the company's second fiscal-quarter earnings surpassing Wall Street expectations. Cook mentioned that tariffs are expected to add $900 million to costs in the current quarter, but predicting beyond that is difficult due to tariff uncertainties. He noted Apple is already sourcing iPhones for the U.S. from India and other products from Vietnam, where tariffs are lower than from China. The company reported $1.65 per share on $24.78 billion of net income during the quarter, versus $23.64 billion, or $1.53 per share, in the year-ago period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy conveyed optimism that the company could emerge stronger from the current tariff environment during the company's first-quarter earnings call. Jassy referenced the COVID-19 pandemic as an example of how Amazon's broad selection and low prices helped customers find what they wanted despite economic uncertainty. The comments followed Amazon's first-quarter earnings report, where the company beat expectations, but its operating income forecast for the current period came in light. Amazon projected operating profit of $13 billion to $17.5 billion, compared with consensus estimates of $17.8 billion, according to LSEG. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon reported better-than-expected results for the first quarter, driven by growth in its cloud computing and advertising businesses, but it gave soft guidance for the current period. The company expects second-quarter operating income to be between $13 billion and $17.5 billion, below the $17.64 billion consensus forecast, according to StreetAccount. Amazon noted "tariffs and trade policies" and "recessionary fears" are among a range of factors that could make its guidance subject to change. Many sellers on Amazon's third-party marketplace, which accounts for more than half the company's total sales, rely on the world's second-largest economy to make or assemble their products.

The proposal has raised concerns among education experts, including State Education Commissioner Betty Rosa, who called the changes a “travesty” for children in religious schools lacking a basic secular education. The potential deal is the result of years of lobbying by Hasidic leaders, who view government oversight as a threat. A 2022 New York Times investigation found that scores of all-boys yeshivas collected about $1 billion in government funding over a four-year period but failed to provide a basic education.</p>

Airbnb attributed the softer results in the U.S. to broader economic uncertainties. The company said it experienced strong year-over-year growth in North America "despite broad macro uncertainty".

Trump defended his tariff plan as necessary to combat unfair trade deficits and boost domestic manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>
