        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of a UK/EU summit, youth mobility and fishing rights have emerged as key negotiating issues, with the prime minister hoping to "reset" relations. The EU is proposing a "youth mobility scheme" allowing citizens aged 18-30 to stay for up to four years, but concerns exist about its impact on UK immigration numbers. Fishing rights are also contentious, with the EU seeking an extension of current arrangements while UK fishing groups advocate for changes. Post-Brexit paperwork has complicated fish exports, and Cornish fishermen want to restrict EU vessels from fishing closer to the coast.</p>

          <p>The Doom franchise, a cornerstone of video games since 1993, is adapting to the modern gaming landscape with its latest installment, Doom: The Dark Ages. The developers face challenges such as attracting new players, competing with free-to-play games, and managing rising production costs. They aim to draw in new audiences with a "Medieval sci-fi" setting and customizable gameplay, while emphasizing the value of a premium, curated experience over potentially more expensive free-to-play models. The game will also be available on PC and Xbox via Game Pass, offering an alternative to purchasing the game outright.</p>

          <p>British-Ghanaian designer Ozwald Boateng celebrated 40 years in the fashion industry by dressing celebrities, including African musicians, for the Met Gala. The theme, "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style," aligned with Boateng's signature style of challenging men's tailoring norms with bold colors and African-inspired patterns. Boateng, who opened the first black-owned shop on Savile Row in 1995, sees the Met Gala as an opportunity to reach a new audience. He was inspired by his father's tailored suits and the influence of tailoring on black identity.</p>

Trump's initial post followed Swift's endorsement of Kamala Harris, and he has a history of criticizing celebrities who oppose him politically. Trump also criticized Bruce Springsteen in a separate post.</p>

          <p>A California environmental board voted to rescind a controversial proposal that would have allowed municipal landfills to accept contaminated soil currently designated for hazardous waste sites. Environmental advocates and community members raised concerns about toxic dust and groundwater contamination. The decision followed months of scrutiny and opposition to the plan, with state officials acknowledging the concerns. The proposal aimed to ease the disposal of contaminated soil, but critics argued it would weaken environmental protections and rely on federal rules.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit seeks to prevent the Los Angeles Zoo from moving its two surviving elephants, Billy and Tina, to another zoo in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with animal-rights advocates, including Cher, advocating for their relocation to an animal sanctuary. The zoo's decision to move the elephants comes after two aging members of the herd were euthanized. Advocates argue that the elephants' enclosure is restrictive and harmful, while zoo officials claim the move is in the best interest of the animals, a stance which has been publicly challenged by city officials. The battle reflects a broader trend of zoos closing elephant enclosures amid lawsuits and shrinking animal populations.</p>
