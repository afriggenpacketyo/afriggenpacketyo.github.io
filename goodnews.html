          <p>The British and Irish governments have agreed to a new framework to address legacy cases from the Northern Ireland Troubles. This deal involves reforming the UK's controversial legacy body, which will be renamed the Legacy Commission, and establishing a new legacy unit within the Irish police force. The agreement, which requires new legislation in both countries, aims to ensure full cooperation from Irish state bodies and heal the diplomatic rift caused by the previous UK act. Victims' groups have been briefed on the plan, which is seen as an opportunity to move forward on the sensitive issue of historical justice.</p>

          <p>Italian driver Fabio Barone has set a new world record for the fastest speed achieved by a car on a boat. He drove a Ferrari SF90 supercar across the flight deck of an Italian navy aircraft carrier, reaching a certified speed of 101.9 mph (164 km/h). The attempt, which took place near Rome, was challenging due to a damp flight deck that had to be dried before the run. After successfully braking before the deck's "ski jump" end, the record was confirmed by an official timekeeper, and the results will be submitted to Guinness World Records.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell after initially hitting a record high, following the Bank of Japan's decision to keep its policy rate unchanged at 0.5%. The central bank's move was widely expected and comes as Japan's core inflation rate for August slowed to 2.7%, its lowest level since November 2024. Analysts suggest the BOJ is taking a cautious approach, prioritizing economic stability amid global uncertainty and slowing inflation. The decision signals a continued focus on supporting Japan's economic recovery rather than implementing premature tightening measures. (not investment advice)</p>

Early signs from preorders and launch day queues appear positive, with customers expressing excitement over new designs and features. The successful rollout could also help reassure investors who have raised questions about Apple's strategy and progress in the field of artificial intelligence, where competitors have been perceived as moving more aggressively.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Japan has maintained its policy rate at 0.5%, a decision made as the country's core inflation rate fell for the third consecutive month to 2.7% in August. This figure, which excludes fresh food prices, aligns with economists' expectations and marks the lowest level since November 2024. Despite headline inflation remaining above the bank's 2% target for over three years, the BOJ is prioritizing stability amid global uncertainty. Analysts believe this cautious stance supports a reflationary cycle, with some seeing long-term investment opportunities in Japan's industrial and manufacturing sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Listed companies based in China's Xinjiang region saw their stock prices surge, driven by the area's strong economic performance. In the first half of the year, Xinjiang's economy grew by 5.7%, surpassing the national average of 5.2%. This robust growth, combined with expectations of continued policy support from Beijing, has fueled investor optimism in sectors like infrastructure and energy. Speculation about the potential development of an artificial intelligence data center in the resource-rich region also contributed to the rally, highlighting Xinjiang's unique position as a focus for both thematic trading and state-backed development.

          <p>Scientists conducting excavations in the arid northern desert of Chad are finding evidence of a once-lush period known as the 'Green Sahara.' At the Gaora Hallagana rock shelter, a team of Chadian archaeologists and geologists discovered fragments of pottery and ancient rock art depicting animals like cattle, hippos, and giraffes. These findings suggest the region, now a desert, was previously home to pastures, forests, and waterways between 10,000 and 3,000 BC. The research aims to build a chronological framework for ancient human settlements and understand how people adapted to the region's dramatic climate change over millennia.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 2011, the total number of refugees living in Germany has decreased, falling by approximately 50,000 in the first half of 2025. The decline, from 3.55 million to 3.50 million, is attributed to a combination of factors including an increase in deportations, voluntary departures, and a significant number of naturalizations. The statistics include recent arrivals as well as long-term residents and over 1.2 million refugees from Ukraine. While the government may see this as a sign of managed migration, some political groups argue it reflects stricter EU border policies preventing those in need from seeking protection.</p>

Coming from a rugby family where both parents captained Canada, she has overcome a significant knee injury to return to world-class form for the tournament.
