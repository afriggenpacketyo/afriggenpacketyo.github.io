          <p>This New York Times article discusses Warren Buffett's impending retirement as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, marking the end of an era defined by his exceptional investment acumen and unwavering commitment to long-term value. Buffett's leadership transformed Berkshire from a struggling textile mill into a diversified conglomerate worth trillions, significantly outperforming market averages over six decades. The article emphasizes Buffett's ethical approach to capitalism, his focus on shareholder trust, and his ability to ignore short-term distractions in favor of enduring value, making him an irreplaceable figure in American finance.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump falsely asserted that gasoline prices have fallen below $2 per gallon, urging the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. This claim contradicts actual prices, which average over $3 per gallon nationwide. Trump's figure appears to be based on the price of RBOB gasoline futures, a wholesale contract that excludes taxes, transportation costs, and retail expenses. Analysts emphasize that RBOB prices are irrelevant to consumers, as they do not reflect the final price at the pump, highlighting the discrepancy between Trump's statement and the reality faced by U.S. drivers.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is reducing its overpayment clawback rate from 100% to 50% after a recent policy change sparked concerns about financial hardship for beneficiaries. The SSA's decision to take 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check to recover overpayments, directed by Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, faced criticism for its potential impact on low-income individuals. The agency's inspector general found that many overpayments were due to SSA's own calculation errors, leading to calls for a more lenient approach to recouping funds from recipients.</p>

His complicated relationship with President Trump, who previously attacked Kemp for not supporting his false election claims, also loomed over a potential campaign. Ossoff, considered the most vulnerable Democrat in the Senate, has been actively fundraising in anticipation of a tough race.</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer is adopting a cautious stance, refraining from new capital deployment due to the overbought conditions of the S&P 500, despite mixed sector performance and a stronger-than-expected ISM Services Index. While some sectors, like Industrials and Communication Services, showed positive performance, Energy and Consumer Discretionary sectors lagged. The Club is awaiting earnings reports from several companies, including Coterra Energy, Ford, and Palantir, before making further investment decisions. (not investment advice)</p>
