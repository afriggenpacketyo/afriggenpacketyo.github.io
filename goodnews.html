          <h2>Japan's Overall Exports Rebound as Asia Shipments Grow, Despite Continued Decline to U.S.</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 20:46:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports rebounded by 4.2% year-on-year in September, breaking a four-month streak of declines, largely fueled by strong growth in shipments to Asia. Despite this, exports to the U.S., Japan's second-largest trading partner, fell by 13.3%, with auto shipments particularly impacted, even after a trade deal aimed at reducing tariffs. The data emerges as Sanae Takaichi takes office as Japan's first female prime minister, with her proposed loose monetary policy and fiscal stimulus expected to weaken the yen, making Japanese goods more competitive globally. Overall economic resilience is noted, with second-quarter GDP revised upward, suggesting better-than-expected performance.</p>

          <h2>Experts Debunk Common Haircare Myths, Emphasizing Scalp Health Over Quick Fixes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 20:34:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Trichologists Eva Proudman and Tracey Walker debunk four common haircare myths, advising against cold water rinses for shine and clarifying that no product can truly repair damaged hair or split ends; only a haircut can. They stress that hair won't "self-clean" and requires regular washing to prevent oil and debris buildup, which can worsen scalp conditions like dandruff. Furthermore, dry shampoo is acceptable for single-day use between washes but should not replace regular washing, as overuse can lead to an itchy, flaky scalp. The article emphasizes that focusing on scalp health, similar to facial skincare, is crucial for overall hair well-being.</p>

          <h2>Vice President Vance Expresses Optimism on Israel-Hamas Ceasefire Progress</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 20:23:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vice President JD Vance and Jared Kushner, visiting Israel, expressed cautious optimism that the U.S.-brokered Israel-Hamas ceasefire is progressing better than anticipated, despite recent violence. Vance acknowledged difficulties in recovering all hostage remains, with two more bodies returned to Israel for identification. The peace deal has seen 165 Palestinian bodies returned to Gaza and all 20 living Israeli hostages released. However, the long-term viability of President Trump's peace plan remains uncertain, with critics like Alon Pinkas questioning Netanyahu's commitment and predicting a resumption of Israeli operations. Vance emphasized no American troops would be deployed in Gaza, while Trump warned Hamas against breaching the deal.</p>

          <p>Capital One's shares rose after the credit card issuer announced strong third-quarter results, surpassing revenue and earnings expectations, largely due to better-than-anticipated credit quality performance. Revenue surged 53% year-over-year to $15.36 billion, with adjusted EPS increasing 32% to $5.95. The company's net charge-off rates declined in both domestic card and auto portfolios, easing investor concerns about its subprime market exposure, especially after recent bankruptcies in the auto lending sector. Capital One also revealed a significant new $16 billion share repurchase authorization and boosted its quarterly dividend, signaling confidence in its financial health and the strategic benefits of its Discover acquisition.

          <p>A groundbreaking study by King's College London and the University of Oxford has, for the first time, ranked the physical side effects of various antidepressants, revealing substantial differences in their impact. Analyzing 30 commonly used drugs across 151 studies, researchers found variations such as weight changes of up to 2kg and heart rate shifts of 21 beats per minute within the first eight weeks of treatment. This research, published in the Lancet, emphasizes the importance of tailoring antidepressant prescriptions to individual patient needs and existing health conditions, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, to improve health outcomes and treatment adherence.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight from Denver to Los Angeles was diverted to Salt Lake City last week after pilots discovered a crack in the windshield. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating, and WindBorne Systems, a weather balloon company, believes one of its balloons may have been responsible. The multilayer windshield is designed to function with damage, and there were no injuries among the 134 passengers and six crew members. WindBorne Systems has initiated its own investigation, shared preliminary findings with the NTSB and FAA, and deployed a software change to minimize flight time at active levels, emphasizing their commitment to safety and weather forecasting.</p>

Despite a dip in consumer confidence and slight revenue decline, Merlin attracted nearly 63 million visitors in 2024, emphasizing escapism and family togetherness. The company is investing £85 million in immersive experiences, including new rides based on popular brands like Bluey, PAW Patrol, and Minecraft, to draw families back to parks.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions and aggressive rhetoric from some US officials, analysts suggest President Trump's direct control over his administration could make him a "unique guard rail" for US-China relations. His focus on leader-to-leader diplomacy with Xi Jinping, coupled with his ability to temper the more hawkish elements of his team, is seen as potentially stabilizing. International relations professor Zhiqun Zhu notes that Trump "calls the shots," making personal engagement crucial. While acknowledging structural competition between the two powers, this perspective suggests that Trump's centralized decision-making and pragmatic approach might prevent further escalation, offering a distinct dynamic in a fraught relationship.</p>

CEO Sam Altman believes AI offers a "once-in-a-decade opportunity" to redefine browsers, shifting internet access towards a chat-based experience with ChatGPT at its core. Atlas allows users to chat with websites, find products, and automate tasks like booking appointments. OpenAI, backed by Nvidia, seeks to make ChatGPT the default operating system for the AI age, leveraging its 800 million weekly users and developing custom AI chips. Despite Google's existing infrastructure and market share, Atlas represents a significant challenge in the evolving browser wars.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix shares dropped approximately 7% after the company missed its third-quarter earnings estimates, attributing the shortfall to an unexpected expense from an ongoing Brazilian tax dispute. The company recorded a 10% tax on certain payments made by Brazilian entities to operations outside the country, an impact not included in its prior forecast. Despite the earnings miss, revenue increased by 17% year-over-year, record ad sales, and strategic content expansion, including with "KPop Demon Hunters." While revising its full-year operating margin forecast due to the tax issue, Netflix anticipates continued revenue growth for the fourth quarter, signaling overall business resilience.
