          <h2>Culinary Experts and Chefs Debate the Merits and Flaws of Controversial Pasta Shapes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 06:45:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article explores the passionate, often humorous, debate over what constitutes a "good" or "bad" pasta shape, citing farfalle, penne, and wagon wheels as common offenders. Culinary experts explain that superior shapes, like rigatoni or bucatini, excel at cooking evenly and effectively holding sauce, which they argue is the primary function of pasta. The persistence of less-functional shapes is attributed to nostalgia and their frequent use in potluck dishes like pasta salad. The piece suggests that even the most maligned pasta might find redemption if used in the right culinary context, highlighting the subjective nature of taste.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesco's chief executive, Ken Murphy, has publicly warned the UK government against levying additional taxes on retailers, stating that the industry has already absorbed substantial new costs this year. Ahead of the November budget, Murphy emphasized that recent increases in National Insurance contributions and new recycling levies have placed a significant burden on the sector. His plea for no new financial hurdles came as the supermarket giant simultaneously upgraded its annual profit forecast to between £2.9 billion and £3.1 billion. This prompted criticism from the Unite union, which accused the company of profiteering during a cost-of-living crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders' recent viral moment, where he pantomimed answers to reporters without speaking, was reportedly a response to critical comments from former NFL coach Rex Ryan. According to team officials cited by ESPN, Sanders was reacting to Ryan's on-air remarks suggesting the quarterback should study more and talk less, calling his attitude an "embarrassment." The silent display occurred after the Browns benched veteran Joe Flacco in favor of fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel. The incident highlights the mounting pressure on the young quarterback as he navigates his third-string role on the team.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge has dismissed the lawsuit filed by Spencer Elden, the man who appeared as a naked baby on the cover of Nirvana's 1991 album "Nevermind." Elden had sued the band, alleging the image constituted child pornography and commercial sexual exploitation. However, the judge ruled that the photograph does not feature sexually explicit conduct and that nudity alone is insufficient to meet the legal standard for child pornography. The court noted that Elden had previously embraced his connection to the iconic album cover, and his legal team has stated they plan to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>The Colombian government has allocated a portion of Hacienda Napoles, the infamous former estate of drug lord Pablo Escobar, to women farmers who are victims of the country's long-running armed conflict. President Gustavo Petro announced that 297 acres of the lavish property, once a symbol of cartel wealth, have been given to the women as part of a broader land reform program. The estate, known for its exotic animals including a large hippo population, was seized by the state after Escobar's death in 1993 and has since operated as a popular theme park. This move aims to repurpose a site of historical notoriety for restorative justice.</p>

          <h2>Singapore Grand Prix Designated as Formula 1's First 'Heat Hazard' Race</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Formula 1's governing body, the FIA, has officially declared this weekend's Singapore Grand Prix a 'heat hazard' event due to predicted high temperatures and humidity. This is the first time the designation has been used under a new rule introduced this year to protect driver safety in extreme conditions. The ruling means teams must fit their cars with a cooling vest system, which drivers can choose to use during the race. The Singapore Grand Prix is widely considered the most physically demanding race on the F1 calendar due to its combination of heat, humidity, and the race's long duration.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's manager, Ruben Amorim, is under increasing pressure as the team's performance continues to decline, marking the worst record for any permanent manager at the club in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. Despite a string of losses that places the team closer to relegation than a title, the club has so far stood by him. Firing Amorim would be a politically difficult move for the club's new leadership under Sir Jim Ratcliffe, as his appointment was their first major decision. The article suggests that while a rebuilding period was expected, the lack of progress may force the club to reconsider its investment in the manager.</p>

The 8.5-acre garden, designed by architecture firm Rios, will be built over an underground garage and will feature two miles of walkways, over 200 species of drought-resistant native plants, and various water features. More than half of the garden will be open to the public, a key condition for the city's approval of the project's two tall condominium towers.

          <p>Japanese rookie Roki Sasaki delivered a dominant performance in the Dodgers' National League wild-card series, fueling speculation that he has secured the role of the team's closer. In a perfect ninth inning, the 23-year-old showcased a fastball consistently exceeding 100 mph and a devastating forkball, striking out two batters. His performance provided a sense of stability to a bullpen that had struggled in the previous game. While team management remains noncommittal about officially naming him the closer, his electrifying debut in a high-leverage situation has positioned him as the team's most promising late-inning option.</p>

          <p>A consortium of lenders has put forward a new rescue plan to prevent the collapse of Thames Water, the UK's largest water company. The proposal includes writing off approximately one-third of the company's nearly £20 billion debt and injecting an initial £5.4 billion to stabilize its finances and fund future investments. The investors state the plan would not require taxpayer money but hinges on adjusting the company's performance targets, which they currently deem unachievable. The plan aims to turn around the troubled utility, which has faced years of financial distress and criticism over its performance on leaks and pollution.</p>

          <p>Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev asserted that the tokenization of real-world assets like stocks and real estate is a transformative force that will eventually encompass the entire financial system. Speaking at a conference in Singapore, Tenev described the trend as an unstoppable "freight train," predicting that most major markets will establish regulatory frameworks for tokenized assets within the next five years. He cited stablecoins as an early example and believes Robinhood's offering of tokenized U.S. stocks in Europe will become a standard method for international investors to gain market exposure.

          <p>Hurricane Imelda has been downgraded to a Category 1 storm after making a direct hit on Bermuda, where it brought powerful winds and heavy rain as a Category 2 hurricane. The National Hurricane Center reported that the worst conditions had passed for the island archipelago as of early Thursday morning. The storm is now moving farther out into the Atlantic Ocean, where it is expected to continue weakening and become an extratropical cyclone. While a hurricane warning for Bermuda has been lifted, a tropical storm warning remains in effect, and swells from Imelda are causing dangerous surf conditions along the U.S. East Coast.</p>
