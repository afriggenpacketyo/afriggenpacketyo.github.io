          <p>Constellation Energy's shares experienced a 15% rally after securing a 20-year agreement with Meta to supply nuclear power. Meta will purchase 1.1 gigawatts of energy from Constellation's Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois, covering the entire output of the plant's nuclear reactor. The deal supports the plant's continued operation and relicensing, which was at risk due to expiring zero-emission credits. The plant will provide power to the regional grid, supporting Meta's objective of achieving 100% clean electricity.</p>

          <p>A contributor argues in favor of adding work requirements to Medicaid, asserting that they can increase employment and improve the lives of benefit recipients. Drawing on experience in the job training system, the author contends that work rules provide a necessary push and support network for individuals on welfare and other benefit programs. While acknowledging challenges and potential dropouts, the author emphasizes the value of employment beyond income and the availability of existing workforce networks to provide job placement services. The author asserts that the proposed rules are not cruel or punitive, and will help Americans reclaim the power of a job.</p>
