          <p>AI search startup Perplexity has reportedly made an unsolicited $34.5 billion offer to acquire Google's Chrome browser. This bid follows a U.S. Department of Justice proposal that Google divest Chrome as part of an antitrust ruling against the tech giant's search market monopoly. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine, recently launched its own browser and has secured investor backing for the ambitious deal. The move represents a significant challenge to Google's control over a key gateway to the internet.</p>

          <p>Former Las Vegas Raiders coach Jon Gruden has won a significant victory in his lawsuit against the NFL, as the Nevada Supreme Court ruled he is not required to enter arbitration overseen by Commissioner Roger Goodell. The court found that forcing Gruden, as a former employee, into the league's internal arbitration process would be "unconscionable." This decision clears the way for his lawsuit to proceed in state court, where he alleges the NFL orchestrated a campaign to destroy his career by leaking offensive emails he had sent years earlier.</p>

          <p>This article proposes that instead of chasing management fads, companies should focus on a timeless principle: employee happiness. Citing research from firms like Irrational Capital, it argues that companies scoring high on employee satisfaction metrics consistently outperform their peers in stock performance, more so than those offering high extrinsic rewards like pay. The piece identifies six key drivers of satisfaction, including valuing employee ideas, clear communication, and fostering friendships. It concludes that treating employees as humans rather than machines is the most effective path to both profitability and a better quality of life.</p>

          <p>This article examines the differences between money market accounts and high-yield savings accounts for savers in the current economic climate. While both offer higher interest rates than standard accounts, money market accounts typically provide check-writing and debit card access, sometimes in exchange for higher minimum balance requirements. Experts suggest high-yield savings accounts are often ideal for building emergency funds, while money market accounts can suit those who need occasional direct payment access from a large cash reserve. With potential Fed rate cuts looming, savers are advised to compare APYs, minimums, and accessibility features for each option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For retirees who must take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from their retirement accounts but don't need the cash, financial experts suggest several strategies. One option is to reinvest the funds in a brokerage account, preferably using tax-efficient assets like ETFs. Another popular strategy for the charitably inclined is the qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which allows a direct, tax-free transfer from an IRA to a nonprofit. For those focused on legacy planning, using the RMD to contribute to a 529 college savings plan for family members can also be a tax-advantaged move. (not investment advice)</p>
