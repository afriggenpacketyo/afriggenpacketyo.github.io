          <h2>Ford Bets on Affordable EVs Despite Trump's Rollback of Incentives</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 06:00:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to dismantle government incentives for electric vehicles, Ford is making a significant $5 billion investment in a new EV platform to produce a $30,000 pickup truck by 2027. This ambitious strategy aims to tap into a mass market for affordable EVs, countering the recent slowdown in U.S. sales driven by cost concerns and infrastructure worries. Ford's bet underscores the broader global shift towards electric vehicles, where demand for cheaper models remains high, particularly in markets like China and Europe. This development suggests that while U.S. policy may waver, the industry's commitment to an electric future, especially at lower price points, persists.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has successfully launched a classified US military X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle, an uncrewed and autonomous spaceplane, into orbit from Cape Canaveral, Florida. This eighth flight of the Boeing-built X-37B is dedicated to testing next-generation technologies, including laser communications and the highest-performing quantum inertial sensor ever tested in space. The mission aims to significantly improve the resilience, efficiency, and security of U.S. space-based communications architectures. While the exact duration of this mission remains undisclosed, these reusable space planes play a crucial role in advancing U.S. military capabilities and scientific experiments in various Earth orbits.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lauded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) as one of history's greatest companies, suggesting that investing in its stock would be "very smart." His comments came during a visit to Taiwan, where TSMC is manufacturing six new products for Nvidia, including next-generation AI chip architectures. This praise coincides with the U.S. administration's interest in acquiring equity stakes in tech companies, particularly those receiving CHIPS Act funding to boost domestic semiconductor production. The article highlights TSMC's critical role in the global tech supply chain and the strategic importance of chip manufacturing.</p>

          <p>China's electricity consumption reached a historic high of 1.02 trillion kilowatt-hours in July, an 8.6% increase year-on-year, driven by scorching heatwaves across the country. This unprecedented demand is equivalent to the annual electricity usage of all ASEAN nations combined, highlighting the immense energy needs of China's economy and population. The primary industry, encompassing agriculture and fisheries, saw the fastest growth in electricity use. This surge occurred despite a slight slowdown in industrial output, reflecting the significant impact of extreme weather on energy demand.</p>

          <p>Thailand's former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been acquitted of a royal defamation charge, a verdict that spares him a potential 15-year prison sentence. The Bangkok Criminal Court found the evidence too weak for conviction, noting the prosecution's incomplete account and potential political bias from witnesses. This acquittal marks a significant development in Thaksin's long-running legal and political struggles since his 2006 ouster, although he still faces other legal challenges. The case highlights the contentious use of Thailand's strict lese majeste law against government critics.</p>
