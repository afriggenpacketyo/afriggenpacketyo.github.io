          <p>Bill Belichick is reportedly exploring a public relations move after facing scrutiny over a recent CBS interview. Sources indicate that Belichick has been in discussions with a PR expert to boost interest in his book and program. The controversy arose from an awkward moment during the interview when Belichick's girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, intervened to shut down a question about how they met, leading to accusations of a "false narrative" created by selectively edited clips. Belichick defended Hudson and accused CBS of misrepresenting the conversation, while CBS stood by its interview, stating there were no preconditions or limitations.</p>

          <p>A psychologist identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" as a particularly damaging statement in relationships. This phrase, often used during arguments, implies that the partner is inadequate and someone else would be a better fit. It can lead to insecurity and questioning of self-worth. The article suggests that the phrase is often a symptom of deeper issues, such as a fear of openly expressing needs and frustrations, and encourages direct and honest communication to foster a healthier relationship.</p>

The humor stems from the relatability of the sketch, which acknowledges the challenges and culture-shocking events that Millennial women have experienced.
