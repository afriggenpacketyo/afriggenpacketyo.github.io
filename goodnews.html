          <p>This opinion article posits that Beijing's decennial parade transcends mere spectacle, holding profound significance for Hong Kong and Macau when examined through the perspectives of national destiny and institutional resilience. It argues that the event is a powerful declaration of deep national cohesion among the Chinese people, fostering an emotional release and resonance with the nation’s trajectory, rather than a shallow patriotic show. The author suggests that a Western-centric viewpoint often overlooks this deeper cultural and political importance, emphasizing the parade's role in unifying individuals and showcasing collective strength in a fragmented world.</p>

          <p>Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel returned to "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after a week-long suspension by ABC, which followed comments he made criticizing President Donald Trump's MAGA movement in connection with conservative activist Charlie Kirk's killing. The show's comeback sparked considerable public interest, drawing both protesters and supporters to the Hollywood studio where it is taped. Kimmel's pre-taped monologue was highly anticipated as his initial public statement on the controversy. While some protesters called for a more extended suspension, supporters championed the importance of free speech, underscoring the divided public sentiment surrounding the incident.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced a significant shift in his position on the war in Ukraine, stating that Kyiv can "win all of Ukraine back in its original form" with support from Europe and NATO, citing Russia's economic troubles. This statement, made after talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and shared on Truth Social, marks a departure from his previous warnings that Ukraine might need to cede territory. Zelenskyy welcomed the "big shift" as a positive signal, indicating a potential for more weapons and air defenses. Trump also suggested NATO nations should shoot down Russian planes breaching their airspace.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service successfully disrupted a vast telecommunications network in the New York Tri-State Area, which posed a serious threat to NYC's telecom systems and the ongoing United Nations General Assembly meetings. Investigators seized 300 SIM servers containing over 100,000 SIM cards from abandoned buildings, capable of sending 30 million texts per minute and potentially disabling cell phone towers. This "well organized and well funded" network, linked to foreign governments, organized crime, drug cartels, and human trafficking, was discovered following telephonic threats to senior U.S. officials. While no arrests have been made, the dismantled network no longer poses a threat.</p>

          <p>This article explores how China's successive five-year plans have profoundly shaped its economic trajectory over more than seven decades, remaining a cornerstone of macroeconomic policymaking despite the country's move away from a command economy. These 14 plans have been instrumental in transforming China's limited industrial capacity into the "world's factory" and are now guiding its ambition to become a global innovation hub in cutting-edge sectors. The upcoming 15th five-year plan is anticipated to further this strategic direction, with past iterations offering a comprehensive historical overview of China's complex economic development and industrialization journey since 1953.</p>

          <p>Veteran pop star Lulu, 76, has publicly revealed her long-hidden struggle with alcoholism in her new memoir, "If You Only Knew," describing it as a liberating experience. Now nearly 12 years sober, she sought help in 2013 after confessing to her family at her 65th birthday party, subsequently checking into rehab and committing to Alcoholics Anonymous. Lulu, who was a "highly functioning alcoholic" even during her time on Strictly Come Dancing, kept her problem secret for years, fearing damage to her "squeaky clean" image. She attributes her resilience to breaking a family pattern of addiction.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's Tyrique George, who was nearly transferred to Fulham, has seized a first-team lifeline by delivering a starring performance in the Carabao Cup, scoring and assisting to secure a comeback victory against Lincoln City. Playing out of his usual wing position as a lone striker, the 19-year-old academy graduate proved his value, despite the club strengthening its attacking options. His display offers a welcome solution for manager Enzo Maresca in a problematic position, contrasting with the typical Chelsea academy pathway of breakthrough, loan, and then often sale. George's dedication from a young age, including extra training, has been key to his progress.</p>

          <p>Jerome Cohen, a pioneering and highly respected scholar of Chinese law, has died at the age of 95. As a professor emeritus at NYU School of Law and founder of its US-Asia Law Institute, Cohen profoundly influenced global discussions on China's legal system, trade, and human rights for over six decades. He was the first American to practice law in Communist China and was renowned for his groundbreaking writings on Chinese criminal procedure and international law. Cohen built a reputation as both an advocate for Chinese dissidents and a proponent of continued engagement with Beijing, leaving a towering impact on the field.</p>

          <p>California is moving to address the long-standing annoyance of excessively loud TV commercials, with a new bill, Senate Bill 576, awaiting the governor's signature. Inspired by a new mother whose baby was disturbed by blaring streaming ads, the legislation aims to prohibit streaming services like Hulu and Netflix from playing commercials louder than their programming. While the federal CALM Act already regulates broadcast and cable TV ads, it doesn't cover streaming. The streaming industry initially opposed the bill due to control issues but became neutral after an amendment removed the right for private parties to sue, relying instead on regulatory enforcement.</p>

          <p>As China drafts its 15th five-year plan, this article examines how the upcoming blueprint might address the urgent financial woes of local governments, which are seeking new revenue streams. The issue is highlighted by recent aggressive tax clampdowns, where wealthy individuals have been forced to pay millions in back taxes on undeclared overseas income, signaling a stricter enforcement of existing laws. The article explores how these expansive blueprints reflect high-level policy priorities and could integrate ecological goals, but primarily focuses on the critical need for sustainable financial solutions for local authorities within the framework of national development.</p>

          <p>China has officially endorsed Brazil’s $125 billion Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF), a significant fund designed to reward nations for preserving tropical forests. This backing adds momentum to one of the main initiatives slated for COP30 in Belem. The TFFF, developed with World Bank support, will invest in low-risk assets and channel returns to tropical countries based on hectares of standing forest, with payments contingent on keeping deforestation below 0.5 percent annually. Brazil's President Lula da Silva announced a $1 billion initial contribution, emphasizing it as an investment in humanity and the planet, with a fifth of resources dedicated to Indigenous peoples.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats, led by Sir Ed Davey, have adopted a more aggressive political stance, particularly targeting Reform UK and its leader Nigel Farage, whom they are using as a "funding and recruiting sergeant." Davey's punchy speech at the party conference contained numerous references to Farage, far more than to the Prime Minister, aiming to motivate activists and extend their appeal to disillusioned Conservative voters. Despite accusations of scaremongering regarding gun laws, the Lib Dems are buoyed by internal polling suggesting a growing openness to their party, positioning themselves as a clear alternative in an increasingly competitive and fluid political landscape.</p>

          <p>Tether, the issuer of the largest stablecoin, is reportedly planning a capital raise of $15 billion to $20 billion through a private placement, which could value the crypto company at an impressive $500 billion. This valuation would place Tether among the world's largest private companies, rivaling giants like OpenAI and SpaceX. The transaction, involving new equity, is still in early stages, but reflects Tether's strategic efforts to re-enter the U.S. market. This push is influenced by President Donald Trump's pro-crypto stance, with Tether recently appointing a U.S. CEO and launching a new U.S.-regulated token, USAT, under the GENIUS Act.
