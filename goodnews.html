        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article posits that former President Trump employs a consistent three-pronged strategy for deal-making, evident in both domestic and international negotiations. The author highlights a recent deal with Pfizer to lower drug costs and a 21-point peace plan for the Gaza conflict as key examples. The strategy involves ignoring conventional wisdom, aligning the interests of opposing sides with U.S. interests, and tenaciously pursuing goals while remaining flexible. This approach, the article argues, has allowed Trump to achieve breakthroughs on issues where previous administrations and political opponents have failed, such as curbing pharmaceutical prices and advancing Middle East peace talks.</p>

          <p>Certified financial planners recommend that the final quarter of the year is an opportune time for individuals to review their finances and prepare for the upcoming year. With actual income and spending data available, it's an ideal moment for impactful tax planning, especially considering recent tax law changes like the temporary increase in the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap. Experts also stress the importance of creating a holiday budget to avoid starting the new year with financial stress, as a significant percentage of Americans incurred holiday-related debt last year. Proactive financial assessment now can help set a stable course for the year ahead.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece celebrates a recent ruling by U.S. District Judge William Young, who condemned the Trump administration for violating the free speech rights of non-citizen residents. The judge's decision in a case involving the detention of pro-Palestinian foreign scholars asserted that the First Amendment protects all people within U.S. borders, not just citizens. The author praises Judge Young for going beyond typical legal language to personally rebuke the president for ignoring the Constitution and bullying dissenters. The article argues that this judicial stance is a crucial defense of American values, framing the threat to immigrants' rights as a threat to the constitutional principles that protect everyone.</p>

          <p>Ahti Heinla, a co-founder of Skype, is now leading Starship Technologies, a company deploying autonomous delivery robots for food and groceries. Heinla claims the venture is already operating at a small profit, offering deliveries at a lower cost than human drivers, even in less dense areas like small towns. The six-wheeled robots are currently active in several UK cities, Finland, and Estonia, having completed over 8 million deliveries. While facing competition from other robotics and drone delivery companies, Starship's primary hurdle is inconsistent regulation, which has slowed its expansion in the UK compared to Finland. Heinla believes robotic delivery will soon become an essential, non-negotiable part of the retail landscape.</p>

          <h2>Fashion Industry Leverages Artificial Intelligence to Forecast Upcoming Trends</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The fashion industry is increasingly turning to artificial intelligence to navigate the fast-paced world of trends, which are now largely driven by social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram. AI algorithms analyze vast amounts of data from runways, social media, and consumer behavior to detect emerging styles months before they become mainstream. Companies like Heuritech use this technology to advise major brands such as Prada and New Balance on future trends, successfully predicting the rise of specific colors and styles. However, industry experts emphasize that human expertise remains essential to interpret the AI-generated data, distinguishing between fleeting online entertainment and genuine commercial viability.</p>

          <h2>Expert Advice on Managing and Canceling Multiple Credit Cards Without Damaging Your Credit Score</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals holding a large number of credit cards, canceling some can be a sensible financial move despite the potential for a small, temporary dip in their credit score. Financial experts advise that closing cards may be justified if you are struggling with payments, paying high annual fees on unused cards, or dealing with steep interest rates. To minimize the impact on your credit score, it is recommended to first cancel newer cards or those with low credit limits, while keeping the oldest accounts open to preserve your credit history length. Strategically closing cards over time, rather than all at once, can help manage credit utilization and allow your score to recover more smoothly.</p>

          <h2>Bitcoin Price Nears All-Time High Amid US Government Shutdown</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 06:46:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's value surged, trading up approximately 2% to nearly $124,000, bringing it within 1% of its all-time high. The rally is attributed to investors seeking a safe-haven asset as the U.S. government shutdown continues into its third day, with the cryptocurrency gaining 12% in the past week alone. Analysts note that unlike previous shutdowns, Bitcoin is now being treated as a hedge against U.S. government risks, similar to its relationship with the U.S. treasury term premium. Financial institutions like Standard Chartered are predicting that Bitcoin will soon set a new record high, potentially reaching $135,000. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi, a 64-year-old conservative, as its new leader, making her the likely first female prime minister in the country's history. Takaichi, a protege of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, is known for her hard-line conservative views and hawkish stance on China. Her election comes as the LDP seeks to regain public trust after significant election losses that have weakened its control in parliament. As prime minister, she will face immediate challenges, including navigating diplomatic relations with Asian neighbors and a potential summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, who may press for increased defense spending.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientific analysis of the first-ever rock samples returned from the far side of the moon indicates that this hemisphere may be colder than the near side. A collaborative team of Chinese and British scientists studied the samples from China's Chang'e-6 mission and found a significant thermal asymmetry. The minerals from the far side appear to have formed in lava that was approximately 100 degrees Celsius cooler than the lava on the near side. This discovery, published in Nature Geoscience, provides crucial new data for understanding the moon's formation and the long-observed geological differences between its two hemispheres, which had previously been studied without the benefit of physical samples from the far side.</p>

          <p>This opinion column refutes conservative criticism of the NFL's choice of Bad Bunny for the Super Bowl halftime show, labeling the backlash as un-American and geographically ignorant. The author points out that as a Puerto Rican, Bad Bunny is a U.S. citizen, and his Spanish-language music has achieved massive mainstream success on American charts. The piece highlights the NFL's long history of featuring non-American acts like The Rolling Stones and U2, making the focus on Bad Bunny's heritage and language appear discriminatory. The author argues that such reactions are counterproductive and reflect a fear of cultural diversity, rather than any legitimate concern about patriotism or inclusivity.</p>

          <p>A new film, "The Smashing Machine," starring Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, is set to portray the turbulent life of pioneering MMA fighter Mark Kerr. The project, directed by Benny Safdie, is based on a 2002 documentary of the same name that captured Kerr's rise to the top of the sport in the late 1990s and his subsequent fall due to a severe addiction to opioids. After years of struggling with alcoholism and personal turmoil following the end of his fighting career, a now-sober Kerr has been closely involved with the film's production. Johnson's portrayal of the vulnerable yet formidable fighter has already garnered critical acclaim, offering Kerr a second chance at public recognition.</p>
