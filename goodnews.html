          <h2>Analysts Examine China's Military Anti-Corruption Campaign</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that China's ongoing anti-corruption crackdown within the People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA) should not be interpreted as a sign of President Xi Jinping's weakened control over the military. The campaign has targeted high-ranking officials, including members of the Central Military Commission (CMC), for corruption. Experts believe that the impact on the military's war readiness and modernization is limited, and internal competition among Xi's supporters may be a contributing factor to these investigations. The campaign underscores Xi's commitment to rooting out corruption and maintaining discipline within the PLA.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence received the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for upholding the constitutional transfer of power after the 2020 election. In his acceptance speech, Pence emphasized the importance of the Constitution as a unifying force for Americans. He referenced disagreements with both Democrats and his own Republican Party on issues like spending, tariffs, and support for Ukraine. Pence's remarks came shortly after an interview aired where Donald Trump expressed uncertainty about whether all individuals in the U.S. are entitled to due process, highlighting the divide between the two.</p>

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has closed its last in-house beagle laboratory following reports of alleged animal abuse and pressure from government officials. The White Coat Waste (WCW) project detailed the lab's history of reportedly conducting deadly experiments on thousands of beagles. PETA praised the closure, highlighting the importance of modernizing science and ending animal testing. The NIH director stated that PETA sent him flowers following the closure, a departure from the physical threats NIH directors typically receive. The move aligns with a broader trend of phasing out animal testing in favor of alternative methods.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump addressed judicial nominations, stating that the administration is rapidly appointing judges who will not demand trials for every illegal immigrant. He argued that the administration's sweeping deportations are being delayed by "radicalized" judges, and emphasized that overhauling U.S. immigration policies was his top campaign issue. Trump claimed that having trials for every illegal immigrant would be impractical and that the Supreme Court would not allow it. These comments underscore the administration's continued focus on immigration enforcement and judicial appointments.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris criticized Max Verstappen's racing strategy at the Miami Grand Prix, suggesting it was not very smart. McLaren team principal Andrea Stella noted that Norris could have been more patient in corner one-two to secure second position, given the car's speed. Norris was further delayed because he passed Verstappen off track at Turn 11 and had to cede the position. Stella saw no significant difference between Norris's and Piastri's approaches to racing Verstappen. Ultimately, Norris closed on Piastri but ran out of time to overtake him.</p>

          <p>Australian stocks fell following Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's re-election, marking his second consecutive term in 21 years. This comes amid uncertainties in the global macroeconomic outlook. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 declined 0.47%, reversing gains from the previous session. The Australian dollar, however, appreciated against the greenback. Meanwhile, most Asian markets were closed for public holidays. Oil prices also experienced a plunge after OPEC+ agreed to increase production for a second month, further impacting market dynamics.</p>

          <p>President Trump's policies are influencing domestic political battles around the world, though not always to his benefit. In recent elections in Canada and Australia, center-left parties triumphed over conservative parties that had adopted Trumpian tactics. Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney campaigned on an explicitly anti-Trump message, while Australia's Anthony Albanese did not, but both benefited from an anti-Trump sentiment.

          <p>More and more American women are freezing their eggs to preserve their fertility, leading to a surge in the number of procedures. The process, once primarily for medical reasons, has become an accepted practice for women who want to delay motherhood. The process involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and storage in liquid nitrogen. While egg freezing offers women more control over their reproductive timelines, it is expensive and not guaranteed to result in a successful pregnancy. The article explores the trend, costs, benefits, and ethical considerations of egg freezing.</p>

          <p>More than half of first-time buyers received financial help from their family to make house purchases last year, according to estimates by estate agency Savills. An average of ¬£55,572 was given in loans and gifts by the so-called bank of mum and dad to buyers. Young buyers faced relatively high mortgage rates in 2024, while also seeing the cost of renting increase. Family assistance peaked in 2009 during the fallout from the financial crisis, when 70% of first-time buyers received help, the estate agency's figures suggest.</p>
