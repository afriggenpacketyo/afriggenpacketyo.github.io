          <p>A major exhibition in Trier, Germany, explores the enduring relevance of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius and his Stoic philosophy, particularly his book "Meditations." The exhibition delves into themes of good governance, wisdom, justice, prudence, and moderation, highlighting their importance in times of crisis and polarization. Marcus Aurelius, who ruled during a period of war and plague, emphasized equanimity and acting for the common good, offering insights that continue to resonate today. The exhibition aims to inspire reflection on leadership, society, and the timeless wisdom of the philosopher-king, though the article notes that Marcus Aurelius's views were limited by the social structures of his time.</p>
