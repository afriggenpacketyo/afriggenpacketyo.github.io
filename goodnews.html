          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams addressed the federal corruption case against him, explaining his use of seven different phone numbers as necessary for separating official, personal, and campaign communications, which he states is common practice among New Yorkers. Adams also claimed that the FBI's tactics, including seizing his devices at the 2023 New York City Marathon finish line, were intended to humiliate him, and that his dyslexia prevented him from remembering his primary phone's password. Documents from the case revealed the FBI tracked Adams' location using cellphone data, leading them to seek permission to use a "cell site simulator" to identify other devices he might be using. The charges against Adams were eventually dismissed after the Trump administration intervened.</p>

          <p>The head of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and several teams within the agency have been reinstated after facing layoff notices, reversing previous cuts to worker safety programs. This reversal comes ahead of congressional hearings with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., where he was expected to face questions about the layoffs. The reinstatements include staff in NIOSH's respiratory health division, division of safety research, division of compensation and analysis support, and the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory. The move will allow NIOSH to resume critical functions such as approving N95 respirators and conducting workplace health risk investigations, though many workers at other CDC divisions remain laid off.</p>

          <p>Iran has proposed a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington's demand that it dismantle its nuclear program, according to Iranian officials. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to American special envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman, suggesting a consortium where Iran would enrich uranium to a low grade for civilian use in other Arab countries. This plan aims for permanence, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, and would involve on-the-ground oversight from representatives of participating countries, including possibly the United States. President Trump has expressed a desire for a deal with Iran to enhance regional safety, but warned that time is limited for Iranian leaders to decide.</p>

At least 300 hospitals in China have started using DeepSeek's large language models (LLMs) for clinical diagnostics and medical decision support. The researchers warned that DeepSeek's tendency to generate "plausible but factually incorrect outputs" could lead to "substantial clinical risk," despite its strong reasoning capabilities.

Her work has contributed to Brazil becoming an agricultural superpower, and microbial treatments are now widely used on major crops like soybeans and corn in Brazil.

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.3% in April on an annual basis, reflecting price hikes that remain above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The CPI reading for April was the lowest level since February 2021, with housing costs being a major driver of inflation. Economists are watching for signs that President Trump's tariffs are impacting American households, though the impact may not be evident in economic data for a few months. The Federal Reserve is taking a wait-and-see approach on Mr. Trump's tariffs, which he said could boost inflation and blunt economic growth. Because of the tentative trade agreement between China and the U.S., inflation may not rise as much as earlier anticipated.</p>

          <p>Jose "Pepe" Mujica, a former guerrilla fighter who became Uruguay's president, has died at the age of 89. Known as the "World's Poorest President" for his humble lifestyle, Mujica was beloved for his modesty and progressive social reforms. He legalized gay marriage and abortion, and his socioeconomic policies led to decreased unemployment, poverty, and infant mortality. Even in the highest office of the state, Mujica remained true to himself, often appearing at Cabinet meetings wearing a cardigan, sandals and an old pair of trousers. Because of his modest style, Mujica was generally deemed to be above suspicion of corruption.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has reversed the firings of more than 100 federal employees with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), following public pressure and legal challenges. This reversal comes after public pressure from Capito, and follows a series of ABC News reports detailing the impact the firings would have on black lung health care programs for coal miners. The announcement came just hours before a federal judge ordered HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to temporarily halt its dismissal of NIOSH officials who oversee the black lung surveillance program.</p>
