          <p>A historically significant letter that marked the beginning of Margaret Thatcher's ascent to power has been discovered in a garage in Somerset, UK. The 50-year-old document is a nomination paper, signed by Thatcher on January 27, 1975, in which she consented to run for the leadership of the Conservative Party. This artifact, once belonging to Conservative MP Sir Edward du Cann, is part of a collection of political papers from that era. The find is considered a sensational and unprecedented discovery, offering a tangible piece of the moment that launched her political career.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In Austin, Texas, Christophe Waggoner is helping families manage the rising cost of Halloween by creating and donating costumes made from thrifted items. With the average price of a single costume increasing by 11% this year, many families are struggling to afford the expense. Waggoner spends thousands of his own money annually to collect, redesign, and store the costumes, which he then gives away for free at community events. His initiative not only provides children with the joy of dressing up but also inspires a cycle of giving, as many families return to donate their old costumes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid recent market volatility, an Invesco senior portfolio manager suggests that income funds utilizing options-based strategies can offer investors better structural protection. These funds are not reliant on traditional stock correlations and can provide downside protection and income that is less sensitive to interest rate changes. The article notes that while demand for these strategies is growing, investors should be cautious and select ETFs managed by experienced professionals to avoid unsustainable yields and high fees. This approach is presented as a way to add a diversifying source of income without relying on Federal Reserve policy. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to common stereotypes, a recent study from the Kinsey Institute reveals that men are more likely than women to want to accelerate relationship milestones like moving in together or getting married. The research indicates that financial savings are a primary motivator for men, though experts also point to social and emotional factors. Psychologists suggest that for many heterosexual men, romantic relationships serve as their main source of emotional support, a need less acutely felt by women who often maintain stronger support networks through friendships and family. This dynamic can lead to men feeling a greater urgency to commit.</p>

          <p>A minor ground collision occurred at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport when a United Airlines aircraft clipped the tail of another stationary United plane. The incident involved a flight arriving from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, as it was heading toward its gate. Fortunately, no injuries were reported among the 113 passengers or crew on board, and all were able to deplane normally after a delay. This event adds to recent concerns about aviation safety following several other runway incidents and near misses at U.S. airports. The circumstances of the collision are currently under investigation by authorities.</p>

          <p>Efforts are underway to repair the damaged external power supply to Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to the UN's nuclear watchdog. For the past four weeks, Europe's largest nuclear station has relied on backup diesel generators, a situation that poses significant safety risks. The International Atomic Energy Agency stated that both Russian and Ukrainian forces have cooperated to establish ceasefire zones, allowing specialists to conduct the complex repairs. Restoring a stable off-site power connection is considered crucial for cooling the plant's shutdown reactors and preventing a potential nuclear incident.</p>
