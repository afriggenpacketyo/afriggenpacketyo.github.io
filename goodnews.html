          <p>President Trump announced a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia, which he claims includes a 19% tariff on Indonesian imports and significant Indonesian purchases of US goods. The deal would grant American firms greater access to Indonesian markets, with Trump stating the U.S. would pay no tariffs. While Indonesia's president confirmed a positive discussion took place, he did not confirm the specific terms of the agreement. This move is part of a broader strategy where the administration has been negotiating new trade terms with multiple countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Semiconductor equipment giant ASML announced second-quarter earnings that beat expectations, but issued cautious guidance for the future. The company narrowed its 2025 sales growth forecast to 15% and stated it could not confirm growth for 2026, citing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, including U.S. tariff policies. ASML, a critical supplier for advanced chip manufacturing, has benefited from high demand for AI-related technology. The company's third-quarter revenue forecast, however, fell short of market expectations, reflecting ongoing industry challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The MLB All-Star Game was decided by a home run swing-off for the first time, with the National League securing a 7-6 victory over the American League. Dodgers' third base coach Dino Ebel became an unlikely hero, pitching to the NL hitters during the tiebreaker. Philadelphia's Kyle Schwarber hit three home runs off Ebel's pitches to clinch the win and earn the MVP award. The novel tie-breaking procedure, likened to a penalty shootout, provided an exciting conclusion to the game, with Ebel's consistent batting practice pitches being crucial for the win.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced the end of the deployment for 2,000 National Guard troops in Los Angeles, which is about half the force sent to the city. The troops were federalized by President Trump to address protests against the administration's immigration policies, a move legally challenged by California Governor Gavin Newsom. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass celebrated the withdrawal, attributing it to unified local opposition and peaceful protests. Governor Newsom criticized the deployment as political theater and called for the remaining troops to be sent home immediately.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts predict that China's imports of naphtha, a key petrochemical feedstock, will surge to record levels this year. The increased demand is driven by the opening of new petrochemical plants and a strategic shift away from U.S. propane and ethane due to trade war-related supply uncertainties. Consultancies forecast that imports could reach up to 17 million metric tons, a significant increase from 2024. This robust demand from China is expected to provide support for Asian refiners' profit margins for the feedstock throughout the year. (not investment advice)</p>
