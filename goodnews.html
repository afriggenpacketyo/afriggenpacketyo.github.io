          <p>Several Chinese ambassadors from West African nations have recently concluded their tenures, prompting speculation about the reasons behind their departures. While some analysts suggest these are routine rotations for diplomats, others believe it could be a subtle message to Sahelian regimes amid rising tensions over resource nationalism and security concerns. The departures include ambassadors from Senegal, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. The timing of these departures raises questions about China's diplomatic strategy in the region, particularly in light of increasing competition for resources and influence. The situation warrants close observation to determine the long-term implications for China's relations with West African nations. </p>

          <p>Hong Kong faces the risk of developing two distinct economies, with its financial, professional, and business services thriving due to China's resurgent economy. Meanwhile, other sectors such as food and retail are struggling to keep pace. Capital is flowing to Asia for better returns as credit rating downgrades and slower growth impact the U.S. dollar. Hong Kong's stock market benefits from its position as a platform for Chinese tech companies. State policies and local government actions are aimed at bolstering Hong Kong's position as a global financial hub. (not investment advice)</p>

They discovered that Jessi had taken flowers Fagan placed at the graves during the trial of Jessi's stepbrother, Jeff Pelley, who was convicted of the murders.

          <p>Texas will require all public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments under a new law signed by Governor Greg Abbott. The law is expected to face legal challenges from critics who argue it violates the separation of church and state. A similar law in Louisiana was blocked by a federal appeals court, while Arkansas has a similar law facing a federal court challenge. The Texas measure requires schools to post a 16-by-20-inch poster or framed copy of a specific English version of the commandments. Abbott also signed a bill allowing schools to provide students and staff with a daily voluntary period of prayer or religious reading. </p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and activist, has returned to New Jersey after a federal judge ordered his release from ICE detention. Khalil, a green card holder, was in ICE custody for over 100 days due to his role in campus protests against Israel. Judge Michael Fabiarz ruled that Khalil is not a threat or flight risk, calling his detention "highly unusual." Khalil accused the Trump administration of trying to dehumanize him and immigrants, while Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez criticized his detainment as a violation of his First Amendment rights. Khalil vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights. </p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from making drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). Judge Indira Talwani struck down a policy change that would have capped indirect costs for universities at 15% of direct research costs. The universities argued the move threatened critical work in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and other technology fields. Talwani deemed the change arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. The University of California estimated the change would cost it just under $100 million a year. </p>

Two flights departed from Tel Aviv to Athens with approximately 70 U.S. citizens, their families, and lawful permanent residents. The evacuations began hours before President Trump announced U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The U.S. State Department has also placed Israel under a Level 4 travel advisory, urging Americans not to travel there due to armed conflict, terrorism, and civil unrest. The announcement follows days of confusion regarding U.S. government assistance for American citizens evacuating from Israel. </p>
