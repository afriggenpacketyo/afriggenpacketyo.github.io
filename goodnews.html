          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 23:00:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men‚Äôs participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining global birth rates, addressing China‚Äôs demographic challenges. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, argues that subsidies for fathers produce higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. This innovative policy proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population and a shrinking workforce. The study also found that traditional expectations place the burden on women to perform most childcare duties, clashing with rapid economic changes. The optimism score is moderate due to the potential for positive demographic changes.</p>
