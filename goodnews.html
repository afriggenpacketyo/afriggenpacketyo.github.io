He shared the news on social media following the conclusion of his two-year world tour, explaining his desire for transparency about his health struggles. Timberlake noted that the joy of performing outweighed the physical challenges, and he hopes sharing his story will prevent misinterpretations of his condition. The 44-year-old artist did not disclose further details about his treatment but expressed gratitude for being able to complete the tour despite the debilitating symptoms.</p>

          <p>Investors are anticipating Amazon's second-quarter earnings report, with a key focus on the impact of U.S. tariff policies and the company's investments in artificial intelligence. While Amazon previously warned that trade policies could affect results, some analysts believe the tariffs may have inadvertently benefited the company by weakening competition from Chinese e-commerce sites. Another major point of interest is the growth of Amazon Web Services (AWS), particularly how the company's substantial AI spending is translating into revenue. The report's guidance will provide insight into whether Amazon expects these economic and technological trends to continue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of the design software company Figma more than tripled in value during their initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, signaling a potential resurgence in the tech IPO market. The company, which makes web-based collaborative design tools, priced its shares at $33 before the stock opened at $85, achieving a valuation of approximately $50 billion. The successful debut follows a period of dormancy for tech IPOs and comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was abandoned due to regulatory opposition. The offering raised $1.2 billion for the company and its early investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Brazilian government has reached a compromise regarding tariff hikes on electric vehicles, granting Chinese automaker BYD a temporary reprieve. BYD will be allowed to import a set value of semi-assembled vehicles tariff-free for six months in early 2026 as it establishes its new manufacturing plant in the country. However, Brazil also accelerated its long-term plan, with import tariffs on EV kits set to rise to 35% earlier than originally scheduled. The decision balances BYD's request for relief against pressure from domestic automakers who warned that a full exemption would threaten local jobs.</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of stick insect in a rainforest in Far North Queensland, Australia, which is thought to be the heaviest insect ever found on the continent. The insect, named Acrophylla alta, measures 40 centimeters long and weighs 44 grams, comparable to a golf ball. It was discovered high in the canopies of the mountainous Wet Tropics region, a remote habitat that likely contributed to it remaining undiscovered for so long. Researchers believe its large body mass is an adaptation that helps it survive in colder, high-altitude conditions.</p>

          <h2>Evaluating the Pros and Cons of Rolling a 401(k) into an Annuity in the Current Economy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 13:36:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With ongoing economic uncertainty, many pre-retirees are considering whether to roll over their 401(k) savings into an annuity to secure a guaranteed income stream. While high interest rates have made annuity payouts more attractive, this move involves trade-offs, such as reduced liquidity and potentially high fees, that may not suit everyone's financial goals. The article advises that the decision should be based on individual factors like risk tolerance, proximity to retirement, and the need for predictable income versus investment growth potential. A partial rollover is suggested as a possible compromise to balance security with flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Defense has reversed an earlier decision and will continue to share crucial satellite weather data that forecasters rely on, particularly for tracking hurricanes. The Navy had planned to end the data sharing as part of a modernization effort, but it changed course after receiving feedback from government partners and scientists who feared the loss of data would lead to less accurate storm forecasts. The information, which helps in monitoring storms as they form and tracking sea ice, will now remain available until the program formally ends in 2026 or the satellite sensor fails.</p>

          <p>The San Diego Padres have made a significant move to bolster their pitching staff by acquiring All-Star closer Mason Miller and left-handed pitcher JP Sears from the Oakland Athletics. Miller, known for a fastball that averages 101 mph, has 20 saves this season and is under team control through 2029, making him a valuable long-term asset. In exchange, the Padres sent a package of four prospects to the A's, including highly-touted shortstop Leo De Vries. The trade is a major blockbuster ahead of the deadline as the Padres, who currently hold a wildcard spot, push for a playoff run.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced the withdrawal of approximately 1,350 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, significantly rolling back a controversial deployment ordered by President Trump. The troops were sent in June to protect federal agents during public unrest related to immigration raids, a move California's Democratic leaders condemned as an illegal and unnecessary militarization. Governor Gavin Newsom's office stated that the president's "political theater backfired," as the troops had little to do once protests subsided.

The study found Mounjaro was not only as effective as Trulicity in reducing risks like heart attack and stroke but also showed a 16% lower rate of death from any cause. The company believes these comprehensive results strengthen the case for Mounjaro to be the first-choice treatment for patients with Type 2 diabetes. The data could bolster Mounjaro's market position, especially as Trulicity's patent is set to expire in 2027.</p>

He observes that in moments of crisis, patients often turn to spirituality, sometimes with anger and sometimes with strengthened faith.
