          <p>A writer shares her complex journey of recovering from anorexia, only to be diagnosed years later with very high cholesterol, forcing her to diet for medical reasons. She reflects on how her recovery involved a performative rejection of all dietary restrictions, which ultimately led to a different kind of unhealthy eating. The diagnosis forced her to confront society's contradictory health messages, which often conflate weight with health and can be triggering for those with a history of eating disorders. Her experience highlights the difficulty of navigating physical health needs while protecting mental well-being and challenging a culture that is still fixated on calories and weight.</p>

          <p>Thirty years ago, Mike Tyson's return to boxing after a three-year prison sentence set a new precedent for pay-per-view spectacles. His fight against Peter McNeeley in Las Vegas was a highly anticipated event that, despite lasting only 89 seconds, shattered television revenue records, earning $96 million. The bout, promoted as "He's Back," drew a massive celebrity crowd and demonstrated that spectacle could be more profitable than a competitive contest. This event arguably paved the way for the modern era of celebrity boxing and influencer fights, proving that a compelling narrative and a larger-than-life personality could be the biggest draw in the sport.</p>

          <p>In a significant development, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has agreed to participate in a trilateral meeting with President Trump and Vladimir Putin, even without a prior ceasefire. This marks a shift from his previous stance and aligns with a position President Trump adopted after recent talks with the Russian leader. Despite ongoing Russian attacks on Ukraine, Zelenskyy stated he is "ready for trilateral" talks to find a diplomatic end to the war. The move has surprised observers, as both Ukraine and its European partners had previously insisted that a halt in hostilities was a necessary first step for any meaningful negotiations.</p>

          <h2>Social Media Algorithms Are Rapidly Reshaping Modern Language</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The algorithms that power social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram are transforming language at an unprecedented speed, according to author Adam Aleksic. In his book "Algospeak," he explains how engagement metrics and viral memes create and popularize a new lexicon, often replicated by millions of users globally. This phenomenon, where words and phrases can gain widespread use without a traditional basis, demonstrates how technology is rewiring communication patterns. The rapid evolution of online language reflects a new dynamic where algorithms, rather than organic cultural shifts, are a primary driver of linguistic change.</p>

          <p>A landmark 113-year-old wooden church in the Swedish city of Kiruna is being moved in its entirety to a new location 5 kilometers away. The massive 672-tonne structure was hoisted onto rolling platforms for the two-day journey, a necessary measure to save it from ground subsidence caused by over a century of iron ore mining. This relocation is the most symbolic part of a larger project to move the city's center to safer ground. The complex engineering feat, which involves moving the church with its valuable interior art intact, represents a deeply emotional and historic moment for the local community in the Arctic Circle.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a plan to convert grants from the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act into a 10% equity stake in semiconductor manufacturer Intel. This move would make the U.S. government the company's largest shareholder, representing a significant intervention aimed at revitalizing a key player in the American tech industry. The potential deal, worth approximately $10.4 billion at current market values, is part of a broader effort to bolster domestic chip production and national security. While discussions are ongoing and the plan is not finalized, it reflects the administration's strategy of creating government-backed national champions in strategic sectors.

          <p>The private members' club chain Soho House is being taken private in a $2.7 billion (£2 billion) acquisition by a consortium led by US hotel group MCR Hotels. Actor and investor Ashton Kutcher is part of the deal and will join the company's board. Soho House, known as a popular venue for celebrities, has struggled financially since its public listing in 2021, with its share value declining amid concerns that its rapid expansion diluted its exclusive brand. The move to private ownership is intended to put the company on more stable footing for long-term growth, away from the pressures of quarterly public reporting.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled images of a prototype tilt-rotor aircraft, which appears to be the country's first crewed aircraft of this type. The design combines the vertical take-off and landing capabilities of a helicopter with the speed and range of a fixed-wing plane, similar to the US V-22 Osprey. Photos show the aircraft hovering in helicopter mode and other incomplete airframes in a hangar, suggesting the project is in an advanced stage. While this technology offers significant versatility, it is also known for its mechanical complexity, high costs, and historical safety concerns, presenting major engineering challenges for its developers.</p>

Both sides indicated that ties are on a "positive trend" as they discuss issues ranging from trade to resolving their long-standing boundary dispute. This diplomatic effort is seen as a significant step toward normalizing relations and is expected to set the stage for a potential visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to China.</p>

By combining detailed prisoner records, historical sketches, and in some cases photos of modern descendants, the project brings the stories of these individuals to life. The research traced 60 convicts from Anglesey, who were transported for crimes ranging from theft to trampling turnips. This innovative use of AI offers a new way to connect with a significant period of Welsh and Australian history, where an estimated 1,000 Welsh people were among the 162,000 convicts sent to the continent.</p>

          <p>A travel trend known as "coolcations" is gaining momentum as tourists increasingly opt for destinations with more temperate climates, avoiding the extreme heat and wildfires affecting traditional Southern European hotspots. Concerns over record-breaking temperatures are causing travelers to choose cooler locations like Iceland, Norway, and Slovenia, or to shift their vacations to the spring and autumn shoulder seasons. This behavioral shift, driven by climate change, is also prompting tourists to seek less crowded, off-the-beaten-path destinations. While this may alleviate overtourism in some areas, it poses potential economic challenges for countries heavily reliant on peak summer tourism.</p>

By wearing a suit and expressing gratitude, Zelenskyy successfully navigated the high-stakes discussions, which focused on potential U.S. security guarantees and a future meeting with Vladimir Putin. While he remained quiet on Trump's controversial dismissal of a ceasefire, he reportedly used a map to correct the White House's understanding of the battlefield situation. The key outcome for Ukraine was not a concrete resolution but buying more time to steer negotiations away from a premature or unfavorable peace deal.</p>
