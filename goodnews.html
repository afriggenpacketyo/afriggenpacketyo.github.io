          <p>Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are experiencing a surge in acceptance within Washington D.C. and Wall Street, bolstered by the Trump administration's supportive stance. Recent legislation has opened doors for major corporations to issue digital currencies, and Congress is debating a regulatory framework for the industry. However, former SEC official Amanda Fischer warns that crypto remains a highly speculative and volatile asset, comparing the current enthusiasm to the subprime mortgage bubble before the 2008 financial crisis. Despite these risks, the industry's influence is growing, with significant lobbying efforts and the price of Bitcoin reaching new highs.</p>

The movie, which explored themes of obsession and Hollywood's dark side, starred Gloria Swanson and William Holden and remains a cultural touchstone. Actress Nancy Olson, now 97, recalls the film's production and its enduring legacy.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a humorous commentary, author David Sedaris reflects on the modern dilemma of tipping, particularly with the rise of automated payment screens that prompt for gratuities. He recounts an experience at a Minneapolis airport breakfast spot where he was asked to tip 22% for a self-service transaction, sparking an internal debate about the value of the service provided. Sedaris humorously contrasts the minimal effort of the server with more physically demanding tasks. Ultimately, his reflections touch on feelings of social obligation, guilt, and the changing nature of service and compensation in today's economy.</p>

          <p>A new biography, "Electric Spark" by Frances Wilson, delves into the life of Scottish novelist Muriel Spark, highlighting her identity as a significant modern religious writer whose work was deeply influenced by Roman Catholicism and the Bible. While known for her witty and acerbic style, Spark's novels often explore theological themes of divine judgment and human fallibility, using narrative form to mimic the relationship between God and humanity. The biography examines how her conversion to Catholicism, along with experiences like working in wartime psychological operations, shaped her unique literary voice. It presents her as a complex figure who used fiction to grapple with questions of truth, control, and faith.</p>

          <p>An almanac feature looks back to 1791, when Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton commissioned the Cape Henry Lighthouse in Virginia, the first to be fully funded and constructed by the U.S. federal government. Completed the following year, the original stone tower guided ships for nearly 90 years before being replaced by a taller iron structure that still stands today. This project marked the beginning of a federal system of lighthouses across the nation, crucial for maritime safety. Over the centuries, technology has advanced, and nearly all U.S. lighthouses are now fully automated, a significant shift from the era of dedicated lighthouse keepers.</p>

          <p>As generative AI provides attackers with sophisticated new tools, corporations are increasingly deploying defensive AI agents to bolster their cybersecurity forces. These autonomous AI 'teammates' are being used to automate routine detection, analysis, and response tasks, freeing up human security professionals to focus on more complex threats. Cybersecurity experts note that these agents can handle high-volume, low-level work, which helps reduce burnout and addresses the talent shortage in the industry. While the technology is still evolving, its adoption is seen as essential for defenders to keep pace with the rapidly advancing capabilities of AI-powered cybercriminals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Xenobe Purvis's debut novel, "The Hounding," taps into the long-standing literary fascination with strange and mystical sisters, a trope seen from Macbeth to classic fairy tales. The story follows five sisters in 18th-century England who are accused of witchcraft and transforming into dogs, exploring how femininity itself can be perceived as a threat. The article analyzes how literature often uses sisterhood as a mysterious force that tests other characters and societal norms. While "The Hounding" engages directly with this history, it also highlights the timeless and often tragic reality of how women who defy convention are persecuted.</p>

          <p>An expert who assists Americans moving abroad has identified Albania as a top, yet often overlooked, European destination. The country's appeal stems from its significant affordability, with low costs for rent, food, and healthcare compared to the U.S. and Western Europe. A major advantage for Americans is the ability to live in Albania for up to a year without a visa, allowing for an extended trial period. With stunning natural landscapes, a welcoming attitude towards Americans, and a growing expatriate community, Albania is increasingly seen as an accessible and attractive option for those seeking a new life abroad.</p>

          <p>A tourist visiting Mexico was startled to find a wild coati, a relative of the raccoon, had made its way into her hotel room and was resting comfortably on her bed. She captured the unusual encounter in a video, expressing her panic before the animal eventually left the room on its own. The incident highlights the increasing frequency of human-wildlife encounters as human populations expand into natural habitats. While often not dangerous, experts advise maintaining a safe distance and not feeding wild animals to ensure both human and animal safety, especially for species like the coati, some of which are endangered.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Michigan State University have documented a notable expansion of the black bear population into the southern part of the state, an area where they have not traditionally resided. Trail cameras at the Corey Marsh Ecological Research Center captured images of the bears, confirming their southern migration from their typical habitats in the Upper Peninsula. Wildlife officials view this population growth as a positive sign for the ecosystem, as bears play a vital role in controlling insect populations and dispersing seeds. The Department of Natural Resources has issued guidance for residents to coexist peacefully by securing food sources like trash and bird feeders.</p>

          <p>Devastating floods in Texas Hill Country last month have led to a remarkable prehistoric discovery, uncovering a series of 110-million-year-old dinosaur tracks in Travis County. A volunteer assisting with cleanup found the large, three-clawed footprints, which paleontologists believe were left by a carnivore similar to the 35-foot-long Acrocanthosaurus. The floodwaters washed away layers of dirt and debris along Sandy Creek, revealing the tracks preserved in the underlying limestone. Experts are now working with disaster response crews to document the find and ensure the historically significant site is protected from damage during ongoing recovery efforts.</p>

According to TipRanks, which tracks analyst performance, companies like Chevron (CVX), Rithm Capital (RITM), and AT&T (T) are being highlighted for their potential. Analysts point to Chevron's growth prospects following its Hess acquisition and AT&T's strong free cash flow outlook as positive indicators.

          <p>A schoolboy in Orkney, Scotland, discovered the wreckage of a 275-year-old ship on a beach following a storm. The vessel's hull was later identified by researchers as the Earl of Chatham, a former Royal Navy ship named HMS Hind. Built in 1749, the HMS Hind was involved in British military campaigns, including during the American Revolution, before being sold and repurposed as a whaling ship. The community rallied to preserve the 12-ton oak timbers of the vessel, which ultimately sank in a North Sea storm in 1788 with all 56 crew members surviving the wreck.</p>
