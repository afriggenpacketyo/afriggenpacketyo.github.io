          <p>Clean-up operations are in progress across the UK, particularly in Scotland, after Storm Floris caused significant disruption. The storm, described as the most damaging in recent memory, left approximately 50,000 homes without power and led to widespread travel cancellations, including over 100 incidents on Scotland's rail network. While a yellow weather warning remains in place, authorities are working to restore services and power, with Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks providing free food and drinks in affected areas. The Scottish government is coordinating the recovery, urging caution as teams work to clear debris and assess damages.</p>

          <p>China's government has unveiled a new plan to support its cattle industry in response to falling beef prices and strong competition from imports. The initiative, announced by the country's top economic planner, aims to increase domestic production and consumption of high-quality beef by implementing a new quality-grading system. This policy is part of a broader effort to strengthen key agricultural sectors and enhance the appeal of domestic products. The move comes as wholesale beef prices remain significantly lower than in previous years, and officials note there is significant room for growth in high-quality protein consumption among Chinese residents.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 22:08:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have reportedly been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's asylum ban. A three-judge panel for the D.C. Circuit Court ruled on Friday that the ban cannot be used to completely suspend humanitarian protections for asylum seekers. This partially grants a challenge brought by the ACLU, which argued the policy violated U.S. and international law. The directive instructs Customs and Border Protection officials to revert to processing migrants under existing immigration law, marking a significant legal setback for the administration's hardline border policies.</p>

The White House confirmed the task force will coordinate on critical areas such as security, transportation, and visa processing for the international event. The chair of the LA Olympics organizing committee expressed deep appreciation for the administration's support, highlighting the importance of federal leadership for the games. This move follows a similar task force Trump chairs for the 2026 World Cup, which the U.S. will co-host with Canada and Mexico.</p>

          <p>Australia has announced it will acquire 11 advanced Mogami-class frigates from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in a deal worth approximately $6.5 billion. Defense Minister Richard Marles described it as the largest defense-industry agreement ever between the two nations, highlighting their close strategic alignment in the Indo-Pacific. The purchase is a key part of Australia's military restructuring aimed at countering China's regional influence and will more than double its fleet of major warships over the next decade. The deal marks Japan's first major warship export since before World War II, a significant step given its pacifist constitution.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) has agreed to a $1.7 million settlement in a lawsuit brought by 45 California counties over the improper disposal of hazardous waste. The lawsuit alleged that UPS facilities were sending corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials to local landfills not equipped to handle such waste. The settlement includes $1.4 million in civil penalties and funds for environmental projects. Officials noted that UPS was cooperative during the investigation and has already implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs across its California locations to address the issue and ensure future compliance.</p>

          <h2>Experts Advise on Tarantula Sightings as Mating Season Begins in California</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 21:29:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>It is currently tarantula mating season in California, a period from August to December when male spiders leave their burrows in search of a mate. Wildlife experts note that sightings are common at dusk in chaparral, desert, and mountain areas across Southern California, including popular hiking spots like Griffith Park and Joshua Tree National Park. While their appearance may be alarming to some, the spiders are generally harmless to humans unless provoked. Experts advise that the tarantulas' venom is not deadly and they are reluctant to bite, but they can flick irritant hairs from their bodies if they feel threatened.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles star running back Saquon Barkley has declined an invitation to serve on President Donald Trump's revitalized council on sports, fitness, and nutrition. Barkley, who was on a list of proposed members that included other prominent sports figures, stated that he and his family decided it was in his best interest not to accept due to his busy schedule. He expressed shock at being considered but confirmed his decision to decline. The running back has previously golfed with both Trump and Barack Obama, and noted that he respects the office of the presidency.</p>

          <p>The remains of an auroch, an extinct species of large wild cattle from the Bronze Age, have been discovered by archaeologists in a cave near Ingleborough in the Yorkshire Dales. The discovery was part of a broader project surveying caverns in the area, which also uncovered evidence of Neolithic human burials. The findings, made in partnership with local cave explorers, are helping to shed light on the prehistoric use of the landscape by early farmers. The project is part of a larger initiative aimed at preserving the history and traditional farming practices of England's upland commons.</p>

          <h2>American Eagle Stock Surges Over 20% Following Trump's Endorsement of Sydney Sweeney Ad</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 21:04:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters skyrocketed on Monday after President Trump praised the retailer's controversial advertising campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. In a Truth Social post, Trump called the ad the 'HOTTEST' out there and encouraged his followers to support the brand, sparking a meme-driven rally. The ad had previously drawn criticism from some who claimed its 'great genes/jeans' wordplay promoted eugenics, a charge the company denies. The presidential endorsement provided a significant boost to the retailer, which has recently faced financial challenges, including slow sales and a major write-off of merchandise.

          <p>A hiker was rescued and airlifted to a hospital after falling 25 feet down Big Falls waterfall in the San Bernardino Mountains. The man lost his footing on slick, moss-covered rocks and crashed into a pool below, but was fortunate that someone heard his screams and called for help. A specialized rescue helicopter from the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department responded, lowering a paramedic to the injured hiker and hoisting him to safety in a rescue basket. Authorities noted that such falls are a common occurrence at the notoriously dangerous location despite warning signs being posted.</p>

          <h2>Increased Screenings Lead to More Early-Stage Colon Cancer Diagnoses in Ages 45-49</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 20:21:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows that lowering the recommended screening age for colorectal cancer to 45 has led to a significant increase in early-stage diagnoses for that age group. Following updated guidelines, screening rates among adults aged 45 to 49 rose by 62% between 2019 and 2023. This corresponds with a jump in the annual incidence rate of early-stage cancer diagnoses, which researchers say is promising news as it indicates cancers are being caught sooner. However, experts caution that screening uptake in this younger demographic remains suboptimal and inequitable across different insurance and education levels.</p>
