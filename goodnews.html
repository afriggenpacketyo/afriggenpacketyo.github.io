          <p>An Austrian court has overturned the perjury conviction of former Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who had previously received an eight-month suspended jail sentence for giving false testimony to a parliamentary inquiry. The three-judge panel acquitted Kurz, who was once a rising star among European conservatives and twice headed a governing coalition in Austria. This decision marks a significant turn in the legal proceedings that have shadowed Kurz's political career, potentially paving the way for a future return to public life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Food apps that rate the healthfulness of packaged foods have become increasingly popular, but nutrition experts advise using them with skepticism. While these apps can help consumers decode nutrition labels and make healthier choices, different apps may provide different scores for the same product. Experts recommend opting for apps that assess food on overall nutrient content rather than focusing on single ingredients, and to approach the results with a grain of salt, as some apps may overstate the risks of certain food additives.</p>
