          <p>Esteemed CBS News correspondent Mark Knoller is remembered for his legendary 32-year career and his unique, unofficial role as the meticulous record-keeper of presidential statistics. Revered by colleagues and presidents from both parties, Knoller was known for his obsessive dedication to logging every detail of a president's daily activities, from speeches to basketball games. His encyclopedic knowledge and distinctive radio voice made him a Washington institution, with the White House itself often relying on his personal archives for data. His passing marks the loss of a selfless, warm, and highly respected figure in journalism.</p>

          <p>Renowned painter Alex Katz, now 98, reflects on his seven-decade career and his commitment to supporting other artists through a major donation to Maine's Portland Museum of Art. Known for his distinctive figurative style, Katz has gifted a collection of over 100 paintings, featured in an exhibit called "Painting Energy," to help emerging artists who face the same difficulties he once did. Despite his global acclaim and multi-million dollar sales, Katz continues to paint daily, driven by a desire to explore new creative territory he finds both exciting and frightening.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Shares Six Phrases to Encourage Children to Listen</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A child psychologist who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that fostering long-term cooperation requires building a connection based on emotional safety. Rather than demanding obedience, parents can use specific phrases to calm a child's nervous system and validate their feelings. Phrases like "I believe you" and "Let's figure this out together" shift the dynamic from an adversarial one to a collaborative partnership. This approach helps children feel heard and respected, making them more naturally inclined to listen and cooperate with boundaries.</p>

          <p>The Premier League transfer window is set for a frantic conclusion, with several high-profile deals hanging in the balance before Monday's deadline. The most significant saga involves Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak, who is attempting to force a move to Liverpool, with a potential fee approaching £150 million. Other key storylines include Arsenal's last-minute £60 million acquisition of Eberechi Eze from under Tottenham's nose and Manchester United's ongoing efforts to resolve the futures of several players, including Kobbie Mainoo and Antony. Goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma's potential departure from PSG also adds intrigue, with Manchester clubs cited as possible destinations.</p>

          <p>The UK has finalized its largest-ever warship export deal, a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The deal is expected to support 4,000 jobs in the UK, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow, and bolster over 400 British businesses. This strategic partnership will create a combined fleet of 13 advanced anti-submarine frigates, significantly strengthening NATO's northern flank. The agreement marks a major victory for the British defense industry over international competitors from France, Germany, and the United States.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is creating a challenging labor market for recent graduates, as job postings have declined and many entry-level tasks are being automated. However, experts suggest the impact is more nuanced than headlines imply, with many roles requiring empathy, creative thinking, or physical skills remaining secure from AI disruption. While jobs like coding and copywriting are at higher risk, new categories of work are expected to emerge, similar to past technological shifts. The current economic uncertainty is also a significant factor, causing some companies to slow hiring regardless of AI's influence.</p>

          <p>Following the Alabama Crimson Tide's 31-17 upset loss to Florida State, ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith declared that the era of Nick Saban's dominance is "looooonnngggg gone." Smith pointed to several weaknesses in the team's performance, including sacks surrendered, dropped passes, and quarterback limitations. The loss snapped Alabama's 23-game winning streak in season openers and comes in the first full season after legendary coach Nick Saban's retirement. The team, now led by Kalen DeBoer, faces a difficult schedule ahead, further testing the program's post-Saban identity.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, the author challenges the common liberal disdain for hunting by arguing it is a more honest and sustainable way to consume meat than relying on factory-farmed products. Recounting her own journey from a non-hunter to someone who finds a deep connection with the animals she harvests, she explores the complex emotions and responsibilities involved. The article also addresses the crucial role hunters play in wildlife conservation through taxes on firearms and ammunition, while acknowledging the deep ambivalence many, including herself, feel about gun culture in the United States.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.1 billion after no ticket matched all six numbers in the latest drawing, extending a winless streak that began in May. This prize ranks as the fifth-largest in the game's history, offering a winner the choice between 30 annual payments or a lump sum of approximately $498.4 million before taxes. While the odds of winning remain incredibly slim at 1 in 292.2 million, the enormous jackpot continues to attract players across 45 states.

          <p>A new exhibition at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History chronicles the little-known story of how surfing was first introduced to the American mainland in 1885. Three teenage Hawaiian princes, sent to a military school near Santa Cruz, famously rode the local waves on surfboards they crafted from native redwood trees. This event, documented in a local newspaper at the time, planted the seeds for the sport's eventual popularity in California. The exhibit features replicas of their heavy, finless boards, illustrating the origins of a now-iconic coastal pastime.</p>

          <p>As part of its ongoing efforts to combat single-use plastic pollution, the state of South Australia will ban the sale and distribution of fish-shaped soy sauce containers starting Monday. These iconic packets, a staple in Asian takeaways, are made of recyclable plastic but are too small to be processed effectively by recycling machinery. This new measure builds on previous legislation that has already banned items like plastic straws and carrier bags. The government aims to protect marine life and reduce carbon emissions, noting that without action, plastic flow into the ocean is projected to triple by 2040.</p>
