          <p>Lewis Pugh, a British-South African endurance athlete, became the first person to swim the 62-mile circuit around Martha's Vineyard, completing the feat over 12 days. Pugh undertook the swim to raise awareness about the threats faced by sharks and to challenge negative perceptions perpetuated by films like Jaws. Despite enduring cold water, strong winds, and the presence of sharks, Pugh swam for approximately 24 hours to highlight the ecocide of sharks, with nearly 100 million killed annually. He hopes his efforts will encourage greater protection for these vital apex predators, essential for a healthy ocean ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Kevin O'Leary, a Shark Tank investor and Harvard Business School professor, criticized the Trump administration's plan to restrict Harvard's ability to enroll international students. O'Leary argued that these students are valuable contributors to the American economy and represent the "brightest and the best" from around the world. The Trump administration claims Harvard is failing to uphold American values, citing pro-Palestinian protests, while Harvard contends the administration's demands infringe on academic freedom. O'Leary urged a resolution to ensure that top global talent continues to be attracted to American institutions.</p>

Scott, who has blown several save opportunities, is leaving too many pitches in the middle of the strike zone, leading to increased contact and fewer strikeouts. The team is encouraging Scott to be more aggressive in seeking swings and misses, even if it means issuing more walks. With several key relievers injured, Scott's performance in save situations is crucial for the Dodgers.</p>
