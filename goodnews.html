          <p>Academy Award-winning actress Marlee Matlin shares her routine for a perfect Sunday in Los Angeles, balancing relaxation, family time, and local exploration. Her day begins early with pet care and breakfast, followed by supporting local female-owned boutiques in Pasadena and La Cañada Flintridge. Matlin, a governor of the Academy Museum, often visits the museum or enjoys other activities like a Dodgers game or walking at the Rose Bowl. The afternoon is dedicated to quality time with her granddaughter, and the evening involves either cooking a meal at home or visiting her favorite Eagle Rock pizza place, Casa Bianca.</p>

          <h2>Review: 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' Sequel Delivers Nostalgic, Perky Horror</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new installment of "I Know What You Did Last Summer" successfully resurrects the '90s slasher franchise with a fun, self-aware tone. The film brings back original stars Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. to mentor a new group of teens who commit a similar crime and are stalked by a hook-wielding killer. Director Jennifer Kaytin Robinson is praised for balancing nostalgia with fresh humor, creating an enjoyable popcorn movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. While the plot has some weaknesses, the film's strength lies in its witty dialogue and surprisingly likable characters, making for a satisfyingly silly horror throwback.</p>

          <p>Barry Mazor's new book, "Blood Harmony," provides a deeply researched look into the career of Phil and Don Everly, one of rock and roll's foundational harmony duos. The book corrects common myths about their origins and highlights their significant influence on artists like The Beatles and Simon & Garfunkel. It chronicles their string of hits in the late 1950s and early 1960s, their subsequent struggles amid the British Invasion, and their eventual reunion. The biography also delves into the complex and often tense relationship between the two brothers, whose different temperaments created both musical magic and personal friction throughout their decades-long career.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Plans to Lower Voting Age to 16 for All Elections</h2>

          <p>The British government has announced plans to introduce a bill that would lower the voting age to 16 for all UK elections, potentially adding 1.5 million young people to the electorate. This would be the most significant expansion of the franchise since 1969 and would align national elections with those already held in Scotland and Wales. The move presents a new challenge for political parties, who will need to engage this demographic on platforms like TikTok, where many young people get their news. While the Labour Party is expected to benefit most, some analysts note the right-wing Reform UK party also has a strong social media presence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shoppers in the UK using 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) services like Klarna will face stricter affordability checks under new regulations set to take effect next July. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is introducing these rules to bring the largely unregulated sector in line with other forms of credit, aiming to prevent consumers from accumulating excessive debt. The changes mean some shoppers may be denied credit, and will also provide users with the right to complain to the Financial Ombudsman and receive clearer information on fees and cancellation rights. Debt charities have welcomed the move as a significant step in consumer protection.</p>

          <p>Estonia has become a global model for digital governance, offering nearly all public services online, from filing taxes to initiating a divorce. A new report highlights how the small Baltic nation achieved a user adoption rate of over 90% for its e-government services, compared to much lower rates in countries like Germany. Key to Estonia's success is a user-friendly, secure e-ID system that provides access to both public and private sector services, and a "once-only principle" where citizens provide data to the government just once. This comprehensive approach has streamlined bureaucracy, saved taxpayer money, and set a benchmark for digital transformation across Europe.</p>

          <p>The "One Big Beautiful Bill" signed into law by President Trump is projected to lower taxes for millions of Americans, with every income group seeing some savings in 2026. An analysis by the Tax Policy Center found that the average household will save about $2,900. The law extends the 2017 tax cuts and adds new breaks, such as eliminating taxes on tips and overtime. However, the benefits are skewed towards higher earners, with the top 20% of households receiving about 60% of the total tax breaks, translating to a more significant boost to their after-tax income compared to lower-income households.

          <p>A growing number of young, progressive candidates are running for office by centering their campaigns on generational change, but this strategy has yielded mixed results. While some, like New York's Zohran Mamdani, have achieved upset victories, many others have struggled to overcome established opponents, as seen in Deja Foxx's recent loss in an Arizona special election. Experts note that success for these candidates often depends on factors beyond a generational message, including a distinct policy platform and the ability to build institutional and fundraising support. The challenge highlights the difficulty first-time, younger candidates face in breaking through, especially against well-connected incumbents or their relatives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix has used generative artificial intelligence to create visual effects in one of its shows for the first time, according to co-CEO Ted Sarandos. The technology was employed in the Argentine sci-fi series "The Eternauts" to depict a collapsing building, a sequence that was completed ten times faster and at a much lower cost than with traditional methods. While Sarandos touted the benefits for productions with smaller budgets, the use of generative AI remains a contentious issue in Hollywood. Many in the industry have raised concerns about its potential to replace human artists and use existing work without consent.</p>

          <p>Shares of Swedish defense contractor Saab jumped over 12% after the company reported second-quarter profits and sales that significantly exceeded analyst expectations. The maker of the Gripen fighter jet has seen its stock price more than double this year, benefiting from a continent-wide surge in defense spending by European nations. This "era of rearmament" is driven by security concerns following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and calls for NATO members to increase their military budgets. Saab's CEO noted the company is ramping up production dramatically to meet the high demand across its portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>
