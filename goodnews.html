        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from Vanguard indicates that having at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account is a more significant predictor of financial well-being than income or assets. The survey of over 12,000 Vanguard investors revealed that $2,000 in savings increased financial well-being by 21%, surpassing the impact of a $500,000 income or $1 million in assets. This finding highlights the importance of preparedness for unexpected expenses, as the median cost of an emergency is approximately $2,000. The study also found that individuals with emergency savings spend less time worrying about their finances each week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Mozartfest W√ºrzburg is exploring the theme of Mozart's friendships, examining whether the famous composer had genuine connections beyond his musical circles. The festival's artistic director, Evelyn Meining, emphasizes that true friendship requires trust and mutual understanding, something that even millions of social media followers cannot replace. The festival also highlights artistic friendships among performers, such as Nils M√∂nkemeyer and William Youn, who commissioned a new piece inspired by Mozart's transparency. The festival aims to dispel misconceptions about Mozart's relationships with contemporaries like Antonio Salieri, portraying them as mutually respectful colleagues rather than rivals.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's governor signed legislation that increases taxes on hotel rooms and vacation rentals to generate funds for addressing the consequences of the climate crisis. The tax is estimated to generate nearly $100 million annually, which will be used for projects like replenishing sand on Waikiki beaches and clearing flammable invasive grasses. The measure adds 0.75% to the daily room rate tax and levies a new 11% tax on cruise ship bills, bringing the total levy on accommodations to nearly 19%. Governor Green argues that the increase is small enough that tourists will not feel much of a difference, and that many visitors will welcome committing dollars to protect shorelines and communities.</p>

          <p>The AI industrial trade is regaining momentum, with GE Vernova shares reaching an all-time high after a period of market volatility. GE Vernova's success is attributed to being earlier in a potential upcycle for revenue and orders compared to peers like Eaton and Vertiv, and to a larger backlog. Recent deals, such as the $14.2 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia and support for the U.S. nuclear power industry, have also boosted the stock. Despite this positive momentum, the Club has downgraded the stock to a hold-equivalent rating due to its parabolic move higher. (not investment advice)</p>
