          <p>Corporate travel and expense management startup Navan has officially filed to go public, planning to list on the Nasdaq under the symbol 'NAVN'. The company reported a 32% increase in its trailing 12-month revenue, reaching $613 million, and has seen its net loss decrease by 45% year-over-year. Navan, which describes itself as an "all-in-one super app" for business travel, aims to disrupt the sector with its AI-driven platform. The move comes amid a resurgent IPO market, which has seen the most activity since the boom years of 2020 and 2021.</p>

          <p>Reports emerged that Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, was in the process of raising $10 billion at a staggering $200 billion valuation. However, Musk quickly refuted these claims in a post on his social media platform X, calling the report "fake news" and stating that xAI is not currently raising capital. The initial report suggested the funding would support the development of its AI models, including the Grok chatbot, and the construction of a large AI supercomputer in Memphis. The situation highlights the intense investor interest and soaring valuations within the competitive AI industry.</p>

          <p>England is set to face France in a highly anticipated Women's Rugby World Cup semi-final in Bristol, with the winner advancing to the final against Canada. As the tournament hosts and world number one, England's Red Roses are the clear favorites, having won their last 16 matches against the French team. Despite a dominant warm-up victory, England narrowly defeated France in a tense Six Nations decider earlier this year, suggesting a competitive match is expected. The game will showcase England's formidable offense, which has scored 38 tries in the tournament so far.</p>

          <p>The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note reached a two-week high, rising even after the Federal Reserve implemented its first interest rate cut of the year. This counterintuitive market reaction suggests investors are weighing factors beyond the Fed's immediate policy, such as expectations for economic growth, inflation, and the government's need to issue more debt. The move reflects a complex economic picture, where calming signs in the labor market are balanced against ongoing price pressures. Investors are now looking ahead to the upcoming personal consumption expenditures index for further inflation insights. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Las Vegas Raiders offensive coordinator Chip Kelly clarified that while he consults with minority owner Tom Brady about football strategy, the legendary quarterback is not involved in weekly game planning. The clarification came after a sideline report suggested Brady was in regular contact with Kelly about game plans and film review. Kelly explained that he uses Brady as a valuable resource for high-level strategic insights, such as how to approach certain defensive schemes, but confirmed that day-to-day preparations are handled by the coaching staff. The NFL has stated Brady's presence in the coaches' booth is permissible under his ownership role.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department and the IRS have issued proposed regulations clarifying President Trump's new "no tax on tips" policy. The provision allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually, but the guidance specifies which occupations qualify and which do not. Notably, jobs in sectors like healthcare, legal, and financial services are excluded. The rules also confirm that automatic gratuities, such as those added for large parties at restaurants, will not qualify for the deduction because they are not considered voluntary payments. The agencies will finalize the regulations after a public comment period.</p>

          <p>Following a series of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, consumers may find more affordable options for borrowing money. Among the cheapest methods are home equity-based products, with Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) currently offering the lowest average rates due to their variable nature. Home equity loans provide the stability of a fixed rate at a slightly higher cost. For those without home equity, personal loans remain a less expensive alternative to high-interest credit cards, though rates are still higher than in previous years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A retrospective look at Robert Redford's extensive film career reveals a consistent and critical theme: the hollowness and corrupting nature of victory. Across iconic roles in films like "Downhill Racer," "The Candidate," and "The Natural," Redford often portrayed characters whose athletic or personal triumphs came at a significant moral or personal cost. As both an actor and director, he was drawn to stories that questioned America's obsession with winning, suggesting that true grace comes from the art of playing the game, not just the outcome. This perspective defined his legacy as an artist who used his 'golden boy' image to explore deeper, more complex truths.</p>

          <p>The Panama Canal Authority is taking steps to win back liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker traffic that was lost during recent years of drought. Officials plan to reinstate a preferred booking slot system for LNG carriers and are developing a new pipeline project to transport natural gas liquids across the isthmus as an alternative to canal transits. These initiatives aim to provide more flexibility and reliability for energy shippers, who had rerouted to longer sea voyages. The move comes as the canal forecasts a decrease in container traffic after a period of record volumes.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, ruling that the legal complaint failed to meet basic court rules. The judge characterized the filing as a "political document" and "a protected platform to rage against an adversary" rather than a clear statement of claims. The lawsuit, which also named publisher Penguin Random House, was part of a broader criticism by Trump of media coverage he deems unfair. The judge has given Trump's legal team 28 days to file an amended, compliant version of the lawsuit.</p>
