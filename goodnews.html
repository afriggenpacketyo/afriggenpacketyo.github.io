          <p>The UK is bracing for another day of temperatures exceeding 30C, with central England potentially reaching 32C, as an early summer heatwave persists. While Friday is expected to be slightly cooler than Thursday's record-breaking temperatures, Saturday could see highs of 34C. The UK Health Security Agency has issued an amber heat-health alert for all regions in England, cautioning of significant impacts on health and social care services, particularly for the elderly and those with health conditions. The heatwave is predicted to peak on Saturday, with some regions experiencing thundery showers, before temperatures ease slightly on Sunday, remaining below the June peak of 1976. </p>

Durov stated that all his children will have equal rights to the inheritance, which they will not be able to access for 30 years, as he wants them to live normal lives and build themselves up independently. Durov, who faces criminal charges in France related to the moderation of his app, explained that his job involves risks, as defending freedoms earns one many enemies. He denies any wrongdoing and describes the charges as absurd, emphasizing that the use of Telegram by criminals does not make the platform's operators criminals. </p>

          <p>A US appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump can maintain control over National Guard troops in Los Angeles, despite objections from California's governor. The court stated that Trump's administration provided a defensible rationale for the deployment, which was to protect federal personnel and property. This decision reverses a lower court ruling that ordered Trump to return control of the National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom, who criticized the deployment as an authoritarian move. Trump celebrated the ruling as a "BIG WIN," while Newsom emphasized that the president's powers are not unlimited. </p>

          <p>Leading publications of China‚Äôs ruling Communist Party have urged local governments to implement strictures on lavish banquets carefully, seeking to temper overzealousness amid concerns from the food and beverage industry. A commentary in Qiushi, the party's theoretical journal, emphasized that the frugality measures are intended to limit extravagant practices, not ordinary dining. Some local governments have been scrutinizing every meal gathering and intervening in banquets, leading to agencies canceling official receptions and cadres avoiding normal working meals. These oversimplified measures have complicated understanding of the regulations, derailing their original intention and causing unnecessary shocks to the catering industry. </p>

          <p>The recent conflict between Israel and Iran has highlighted the effectiveness of Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system, potentially boosting the prospects for the U.S.'s proposed Golden Dome multi-layered missile defense system. Trump's Golden Dome aims to protect the U.S. from ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles through a network of satellites, sensors, and interceptors. The project has faced criticism due to its high cost and potential to escalate arms races, but it is seen as an opportunity for private space companies facing budget cuts at NASA. The House Appropriations Committee has proposed significant funding for missile defense and space programs to support the Golden Dome effort. (not investment advice)</p>

The condition is best treated before the age of seven, but many councils are unable to offer screenings due to capacity or budget constraints.

The new strategy is as effective as existing preservation methods but reduces carbon dioxide emissions and the potential for toxicity.

Florida beaches have recorded the highest number of unprovoked shark bites, while New Smyrna Beach in Florida is known as the 'shark bite capital of the world'.

This year, China is allowing pilgrims to return to Tibet to follow two pilgrimage routes after a five-year suspension caused by Covid controls and cross-border issues. These sites are sacred to followers of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Bon, and the pilgrimages involve treks through the Lipulekh Pass in Uttarakhand or Nathu La Pass in Sikkim.

          <p>Chris Richards scored in the second half, leading the United States to a 1-0 victory over Saudi Arabia and securing their place in the CONCACAF Gold Cup quarter-finals. Richards scored with a left-footed flick off a free kick from Sebastian Berhalter in the 62nd minute. The win, combined with a draw in the other Group D match, ensured the Americans' advancement. The Gold Cup serves as a crucial test for the US ahead of the 2026 World Cup, with coach Mauricio Pochettino selecting a roster of relatively untested players due to the absence of several top players. </p>

          <h2>China Keeps Lending Rates Steady as Trade Deal Eases Growth Worries</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 23:21:34 EDT</div>

          <p>China's central bank has maintained its benchmark lending rates, following recent monetary easing measures and a trade agreement with the U.S. that alleviates some concerns about economic growth. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) kept the one-year loan prime rate (LPR) at 3.0% and the five-year LPR at 3.5%. Trade-war fears have diminished after U.S. and Chinese trade representatives agreed to honor the consensus reached in Geneva, facilitating trade in rare earth and tech products. This trade truce provides Beijing with more flexibility to support its currency and raises hopes for a smaller economic impact than previously anticipated. (not investment advice)</p>
