          <p>The Trump administration has reached a deal with pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to reduce the cost of its drugs in the United States. The agreement, similar to a previous pact with Pfizer, will reportedly involve AstraZeneca selling drugs to Medicaid patients at the lowest price offered in other developed nations. This is part of President Trump's broader effort to pressure drugmakers to lower prices for American consumers and increase domestic manufacturing. The administration has used the threat of high tariffs to bring pharmaceutical companies to the negotiating table for these pricing deals.</p>

          <p>Chicha is a uniquely Peruvian music genre that emerged in the 1960s, blending Colombian cumbia with Andean folk music, psychedelic rock, and other influences. The term itself is complex, referring to a sacred drink and popular culture, but also used derisively against migrant communities in Lima. The music, characterized by its prominent electric guitar, became a powerful voice for marginalized Andean migrants, with artists like Chacalón and Los Shapis achieving massive popularity in the 1980s. Decades later, the sound of chicha continues to be a vibrant and essential part of Peru's cultural identity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For retirees, investing in precious metals like gold can serve as a hedge against inflation and a store of value during economic uncertainty. Gold's historical resilience makes it a popular choice for portfolio diversification, as it often moves independently of stocks and bonds. However, there are significant risks to consider, including the lack of dividends or growth, high capital gains taxes on collectibles, and costs for storage and insurance. Experts suggest that while gold can provide stability, it is not an engine for wealth creation and should typically comprise only 5-10% of a retirement portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

Machado, who was barred from running in the last presidential election, has been forced to live in hiding but continues to inspire millions.

          <h2>Experts Explain Why Central Banks Continue to Amass Gold Reserves</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Central banks globally have been increasing their gold reserves, a strategy driven by several key factors. Experts point to gold's role as a tool for diversification, reducing reliance on single currencies like the U.S. dollar and operating outside the traditional banking system. Gold is also valued as a stable store of value, a hedge against inflation, and an asset with no counterparty risk, providing security during financial crises. This historical trust in gold as a foundational asset allows central banks to maintain economic stability and manage monetary policy with greater flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For individuals with a certificate of deposit (CD) maturing in November, it is crucial to act proactively as interest rates have begun to soften. The article advises savers to review their bank's maturity notice and grace period rules to avoid automatically rolling funds into a lower-yielding account. It is recommended to shop around for the best current rates on new CDs or high-yield savings accounts, as the gap between them has narrowed. Given the changing rate environment, evaluating whether the liquidity of a high-yield savings account is now more advantageous than locking in a fixed CD rate is a key consideration.

The price increase is driven by central bank buying, geopolitical uncertainty, and interest rate cuts.
