        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With interest rates expected to fall, financial experts are highlighting the benefits of a CD laddering strategy. This approach involves opening multiple Certificates of Deposit with staggered maturity dates, allowing savers to lock in current high rates while maintaining access to their funds periodically. In the current economic climate, where short-term CD rates are unusually higher than long-term ones, this strategy provides a blend of high returns and flexibility. It helps savers navigate inflation and potential Federal Reserve rate cuts without locking all their money away for extended periods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team of archaeologists from East Carolina University has discovered four shipwrecks off the North Carolina coast, one of which is believed to be a Spanish privateer ship from 1748. Wood samples suggest the vessel, possibly the 'La Fortuna', was built with materials from Spanish Caribbean colonies. The ship exploded during an attack on a colonial port during King George's War. The discovery, along with three other wrecks and colonial port infrastructure, offers significant new insights into the region's maritime history, trade, and military conflicts.</p>

          <p>English cricketer Chris Woakes is contemplating rehabilitation over surgery for a shoulder injury sustained during a recent Test match against India. Awaiting scan results for a suspected dislocation, Woakes faces a choice between a four-month recovery post-surgery, which would risk his availability for the Ashes, or an eight-week rehab period. Despite the injury, he famously batted with his arm in a sling in an attempt to help his team clinch a victory. His decision highlights the difficult balance athletes face between long-term health and crucial upcoming competitions.</p>

          <p>The Hubble Space Telescope has taken the clearest image yet of 3I-Atlas, the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system. Traveling at 130,000 mph, the comet poses no threat to Earth and will make its closest approach to the sun in late October. Observations have refined the size of its icy core to be no more than 3.5 miles across. The comet's unique characteristics, such as its high reflectivity and a glow in front of it, have led some scientists, including Harvard's Avi Loeb, to speculate it could be of technological origin.</p>

          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe admitted to mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants" in a social media post. After alerting authorities and declaring he would use "every tool" to ensure their deportation, it was revealed the boat contained a crew raising money for motor neurone disease. The crew, which includes a former Royal Marine, found the incident "hilarious." In a subsequent post, Lowe explained it was a false alarm based on constituent complaints and pledged to donate £1,000 to their charity.</p>

          <p>This article explores the enduring relevance of Virginia Woolf's novel "Mrs. Dalloway" on its 100th anniversary, arguing it is a masterpiece of the midlife crisis. The author reflects on how the book's themes resonate differently at various stages of life, moving from a youthful focus on its portrayal of post-WWI trauma to a more mature understanding of its protagonist's grappling with mortality and past choices. The novel juxtaposes the societal life of Clarissa Dalloway with the tragic fate of a war veteran, Septimus Smith. Ultimately, the work is celebrated for its profound depiction of finding happiness amidst life's complexities and anxieties.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is significantly boosting digital advertising revenue for tech giants like Meta and Alphabet, both of which reported strong quarterly earnings. Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg credited AI with improving the efficiency of the company's ad system, which has seen a rebound in spending from key advertisers. However, the benefits are not universal across the industry, as smaller platforms like Snap and Pinterest delivered lukewarm results. These companies face challenges from botched platform updates and advertiser pullback, indicating that in the competitive ad market, AI's advantages are currently concentrating at the top.

          <p>Chelsea FC has generated over £250 million from the sale of academy-grown players in the last three years, a strategy accelerated under the current ownership to comply with financial regulations. The departure of Armando Broja to Burnley for up to £20 million is the latest example. These sales, which count as 'pure profit' in financial accounting, have provided the club with significant flexibility to fund over £250 million in new signings this summer alone. This business model highlights the financial importance of a successful youth academy in the modern era of stringent profit and sustainability rules in football.</p>

          <p>Market analysts are suggesting that bitcoin's predictable four-year price cycle, which has historically revolved around its "halving" event, may be breaking down. The recent approval of spot bitcoin ETFs has introduced a new class of long-term institutional investors, altering market dynamics and causing bitcoin to hit a new all-time high before the last halving, contrary to past patterns. Other factors, such as a more supportive regulatory environment, are also contributing to this shift. This potential break from historical trends could mean that the massive 70-80% price crashes of the past may be replaced by more moderate corrections. (not investment advice)</p>
