          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and Palestinian rights activist, has arrived in New Jersey following a federal judge's order for his release from ICE detention in Louisiana. Khalil, a green card holder, was detained for over 100 days, sparking protests and discussions about free speech. Upon arrival, Khalil affirmed his commitment to advocating for Palestinian rights and criticized the Trump administration for punishing his political speech. Judge Michael Fabiarz ruled that Khalil was not a flight risk or danger to the community, denouncing the government's actions as an attempt to punish Khalil for his anti-Israel stance, and the arrest of Khalil set off a series of protests.</p>

          <p>Palestinian rights activist Mahmoud Khalil has reunited with his family in New Jersey after being detained by ICE for over three months. Khalil, a Columbia University graduate, was targeted by the Trump administration for speaking out against Israel's war on Gaza. Upon arrival, he vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez condemned the persecution based on political speech as a violation of First Amendment rights. Khalil's release follows a federal judge's ruling that his detention was unconstitutional, marking a setback for the Trump administration's efforts to deport pro-Palestinian international students.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). Judge Indira Talwani struck down a policy change that would have capped indirect costs for universities at 15%, deeming the move arbitrary and contrary to law. The University of California estimated the change would cost it nearly $100 million annually. The ruling follows similar blocks on caps placed on grants by the Energy Department and the National Institutes of Health, ensuring critical research in various technology fields continues uninterrupted. This decision protects vital research funding.</p>

          <p>Following his release from over three months in immigration detention, Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil stated that the Trump administration's attempts to suppress pro-Palestinian voices have failed. Khalil, a prominent figure in pro-Palestinian protests, was arrested on March 8, sparking demonstrations in New York and Washington DC. The US government seeks to deport him, citing his activism as detrimental to foreign policy interests. Khalil's statement underscores the ongoing tensions between the administration and activists advocating for Palestinian rights, and it reinforces the notion that his release is a victory for freedom of speech.</p>
