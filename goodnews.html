          <p>Despite Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's efforts to avoid direct criticism of Donald Trump during his re-election campaign, Trump's global policies became a factor in the election. Voters, concerned about the rising cost of living, were wary of conservative opposition leader Peter Dutton's alignment with Trump's ideas. Trump's tariff decisions and their impact on retirement accounts influenced voters to support Albanese and the Labor Party, leading to a significant victory. Dutton's defeat in his own parliamentary seat further underscored the repudiation of Trump-like policies in Australia, indicating a preference for sensible, centrist politics.</p>

          <p>Students at Hunan University in China recreated a rice dish from a 2,000-year-old bamboo manuscript called the "Shi Fang." The ancient recipe, using wooden steamers and clay pots, produced rice that was loose yet elastic with a lower sugar content than modern rice. The students soaked the rice for half an hour, steamed it for 20 minutes, cooled it, added water, and steamed it again for 15 minutes. Researchers combined Han-era techniques with modern technology to deepen their appreciation for traditional Chinese culture.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party has made significant gains in English local elections, challenging the traditional dominance of the Labour and Conservative parties. The party's success reflects public disenchantment with the two main parties and a fragmentation of society. Reform's gains, along with those of the Liberal Democrats and Greens, suggest a shift away from the two-party system. This fragmentation presents challenges for both Labour and the Conservatives as they compete for votes across the political spectrum.</p>
