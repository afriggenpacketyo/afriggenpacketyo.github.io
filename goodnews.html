          <p>Kent Broussard, a 66-year-old retired accountant from Baton Rouge, has successfully auditioned for and joined the Louisiana State University Tiger Marching Band as a tuba player. Fulfilling a dream he had held since childhood, Broussard returned to school and dedicated himself to relearning the instrument to compete in the rigorous audition process. Despite being 41 years older than the next oldest member, he was not given any special treatment by the band director. Broussard's story highlights a message of pursuing lifelong passions and stepping out of one's comfort zone, as he prepares to perform in his first game.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board has proposed a new long-term compensation package for CEO Elon Musk that could be worth approximately $900 billion, potentially making him the world's first trillionaire. The plan is contingent on the company achieving ambitious market capitalization and production goals over the next decade, including growing its value to $8.5 trillion. This proposal aims to ensure Musk's continued leadership and align his interests with shareholder success, following legal challenges that struck down his previous $50 billion pay package. The package requires shareholder approval and comes as Tesla faces recent declines in quarterly revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The artificial intelligence company Anthropic has agreed to a landmark $1.5 billion settlement in a class-action lawsuit brought by authors who alleged their copyrighted books were used without permission to train its AI model, Claude. If approved, the settlement would compensate authors approximately $3,000 for each of the estimated 500,000 books involved. A key aspect of the case was a judge's ruling that while training on legally obtained books was fair use, using pirated copies was not. This settlement is seen as a major precedent in the ongoing legal battles between creative industries and AI developers over training data.</p>

During a visit to an engine manufacturing plant in Samara, Putin stated that Russia must not only meet its own needs but also actively compete in global markets to maintain its status as a leader in space technology. He highlighted Russia's success in developing innovative engines for the energy sector despite Western sanctions, linking this capability to crucial export projects like the proposed Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline to China. Putin also pointed to the development of new aircraft engines for both military and civil aviation.</p>

However, the global biker community and the public have responded with numerous offers of help, including replacement motorcycles, gear, and messages of solidarity. Notably, the production company behind Ewan McGregor's 'Long Way Home' series offered to lend him a bike. Alekari expressed immense gratitude for the kindness shown, stating it has changed his perspective on the unfortunate event.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has ruled that the Trump administration's attempt to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Venezuela and Haiti is unlawful. The decision by Judge Edward Chen blocks the Department of Homeland Security's move, allowing approximately 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians to maintain their legal status to live and work in the U.S. The judge stated the administration's action was unprecedented and violated the law, given the dangerous conditions in the migrants' home countries. The DHS has indicated it will likely appeal the ruling, criticizing it as judicial activism.</p>

          <p>California has officially joined the Northwest Wildland Fire Fighting Compact, a collaborative agreement with twelve other U.S. states and Canadian provinces to share firefighting resources and technology. This partnership allows member jurisdictions to assist one another when wildfires exceed local capacity, a crucial move as California confronts increasingly severe fire seasons. Governor Gavin Newsom framed the decision as a response to federal budget and staff cuts at the U.S. Forest Service under the Trump administration. The move is part of a broader effort by West Coast states to form regional alliances to counteract what they perceive as hostile federal policies.</p>

          <p>A new draft of a major cryptocurrency regulation bill in the U.S. Senate includes a provision to ensure that tokenized versions of stocks and other traditional securities are not reclassified as commodities. This update to the Responsible Financial Innovation Act is a key step in establishing a clear regulatory framework for digital assets, defining the jurisdictions of the SEC and the CFTC. Senator Cynthia Lummis expressed hope for a Senate committee vote this month and a full floor vote by November, aiming to get the bill to the president's desk by year's end. Bipartisan support is still being negotiated for the comprehensive market structure legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching an estimated $1.8 billion, winners face the critical decision of taking a lump sum cash payment or receiving an annuity over 29 years. Certified public accountant Dan Geltrude advises that while he would personally choose the lump sum for investment control, it can be a "dangerous" option for many, as overspending has led past winners to bankruptcy. The annuity provides a safer, more stable stream of income over time. Geltrude's primary advice for any winner is to remain anonymous, sign the ticket, and immediately assemble a team of legal, financial, and accounting professionals before making any decisions.</p>

While the first two sets were closely contested, Alcaraz's aggressive play and strong serving in key moments proved to be the difference. The victory continues Alcaraz's dominant run, as he has reached the final without dropping a single set in the tournament. He will now face either Jannik Sinner or Felix Auger-Aliassime for the championship title.</p>

The match featured debuts for new players on both sides, including Chelsea's high-profile signing Ellie Carpenter, who made an immediate impact by assisting the opening goal. While Manchester City showed creative pressure and a new dynamic style under their new manager, they failed to convert key chances. The result reinforces Chelsea's position as the team to beat, though the season has only just begun and both teams are still developing.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made a sudden change to their pitching rotation, with Shohei Ohtani stepping in to start against the Baltimore Orioles on short notice. The scheduled starter, Tyler Glasnow, was scratched due to back tightness, which the team hopes is not a serious issue. Ohtani, who had his own recent start postponed due to illness, volunteered to take the mound for his first pitching appearance since August 27. Manager Dave Roberts praised Ohtani's willingness to alter his routine for the team's needs and hoped it would provide a boost after a recent series sweep.</p>

          <p>Giorgio Armani, the iconic Italian fashion designer who died at age 91, is being remembered for transforming Hollywood's red carpet from a chaotic fashion landscape into a global runway. Beginning in the 1980s, Armani pioneered the practice of dressing celebrities for major events, using the film industry to build his brand. His signature unstructured, elegant suits, famously worn by Richard Gere in "American Gigolo," redefined power dressing for both men and women. By establishing a dedicated presence in Hollywood, he created a system of designer-celebrity partnerships that now dominates awards season, forever changing the relationship between fashion and film.</p>
