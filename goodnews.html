          <p>In a reflective opinion piece, author and activist V (formerly Eve Ensler) addresses the challenge of maintaining hope and resisting despair in what she describes as a suffocating political climate of authoritarianism and cruelty. She argues against succumbing to immobilization, advocating for a "dance of duality" where one acknowledges pain but channels it into purposeful action and community building. Citing examples from activists in the Congo to community organizers in St. Louis, the article posits that collective actions like protests and local aid are vital. These efforts build solidarity and reaffirm humanity as a powerful form of resistance.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing trend among Gen Z patrons to pay for each drink separately rather than opening a bar tab is causing frustration for bartenders. While some bartenders find the practice "annoying" and time-consuming, especially during busy periods, they also acknowledge its potential benefits for customers. Paying drink-by-drink can help individuals better monitor their alcohol consumption and spending, promoting fiscal responsibility. The habit also reflects a broader trend of younger adults drinking less alcohol overall and being wary of leaving credit cards with the bar.</p>

          <p>Fifteen years after its initial public offering on June 29, 2010, Tesla has transformed from a niche electric car startup into a trillion-dollar company, with its stock value increasing almost 300 times. An initial $10,000 investment would be worth nearly $3 million today. However, the company now faces significant challenges, including sluggish sales, increased competition from Chinese manufacturers, and concerns over CEO Elon Musk's unpredictable behavior and political entanglements. Musk is now shifting investor focus away from car sales and towards future technologies like autonomous driving and humanoid robots as the key to Tesla's continued growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following their victory in the Euro 2025 final, England's Under-21 soccer team is being celebrated, with attention now turning to which players might advance to the senior squad for next year's World Cup. The article assesses the potential of standout performers like Tino Livramento, Harvey Elliott, and James McAtee to make the step up to the full national team. It notes that while past U21 success has produced some senior stars like Cole Palmer, many talented youth players do not go on to have significant international careers. The achievement highlights the strength of England's youth development system and raises expectations for the future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On the 100th anniversary of the devastating 1925 Santa Barbara earthquake, experts reflect on the lessons it provides for modern seismic safety. The magnitude 6.5-6.8 quake revealed critical vulnerabilities in unreinforced brick buildings, a danger that took decades for many California cities to address with mandatory retrofitting laws. The event also prompted Santa Barbara to adopt new building codes and a unified Spanish Colonial Revival architectural style that defines the city today. However, experts note that many potentially vulnerable structures, like soft-story apartment buildings, still exist, highlighting an ongoing reluctance to enforce the strictest safety measures.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The surprisingly muted reactions from China and Russia to the recent U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran reveal the limits of their so-called "axis of antagonism" against the West. This analysis argues that while the three nations share an opposition to U.S. influence, their strategic interests diverge significantly when global stability is threatened. For China, its economic ties with the West and need for stability outweigh its support for Iran in a direct military confrontation. This cautious approach suggests that the "no limits" partnership between Russia and China may also be less robust than advertised, prioritizing self-interest over ideological solidarity.</p>

          <p>B√§rbel Bas, a politician from a working-class background, has been elected as the new co-leader of Germany's center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), alongside Lars Klingbeil. Her election is seen as a source of new hope for the ailing party, which suffered a historic defeat in recent elections. Bas, who represents the party's left wing, is expected to provide a counterbalance to the more conservative Klingbeil. In her acceptance speech, she emphasized her commitment to social mobility and solidarity, sharply criticizing conservative calls to cut social benefits and vowing to champion the welfare state as Germany's new labor minister.</p>

          <p>During a match against Western Force, the Perth stadium announcer attempted to troll the British and Irish Lions by highlighting the southern hemisphere birthplaces of several players, including New Zealand-born Irish winger James Lowe. The tactic, which followed similar comments by Australia's head coach, failed to faze Lowe, who contributed two assists in the Lions' dominant 54-7 victory. Lowe humorously dismissed the announcer's "gag," stating he is used to being teased and that the team's performance is what matters. The incident adds a layer of playful rivalry to the Lions' tour of Australia.</p>

The organization states its strong preference for on-the-record sources but acknowledges that anonymity is sometimes necessary to protect individuals from retaliation or to report on sensitive topics. Before granting anonymity, senior editors vet the source's credibility, the importance of their information, and the potential risks they face. When an unnamed source is used, NPR commits to explaining the reason for the anonymity to its audience, ensuring transparency while still enabling the publication of crucial stories that would otherwise go untold.</p>
