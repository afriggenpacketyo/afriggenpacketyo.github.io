        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following Clayton Kershaw's 3,000th career strikeout, this opinion article from the LA Times makes the case that he is the greatest pitcher in Dodgers history, surpassing even Sandy Koufax. The author contends that while Koufax had a period of unparalleled dominance, Kershaw's longevity and sustained excellence over 18 seasons give him the edge. The piece acknowledges Kershaw's postseason struggles but argues his overall body of work, including more wins and strikeouts, establishes a legacy of enduring greatness unmatched in the franchise's lore.</p>

          <p>The United States has lifted export controls on chip-design software for China, as confirmed by leading semiconductor software firms Synopsys and Cadence. This reversal allows American companies to resume selling critical electronic design automation (EDA) software, a market they dominate, to Chinese customers without needing special licenses. The move, which follows a ban implemented in May, caused shares of the affected companies to rise significantly. This development occurs as the U.S. and China signal progress toward a broader trade truce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw achieved a historic milestone by recording his 3,000th career strikeout during a game against the Chicago White Sox. The moment occurred in the sixth inning, making him just the 20th pitcher in Major League Baseball history, and only the fourth left-hander, to reach this elite benchmark. The game paused as Kershaw received a standing ovation from the crowd and was congratulated by his teammates.

          <p>Armenia is actively looking to deepen its relationship with China and elevate it to a strategic partnership, according to Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan. This diplomatic effort is part of Armenia's broader strategy to diversify its foreign relations beyond its traditional alliance with Russia. The move follows dissatisfaction with Moscow's role during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war and its aftermath. Mirzoyan's visit to Beijing signals a mutual interest from both nations in strengthening ties without limitations, marking a significant pivot in the South Caucasus nation's geopolitical alignment.</p>

          <p>With a razor-thin Republican majority, the possibility of a tie vote on major legislation, such as the Trump-backed spending bill, has become a relevant concern. According to House rules, if a vote on a question results in a tie, the measure is considered lost and fails to pass. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House has no such mechanism. This procedural reality highlights the high stakes of party unity and the significant power held by even a small number of dissenting members.</p>

U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president exceeded his legal authority, stating that the White House cannot unilaterally create an "alternative immigration system" that supplants laws enacted by Congress. The judge granted a nationwide injunction but stayed his decision for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal.

This updated intelligence assessment suggests a more significant impact than earlier, low-confidence reports that estimated a delay of only several months. The new analysis is reportedly based on materials confirming the destruction of centrifuges at the Fordow enrichment site. The claims come as Iran has suspended cooperation with the UN's nuclear watchdog.</p>
