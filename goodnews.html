          <p>A federal judge ruled against forcing Google to sell its Chrome browser as part of an antitrust remedy, a decision that caused parent company Alphabet's stock to surge by 9%. While the judge deemed Google a monopolist, he opted for less severe measures, such as requiring Google to share some search data with rivals, calling a forced divestiture "incredibly messy and highly risky." The ruling is seen as a significant victory for Google, though the Department of Justice stated the imposed remedies are an important step forward for consumer protection. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has overturned the Trump administration's freeze on $2.2 billion in research funding for Harvard University, ruling the action was an illegal violation of the university's First Amendment rights. The judge stated that the administration used antisemitism as a "smokescreen" for an ideologically motivated attack, noting there was little connection between the frozen research grants and the claims of antisemitism. This decision vacates the freeze orders and reinstates funding for numerous critical research projects in fields like medicine and science.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of U.S. House members has introduced the Restore Trust in Congress Act, a new bill aimed at banning members of Congress, their spouses, and dependent children from owning or trading individual stocks. The legislation combines several previous proposals and is supported by lawmakers across the political spectrum, from conservative Republicans to progressive Democrats. Supporters argue the ban is essential to eliminate conflicts of interest and address widespread public perception that lawmakers are profiting from their positions.</p>

          <p>An agreement has been reached in North Carolina that will keep approximately 98,000 voters on the registration rolls. The deal settles a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration's Department of Justice, which sought to force the state to remove voters who had not provided a driver's license or partial Social Security number. The negotiated settlement, driven by the Democratic National Committee and voting rights groups, allows these voters to provide the required information via a provisional ballot when they vote, thereby protecting their right to participate in elections.</p>
