          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries supports Elon Musk's description of President Trump's domestic policy bill as a "disgusting abomination," citing the bill's cuts to Medicaid and nutritional assistance. Jeffries criticizes the bill for taking healthcare from millions and cutting food programs for vulnerable populations to provide tax breaks for billionaires. Musk's criticism focuses on the bill's high cost, differing from Jeffries' focus on program cuts, but both oppose the legislation. Jeffries also highlights the "Republican civil war" as different factions within the GOP attack each other over the bill. The Democratic leader sees common ground with Musk in opposing the bill's impact on everyday Americans. The situation shows the widening gap between different factions within the government. The optimism score is related to the potential for bipartisan cooperation in addressing fiscal policy. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is preparing to end the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) "Quiet Skies" program, a domestic surveillance program for travelers. The program identifies travelers who could present an elevated risk to aviation security using various data points. Quiet Skies has faced criticism for tracking U.S. citizens not suspected of any crimes, raising concerns about privacy and civil liberties. The decision to end the program follows reports that the husband of a U.S. Senator was placed on the watchlist. It is unclear if Quiet Skies staff will be shifted to other roles within the administration.</p>

          <p>A Guatemalan man, identified as OCG, was flown back to the US after a judge ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return. OCG had been deported to Mexico despite fearing persecution there. The judge found that the deportation likely lacked due process. OCG, who is gay, had applied for asylum in the US after experiencing homophobic violence in Guatemala. The Trump administration admitted to an "error" in falsely claiming that OCG was not afraid of being returned to Mexico. The legal battle highlights the challenges faced by asylum seekers.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to give more than 100 Venezuelan men sent to a supermax prison in El Salvador a chance to contest their deportation. The judge found that the men had been "plainly deprived" of their due process rights. The Trump administration has argued that the 1798 Alien Enemies Act allows the government to summarily deport Venezuelans identified as gang members. The judge expressed concerns about the government's claims that all the deportees are gangsters. The ruling is a victory for civil rights advocates.</p>

          <p>The fungus labeled a "potential agroterrorism weapon" in a recent arrest is likely native to North America and widely prevalent in the U.S., according to a researcher. Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu were charged with trying to smuggle strains of Fusarium graminearum into the United States. F. graminearum is a common cause of Fusarium head blight or head scab in crops. The incident raises questions about the actual threat posed by the smuggled fungus.
