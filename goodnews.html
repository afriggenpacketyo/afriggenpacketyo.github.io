          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 14:05:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) must consider new strategies to maximize their earnings. Simply allowing a CD to roll over could lock in a significantly lower rate than previously enjoyed. This article outlines three viable options: moving funds to a high-yield savings account for flexibility, opting for a money market account which combines high rates with checking features, or reinvesting in a new long-term CD to secure a fixed rate against future market changes. Each choice presents a trade-off between rate security and access to funds in the current economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot reaching $1.8 billion, the second-largest in U.S. history, has created a significant business boom for lottery courier services like Jackpocket, which is owned by DraftKings. The company reported a 130% day-over-day increase in ticket sales on its platform, which fulfills lottery orders for customers in 16 states for a fee. This surge highlights the lucrative nature of lottery courier services, which DraftKings acquired to cross-sell customers into its primary sports betting and iGaming offerings. The massive jackpot's popularity demonstrates a powerful revenue driver for companies operating in the digital lottery space.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell significantly to 6.29%, its largest one-day drop in over a year, in direct response to a weaker-than-expected August employment report. This sharp decrease offers potential relief to homebuyers who have been facing rates in the high 6% range for months, potentially lowering monthly payments by a noticeable amount. However, it remains uncertain if this drop will be substantial enough to reinvigorate the housing market, as high home prices and economic uncertainty continue to sideline many prospective buyers. Analysts suggest rates may need to fall into the 5% range to truly spur a recovery in mortgage demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Newsmax's antitrust lawsuit against Fox News just two days after it was filed, citing it as an impermissible "shotgun pleading." The dismissal is technical, as Judge Aileen Cannon noted that several counts improperly incorporated all preceding allegations, making the complaint structurally flawed. Newsmax has been granted until the following Thursday to file an amended complaint that corrects these procedural issues. The original lawsuit accused Fox News of monopolistic practices and using intimidation tactics to suppress competition in the conservative media landscape, seeking damages and an injunction against such conduct.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 13:21:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As part of a heightened counter-narcotics effort named Operation Pacific Viper, the U.S. Coast Guard has seized more than 40,000 pounds of cocaine in the Eastern Pacific Ocean over the past month. The operations resulted in over a dozen interceptions and the apprehension of 36 suspected drug smugglers. This surge in enforcement aims to disrupt cartels and criminal organizations by cutting off drug and human smuggling routes from South America before they reach U.S. shores. The agency released images from the operations, including one of a burning vessel that had been intercepted, underscoring the dramatic nature of these at-sea interdictions.</p>

          <p>A new image from the International Gemini Observatory in Chile shows the expanding tail of comet 3I/ATLAS, the third-known interstellar object to travel through our solar system. The photograph, captured on August 27, reveals that the comet's coma and tail are significantly more extended than in previous images, indicating it has become more active as it approaches the sun. Scientists are studying the light spectrum from the comet to learn more about its chemical composition and how it changes during its journey. The rare visitor poses no threat to Earth and is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October.</p>

          <h2>Author Lauren Grodstein Reflects on Lessons from Georgian Protests for American Democracy</h2>

          <p>In an article for The Atlantic, novelist Lauren Grodstein shares how witnessing mass protests in Tbilisi, Georgia, reshaped her understanding of democratic resistance. She was struck by the protesters' perseverance against a repressive, pro-Russian government, even when they felt their efforts might be futile. This experience, Grodstein writes, highlighted uncomfortable parallels with the current political climate in the United States and forced her to question her own daily accommodations to government priorities. She concludes that the fight for democracy is a long-term commitment, and the actions of Georgian citizens offer a powerful lesson on when to put oneself on the line for core principles.</p>

          <h2>Winning the $1.8 Billion Powerball Jackpot Comes with a Substantial Tax Obligation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 12:38:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The winner of the estimated $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot will face a significant tax bill, substantially reducing the final take-home amount. If the winner chooses the $826.4 million lump-sum cash option, there is a mandatory 24% federal withholding, immediately cutting the prize by nearly $200 million. However, the total federal tax rate for such a high income is 37%, meaning millions more will be owed to the IRS at tax time. State taxes can further reduce the winnings, with rates varying from over 10% in some states to zero in others, making the winner's location a key factor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The city of Norwalk, California, has agreed to repeal a controversial local law that banned the development of homeless shelters, settling a lawsuit brought by the state's attorney general. The state had sued the Los Angeles County community, arguing the ban was discriminatory and violated fair housing laws. As part of the settlement, Norwalk will also dedicate $250,000 toward new affordable housing and accept increased state monitoring of its housing policies. State officials said the outcome demonstrates their resolve to challenge local governments that attempt to block necessary housing and services for homeless residents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of Powerball data provides insights into the historic $1.8 billion jackpot, highlighting the long odds and how a winner's location impacts their payout. The odds of winning the grand prize are 1 in 292.2 million, and the current run of 42 consecutive drawings without a winner is a new record. After federal taxes, a winner's take-home amount varies significantly by state due to differing state income tax laws on lottery prizes. For example, winners in states like California and Florida, which do not tax lottery winnings, would receive a much larger payout than a winner in New York, which has the highest tax rate.</p>

          <h2>Determining a Sufficient Monthly Retirement Income in 2025 Depends on Lifestyle and Location</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts suggest that a "good" monthly retirement income is typically 75% to 85% of one's pre-retirement earnings, but this figure varies greatly based on individual circumstances. While the average U.S. retiree spends around $5,000 per month, the median retirement income is closer to $3,900, indicating many rely on less. Factors like geographic location, lifestyle choices, and unexpected healthcare costs are crucial in determining an adequate amount. To supplement Social Security, this article suggests strategies like purchasing annuities for a guaranteed income stream, utilizing a reverse mortgage for home equity, or optimizing Social Security benefits by delaying claims.
