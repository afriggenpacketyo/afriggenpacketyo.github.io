          <h2>Eagles' Saquon Barkley Argues a Few NFL Teams Devalued Running Back Contracts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 16:36:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley has suggested that the recent trend of undervaluing players in his position is a narrative deliberately created by a few NFL franchises to lower salaries. He believes that after a handful of running backs received large contracts and subsequently got injured, teams began using this as a pretext to offer cheaper deals. Barkley contrasted this with the treatment of other positions, such as wide receivers, who often secure large contracts into their 30s without facing similar league-wide valuation questions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is considering a petition from the DEA to review and potentially loosen federal restrictions on psilocybin, the psychoactive compound in 'magic mushrooms.' The proposal involves reclassifying psilocybin from a Schedule I to a less restrictive Schedule II narcotic, which would acknowledge its medical value while still recognizing its potential for abuse. This potential shift at the federal level comes after multiple efforts to legalize its therapeutic use have failed in states like California, signaling a possible change in national drug policy.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, is moving away from the North Carolina coast after bringing tropical storm conditions and dangerous surf to the Outer Banks. Although the hurricane is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., authorities have warned of life-threatening rip currents along most of the East Coast and have issued evacuation orders for parts of the Outer Banks due to storm surge. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that Erin will gradually weaken over the next few days and is expected to become a post-tropical storm by Saturday.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As U.S. credit card debt surpasses $1.2 trillion, debt forgiveness programs are becoming a key option for struggling consumers, though not everyone qualifies. Eligibility this September is primarily aimed at individuals with substantial unsecured debts, typically over $7,500, and those experiencing verifiable financial hardship such as job loss or medical emergencies. Borrowers who are already delinquent on their payments are also prime candidates, as creditors are more willing to negotiate a settlement to recover a portion of the debt rather than risk a total loss through bankruptcy.

          <p>A New York state appeals court has voided the massive monetary fine, which had grown to over $500 million, imposed on Donald Trump and his company in their civil business fraud case. The court ruled that the penalty was unconstitutionally excessive, although it upheld the underlying verdict that Trump and his associates committed fraud by inflating asset values. This decision is a significant financial victory for Trump, but the nonmonetary sanctions, such as restrictions on his business operations, remain in place while the state's attorney general plans to appeal the ruling.

          <p>New research indicates that 44% of American adults are now ordering meals from restaurant kids' menus, primarily to save money and manage portion sizes amid economic pressures. This trend coincides with reports from major chains like McDonald's and Wendy's of slowing sales, particularly among low-income consumers. Diners are drawn to the lower prices and simpler options on kids' menus, highlighting a broader consumer shift towards value-seeking behaviors as the cost of eating out continues to rise.</p>

          <p>The rapid growth of data centers, driven by AI and other technologies, is creating a critical shortage of skilled trade workers such as electricians, plumbers, and HVAC technicians. As older workers retire and fewer young people enter these fields, data centers find themselves competing with other industries for a shrinking labor pool, threatening their ability to maintain 24/7 operations. Industry experts suggest that while new technology can improve efficiency, a more robust pipeline of apprentices and new recruits is needed to fill the estimated 400,000 currently unfilled trade jobs.</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates trending downward and a potential Federal Reserve rate cut on the horizon, financial experts are advising homeowners with high-interest loans to prepare for refinancing. They recommend proactive steps such as checking credit reports for inaccuracies, protecting credit scores by avoiding new debt, and gathering necessary documents like proof of income and insurance.

          <p>The construction of a new $3 billion biologics manufacturing plant in North Carolina by Fujifilm illustrates the lengthy and complex process of onshoring pharmaceutical production. The project, which took five years to reach its initial opening, shows why drugmakers cannot quickly shift their supply chains to the U.S. to avoid potential tariffs threatened by the Trump administration. While recent policy changes have made domestic production more attractive, the timeline for building and getting regulatory approval for such advanced facilities means companies are making long-term strategic investments rather than short-term tariff-dodging maneuvers.

          <p>Chipotle is launching a pilot program for autonomous drone delivery in the Dallas area through a partnership with Zipline. Select customers can opt for 'Zipotle' delivery via the Zipline app, where an aircraft will fly to their location and lower the order to the ground using a small robot. This initiative aims to enhance the delivery experience and could appeal to Chipotle's younger consumer base, who are more inclined to use delivery services. The test will help determine the feasibility of a broader national expansion of drone delivery for the restaurant chain.</p>
