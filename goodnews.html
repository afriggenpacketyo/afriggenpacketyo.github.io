          <p>Shares of U.S.-listed companies involved in the rare earth minerals supply chain experienced a notable increase in premarket trading. This surge follows an announcement from the U.S. Treasury that the government plans to set a price floor for these critical minerals to combat market manipulation by China, which currently dominates global production. Investors are speculating on which domestic firms will benefit from this industrial policy, aimed at reducing American reliance on China for materials essential to technology and electric vehicles.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the current high-interest-rate environment, home equity products offer a comparatively affordable borrowing option for homeowners with significant equity. As of mid-October 2025, the average rate for a home equity line of credit (HELOC) is 7.84%, while 10-year home equity loans average 8.30%. These rates are considerably lower than those for personal loans or credit cards. The article explains the differences between fixed-rate home equity loans and variable-rate HELOCs, noting that rates could potentially decrease if the Federal Reserve implements further cuts.

          <p>Despite a U.S. government shutdown, the 74 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits will continue to get their monthly checks on schedule. This is because the program's funding is classified as mandatory spending and is not subject to annual congressional appropriations. However, the Social Security Administration's operational budget is affected, which could disrupt other services. A shutdown may lead to furloughs and the temporary halt of services such as benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and the issuance of replacement Medicare cards.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates have seen some relief in 2025, falling from nearly 7% to the mid-6% range due to a Federal Reserve rate cut and other economic factors. Experts believe rates will be heavily influenced by inflation and labor market data in the coming months. Projections from the Mortgage Bankers Association and Fannie Mae suggest that the average 30-year rate will likely hold steady around 6.5% for the remainder of the year. However, a further drop below 6% is considered possible if economic growth slows and inflation remains subdued. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Columbia University psychologist Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic argues that mastering specific social skills is more crucial for career success than simply "being yourself." He identifies high emotional intelligence as a fundamental currency in the workplace, making individuals more employable and effective. The three essential skills he highlights are being genuinely receptive to critical feedback, cultivating strong social awareness by focusing on others' perspectives, and demonstrating adaptability by willingly stepping out of one's comfort zone to learn and grow. These abilities help close the gap between self-perception and actual performance.</p>

          <p>As of October 2025, the price of gold is approximately $4,263.85 per ounce, though its value is in constant flux due to a variety of market forces. The article explains that the price of this precious metal is influenced by supply and demand, global economic conditions, and its role as a hedge against inflation. Other key factors include interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty, and the strength of the U.S. dollar, all of which contribute to gold's status as a safe-haven asset for investors during turbulent times.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's soybean imports surged in September, driven by increased purchases from South American countries, particularly Brazil, which accounted for over 85% of the total. This shift comes as imports from the United States, traditionally a top supplier, have reportedly fallen to zero amid ongoing trade tensions. The realignment in agricultural trade reflects China's strategy to diversify its suppliers and reduce reliance on the U.S. market. This trend is expected to continue as China seeks to secure its food supply chain in the face of geopolitical uncertainties.</p>

The feature, which is integrated into Apple's latest operating systems, is currently unavailable on the mainland due to local regulatory requirements for AI models. Reports suggest that Apple may partner with a Chinese company, such as Alibaba, to use a locally approved AI model to comply with regulations.

          <p>Financial commentator Jim Cramer has issued a strong warning against investing in "meme stocks," calling the practice an "easy road to disaster." He describes trading highly volatile stocks like GameStop as a "musical chairs game" based on the "greater fool" theory, where investors buy overpriced assets hoping to sell them to someone else at a higher price. Cramer advises against this short-term speculative approach, instead advocating for long-term ownership of fundamentally sound, best-of-breed companies that can compound wealth over time.

This move comes after Cooper recently lowered its full-year revenue outlook, citing weaker demand in certain markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The act of "ghosting," or abruptly ending communication without explanation, has become a common yet emotionally complex part of modern life. This cultural analysis explores the paradox of how ghosting can be both a banal, expected occurrence and a deeply hurtful one. The article suggests that in an "overly social world," the ease of digital disengagement can dehumanize others. However, it also posits that ghosting can sometimes stem from a ghoster's own complicated feelings or even be a misguided attempt to be merciful by avoiding a direct, painful rejection.</p>

          <p>Europe has become a key battleground for the global autonomous driving industry, with several Chinese tech startups expanding their trials and partnerships across the continent. This pivot toward Europe is driven by U.S. restrictions on Chinese AI technologies and offers an opportunity for China to influence global standards in data, safety, and AI ethics. As Chinese firms like WeRide and Baidu's Apollo Go integrate into Europe's automotive ecosystem, they are not only competing for market share but are also central to the continent's debate over technological sovereignty and geopolitical influence.</p>

          <p>A revolutionary eye implant has allowed a group of blind patients to read again in a life-changing international clinical trial. The procedure involves inserting a tiny 2mm-square microchip under the retina of patients with geographic atrophy, an advanced form of dry age-related macular degeneration. Patients wear special glasses with a camera that sends video images to the implant, which then transmits signals to the brain. A surgeon at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, where five patients received the implant, called the results "astounding" and a major advance in restoring meaningful vision.</p>
