          <p>South Korea's presidential candidates are set to engage in their first televised debate, focusing on strategies to revitalize the nation's struggling economy. According to Yahoo News, the debate comes ahead of a snap election triggered by the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol. Lee Jae-myung, the leading candidate, has pledged to increase investment in artificial intelligence and offer tax credits for domestic semiconductor manufacturing, while Kim Moon-soo, the conservative candidate, plans to create a government agency dedicated to regulatory innovation and increased research and development spending.</p>

          <p>A hiker who went missing for weeks in California's Sierra Nevada mountains recounted her survival story, explaining that she was trapped by an avalanche and sustained herself on wild leeks and snowmelt. CBS News reports that Tiffany Slaton, a nutritionist, was immobilized by a fall but managed to find wild leeks and boil snowmelt for sustenance. Slaton, who had lost her tent and sleeping bags, credited her foraging skills for her survival until she was found in a cabin by the owner of a nearby resort.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Rwandan refugees, who fled to Congo after the 1994 genocide, have returned home following the seizure of key regions by Rwandan-backed rebels. NPR reports that the repatriation, facilitated by the U.N. refugee agency, involves mostly women and children who have lived in exile for decades. The returnees will receive assistance and support for reintegration, marking a significant step in resolving the humanitarian crisis in the region. The repatriation is based on a tripartite agreement between Rwanda, Congo, and UNHCR, with over 101,000 refugees already repatriated.</p>

          <p>Britain and the European Union are set to convene for a summit in London, signaling a potential new era of cooperation amidst a changing global landscape. The meeting is expected to yield a defense and security agreement aimed at strengthening European military security, particularly given the United States' evolving commitment to the continent. According to the New York Times article, while economic cooperation is also on the agenda, disagreements persist over fishing rights and youth travel programs. The article emphasizes the broader theme of the summit: how to navigate a world where the United States is assuming a less prominent role.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's military is working to recruit more women as it faces a shortage of soldiers, but sexism remains a significant obstacle, according to female soldiers and activists. The New York Times article profiles Lieutenant Kateryna, the only female combat pilot in the Ukrainian military, who faces skepticism and stereotypes despite her skills and dedication. While the number of women in the armed forces has increased, they remain underutilized and marginalized due to deeply rooted stereotypes among male commanders. The article highlights Kateryna's determination to inspire more women to pursue combat roles and challenge traditional gender norms within the military.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers say they have developed a ‚Äúgroundbreaking‚Äù fibre-optic gyroscope that is stable across a large temperature range and can be used for navigation. According to the team from the Tianjin Navigation Instruments Research Institute and Jinan University, the gyroscope could offer a more stable way to measure navigation for aircraft, ships and oil rigs. Those navigation systems allow for the measurement of vehicles without the need for external signals like satellites. That makes them immune to interference, which is vital for military and security applications.</p>

          <p>High-demand concerts and music festivals in China are prompting fans to travel across the country, boosting tourism spending. According to the South China Morning Post, local governments are capitalizing on this trend by bundling concert tickets with discounted hotel, dining, and tourist bookings to encourage greater consumption. This strategy aligns with Beijing's economic agenda to promote domestic consumption amid trade tensions and aims to provide unique, once-in-a-lifetime experiences for concertgoers. Some fans are receiving discounts to popular tourist destinations when they show their concert tickets.</p>

          <p>When tickets for comedian Jimmy O. Yang‚Äôs June shows in Hong Kong sold out within seconds, fans flooded social media to lament how tough it was to get a seat. While some scrambled for resale tickets ‚Äì complete with heavy mark-up ‚Äì others outside the city found it easier to buy travel packages that included airport transfers and guaranteed bookings. Similarly, when British rock band Coldplay performed at Kai Tak Stadium in April, many travelling fans secured their spots by purchasing bundles with concert tickets and hotel stays. With domestic consumption high on Beijing‚Äôs economic agenda this year as trade tensions make export growth less reliable, local governments are bundling spots at popular shows with discounted hotel, dining and tourist bookings to encourage people to buy more than a ticket.</p>

BBC News reports that Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood aims to expand unpaid work programs, collaborating with local councils and private companies to assign jobs to offenders. The money earned from this labor would be allocated to a fund for victim support groups. The move comes amid prison overcrowding issues, with the goal of making punishment more meaningful and beneficial to society.</p>
