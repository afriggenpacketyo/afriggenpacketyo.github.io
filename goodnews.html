          <p>An Altoona, Iowa warehouse is providing temporary relief to importers from tariff volatility through bonded warehousing, which allows companies to hold imported goods without immediate payment of customs duties. This strategy is gaining popularity as companies, especially those importing from China, seek to manage funds more effectively amid fluctuating trade policies. Bonded warehouses, overseen by the U.S. Port Authority, offer cost certainty and improved cash flow by deferring tariff payments until goods leave the warehouse. Iowa's economy, being a production state, is significantly impacted by tariff policies, making bonded warehouses a valuable tool for local businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An electric passenger plane made history by landing at John F. Kennedy International Airport for the first time, carrying four passengers from East Hampton. The flight, operated by Beta Technologies, covered 70 nautical miles in just over half an hour, demonstrating the practicality and efficiency of electric air travel. The use of electric aircraft offers benefits such as reduced noise pollution and lower operating costs, potentially revolutionizing short-distance travel. The FAA has also finalized new rules for pilot training and certification for air taxis, paving the way for wider adoption of electric air travel.</p>

          <p>An NPR interview with Evan Osnos, author of "The Haves and Have-Yachts: Dispatches on the Ultrarich," explores the lifestyle and mindset of the ultra-wealthy in America. Osnos discusses the ambivalence Americans have towards money, the extravagance of gigayachts (luxury boats the length of a football field), and the rise of doomsday preppers in Silicon Valley. He highlights the growing disparity between the ultra-rich and the rest of the country, suggesting that the pursuit of extreme wealth reflects a culture of excess and insatiable desire.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have committed $1 million to provide financial assistance to immigrant families impacted by recent immigration raids in the region. The organization is partnering with the City of Los Angeles and local community groups to offer food and mental health services. This pledge follows heightened tensions between the city and federal immigration authorities, with the Dodgers denying ICE access to their parking lots, a claim ICE disputed. The move reflects a broader effort in Los Angeles to support immigrant communities amid increased federal enforcement.</p>

          <p>The author reflects on Clayton Kershaw's near-perfect no-hitter game, using baseball's acceptance of failure as a metaphor for life's imperfections. The essay contrasts the desire for perfection with the reality that failure is a common and necessary part of growth and success. It highlights the importance of grace, humility, and courage in the face of loss, drawing parallels to Lou Gehrig's response to his terminal illness. The author praises Kershaw's supportive reaction to a teammate's error, emphasizing the value of embracing imperfections with a positive attitude.</p>

          <p>While California Governor Gavin Newsom has garnered praise for his nationally televised speech criticizing President Trump, it's premature to overstate his standing in the 2028 presidential race. Despite the strong reaction from Democrats, Newsom faces challenges including rampant homelessness, a budget deficit, and vast income inequality. The article argues that the fundamentals of the 2028 race remain unchanged, and Newsom's association with California's liberal politics could be a liability. The author also highlights the importance of the upcoming midterm elections in shaping the political landscape.</p>

          <p>The escalation of immigration raids in Los Angeles and the deployment of military forces have heightened fears among Latinos, potentially shifting their voting priorities. While economic issues have been a primary focus, perceived threats to the community can lead to a coalescence as an ethnic voting bloc. Recent events, such as the removal of Senator Alex Padilla from a press conference, exemplify how actions against immigrants can affect U.S.-born Latinos. The article suggests that Trump's immigration crackdown could negatively impact his support among Latino voters, as seen in past instances of heightened enforcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the increasing trend of self-managed medication abortion, where individuals obtain and use abortion pills without direct doctor supervision, and the changing views of medical professionals on its safety and efficacy. The FDA's loosening of restrictions on mifepristone during the pandemic and the overturning of Roe v. Wade have accelerated the adoption of this method. Studies show that self-managed abortion is safe and effective, leading organizations like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to support it. The trend is spreading through informal networks, but faces political challenges and potential restrictions.</p>
