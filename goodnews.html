          <p>Ukraine has demonstrated its ability to use relatively inexpensive drones to effectively target and destroy costly aircraft and strike locations far beyond its borders. This highlights Ukraine's innovative approach to modern warfare by leveraging drone technology to offset conventional military disadvantages. The success of these drone attacks underscores the evolving nature of conflict, where strategic deployment of unmanned systems can yield significant tactical advantages. This capability allows Ukraine to flip the script on how wars are waged, demonstrating resourcefulness and adaptability in the face of ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are reviewing safety protocols at Dodger Stadium after a Yankees fan was reportedly struck by a piece of concrete falling from the stadium ceiling during a game. Ricardo Aquino of Mexico City reported being hit in the back by a baseball-sized chunk of concrete while seated in the top deck. Following the incident, concrete netting was installed in the affected area, and the Dodgers are conducting a thorough examination of the facility to ensure its safety. The incident highlights the challenges of maintaining older stadiums, as Dodger Stadium opened in 1962 and underwent major renovations before the 2020 season.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that his government will accelerate legislation to fast-track ambitious national projects aimed at boosting Canada's economy in response to tariffs imposed by President Trump. The plan involves identifying key "nation-building" projects, such as pipelines, nuclear reactors, and trade corridors, and streamlining the approval process to under two years. The goal is to strengthen Canada's economy, autonomy, and resilience amidst trade threats from the U.S., which has imposed tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum, and its auto sector.

          <p>Dodgers shortstop Mookie Betts is likely to return to the lineup soon after recovering from a fractured toe, participating in pregame drills and showing no compromise in his swing. However, pitcher Tyler Glasnow is experiencing body discomfort after his first bullpen session since being placed on the injured list with shoulder inflammation, casting uncertainty on his return timeline. Glasnow's setback is only mildly surprising given his extensive injury history, and he remains frustrated with the non-linear progress of his recovery. Blake Snell is making good progress, while Roki Sasaki and Shohei Ohtani continue their throwing programs.</p>
