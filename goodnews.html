          <p>NASA's 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter captured a unique image of Arsia Mons, a 12-mile-high Martian volcano, piercing through clouds at dawn. This marks the first time a volcano on Mars has been imaged on the planet's horizon, providing new insights into the Martian atmosphere. The image, taken on May 2, reveals a cloud canopy across the Red Planet's equator and seasonal differences in the atmosphere. Scientists are using these images to study how Mars' atmosphere evolves over time, contributing to a better understanding of the planet's climate and weather patterns.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance characterized Elon Musk's recent attacks against Donald Trump as a "huge mistake" stemming from frustration. Vance acknowledged Musk's criticisms of Trump's tax cuts and spending bill but suggested that the president was being restrained in his response. Despite Musk's call for Trump's impeachment and unsubstantiated claims about Jeffrey Epstein, Vance defended Trump and expressed hope that Musk would eventually return to being an ally. The comments highlight the efforts to manage the fallout from the public dispute between two influential figures in Republican circles.</p>

          <p>The Klamath River is experiencing a rebirth after the removal of four hydroelectric dams, marking the largest project of its kind in US history. The dam removal, forged through decades of campaigning by tribes, environmental groups, and fishing advocates, has unleashed roughly 45 continuous miles of river. This has created new opportunities for recreation and ecological restoration, with over 2,800 acres of land being returned to the Shasta Indian Nation.
