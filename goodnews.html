          <p>Samsung Electronics has announced a major long-term contract worth $16.5 billion to supply semiconductors to an undisclosed company. The deal, effective from July 2024 through the end of 2033, caused Samsung's shares to rise over 2% in early trading. The identity of the counterparty is being kept confidential at their request to protect trade secrets. This significant contract comes as Samsung's foundry business, which manufactures chips for other companies, has been working to catch up with competitors like TSMC and SK Hynix, particularly in the high-demand area of AI-related memory chips.

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service took an individual into custody after they climbed a fence at the U.S. Treasury Building, adjacent to the White House, and dropped a suspicious bag. The incident prompted a response from the Metropolitan Police Department’s Explosive Ordnance Disposal team, who cleared the item without issue. The suspect was transported for a medical evaluation and will face charges for unlawful entry and a separate fugitive from justice warrant.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has successfully shut down four dark web sites dedicated to the distribution of child sexual abuse material as part of "Operation Grayskull." The investigation, which began in 2020, dismantled a network that had over 120,000 members and housed millions of illicit files. The operation has led to the conviction of at least 18 individuals who led or utilized the sites, including a man described as one of the world's most significant purveyors of such material. Officials called the takedown one of the most successful prosecutions of its kind, disrupting a sophisticated and sadistic online community.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Shenzhen, China's technology hub, have introduced new rules mandating leniency for researchers and innovators whose state-funded projects fail to meet their goals. The policy states that individuals and units should not be punished or have their future funding prospects affected if failures are due to reasonable issues like technical difficulties or market changes, provided there was no misconduct. The move is designed to encourage bold exploration in uncharted scientific and technological territories. The goal is to foster a culture that is more tolerant of risk and to avoid penalizing genuine, good-faith research efforts that do not succeed.</p>

          <p>Leaders across Europe have reacted to the newly announced trade deal with the United States, which sets a 15% tariff on most European goods. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni called the agreement "positive" for ensuring stability, while Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin noted it would help protect jobs, despite making trade more expensive. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz welcomed the deal for averting a worse trade conflict that would have harmed Germany's export-focused economy. While the 15% tariff is a compromise from the EU's initial goal of zero tariffs, leaders appear to view it as a sustainable outcome.</p>

Real estate agents report that a majority of recent buyers are from the United States, with many citing political and social volatility as a key motivator.

Some archaeologists suggest the Tamil Brahmi script found there predates the northern Ashokan Brahmi script.
