          <p>A Macau-based conglomerate, HN Group, is developing a luxury senior housing project in Zhuhai's Hengqin district, aiming to attract affluent retirees from Hong Kong. Serensia Woods, a 13,500-square-meter retirement community, will feature a hotel, residential towers, wellness centers, and a spa. The project seeks to capitalize on the limited high-end retirement options available in Hong Kong, where most seniors live at home without guaranteed professional care. With Hong Kong's aging population expected to increase significantly, the development aims to provide a high-quality lifestyle for retirees with the financial means. The average price at Serensia Woods starts at HK$10 million, reflecting its focus on the luxury market.</p>

          <p>Following the Noto Peninsula earthquake, Japan is re-evaluating its disaster preparedness, particularly regarding sanitation. The earthquake exposed the vulnerability of sewage systems, leading to unsanitary conditions and the term 'toilet panic.' Experts emphasize the importance of maintaining sanitary toilets during disasters to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Efforts are underway to educate children on using portable toilets, addressing a lack of knowledge that exacerbated the situation in Noto. The government is also urged to stockpile portable toilets and ensure their availability in evacuation centers to avoid unhygienic conditions and protect public health.</p>

          <p>European startup founders are pushing back against pressure to adopt China's grueling '996' work culture, which involves working from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. Venture capitalists have sparked debate by suggesting that Europe needs to embrace overwork to compete globally. However, many European founders and VCs argue that this 'fetishization of overwork' is a myth and that sustainable innovation cultures are more effective. They emphasize the importance of work-life balance, worker rights, and access to funding and resources over simply increasing working hours. Ultimately, they believe Europe's startup ecosystem needs stronger funding and resources, not just longer hours, to thrive.</p>

          <p>AI scientist De Kai proposes a new approach to artificial intelligence, suggesting that AI systems should be 'parented' rather than viewed as tools in a technological arms race. In his new book, De Kai argues that AI learns by absorbing online content, so humans must be conscientious about their behavior around AI systems. He suggests that treating AI like children can inspire people to become better role models. This concept aims to ensure that AI development aligns with positive human values and avoids potential negative consequences.</p>
