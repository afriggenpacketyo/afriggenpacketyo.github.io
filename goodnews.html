          <p>A group of friends who had been playing Dungeons & Dragons together for 30 years ended their weekly gatherings in 2020 due to political disagreements. Two of the players discussed the impact of politics on their long-standing game with StoryCorps. The players cited increasing polarization and differing views on social and political issues as the primary reasons for the game's dissolution. The article illustrates how even long-term friendships can be strained by the divisive nature of contemporary politics. The event is unfortunate, but the circumstances are relatively stable given the lack of death or injury.</p>

          <p>Small business owners express relief and hope as courts rule that President Trump overstepped his authority in ordering tariffs, but they remain uncertain about receiving refunds. The White House vows to appeal, leaving businesses in limbo, hesitant to make more or ship more, unsure where to build factories or how high to raise prices. Some businesses had stockpiled goods to prepare for tariffs, while others canceled orders. The legal battles and potential for continued tariffs create instability for small businesses. This is an unfortunate situation for the business owners, but it is stable given the lack of death or injury.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump should maintain a tough stance on tariffs against the European Union to address the growing trade deficit. The author contends that the EU has historically engaged in protectionism, disadvantaging American products, and that the U.S. deserves reciprocal treatment. The article suggests that the EU will likely resist making substantial concessions, necessitating the imposition of tariffs to force a fairer trade relationship. The author argues this is a matter of economic security and gratitude for America's historical contributions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is enabling individuals without formal training to write software through a process called "vibe coding." Chloe Samaha and her partner used AI chatbots to create a working version of their online productivity manager in less than a day. The term "vibe coding" was coined by OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy, referring to the way people are now instructing AI to write code without checking it line by line. Experts predict AI coding will radically change the software industry, with AI coders, project managers, and designers becoming commonplace. The progress is promising for the world of technology.</p>

          <p>Google and the Justice Department have concluded closing arguments in a historic tech monopoly case, with the judge set to decide on remedies. The DOJ is pushing for aggressive measures, including the sale of Chrome and licensing of core search technology, while Google argues these are too severe. The case focuses on Google's contracts with device makers and its potential monopoly in artificial intelligence. Google argues that the proposed remedies would hurt consumers and innovation, while the DOJ aims to prevent Google from establishing exclusive distribution agreements for its AI programs.

The charity is calling for these muddy, tidal habitats to be added to the official UK inventory of how much carbon is emitted and how much is removed from our atmosphere every year. This formal recognition could provide more of an incentive to restore and protect more of these sites. The UK has lost about 85% of its saltmarshes since 1860.
