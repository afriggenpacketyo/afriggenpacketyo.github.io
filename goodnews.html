          <p>Shares of USA Rare Earth experienced a significant jump in after-hours trading following comments from CEO Barbara Humpton confirming the company is in "close communication" with the Trump administration. This development comes after the administration has recently taken equity stakes in other critical mineral companies like Lithium Americas and MP Materials. The investments are part of a broader government strategy to bolster the domestic rare earth supply chain and reduce U.S. dependence on China for these essential materials. The company is developing a mine in Texas and a magnet production facility in Oklahoma. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California's Department of Motor Vehicles has begun issuing newly redesigned driver's licenses and identification cards featuring updated aesthetics and enhanced security measures. The new design replaces previous imagery with scenes of California's redwoods, poppies, and coastline. Key security upgrades include a first-in-the-nation digital signature embedded in a barcode on the back of the card and the removal of the old magnetic strip to combat counterfeiting. Officials have clarified that existing licenses remain valid until their expiration date, so there is no immediate need for residents to obtain the new version.</p>

Although his international play has him in good shape, both Doncic and the team are taking a slower approach to prevent potential injuries ahead of the long NBA season. Teammates have praised his high basketball IQ and creativity on the court during early practices. Coach JJ Redick has emphasized the importance of being in top physical and mental condition, implementing strenuous conditioning drills to prepare the team for a championship run.</p>

Participants live and work on the world's largest thoroughbred horse farm, where caring for the animals provides structure, purpose, and a therapeutic connection. The yearlong, 12-step program is free for participants and also addresses a labor shortage in the horse industry by training them for careers in horsemanship. Co-founded by individuals in recovery themselves, the program has shown promising results, with a high sobriety rate among its graduates who find new lives and careers.</p>

          <h2>Pfizer Agrees to Lower U.S. Drug Prices Following Tariff Threats from Trump</h2>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has agreed to a deal with the Trump administration to lower the prices of its drugs in the United States, aligning them with the lower costs charged in other developed nations. This concession, a long-standing goal of President Trump, was reportedly secured after the administration threatened to impose 100% tariffs on drug companies that do not manufacture some products domestically. As part of the agreement, Pfizer will also participate in a new website, TrumpRx, offering certain drugs at steep discounts. While the immediate impact on consumers is still unclear, the deal marks a significant break in the pharmaceutical industry's united front against such pricing policies.</p>

          <h2>A Historical Look at the Rise of College Rankings in America</h2>

          <p>An essay in The Atlantic explores the history of university rankings, tracing their evolution from controversial, informal lists in the early 20th century to the influential cultural force they are today. Early attempts, like a 1911 federal report, were suppressed after causing outrage among unranked institutions. By the 1980s, as college became a mass-consumer good, publications like U.S. News & World Report capitalized on institutional anxiety and consumer demand to create a rankings juggernaut. The article notes how these lists have shaped public perception and the American meritocracy, reflecting and sometimes reinforcing societal biases over objective measures of educational quality.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: China's Economy Is Restructuring, Not Collapsing, Thanks to New Entrepreneurs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 17:30:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that viewing China's economy solely through a lens of stagnation misses a profound transformation driven by a new generation of entrepreneurs. Unlike their predecessors, this cohort of business leaders, born in the 1960s to 1980s, is technically trained and focused on innovation and co-creation. These entrepreneurs, often from business-centric provinces like Zhejiang and Guangdong, are blending their experience of past scarcity with modern market opportunities. This dynamic is fostering a competitive restructuring of the economy, suggesting resilience and continued integration into global systems rather than an impending collapse.</p>

          <p>A team of divers from a shipwreck salvage company has discovered over 1,000 gold and silver coins worth an estimated $1 million off the coast of Florida. The treasure is from a Spanish fleet that was wrecked by a hurricane in 1715 while transporting the fortune back to Spain. The coins, believed to have been minted in Spanish colonies in present-day Bolivia, Mexico, and Peru, are remarkably well-preserved, with some still showing visible dates and mint marks. The find is considered extraordinary, offering a tangible link to the history of the Spanish empire's golden age.</p>

          <p>A feature essay delves into the history and spiritual practices of Lucumí, also known as Santería, an Afro-Caribbean religion developed by enslaved West Africans in Cuba as an act of survival and resistance. The article aims to demystify the tradition, explaining that it emphasizes balance, character, and connection to deities called orishas, which are tied to nature. Scholars argue that the religion is often misunderstood and demonized as "witchcraft" due to anti-Black prejudice, while its core tenets focus on healing and community well-being. The piece addresses and contextualizes controversial aspects like animal sacrifice, framing them within a system of holistic spiritual health.</p>
