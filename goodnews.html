          <p>Five senior executives from RCI Hospitality Holdings, a publicly traded company operating strip clubs, have been indicted in New York for an alleged multi-million-dollar tax fraud and bribery scheme. The indictment, announced by Attorney General Letitia James, claims the executives bribed a state tax auditor with complimentary trips and private dances to avoid over $8 million in taxes. The scheme allegedly involved the company's CEO, CFO, and other top managers, leading to a significant drop in RCI's stock price following the announcement. The company and the indicted individuals deny the allegations and intend to defend themselves in court.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has once again extended the deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. operations, pushing the date to December 16th. This fourth extension comes as a framework deal is reportedly being finalized, which would see an investor consortium including Oracle and Silver Lake take ownership of the U.S. business. The agreement aims to address national security concerns that the Chinese government could access American user data or manipulate content. Under the proposed structure, existing U.S. users would need to migrate to a new application, and the deal is expected to close within the next 30 to 45 days.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce a quarter-percentage-point interest rate cut this week, a decision influenced by a softening labor market and significant political pressure from the White House. The meeting is notable for the inclusion of new Trump appointee Stephen Miran, who may dissent in favor of a more aggressive reduction. While markets have largely priced in the cut, the central bank's updated economic forecasts and Chair Jerome Powell's subsequent press conference will be closely watched for signals about the future direction of monetary policy.

          <p>Alphabet's autonomous vehicle subsidiary, Waymo, has received a permit to begin testing its robotaxi service at San Francisco International Airport (SFO). The company will roll out the service in phases, starting with employee testing where a human safety driver will be present, before eventually offering fully driverless rides to the public. This expansion marks a significant step for Waymo, which already operates in San Mateo County and San Francisco but previously lacked airport access. The move follows similar permits obtained for airports in Phoenix and San Jose, advancing the integration of autonomous ride-hailing into major transportation hubs.</p>

Manager Mikel Arteta praised the impact of his substitutes, adopting the rugby term "finishers" to describe their crucial role in changing the game's outcome. The win was particularly significant for Martinelli, who has recently faced criticism for a dip in form. Arteta expressed his strong support for the Brazilian winger, highlighting the team's spirit and the importance of squad depth as Arsenal navigates a season with key players sidelined by injury.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump have arrived in the United Kingdom for a three-day state visit, his second since 2019. The trip, hosted by King Charles III, will feature significant pageantry, including a formal welcome at Windsor Castle, a royal salute, and a state banquet. On Thursday, the president is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at Chequers for bilateral talks and a press conference. The visit is considered historically unusual, as second-term U.S. presidents are not typically offered a full state visit, highlighting the strategic importance of the UK-US relationship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has issued an executive order delaying the enforcement of a law that would effectively ban TikTok in the United States, marking the fourth such extension. The pause, which now lasts until December 16, coincides with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's announcement of a "framework" deal with China regarding the app's ownership. The bipartisan law requires TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations due to national security concerns. Despite the law's passage, the Trump administration has repeatedly used executive authority to prevent its enforcement, arguing it needs time to finalize a sale that protects U.S. interests.</p>

          <p>The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage has dropped to its lowest point since late 2022, falling to 6.13% on Tuesday. This sharp decline is attributed to investor anticipation of a widely expected interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its upcoming meeting. Market analysts suggest that investors in mortgage-backed bonds are buying in ahead of the Fed's announcement. However, some experts caution that this trend could reverse, noting historical patterns where long-term rates moved higher after the central bank implemented a cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a decades-long period of decline, the sun's activity has been unexpectedly increasing since 2008, according to a new NASA study. Scientists had previously predicted a prolonged phase of low activity, but recent data shows a reversal of this trend, indicating the "sun is slowly waking up." This uptick could lead to more frequent solar storms and flares, which have the potential to impact spacecraft, astronaut safety, and Earth-based technologies like power grids and GPS systems. The findings underscore the importance of space weather prediction, especially for upcoming missions like the Artemis campaign.</p>

The goal is to ensure the crucial waterway remains competitive amid shifting global trade patterns, particularly the rising export of liquefied petroleum gas from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Asia. Canal administrator Ricardo Vazquez Morales emphasized that without this new capacity, Panama risks losing business to rival routes. The announcement aims to bolster the canal's infrastructure to meet the projected doubling of demand for energy products over the next decade.</p>

          <p>The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Brian Mast, has withdrawn a controversial provision from a State Department reform bill that would have given the Secretary of State broad authority to revoke the passports of U.S. citizens. The measure would have allowed passport revocation for individuals determined to have provided "material support" to terrorist organizations, which civil liberties advocates warned could be used to target pro-Palestinian activists. Following widespread criticism, a committee spokesperson stated the provision was being removed to prevent it from overshadowing the bill's other bipartisan reform efforts. The amendment to remove the language requires committee approval.</p>
