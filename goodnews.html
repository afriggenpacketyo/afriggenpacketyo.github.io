          <p>Alibaba's mapping service, Amap, has launched a new AI-powered ranking feature called Amap Street Stars, drawing over 40 million users on its first day. The service uses artificial intelligence to rank and recommend 1.6 million destinations across mainland China, including restaurants, hotels, and tourist attractions. This move positions Amap as a key entry point for Alibaba's local lifestyle services, creating direct competition with Meituan's user review platform, Dianping. Analysts see this as a significant step in Alibaba's super-app strategy, integrating navigation with lifestyle recommendations similar to Google Maps' functionality in other markets.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), led by China, serves as a crucial stabilizing force in a faltering multilateral global system. The author argues that as institutions like the United Nations are increasingly sidelined by unilateralism and trade conflicts, the SCO offers a necessary alternative for governance. It is presented as a platform where countries with diverse cultures and political systems can cooperate effectively. The organization is framed as an embodiment of principles that counter global fragmentation by promoting negotiation over sanctions and tariffs, thereby addressing key ailments of the current international order.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To help parents navigate the common challenge of fussy eating in children, a child nutritionist has shared several practical tips. The advice emphasizes reducing pressure at mealtimes by allowing children to choose whether they eat and not labeling foods as 'good' or 'bad'. Instead, parents are encouraged to make meals enjoyable, be mindful of fluctuating appetites, and involve children in food preparation to foster familiarity. The expert suggests that giving children autonomy and focusing on a balanced, neutral approach to food can help improve their relationship with eating and make mealtimes less stressful for the entire family.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his eighth studio album, 'Play,' Ed Sheeran ventures into new sonic territories by incorporating Asian and Middle Eastern musical influences. The album is described as a response to a difficult personal period, aiming to create joy through cultural exploration with instruments like the sitar, tabla, and santoor. A notable track, 'Sapphire,' features a duet with Indian superstar Arjit Singh, blending English, Hindi, and Punjabi. While the album integrates these new sounds into Sheeran's signature pop style, some critics note it stops short of a deeper cultural fusion, maintaining a focus on accessible, mainstream appeal.</p>

          <p>Stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded higher, mirroring overnight gains on Wall Street where all three major U.S. indexes reached new record highs. Investor sentiment has been buoyed by easing inflation pressures and growing expectations of interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Key indexes in Japan, South Korea, and Australia all saw positive movement. This global equity rally is largely driven by momentum and the prospect of more accommodative monetary policies from central banks around the world. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's National Health Service is studying Denmark's successful cancer treatment model, which has significantly improved patient survival rates over the past 25 years. Denmark transformed its approach through major investments in diagnostic equipment like CT scanners, setting strict national standards for rapid diagnosis and treatment, and enhancing the overall patient experience. Key Danish policies include a two-week maximum wait for a diagnosis after referral and another two weeks to start treatment. UK policymakers, including the Health Secretary, believe that adopting aspects of this focused, long-term strategy could help improve cancer care outcomes in England.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has struck down an apartheid-era law, ruling that men now have the right to take their wives' family names upon marriage. The court found the previous legislation, which only permitted women to change their names, was discriminatory on the basis of gender and a "colonial import." The ruling gives the government two years to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act to reflect this change. The landmark case was brought by two couples who sued the Department of Home Affairs, challenging the law as a violation of the right to equality enshrined in the country's post-apartheid constitution.</p>

          <p>Recent significant gains in China's US$12 trillion stock market are presenting a challenge for regulators aiming to foster a stable, long-term bull market. Beijing's goal is to position the equity market as a reliable source of household wealth that can support consumer spending, shifting reliance away from the property sector. After a recent pullback moderated the market's rapid ascent, regulators may be focused on preventing the wild boom-and-bust cycles seen in past decades. Analysts suggest the market is transitioning to a slower, more sustainable uptrend, though volatility may increase as this new phase unfolds. (not investment advice)</p>
