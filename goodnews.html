        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Aircraft leasing company Air Lease has agreed to a $7.4 billion takeover by a consortium of investors, including Japan's Sumitomo and SMBC Aviation Capital. This move, which will take the Los Angeles-based firm private, signals further consolidation within the airplane-renting industry. The deal values Air Lease at approximately $28.2 billion including debt, capitalizing on a period of high demand and record rental rates for aircraft driven by post-pandemic travel and manufacturing slowdowns. The acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2026, creating a larger, more competitive entity in the global leasing market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taxpayers facing significant debt with the Internal Revenue Service have several avenues for resolution beyond immediate full payment. Options include negotiating an Offer in Compromise to settle for less than the full amount owed, which is typically for those experiencing severe financial hardship. Other possibilities are establishing an installment agreement for monthly payments, requesting a temporary delay in collection, or seeking a penalty abatement for reasonable cause. This article suggests that working with a tax relief service can help navigate these complex processes to find a manageable solution and avoid severe consequences like liens or wage garnishment.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals overwhelmed by credit card debt, debt forgiveness presents a potential solution, though it is not a government-sponsored program. The primary methods involve negotiating with creditors, often through a debt settlement company, to pay a reduced lump sum in exchange for forgiving the remaining balance. While this can provide significant relief, it can also severely damage one's credit score and may have tax implications on the forgiven amount. Other alternatives discussed in the article include debt consolidation loans, debt management programs, and, as a last resort, bankruptcy, which can offer a complete financial reset.

          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Anthropic has announced the closure of a $13 billion funding round, catapulting its valuation to $183 billion. This new valuation is roughly triple what the company was worth after its previous funding round in March. The financing was led by prominent investors such as Iconiq and Fidelity, signaling strong confidence in Anthropic's financial performance and its AI assistant, Claude. As a major competitor to OpenAI, Anthropic plans to use the new capital to advance its AI safety research, meet escalating enterprise demand, and expand its international operations.</p>

          <p>In an effort to win back customers affected by inflation, McDonald's is bringing back its "Extra Value Meals" with offerings like a $5 sausage and egg McMuffin meal and an $8 Big Mac meal. The move comes after the company reported a significant drop in traffic from low-income diners, who have been cutting back on spending for food outside the home. CEO Chris Kempczinski noted that these financial pressures have particularly impacted breakfast sales. This focus on value follows the recent return of the popular Snack Wrap and other promotions aimed at making the fast-food chain more affordable amid economic uncertainty.</p>

          <h2>Savers Advised on CD Account Strategies Ahead of Anticipated Fed Rate Cut</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates in September, savers are advised to avoid common mistakes with their certificate of deposit (CD) accounts. Financial experts recommend that savers should not wait too long to shop for a CD, as banks may preemptively lower their rates before the official Fed announcement. It is also crucial to monitor the rate climate closely and to avoid letting existing CDs automatically roll over upon maturity into new accounts that will likely offer lower returns. Proactive planning can help savers lock in the current higher rates and prevent potential losses from early withdrawal penalties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With gold prices approaching record highs near $3,500 per ounce, beginner investors may find it challenging to enter the market. This article suggests several strategies to start investing without paying top prices for the precious metal.

Acting promptly is advised, as continued price surges could make entry even more difficult for those looking to diversify their portfolios and hedge against inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has barred the Trump administration from using National Guard or other military troops for domestic law enforcement activities in California, such as making arrests or conducting searches. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by the state after President Trump deployed troops to Los Angeles to address protests related to immigration enforcement. Judge Charles Breyer found that the deployment "willfully" violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a federal law restricting military involvement in civilian law enforcement. The judge warned that such actions could create "a national police force with the President as its chief," undermining constitutional principles.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that many of the Trump administration's tariffs, imposed under a 1977 emergency powers law, are illegal. The decision could require the U.S. government to refund billions of dollars in duties collected from businesses, though a stay is in place until October 14 pending an expected appeal to the Supreme Court. The ruling adds another layer of uncertainty for the shipping and supply chain industries, which have been grappling with trade volatility for months. Despite the decision, logistics professionals report that shipping operations have not yet changed as companies await the final outcome of the legal battle.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin demonstrated resilience by edging higher on Tuesday, reclaiming the $111,000 level even as the broader stock market experienced a sell-off. The upward movement for the cryptocurrency occurred while the traditional safe-haven asset, gold, surged to a new record high above $3,500 per ounce. Market analysts suggest that while gold's rally is driven by rate-cut expectations and geopolitical uncertainty, Bitcoin is also benefiting from these themes but has faced headwinds from a market rotation into Ethereum. The divergent performance indicates that investors are seeking both safety and yield, with crypto increasingly competing with traditional assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Expert Analysis on How a Fed Rate Cut Might Impact Mortgage Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 14:08:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the Federal Reserve is widely expected to implement a 25-basis-point interest rate cut in September, its impact on mortgage rates may be muted. Experts suggest several reasons for this, including the fact that the cut is relatively small compared to previous adjustments that caused significant rate drops. Additionally, many lenders may have already "priced in" the anticipated cut, meaning current mortgage offers already reflect the expected change. The article also notes that mortgage rates are influenced by multiple factors beyond the Fed's policy, such as the 10-year Treasury yield, which can temper the effect of a single rate reduction.
