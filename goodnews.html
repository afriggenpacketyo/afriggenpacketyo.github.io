          <p>Bernie Sanders criticizes the Democratic Party for lacking a strong message for working-class people and failing to address their economic needs effectively. He argues that the party's focus on incremental changes does not resonate with those struggling financially. Sanders emphasizes the need for Democrats to confront the billionaire class and advocate for policies such as healthcare for all, affordable childcare, and tuition-free public colleges. He expresses concern that the party's credibility is low and that simply opposing Trump is insufficient to win over working-class voters.</p>

          <p>China's Tiandu-1 satellite has entered a 3:1 Earth-moon resonant orbit, sparking debate over claims that it is the first spacecraft to achieve this feat. The orbit is considered a breakthrough for lunar infrastructure and interplanetary exploration. Experts from the US and Canada have challenged the claim, pointing to NASA's Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) probe, which entered a similar orbit in 2011. The discussion highlights the ongoing competition and innovation in space exploration between China and other nations.</p>

          <p>Japan's only seal sanctuary, the Okhotsk Tokkari Center, focuses on rescuing and rehabilitating injured seals with a unique approach: staff avoid naming or direct contact to minimize emotional attachment. The center rescues seals found along the Sea of Okhotsk coast, releasing them back into the wild after recovery. While staff members try to remain detached, they still develop bonds with the animals. The center's efforts aim to protect seals, which were once viewed as pests, and promote environmental awareness.</p>
