          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 06:12:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article defines parasocial relationships as the one-sided sense of intimacy fans feel towards celebrities, influencers, or other public figures. It traces the history of this phenomenon from 19th-century fan crazes to modern-day online stan culture, noting that while often harmless, it can become toxic when fans feel entitled to control a celebrity's life. The piece explains the psychological underpinnings, where fans interact with a constructed public persona rather than the actual person, leading to blurred boundaries. It concludes by advising responsible engagement, emphasizing that these relationships require care to remain healthy and rewarding.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology giant Alibaba reported mixed results for its fiscal first quarter, with net income surpassing expectations while overall revenue fell short of forecasts. The company's cloud computing division was a significant bright spot, showing accelerated sales growth of 26% year-over-year, largely driven by strong demand for artificial intelligence services. This robust performance in AI-related products highlights a key area of focus for the company. Despite broader economic uncertainties in China, investors reacted positively, buoyed by the firm's profitability and strategic AI investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece examines the escalating cost of higher education in the United States, questioning its modern value proposition for younger generations facing significant debt. The article presents personal anecdotes and expert opinions, including the view that federal subsidies have inadvertently driven tuition hikes. However, it counters this by tracing a long history of U.S. government investment in education, from Thomas Jefferson to the G.I. Bill, arguing these were seen as essential for national progress and democracy. The author concludes that the current affordability crisis stems from a post-1980s shift away from viewing education as a public good.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from a new book details the unique friendship between basketball legend Kobe Bryant and acclaimed composer John Williams. Bryant, a lifelong admirer of Williams' music, sought out the composer for advice on leadership and timelessness, applying musical concepts to his approach on the basketball court. This relationship culminated in their collaboration on the Oscar-winning animated short film "Dear Basketball," for which Williams composed the score. The piece became a poignant tribute to Bryant's career and, tragically, a eulogy following his death in 2020, capturing both his youthful passion and the bittersweet nature of leaving behind a lifelong love.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is aggressively recruiting top AI talent, reportedly offering massive compensation packages to build a new secretive team called "Superintelligence Labs." This move is part of a multi-billion-dollar effort to close the gap with competitors like OpenAI and establish Meta as a leader in the race to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) that surpasses human intellect. The strategy follows the underwhelming reception of Meta's latest language model, Llama, which highlighted the company's lag in the field. While Wall Street has responded positively to the ambitious push, some AI researchers remain skeptical of the company's consumer-focused approach.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur is reportedly on the verge of completing a £51.8 million deal to sign 22-year-old Dutch international Xavi Simons from RB Leipzig. The versatile attacker, who has completed a medical in England, is expected to finalize the move within 24 hours. Simons, a product of Barcelona's La Masia academy, impressed over two seasons at Leipzig with 22 goals and 24 assists. The signing is considered a significant acquisition for Spurs, who were seeking to bolster their attack after missing out on other targets, and he is expected to primarily play on the left wing.</p>

          <p>China's top economic planning agency, the NDRC, has called for a measured and strategic implementation of its "AI Plus" initiative, which aims to integrate artificial intelligence across key industries. Officials emphasized that the rollout should be tailored to local strengths to foster complementary advantages and avoid "disorderly competition and blind expansion." As part of the strategy, the government will continue to subsidize companies' access to computing power and pilot consumer subsidies for AI-powered products. The plan sets ambitious targets for AI adoption in manufacturing and services, aiming for over 70% by 2027 as part of its broader push for technological self-reliance.</p>
