          <p>India is actively rebalancing its international relations, strengthening ties with China and Russia amidst growing tariff friction with the United States. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent engagement with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin at the SCO summit symbolizes this strategic autonomy. Despite US tariffs on Indian goods, experts emphasize that New Delhi is not abandoning Washington but rather pursuing a multi-alignment policy to leverage relationships across various blocs. This delicate diplomatic tightrope aims to protect India's economic and strategic interests in an increasingly volatile global environment.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a rallying call against protectionism and hegemonism during a virtual BRICS summit, advocating for an open global economy. Xi emphasized the importance of maintaining a multilateral trading system centered on the World Trade Organization. His remarks underscore China's push for shared opportunities and win-win outcomes through openness, despite international challenges. This stance reflects Beijing's efforts to position itself as a leader in global economic cooperation, contrasting with what it perceives as protectionist tendencies from other nations.</p>

The Labour Party's National Executive Committee has set a swift timeline for the deputy leadership race, with nominations opening soon and a winner announced by October 25. Candidates require significant backing from MPs and affiliated groups. This expedited process aims to galvanize the party and ensure a complementary leadership that resonates widely across the UK.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 09:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts predict that the long-delayed Power of Siberia 2 pipeline, connecting Russia and China, could create a "structural shock" to global liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade. The project, valued at $13.6 billion, has gained renewed importance for Russia following Western sanctions imposed after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, as China emerges as a crucial alternative market. An overland supply route would offer China cheaper and more secure energy, bypassing maritime chokepoints and insulating it from price volatility. Unresolved issues like pricing and the route, however, suggest prolonged negotiations.</p>

          <p>Stephen Colbert's "The Late Show" has won its first Emmy Award for outstanding directing, just weeks after news of its controversial cancellation by CBS. The win, coming after over 30 nominations, is seen by some as a reaction to public dismay over the show's abrupt ending, which Donald Trump celebrated. CBS attributed the cancellation to financial headwinds in late-night television, despite Colbert's critical stance on Trump and a lawsuit settlement involving the former president. This victory marks a significant milestone for the show's legacy amidst its impending conclusion in May 2026.</p>

          <p>The appointment of Shabana Mahmood as UK Home Secretary is widely interpreted as a signal for a tougher stance on immigration, reflecting the government's prioritization of the issue. Mahmood, known for her "hardliner" reputation within Labour, is expected to accelerate existing plans, such as expanding military sites for asylum seekers and potentially bringing forward deadlines for closing asylum hotels. While constrained by senior party opposition to withdrawing from the ECHR, her communication style is anticipated to be more direct and less nuanced than her predecessor. This shift aims to address public dissatisfaction and counter the narrative driven by other parties.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals a growing disparity in US union membership, with declines concentrated in "right-to-work" states while states protecting collective bargaining rights see increases. These anti-union laws, prevalent in the South and central US, result in lower union density and significantly lower wages for workers. The report highlights Illinois' success after guaranteeing collective bargaining rights, adding 27,000 union members in 2024 and demonstrating improved homeownership and health insurance rates for union members. Efforts are underway to invalidate "right-to-work" laws nationwide, with experts arguing union strength is vital for economic prosperity and democracy.</p>
