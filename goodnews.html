          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 20:40:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed a proclamation imposing 25% tariffs on imported medium- and heavy-duty trucks, including their parts, and 10% tariffs on all imported buses, such as school and city buses. This policy aims to protect U.S. companies from foreign competition and strongly incentivize domestic manufacturing by discouraging the use of only foreign materials. The administration plans to provide credits to vehicle manufacturers who import some parts for U.S. assembly, thereby offsetting tariff liabilities and ensuring they remain cost-competitive. This strategic move is intended to boost American labor, expand vehicle production within the United States, and reduce reliance on foreign-made components, ultimately strengthening the domestic automotive sector.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Liu Huaqing, the former commander of the Chinese navy, revered as a strategist and visionary technocrat who directed the comprehensive modernization of China's naval forces to world-class standards. Born in 1916, Liu joined the Red Army at 13 and took part in the Long March as a teenage soldier, rising to senior ranks in the PLA. He was transferred to the newly established PLA Navy in 1952, marking his first encounter with the sea. Throughout his distinguished career, Liu was often compared to 19th-century American naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan for his profound impact on China's "blue sea strategy."</p>

          <p>The annual Orionid meteor shower is set to peak next week, offering an impressive celestial display visible until November 7th, with optimal viewing between midnight and dawn. Known for their brightness and speed, these meteors originate from debris left by Halley's Comet as Earth passes through its trail, burning up in our atmosphere. The radiant point for the shower is the constellation of Orion, which rises in the east after midnight. Observers can expect around 15 meteors per hour during the peak, some appearing brighter than Venus, providing a spectacular naked-eye show for those in dark locations.</p>

          <h2>Katie Porter Explains Temperament Outbursts, Cites Reporter's Implication</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter acknowledged mishandling a recent TV interview that questioned her temperament, attributing her reaction to a reporter's perceived implication that she should cater to President Trump's supporters. Porter, an outspoken Democrat, stated she was "pushing back" on this notion, asserting she would not compromise California's values for political gain by appeasing Trump supporters, whom she believes are harming the state. She also addressed an older video showing her cursing at a staffer, apologizing for the "inappropriate" incident and emphasizing her value for her team. Porter aims to demonstrate her judgment throughout the campaign, while criticizing Trump's own conduct as an unsuitable benchmark.</p>

          <p>India's traditional Diwali gold rush is seeing a shift this year as soaring prices, topping $1,440 for 10g, influence consumer behavior. While demand for gold remains strong due to its auspicious significance during Dhanteras, buyers are opting for lighter jewelry or smaller gold quantities, with jewellers innovating designs to counter stagnant budgets. A notable trend is the increasing preference for gold as an investment rather than purely for adornment, reflected in rising bullion market data and record inflows into ETFs and digital gold. India's central bank is also significantly boosting its gold reserves to diversify holdings and provide stability during geopolitical stress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>US Sees Significant Drop in Fentanyl Overdose Deaths Through Harm Reduction</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 19:42:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. is experiencing a significant turnaround in its fentanyl crisis, with fatal overdoses falling by 25% in 2024, saving nearly 30,000 lives. This progress is largely attributed to a commitment to harm reduction strategies, particularly in states like North Carolina, where overdoses are down 35%. Innovative programs like law enforcement assisted diversion (LEAD) are diverting substance users from crime to recovery, offering support for addiction, housing, and employment. Medication-assisted treatments like methadone and widespread availability of Naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal drug, are also playing crucial roles, along with a generational shift away from opioids among younger people.</p>

          <p>The Grand Sumo Tournament in London's Royal Albert Hall showcases the ancient Japanese sport, blending centuries-old rituals with modern global fandom. Forty top sumo wrestlers, or rikishi, perform intricate ceremonies like leg stomps and claps to ward off evil spirits, all beneath a six-tonne Japanese temple roof, to an enraptured audience. This rare overseas event, only the second in London since 1991, highlights sumo's growing international appeal, largely fueled by online communities and dedicated YouTube channels. Despite its growing popularity abroad, the sport faces challenges in Japan, including declining recruits, past scandals, and competition from other sports.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council publicly rebuked its city attorney, Hydee Feldstein Soto, directing her to withdraw a request to lift a federal judge’s order banning the LAPD from targeting journalists with crowd control weapons. The ban was prompted by lawsuits from journalists and protesters alleging excessive force during Trump administration protests, with video evidence suggesting officers violated guidelines. Council members emphasized that journalism is under attack and condemned undermining protections for those exercising First Amendment rights. Feldstein Soto's legal team subsequently withdrew the request, though the city is still appealing the injunction, highlighting ongoing tensions over police tactics and press freedom.</p>

          <p>A mysterious phrase, "six, seven," accompanied by a juggling hand motion, has become a widespread viral trend among kids and teens, disrupting classrooms and baffling adults. Originating from Philadelphia rapper Skrilla's song "Doot Doot (6 7)," the artist himself admits he never assigned it a specific meaning, calling it "something positive and fun." The phrase's longevity is partly attributed to teachers getting upset, as children enjoy having a secret code that adults cannot easily ban or avoid due to the numbers' ubiquity. Experts suggest this seemingly nonsensical trend might be this generation's way of expressing fun and lightening up amidst global pressures.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Orange County have arrested Jacob Daniel Rodriguez, 45, the man dubbed "Postal Malone" for his resemblance to the singer Post Malone, who is suspected of a string of package thefts. Rodriguez was booked into Orange County Jail following an investigation by the Irvine Police Department. Last month, police had posted photos of the suspect, captured on camera stealing more than five packages from an apartment community on Spectrum Center Drive, noting his distinctive facial and hand tattoos. The arrest comes after a public appeal for information, with police playfully referencing Post Malone's song titles in their announcement, signaling a resolution to the local crime spree.</p>

          <p>Billionaire Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff apologized for his earlier comments supporting President Trump's suggestion to deploy National Guard troops to San Francisco. Facing intensifying backlash, Benioff stated he listened closely to San Franciscans and local officials, concluding that the National Guard is not needed for city safety. His initial remarks, made with "an abundance of caution" for a company conference, had drawn criticism for advocating domestic troop deployment for law enforcement, a move widely banned by federal law. This apology marks a shift from his previous support for liberal policies, as city leaders tout declining crime rates and reject federal intervention, asserting local control over safety.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals exciting results for the Galleri blood test, showing its potential to speed up diagnosis for over 50 types of cancer, three-quarters of which lack existing screening programs. In a North American trial of 25,000 adults, the test identified cancer in 62% of positive cases, with over half detected at an early, more treatable stage. The test, which detects fragments of cancerous DNA circulating in the blood, correctly ruled out cancer in over 99% of negative results. While these impressive findings suggest a major role in earlier diagnosis, scientists await further evidence from ongoing randomized trials to confirm its impact on reducing overall cancer deaths.</p>

By prioritizing innovation and cultural development over property-led planning, the Northern Metropolis has the opportunity to become a global cradle for cultural content, exporting its unique identity, much like Hollywood or K-pop.</p>
