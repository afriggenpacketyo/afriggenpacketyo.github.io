          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson is working to sway Republican holdouts on the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' which encompasses President Trump's legislative agenda. The bill includes key components related to Medicaid and tax reform, including state and local tax (SALT) deductions. Johnson aims to reach a consensus on SALT caps, which have become a major sticking point. He expressed optimism about passing the bill next week, emphasizing the goal of deficit neutrality. The Republican majority can only afford to lose three votes, making Johnson's task of unifying the conference a crucial test of his speakership.</p>

          <p>The Belgian parliament voted to drop the country's planned nuclear phaseout, reversing a law passed in 2003. This decision comes after a 2022 delay of the phaseout due to energy uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine. The new motion passed with 102 votes in favor, eight against, and 31 abstentions. Nuclear energy currently accounts for around 40% of Belgium's power generation, and this move aligns with other European countries considering a shift in nuclear policy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to lift sanctions on Syria could stabilize the country, but many questions remain. The end of sanctions could mean economic relief, reconstruction, and the return of Syrian refugees. However, it's unclear if the sanctions relief is subject to certain conditions. Trump urged Syria to sign onto the Abraham Accords, tell foreign terrorists to leave, deport Palestinian terrorists, help prevent the resurgence of ISIS, and assume responsibility for ISIS detention centers. The situation is complex, but the lifting of sanctions may be a positive step.</p>
