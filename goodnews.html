        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sarah Lin, a high school senior from the Bronx, is advocating for the Open Captioning Accessibility Act in New York, aiming to make movie theaters more accessible for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. Inspired by her mother's progressive hearing loss, Lin is collaborating with the Hearing Loss Association of America's New York Chapter to push for the bill's passage before the end of the legislative session. The act would mandate that movie theaters offer some showings with open captions, providing a more reliable option than current assistive devices, which are often faulty. Lin hopes New York's action will influence other states to adopt similar measures, urging people to contact their local representatives to support the act. Optimism is present as the act seems likely to pass. </p>

          <p>Reddit shares experienced a surge of approximately 7% after the social media company unveiled new artificial intelligence-powered advertising tools. Announced during the Cannes Lions festival, the two new features aim to assist brands in leveraging discussions on the platform, powered by an engine called Reddit Community Intelligence. The company announced Reddit Insights, a "listening tool" providing real-time insights for marketers to identify trends and launch campaigns, along with Conversation Summary Add-ons, enabling brands to display "positive" user content under their ads. The company emphasizes that these tools are designed for a new era of community marketing, allowing brands to tap into Reddit's authenticity and connect meaningfully with high-intent communities globally. The launch of these tools seems to be a positive direction for the company. </p>

          <p>As an extreme heat warning is issued for parts of California, Arizona, and Nevada, Americans are being advised to limit coffee consumption to avoid dehydration. The National Weather Service encourages people to stay hydrated, use sunscreen, and plan outdoor activities during cooler parts of the day, while cautioning against alcohol, caffeine, and heavy foods. Registered dietitian-nutritionist Lauren Manaker notes that while moderate caffeine consumption is generally safe, larger quantities can act as a mild diuretic, increasing the risk of dehydration. Manaker suggests milk as a surprising hydrating alternative, packed with electrolytes, carbohydrates, and protein, which helps the body recover and retain fluids after exercise. This is a public health announcement. </p>

          <p>Kraft Heinz announced it will remove artificial dyes from its products sold in the U.S. by the end of 2027 and will immediately cease creating new products containing these dyes. This decision comes amid pressure from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to replace synthetic dyes with natural alternatives. While 10% of Kraft Heinz's products currently contain artificial dyes, the company has been investing in removing or replacing them with natural colors, with many products already using natural or no colors. The FDA is also working to eliminate synthetic dyes by the end of 2026 through voluntary efforts from the food industry. The move towards natural dyes is a positive step. </p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve Bank is expected to maintain its benchmark rate at its meeting on Wednesday, signaling ongoing caution amid uncertainty around President Trump's tariffs. The CME Group's FedWatch Tool indicates a 99.9% likelihood that the Fed will keep the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it has been since December. While consumer sentiment has improved somewhat, the inflation rate ticked up slightly in May to 2.4%, and the labor market continues to hold up, with payroll gains exceeding expectations. The meeting will include an economic forecast and will be closely watched for any dissent among voting members, as well as what the economic data indicates. (not investment advice)</p>

Compared to four years ago, streaming has skyrocketed 71%, while broadcast and cable viewing have declined 21% and 39%, respectively. The growth in streaming has been driven by free ad-supported streaming TV offerings, the rise of YouTube, and shifts within legacy media companies to reach streaming-centric consumers. Netflix has emerged as the clear winner among paid subscription services, with a viewing gain of 27% over the past four years. Streaming is becoming the dominant form of media consumption. </p>

          <p>The article explores the evolving ideal woman in America, from the skinny aesthetic of the 90s and 2000s to the "well" woman of today who relentlessly optimizes her health. It delves into the shift towards strength training and muscles as a symbol of worthiness, but also examines the societal pressures and biases that arise when women embrace strength. The piece touches on the politicization of muscles, the rise of wellness culture, and the optimization trap that continues to drive women to seek an elusive state of perfection. The topic is about the pressures women face in society. </p>
