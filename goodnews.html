          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee narrowly voted 5-4 to lower its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.0%, continuing a cautious approach to monetary easing. The decision reflects the challenge of balancing persistent inflation, which rose to 3.6% in June, against a cooling labor market and stagnant economic growth. The close vote, which required a second round to reach a majority, highlights deep divisions among policymakers about the U.K.'s economic path. Economists anticipate further cuts, but the central bank emphasized that future decisions will depend on clear evidence of disinflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India has dispatched its first official delegation to Damascus to engage with Syria's new provisional government, signaling its intent to maintain relations following the ousting of Bashar Assad. The meetings focused on humanitarian aid, health cooperation, and future reconstruction efforts in the war-torn country. Experts suggest this outreach aligns with India's non-aligned foreign policy and strategic interests, including ensuring regional stability and securing trade routes. By establishing early ties with the post-Assad leadership, which is supported by regional powers like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, India aims to avoid being sidelined in Syria's future development.</p>

          <p>The NFL Players Association has clarified that a recent league memo does not prohibit players from using smelling salts, but rather restricts teams and their staff from providing them. The clarification came after a league-wide memo on Tuesday appeared to ban the ammonia inhalants, causing confusion and dismay among players like 49ers tight end George Kittle. The NFL's initial memo cited an FDA warning and the potential for the substance to mask neurological symptoms, including concussions. Under the clarified rule, players who wish to use smelling salts for a gameday boost must now bring their own.</p>

          <p>Ant Digital, an affiliate of Chinese fintech giant Ant Group, is actively promoting its new blockchain platform, Jovay, designed for asset tokenization in Hong Kong. This move comes just a week after the city enacted its new stablecoin law, positioning itself as a hub for digital assets. The company describes its platform as a bridge between traditional Web2 finance and the emerging Web3 ecosystem, aiming to bring credible assets to the blockchain and compliant capital to traditional markets. Ant Digital plans to officially launch the self-developed public blockchain in September, at which point it will be capable of handling real-money transactions.</p>

          <p>U.S. companies are intensifying efforts to bring employees back to the office, with monitoring and enforcement of attendance policies reaching their highest levels since the pandemic began. A new CBRE report shows that 69% of firms now monitor attendance, up from 45% last year, and 37% are actively enforcing their policies. Despite this push, which aims for an average of 3.2 days in the office per week, more companies now expect to expand their office footprints rather than shrink them. This trend is driven by clarity on hybrid work models and a growing concern over the limited availability of high-quality, prime office space.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order directing the Department of Labor to review guidance on including alternative assets in 401(k) retirement plans. This move would open the door for investments in private equity, real estate, and cryptocurrencies within these defined-contribution plans, a long-sought goal for the alternative asset industry. While private assets have been embraced by pensions and endowments, their inclusion in 401(k)s has been limited due to concerns about risk, fees, and transparency. The news prompted a jump in Bitcoin's price and a slight rise in private equity stocks like Apollo Group. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly significantly raised its 2025 financial outlook after its second-quarter earnings and revenue surpassed Wall Street estimates, driven by soaring demand for its weight loss and diabetes drugs, Zepbound and Mounjaro. The company now projects full-year sales between $60 billion and $62 billion, though this guidance does not account for potential new U.S. tariffs on pharmaceuticals. Zepbound sales grew by a remarkable 172% to $3.38 billion, while Mounjaro revenue hit nearly $5.2 billion. Despite the strong performance, shares fell after data from an experimental obesity pill, orforglipron, came in below investor expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to a proposed 100% U.S. tariff on foreign-made semiconductors, major global chipmakers are highlighting their substantial investments in American manufacturing. Companies with significant U.S. operations or commitments, such as TSMC, Samsung, and GlobalFoundries, are expected to be exempt from the new duties. TSMC has pledged $165 billion in U.S. investments, while Samsung is producing components in Texas, and U.S.-based GlobalFoundries is accelerating investments in its New York factory. The policy is designed to onshore the semiconductor supply chain, and investor optimism has boosted the stock prices of companies poised to benefit from the exemptions.</p>

          <p>Peloton reported a surprise fiscal fourth-quarter profit and announced plans to cut an additional 6% of its staff as it continues its restructuring under new CEO Peter Stern. The company aims to reduce expenses by another $100 million in fiscal 2026, on top of $200 million in cuts from the previous year. The connected fitness brand's net income was $21.6 million, a significant turnaround from a $30.5 million loss a year prior, driven by cost-cutting and better-than-expected sales. While its full-year sales forecast is in line with expectations, the company anticipates a $65 million negative impact from new U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England's recent decision to cut its interest rate to 4% will have varied effects on UK households, particularly concerning mortgages and savings. Homeowners with variable-rate mortgages will likely see their monthly payments decrease, offering some financial relief. However, savers will face diminished returns, as average savings rates are expected to continue their downward trend. The central bank's primary goal with the rate cut is to stimulate spending and manage inflation, which currently stands at 3.6%. The move aims to balance the need for economic growth against the risk of prices rising too quickly in the near term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A scholar from a top Communist Party institute has suggested that China needs to maintain an annual GDP growth rate of at least 4.5% to 5% during its next five-year plan (2026-2030). This pace is deemed necessary to achieve the national goal of reaching the per capita GDP of a "moderately developed country" by 2035, a target estimated to be around $30,000. Writing in the Study Times, the professor emphasized that this economic growth is crucial for laying a solid foundation for the 2035 objective, alongside priorities like technological advancement and improving citizens' livelihoods.

While overall revenue of $2.41 billion surpassed expectations, adjusted earnings per share fell slightly short.

However, Popeyes experienced a same-store sales decline of 1.4%, making it the portfolio's laggard for the quarter. Burger King's U.S. division, which is in the midst of a turnaround, saw a modest sales increase of 1.5%. (not investment advice)</p>
