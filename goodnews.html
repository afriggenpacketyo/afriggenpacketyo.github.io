          <p>Many UK newspapers are covering Chancellor Rachel Reeves's reversal on winter fuel payments, with some calling for an apology and others highlighting potential tax rises. The Daily Express celebrated the change as a victory for pensioners after relentless campaigning. The Times reported a standoff between Reeves and the Home Secretary over police funding, potentially impacting crime investigations. Several papers also highlighted Labour's pledge to invest ¬£14bn in the Sizewell C nuclear plant to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and create jobs, with the Energy Secretary calling it a new "golden age" for the British nuclear industry.</p>

          <p>The government has committed ¬£14.2bn to build the Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, aiming to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed the decision as a landmark move to kickstart economic growth, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband emphasized its necessity for a clean energy future. However, critics argue that ministers have not been transparent about the plant's total cost and that the investment could be better allocated to other priorities. The project faces opposition from those concerned about environmental impacts and potential cost overruns.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have significantly decreased, with a 47% reduction in fatal overdoses among those aged 20 to 29. Provisional CDC data indicates that fatal overdoses among people under 35 dropped from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 last year. Experts attribute this decline to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less deadly fentanyl being sold, increased access to addiction healthcare, and a shift towards less risky drug use among teens and young adults. Despite this progress, challenges remain for those struggling with severe addiction, and concerns exist about potential cuts to funding for addiction services.</p>
