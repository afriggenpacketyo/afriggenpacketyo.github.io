          <p>Elon Musk is facing scrutiny from neighbors and local officials in West Lake Hills, Texas, over unpermitted construction at his mansion. Neighbors have complained about a 16-foot fence, outward-facing cameras, and increased traffic, leading to a contentious zoning dispute. The article details how Musk's team failed to obtain permits for the fence and gate, violating six city ordinances. Despite Musk's efforts to seek retroactive permission, the Zoning and Planning Commission unanimously rejected his request, potentially requiring him to alter or remove the structures. The conflict highlights the challenges even the wealthiest individuals face when navigating local regulations and neighborly disputes.</p>
