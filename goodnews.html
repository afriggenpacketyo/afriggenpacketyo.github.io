          <h2>Federal Reserve Expected to Cut Rates Amidst Political Intrigue</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 12:22:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates, but the forecast for the remainder of 2025 and political factors add complexity to the decision. President Trump's appointee, Stephen Miran, is likely to dissent from the widely expected quarter-point rate cut, advocating for a more aggressive reduction. Markets are heavily betting on a 25 basis point cut, with traders also anticipating further cuts in October and December. The Fed's dual mandate goals are in tension, and the growing politicization of the Fed is complicating matters, and the key question is whether the committee will signal this as the first in a series of consecutive cuts (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>StubHub shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange after the online ticket seller priced its IPO at $23.50 per share, raising $800 million. The IPO, trading under the ticker symbol 'STUB,' comes after previous delays due to market volatility and concerns over tariffs. StubHub has benefited from the resurgence of live events following COVID-19 lockdowns, driven by popular shows and sporting events. The company faces competition from Vivid Seats, SeatGeek, and Ticketmaster, with the FTC currently probing Ticketmaster over practices related to automated bots circumventing ticket limits.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Scottish Parliament has approved plans to scrap the controversial 'not proven' verdict as part of wide-ranging justice reforms. The reforms, included in the Victims, Witnesses and Justice Reform (Scotland) Bill, also increase the threshold for a guilty verdict in jury trials and create a special sexual assault court. Justice Secretary Angela Constance said the 'not proven' verdict is widely misunderstood and traumatizes victims, while critics argue its removal risks an increase in miscarriages of justice. The reforms also pave the way for a victims and witnesses commissioner and the extension of rules restricting what can be said in court about a complainer's sexual history.</p>

          <p>Mortgage interest rates have dropped to an average of 6.13%, the lowest level in three years, driven by expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts. This decline has spurred increased mortgage loan applications and refinancing activity, prompting prospective homebuyers to re-enter the market. Experts recommend comparing lenders, checking credit scores, and considering refinancing options to take advantage of the lower rates. While adjustable-rate mortgages may offer lower initial payments, borrowers should carefully weigh the risks associated with future rate increases (not investment advice).</p>

Both Frontier and United are expanding flights on Spirit Airlines routes, aiming to attract customers amidst Spirit's financial challenges.
