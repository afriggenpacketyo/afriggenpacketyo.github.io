The collision occurred on the sideline while Lamb, dressed in street clothes, was watching a play unfold. Despite being the one hit from behind, the Cowboys were assessed a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for a non-player making contact with an official. Lamb was uninjured and seen laughing about the unusual incident with his teammates on the sideline shortly after it happened.</p>

          <p>In the Los Angeles Rams' preseason opener against the Dallas Cowboys, rookie running back Blake Corum demonstrated his potential to play a significant role in the team's offense. The former Michigan star rushed for 32 yards and scored two touchdowns on nine carries, showcasing his readiness for the professional level. With the Rams looking to manage the workload of primary back Kyren Williams, Corum's strong performance suggests he could provide valuable depth and production. Other rookie running backs, Jarquez Hunter and Cody Schrader, also contributed effectively to the Rams' 31-21 victory.</p>

          <h2>Fashion Industry Reportedly Shifting from 'Quiet Luxury' to Bolder 'Loud Luxury' Styles</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest the fashion industry is moving away from the understated "quiet luxury" trend and embracing more visible, statement-making styles, dubbed "loud luxury." This shift is driven by luxury brands like Gucci, Burberry, and Versace seeking to inject novelty and reignite consumer desire amid a sector-wide slowdown. After a period where discrete opulence dominated, brands are reintroducing prominent logos and distinctive designs to capture attention. This strategic pivot aims to appeal to a broader consumer base and reverse declining sales figures experienced by many high-end labels. (not investment advice)</p>

Recent high-profile departures include Yan Zhijie, who led Tongyi's speech lab, and Bo Liefeng, head of its applied vision division, who have moved to rival AI projects. This trend highlights the intense competition for elite AI talent within China's technology sector. As companies race to develop their own advanced AI models, they are increasingly targeting established experts from leading institutions like Alibaba's Damo Academy.</p>

          <p>Jen Pawol achieved a major milestone in baseball history by becoming the first woman to umpire a Major League Baseball regular-season game. Her debut took place during the first game of a doubleheader between the Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins, where she served as the first base umpire. The 48-year-old, who has been umpiring in the minor leagues since 2016, received a warm ovation from the crowd.

          <h2>Experts Question Health Claims of Popular Wellness and Relaxation Drinks</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The booming market for "functional beverages," drinks that promise relaxation and other health benefits, is facing scrutiny from nutritionists and dietitians. While brands advertise ingredients like Lion's Mane mushroom and L-theanine to promote calm, experts are skeptical that the small quantities included can have a significant physiological effect. An advertisement from a leading brand, Trip, was recently banned for making unproven health claims about stress and anxiety relief. Psychologists suggest that any calming effect may be placebo, stemming from the ritual of taking a moment for oneself rather than the ingredients themselves.</p>

          <p>Ali Akbar, believed to be the last traditional newspaper hawker in Paris, is set to receive the National Order of Merit, one of France's highest honors. For over 50 years, the 72-year-old has been a beloved figure in the Saint-Germain neighborhood, selling papers by shouting headlines. Mr. Akbar, who once sold 80 newspapers an hour, now sells around 30, a decline he attributes to the rise of digital media. Despite the changing times, he continues his work for the joy and independence it brings, having become an iconic part of the local culture.</p>

          <p>A recent statement by singer Ed Sheeran, who was born and raised in England, describing himself as "culturally Irish" has ignited a social media debate about identity and heritage. Sheeran defended his connection, citing his Irish grandparents, passport, and formative childhood experiences in Ireland. This article explores the complex and evolving nature of what it means to be Irish in 2025, especially for the diaspora. Experts note that identity is larger than just birthplace and that for many second-generation individuals, a strong cultural connection to their ancestral homeland coexists with their British identity.</p>

          <p>A new adaptation of "War of the Worlds" starring Ice Cube has been widely panned by critics, earning a rare 0% score on the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes before a single positive review slightly raised it. The film, in which an agent must stop an alien invasion from his desk, has been called one of the worst movies ever made. However, the overwhelmingly negative reception has generated a different kind of interest, attracting viewers who enjoy "so bad they're good" films. This phenomenon highlights a niche audience that finds entertainment in earnest but failed filmmaking over polished but forgettable blockbusters.</p>

          <p>Six months after Chinese AI app DeepSeek-R1 shocked Silicon Valley with its impressive capabilities at a fraction of the typical development cost, its influence on the industry continues to be debated. The app challenged the prevailing "bigger is better" philosophy for AI models, proving that smarter engineering could rival resource-intensive approaches. While security concerns about its Chinese origins persist, some US startups continue to use it as a cost-effective alternative. The app's emergence also intensified the US-China AI rivalry, serving as a "Sputnik moment" that spurred further American investment and policy focus on maintaining AI dominance.

          <p>Apple's stock experienced its largest weekly gain in over five years, rising 13% and adding more than $400 billion to its market capitalization. The significant surge followed CEO Tim Cook's appearance at the White House, where he announced plans to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts. President Trump indicated this domestic investment would exempt Apple from potential future tariffs on imported chips, a move that greatly relieved investor concerns about profitability. The positive market reaction was also supported by Apple's strong quarterly earnings report from two weeks prior. (not investment advice)</p>
