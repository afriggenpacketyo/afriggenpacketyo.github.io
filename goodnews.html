          <p>Scientists are aiding the recovery of Yosemite's native turtles by removing invasive bullfrogs from their habitat. American bullfrogs, introduced in the late 1800s, have decimated local wildlife, including Northwestern pond turtle hatchlings. Researchers conducted near-total eradication of bullfrogs from specific bodies of water, resulting in a striking recovery of the pond turtle population. The removal effort also led to the resurgence of other native species, such as snakes and newts, restoring balance to the freshwater ecosystem.</p>
