          <p>Jim Cramer analyzed Tuesday's market activity, attributing stock movements to rising bond yields as Wall Street awaits congressional action on a federal budget bill. He noted that stocks, particularly those related to consumer discretionary spending and banks, are often influenced by the bond market, with higher yields typically leading to less economic activity. Cramer highlighted GE Vernova as a company resilient to bond market changes due to multiple secular trends, including the growing need for energy and new projects. He emphasized the importance of positive themes for stocks to overcome the gravitational pull of rising Treasury yields. (not investment advice)</p>
