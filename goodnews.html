          <p>In an interview about her new book, "Replaceable You," science writer Mary Roach explores the fascinating history and cutting-edge science of transplanting and replacing human body parts. The book covers historical oddities, such as prosthetic noses from the 1500s, and modern breakthroughs in xenotransplantation, particularly the use of genetically edited pig organs. Roach explains why pigs became the preferred animal for organ harvesting, a process involving genetic editing to prevent hyperacute rejection by the human immune system. She also delves into futuristic research, like 3D-printing functional muscle tissue, while expressing concern that recent cuts to medical research funding could threaten future innovation.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, prospective homebuyers are facing a volatile but potentially advantageous mortgage market this September. The article advises buyers to lock in a rate they can afford now, as recent history shows that rates can unexpectedly rise again, rather than assuming they will continue to fall. It also emphasizes the importance of shopping around with multiple lenders, as their responses to Fed cuts will vary. Homebuyers are encouraged to explore all options, such as adjustable-rate mortgages or buying mortgage points, to secure the most favorable terms in the current economic climate.

          <p>Google's generative AI application, Gemini, has claimed the top spot for free apps on Apple's App Store, overtaking its primary rival, OpenAI's ChatGPT. This surge in popularity follows recent updates to Gemini, including a new image-editing feature called Nano Banana, which reportedly attracted 13 million new users. The increased consumer traction has also boosted investor confidence, contributing to Google's parent company, Alphabet, recently joining the exclusive group of companies with a $3 trillion market valuation. This milestone suggests Google is successfully closing the gap with OpenAI in the competitive consumer AI space.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a fourth executive order to delay the enforcement of a bipartisan law requiring TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations or face a ban. This extension, pushing the deadline to at least December 16, comes as U.S. and Chinese negotiators reportedly reach a "framework" for a deal, with a call between Trump and President Xi Jinping planned to finalize details. Despite national security concerns that drove the law's passage, the Trump administration has praised the app's role in mobilizing young voters and has argued that non-enforcement is necessary to facilitate a sale and protect national security interests.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby stated his confidence in the company's expansion plans, which are outpacing rivals who have scaled back growth due to an oversupply of flights. Kirby attributes United's success to its brand loyalty, network strength, and investments in customer-facing technology like seat-back screens and Bluetooth connectivity. He argued that United's focus on a premium product differentiates it from struggling ultra-discount carriers, which he believes have a failing business model.

          <p>As autumn begins, the European Union's natural gas reserves are at just over 80% capacity, which is lower than the 90% cushion seen in the past few years but still considered a solid buffer for the upcoming winter. Following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the EU successfully diversified its energy supply by increasing liquified natural gas (LNG) imports from Norway, the U.S., and Qatar. While this has stabilized the market, new uncertainties have emerged, including potential U.S. tariffs on countries buying Russian energy. Analysts believe Europe is no longer in an acute energy crisis but remains vulnerable to geopolitical shocks and extreme weather events.</p>

          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot has hit back at media pundits for their intense focus on the club's £450 million summer spending spree, which culminated in the British record £125 million signing of striker Alexander Isak. Slot argued that critics who "favour other clubs" consistently ignore the fact that Liverpool recouped over £250 million from player sales, making their net spending more reasonable. He defended the club's strategy of investing in young talent, noting all eight new signings are 25 or under, and stated the club should receive praise for its self-sustaining business model. Isak is expected to make his debut in the upcoming Champions League match.</p>

          <p>In a move highlighting the escalating rivalry between the two AI giants, OpenAI has hired Mike Liberatore, the former chief financial officer of Elon Musk's xAI. Liberatore will serve as OpenAI's business finance officer, tasked with overseeing the company's significant spending on computing infrastructure. The hiring marks another point of friction between OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Musk, who co-founded OpenAI but have since become competitors. Musk has previously sued OpenAI for breach of contract and has actively tried to hinder its transition to a for-profit entity, a move OpenAI recently advanced by restructuring under its nonprofit parent.</p>

          <p>Cloud security provider Netskope has increased its planned price range for its upcoming initial public offering, now targeting a valuation of up to $7.3 billion. The company plans to sell nearly 48 million shares at between $17 and $19 each, up from a previous range that valued it at $6.5 billion. This move signals strong investor appetite and comes amid a hot streak for tech IPOs and a series of major acquisitions in the cybersecurity sector. The successful market debuts of other tech companies like Figma and Klarna suggest a renewed confidence in public markets after a period of volatility caused by inflation and interest rate hikes.

          <p>In an interview with Gayle King, Grammy-winning artist Cardi B addressed her public reputation for being at the center of conflict as she prepares to release her new album, titled "Am I the Drama?" The rapper explained that she doesn't enjoy drama but believes her outspoken personality and aura make her an "easier target" for controversy, which she says often follows her. She acknowledged that this reputation dates back to high school, where she was voted "most dramatic" in her yearbook, a label she didn't feel she deserved at the time. The album's title is a direct nod to this long-running public perception.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's self-driving vehicle company, Waymo, has secured a permit to begin testing its robotaxi service at San Francisco International Airport (SFO). The rollout will occur in phases, starting with tests involving employees and human safety drivers on board before transitioning to a fully driverless commercial ride-hailing service for the public. This expansion marks a significant step for the company, which already operates in San Mateo County and San Francisco but previously lacked airport access. Waymo has established similar services at airports in Phoenix and is testing at San Jose, solidifying its presence in key transportation hubs.</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve signals potential interest rate cuts, long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a way for savers to lock in currently high rates. A two-year CD, in particular, provides a balance of guaranteed returns and medium-term flexibility. With top rates around 4.06%, a $10,000 deposit could earn approximately $828 in interest over the 24-month term, while a $25,000 deposit could yield over $2,000. The article advises savers to shop around, particularly with online banks, to find the most competitive rates before they potentially decline further in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Renewable Energy Remains Most Cost-Effective Option Despite Policy Shifts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 13:28:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of wholesale energy costs reveals that renewable sources like onshore wind and utility-scale solar remain the cheapest forms of energy production, even when accounting for shifting government policies. According to data on the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), onshore wind is the most affordable option, followed closely by solar, while coal and nuclear power are significantly more expensive to generate. While the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act provided subsidies that further lowered renewable costs, the Trump administration's new policies are phasing them out while expanding tax breaks for fossil fuels. Experts note that despite higher upfront capital costs, renewables benefit from zero fuel costs and lower operational expenses. (not investment advice)</p>
