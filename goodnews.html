          <p>Eagles star Saquon Barkley criticized the failed NFL proposal to ban the "tush push" play, calling the opposition "soft." Barkley defended the play, emphasizing that any team can utilize it, but the Eagles' success stems from their strong offensive line and Jalen Hurts' strength. He also dismissed safety concerns, arguing that the play's execution is not universally successful, citing examples of other teams struggling with it. The proposed rule change aimed to prohibit offensive players from pushing teammates lined up behind the center at the snap.</p>
