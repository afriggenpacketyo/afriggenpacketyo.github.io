          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 10:27:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is set to end its long-standing policy requiring passengers to remove their shoes during security screenings at many U.S. airports. According to a memo, the change aims to expedite the security process, allowing all travelers, not just those in PreCheck, to keep their shoes on. This marks a significant shift from the rule implemented in 2006 after Richard Reid's attempted shoe-bombing. Passengers who trigger alarms at scanners will still be required to remove their footwear for additional screening as the new policy rolls out nationwide.</p>

          <p>Three men have been found guilty of an aggravated arson attack on a London warehouse that was shipping aid to Ukraine, an act carried out on behalf of the Russian Wagner Group. The attack, which caused around £1 million in damage, was part of a series of "missions" orchestrated by another individual who had already pleaded guilty. The warehouse was targeted for its role in sending humanitarian supplies and Starlink satellite equipment to Ukraine. This case is a prominent example of a state-linked organization using local "proxies" to conduct serious criminal activity in the UK.</p>

          <p>A new interstellar comet, named 3I/ATLAS, has been detected entering our solar system, marking the third such object ever observed. Astronomers confirm the comet poses no danger to Earth, as its closest approach in October will be over 1.5 times the distance from our planet to the sun. The object is estimated to be about 20 kilometers wide and is traveling at high speed. While much is still unknown, its discovery highlights advancements in telescope technology that allow for continuous sky scanning, with scientists expecting to find more interstellar visitors in the coming years.</p>

          <p>Dan Osborn, an independent who ran a surprisingly competitive race in 2024, has announced he will challenge Republican Senator Pete Ricketts for a Nebraska Senate seat. Osborn, a union leader and Navy veteran, is framing the campaign as a fight between the working class and the "billionaire class" represented by Ricketts. In his previous bid against Senator Deb Fischer, Osborn significantly outperformed expectations in the solidly red state. His campaign is expected to again focus on a populist message, including affordability, border security, and moderate stances on issues like abortion and gun safety.</p>

          <p>The R&A, organizers of The Open Championship, are reportedly planning to move up the tee times for the third round to mitigate disruption from a large loyalist parade scheduled in Portrush. The parade, involving over 2,000 participants, is set to begin shortly after play would typically conclude, raising concerns about significant congestion for the thousands of spectators leaving the golf tournament. Despite a request from the R&A, the parade organizers voted against rescheduling their march. Any adjustment to the schedule will likely be minor due to live television commitments in the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the performance of hybrid vehicles during long-distance highway travel, noting that while they offer fuel economy improvements, the gains are typically more pronounced in city driving. On the highway, the electric motor's role is reduced, but the system still enhances efficiency compared to gas-only cars. The piece explains that steady-state driving is less demanding on a hybrid's battery than the constant charge-discharge cycle of urban traffic. It also differentiates between full hybrids, mild hybrids, and plug-in hybrids, concluding that all types are well-suited for long journeys without the range anxiety associated with fully electric vehicles.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court has enabled the state to implement a ban on conversion therapy by ruling that a legislative committee's rejection of the ban was unconstitutional. The 4-3 decision by the liberal-controlled court found that the Republican-led committee had overreached its authority. The ban, which labels the scientifically discredited practice as unprofessional conduct for licensed therapists, had been blocked twice by the committee. This ruling is a significant victory for LGBTQ+ advocates and is part of a broader power struggle between the Democratic governor and the Republican-controlled legislature over state agency regulations.</p>

          <p>Germany's armed forces, the Bundeswehr, are experiencing a significant rise in volunteer applications, with numbers up by about 20% this year. Officials attribute this trend partly to the war in Ukraine, which has motivated more young people to serve. This growth is crucial as the Bundeswehr aims to expand its ranks to meet increased NATO commitments in response to the threat from Russia. To further boost recruitment, the defense minister plans to make military service more attractive and will soon require all 18-year-old men to complete a questionnaire about their fitness and willingness to serve.</p>

          <p>A recent survey suggests many Americans are engaging in "vibe-based budgeting," adjusting their finances based on feelings about the economy, which is fueling a trend of "revenge saving." This shift from post-pandemic splurging to saving is driven by anxiety over inflation and a potential recession. Financial experts advise against letting emotions drive financial habits and instead recommend intentional strategies. They suggest taking a 'money temperature' to assess your situation, using 'reverse budgeting' to prioritize savings, and creating separate, automated accounts for different goals to build a strong financial foundation.
