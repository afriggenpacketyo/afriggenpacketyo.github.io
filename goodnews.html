          <h2>Defense Secretary Claims Iranian Nuclear Ambitions 'Obliterated' After U.S. Strikes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth declared that Iran's nuclear ambitions have been "obliterated." Hegseth stated that the mission was a precise operation authorized by the president to neutralize threats to U.S. national interests and to defend troops and Israel. He emphasized that the operation was not aimed at regime change in Iran, echoing President Trump's remarks on the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity. The full extent of the damage to Iran's nuclear capabilities remains unclear, but the U.S. government is confident that they have made a significant blow to Iran's nuclear program. The assessment of the impact on Iran's nuclear capabilities is still ongoing.</p>

          <p>Middle Eastern markets largely ended higher despite the U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear sites. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, driven by expectations that U.S. involvement would help resolve the conflict. In the Gulf, Saudi Arabia's Tadawul closed slightly down, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains. Egypt's EGX30 was a major regional gainer. Analysts suggest that the Gulf states' calls for peaceful resolution and condemnation of Israeli aggression have shielded them from major market turmoil, and the market might be pricing in the removal of the Iranian threat.

          <p>The U.S. attack on Iran's nuclear sites involved decoy bombers and "misdirection" to maintain secrecy, according to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine. Decoy B-2 stealth bombers flew towards Guam to divert attention, while the actual bombers deployed earlier and flew under the cover of darkness for 18 hours. The mission involved multiple in-flight refuelings and the dropping of 14 bunker buster bombs. A U.S. submarine also launched Tomahawk cruise missiles at key surface targets, with the element of surprise maintained throughout the mission. Iran did not deploy fighters or surface-to-air missiles, suggesting they were caught off guard.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has released details about "Operation Midnight Hammer," the U.S. military strike on three Iranian nuclear facilities, calling it the "largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history." The operation began with decoy B-2 stealth bombers flying west to the Pacific, while the main strike force of seven B-2 bombers flew eastward for 18 hours. A U.S. submarine launched Tomahawk cruise missiles to clear the way, and the B-2s dropped 14 Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) on Fordow and Natanz. The operation involved over 125 aircraft and marked the first operational use of the GBU 57 MOP weapon. The operation was deemed a success because Iranian fighters did not fly and Iran's surface-to-air missile systems did not engage the strike package.</p>

          <p>Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska discusses her role as a moderate in a polarized Washington, D.C. and the challenges she faces in the Republican Party. She emphasizes her allegiance is to the people of Alaska, not to a political party, and reflects on her write-in campaign victory in 2010. Murkowski never voted for Donald Trump and has warned against ceding congressional authority to the executive branch. She believes Congress is not doing its job and is concerned about the potential impact of President Trump's policies on Alaska, which relies heavily on federal funding. The senator has released a new memoir entitled "Far from Home: An Alaskan Senator Faces the Extreme Climate of Washington, D.C.".</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships reveals that certain phrases can trigger defiance in children. Traditional parenting phrases like "Because I said so" and threats can activate a child's fight-or-flight response. Instead, using language that honors a child's autonomy while setting boundaries can foster cooperation. Examples of better phrases include explaining decisions, giving children agency over when they're ready to meet expectations, validating emotions, and inviting problem-solving instead of blame. The key is to create conditions where cooperation feels natural by fostering respect, emotional safety, and involvement.</p>

          <p>Sixty years ago, The Doors formed in Venice, California, comprising Jim Morrison, Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger, and John Densmore. The band's improvisational attitude and Morrison's poetic lyrics set them apart. Their breakthrough came at the Whisky a Go Go, where their performances inspired a devoted following. Despite Morrison's struggles with substance abuse, The Doors achieved massive success with songs like "Light My Fire." The band's 60th anniversary is celebrated in a new book, "Night Divides the Day," and surviving members Densmore and Krieger continue to honor their legacy with performances.

          <p>Despite facing challenges like tariffs, inflation, labor shortages, and higher financing costs, small business owners in the U.S. are maintaining a generally optimistic outlook. Recent surveys indicate that many small businesses have experienced growth and maintained or increased their workforce. However, optimism is tempered by a weakening outlook on future economic growth, and many have reported declines in financial health. While concerns about inflation have shifted to taxation, small businesses remain resilient and are not "jumping ship." The sentiment is stronger among younger business leaders, who are more likely to anticipate a positive economic impact.</p>

The "brag doc" can be used for networking, following up with hiring managers, and preparing for interviews.
