          <h2>Future of TikTok in the U.S. May Depend on a Licensing Deal for Its Algorithm</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A potential deal to prevent a U.S. ban on TikTok could involve its parent company, ByteDance, licensing its powerful recommendation algorithm to a new U.S. entity. This arrangement aims to resolve national security concerns while allowing ByteDance to retain some ownership of its core technology, which was a major point of contention in negotiations. Experts suggest this "rental" of the algorithm might not fully eliminate risks if it allows for external updates or data access from China.</p>

          <p>Retired boxing champion Floyd Mayweather has filed a lawsuit against a Las Vegas luxury car dealership, alleging "deceptive trade practices" in a multimillion-dollar vehicle transaction. Mayweather claims the dealer, Vegas Auto Gallery, misrepresented the price and history of a 2018 Maybach Landaulet, overcharging him by more than half a million dollars. The lawsuit also alleges the vehicle lacked proper title, customs clearance, and inspection certificates, making the sale legally questionable.</p>

          <p>A phone call between former President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping resulted in significant progress toward a deal for TikTok's U.S. operations, but a final agreement was not reached. Trump expressed optimism on social media, suggesting an approval was secured, while a White House official indicated more work is needed to resolve the dispute. The deal aims to address U.S. national security concerns by having ByteDance divest the app's American business or face a ban.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats in the UK are proposing a new community policing initiative that would establish police counters in public venues like supermarkets, libraries, and shopping centers. The party argues this would increase police visibility, make crime reporting easier, and improve public confidence following a decline in traditional police station front counters. They suggest the plan could be funded by abolishing the elected Police and Crime Commissioner roles, reallocating the savings to this more direct community engagement.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, is reportedly in the process of raising $10 billion from investors, which would value the company at $200 billion. This fundraising effort reflects the massive valuations being assigned to companies developing foundational AI models, following similar large rounds for competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI. While Musk has denied the current fundraising round, the capital would likely be used to acquire vast amounts of computing power and talent needed to build next-generation AI systems.

Investors are weighing signs of a resilient economy against the Fed's monetary policy, with recent data on jobless claims calming fears of a significant slowdown. The increase in long-term yields suggests that expectations for future economic growth, inflation, and government debt are influencing the market more than the recent short-term rate adjustment.
