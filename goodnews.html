        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that while parents in Europe find their lives more meaningful than childfree individuals, they also experience lower life satisfaction. This disparity is especially pronounced for mothers and varies across countries, with Scandinavian nations showing less difference between parents and non-parents. Factors like childcare availability, financial support, parental leave policies, and gender equality contribute to these differences. The study suggests that societal support and a shared responsibility for children's well-being positively impact parental satisfaction.</p>

          <p>A legal dispute over a major lithium project in the Democratic Republic of Congo is on hold as the US seeks to counter China's control of critical minerals. Perth-based AVZ Minerals suspended its arbitration case following US encouragement to resolve the dispute.
