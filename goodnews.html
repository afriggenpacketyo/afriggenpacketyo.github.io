          <p>Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst expectations. The company reported net sales of 7.7 billion euros and net bookings of 5.5 billion euros, both significantly higher than forecasted. ASML is a critical player in the global chip supply chain, producing the exclusive extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines necessary for manufacturing the world's most advanced semiconductors. The strong performance comes as the company continues to navigate market uncertainties, including those related to U.S. tariff policies, and rolls out its next-generation High NA EUV tools.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, speaking at a supply chain expo in Beijing, lauded the "world class" quality of generative AI models developed by Chinese companies like Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent. His praise comes as Nvidia expects to soon resume shipments of its H20 AI chip to China, following a temporary halt due to U.S. export requirements. Huang highlighted the significant role of China's open-source approach in advancing global AI progress and innovation. This visit marks Huang's third trip to China this year, underscoring the complex relationship between the U.S. chip giant and the crucial Chinese market amid ongoing tech tensions.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Burns, the former U.S. ambassador to China under the Biden administration, stated that Washington and Beijing are on a "creeping path towards some kind of a deal." Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, Burns expressed that mutual economic self-interest will likely guide both nations toward a trade agreement, offering rare praise for President Trump's tariff strategy. His comments come during a 90-day trade truce, with an August deadline for a more comprehensive agreement. Burns highlighted the symbiotic economic relationship, noting the thousands of American companies in China and the U.S. being China's largest export market.</p>

          <h2>Trump Intervenes After House Republicans Initially Block Cryptocurrency Legislation</h2>

          <p>President Trump announced that a group of 11 House Republicans, who had initially voted to block several cryptocurrency regulation bills, have agreed to support the legislation after a meeting at the White House. The bills, including the GENIUS Act which seeks to regulate stablecoins, failed a key procedural vote earlier when 13 Republicans joined Democrats in opposition. Trump, who has championed the legislation as vital for making America a leader in digital assets, confirmed the reversal on social media. The episode highlights the president's significant influence over the Republican conference and puts the crypto-focused bills back on track for a vote.</p>

          <p>The National League secured a 4-3 victory over the American League in the MLB All-Star Game, decided for the first time by a home run swing-off. The game ended in a 6-6 tie after the AL rallied from a 6-0 deficit, with the tying run scoring in the ninth inning. In the tiebreaker, Kyle Schwarber hit three home runs to clinch the win and was named the game's MVP, despite going 0-for-2 during regular play. This new tiebreaker format was introduced in 2022 to avoid games running long due to pitching shortages, providing a dramatic conclusion to the midsummer classic.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced the withdrawal of 2,000 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, half of the total number deployed there last month. The troops were sent to the city amid protests related to the administration's immigration policies, a move that bypassed the authority of California Governor Gavin Newsom and prompted a lawsuit. In a statement, Newsom criticized the deployment as making troops "political pawns" and called for the remaining soldiers to be sent home. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass also applauded the withdrawal, attributing it to the unified and peaceful opposition from the city's residents.</p>

The seat was left vacant by the death of her father, the late U.S. Rep. Raúl Grijalva, a long-serving and influential progressive lawmaker. The district is heavily Democratic, stretching across much of the state's border with Mexico. Grijalva, who ran on a progressive platform focused on democracy, immigrant rights, and healthcare, will now face Republican nominee Daniel Butierez in the special general election on September 23. The outcome will not change control of the House but will fill one of three Democratic vacancies.</p>

          <p>Speaking at an expo in Beijing, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicted that artificial intelligence and robotics will replace human labor in the world's factories within the next ten years. He argued that AI is becoming fundamental infrastructure, revolutionizing supply chains and how goods are manufactured and moved. Huang highlighted that many projects in China are already using Nvidia's "omniverse" platform to create digital twins of factories for design and optimization. This vision of automated manufacturing, he suggested, will particularly affect repetitive and hazardous jobs, fundamentally changing the nature of industrial work on a global scale.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order to establish national standards for the Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) program in college sports. This move follows the advancement of the SCORE Act by a House subcommittee, which aims to create a federal framework for athlete compensation, superseding varied state laws. The NIL rules, enacted in 2021, have dramatically reshaped college athletics by allowing student-athletes to earn significant income from endorsements and other activities. The executive order represents a major federal intervention into the rapidly evolving and often contentious landscape of collegiate sports compensation and regulation.</p>

This announcement follows a pattern of the administration using tariff threats to negotiate new trade terms, though Indonesian officials have not yet publicly confirmed the details of the agreement.</p>
