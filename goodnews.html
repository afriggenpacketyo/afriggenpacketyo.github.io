          <p>Nvidia announced it will soon resume selling its H20 AI chips to China after receiving assurances from the U.S. government that export licenses will be granted. This decision reverses a previous ban on the advanced chips, which had been specifically designed to comply with earlier export controls. The move is seen as a significant win for Nvidia, which had lobbied against the restrictions, and follows high-level discussions between the company's CEO and U.S. officials. The resumption of sales is expected to be a major growth catalyst for the company in the Chinese market.</p>

          <p>China's commercial space company, Space Pioneer, announced its Tianlong-3 rocket has passed a critical ground-based stress test. The test involved the rocket's nine-engine first stage and simulated key mission phases like lift-off, flight, and recovery, confirming the structural integrity of the vehicle. This successful test marks a significant milestone for the company, especially after a mishap in June of the previous year where the rocket unexpectedly lifted off and crashed during a static-fire test. The Tianlong-3 is designed for reuse and must withstand enormous stress during its operational cycle.</p>

          <p>Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg revealed the company's plan to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on constructing enormous AI data centers in the United States. The first of these, named Prometheus, is set to be operational in Ohio by 2026, with another multi-gigawatt cluster, Hyperion, planned for Louisiana. Zuckerberg stated that one of the sites will cover an area nearly the size of Manhattan, underscoring the massive scale of Meta's investment in developing "superintelligence." This strategic push aims to position Meta at the forefront of the AI industry, though it raises concerns about the immense energy and water consumption of such facilities.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary block on the Trump administration's decision to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghans. The ruling provides a one-week administrative stay, preventing the revocation of deportation protections and work permits that were scheduled to end. The administration argues that conditions in Afghanistan have improved, while immigrant advocacy groups contend the country remains unsafe. This legal pause allows time for further court filings in a lawsuit that challenges the termination, providing what one nonprofit called a "brief but critical window of relief" for the approximately 11,700 Afghans enrolled in the program.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh has won the 2025 All-Star Home Run Derby, defeating Tampa Bay's Junior Caminero in the final round. Raleigh, who entered the All-Star break as the major league leader in home runs, became the first catcher and the first switch-hitter to ever win the competition. He advanced through the early rounds with dramatic moments, including a tiebreaker win determined by the longest home run distance. Raleigh's victory marks the second time a Mariners player has won the derby, following in the footsteps of three-time champion Ken Griffey Jr.</p>

          <h2>New Research Suggests Animals Can Respond to Sounds Produced by Plants</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study from Tel Aviv University has provided the first evidence that animals react to sounds made by plants, potentially revealing a hidden ecosystem of communication. Researchers found that female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were emitting ultrasonic distress sounds, suggesting the moths could perceive the plants as unhealthy. While plants are not sentient, they produce these sounds through physical processes when under stress, such as dehydration. This discovery opens up new fields of research into how various animals might use plant sounds to make decisions about pollination, feeding, or seeking shelter.</p>

          <p>China's economy grew by 5.2% in the second quarter, surpassing analysts' expectations and keeping the country on track to meet its annual growth target of around 5%. Despite the strong GDP figure, other economic indicators showed mixed results, with retail sales growth slowing while industrial output expanded robustly. The positive growth data may reduce immediate pressure on Beijing to implement large-scale stimulus measures, though challenges like insufficient domestic demand and external uncertainties remain.

          <p>Researchers at Dalian University of Technology in China have developed a new manufacturing technique that could significantly enhance the performance of aircraft engines, including those for next-generation fighter jets. The method involves a novel way to rapidly cool forged turbine discs, which are critical components made from superalloys that must withstand extreme conditions. Improving the quality and durability of these discs has been a long-standing challenge in the aerospace industry. This technological advancement is crucial for China's efforts to develop high-performance, domestically-produced aircraft engines and close the technology gap with Western nations.</p>

The grueling 135-mile ultramarathon starts in Death Valley, 282 feet below sea level, and climbs to an elevation of 8,360 feet at the Mt. Whitney trailhead. Becker completed the race with about three hours to spare, settling a personal score after falling just short of the 48-hour cutoff time in a previous attempt.

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles experienced its busiest June in its 117-year history, processing a record number of shipping containers. Port executives attribute this surge to a "tariff whipsaw effect," as shippers rushed to import goods, particularly from China, ahead of President Trump's looming tariff deadlines. While the increase provided a short-term boost, officials anticipate a significant drop in cargo volume in the coming months once new tariffs are in place. The situation highlights the uncertainty and disruption caused by the ongoing trade disputes, forcing businesses to navigate volatile supply chains and rising costs. (not investment advice)</p>
