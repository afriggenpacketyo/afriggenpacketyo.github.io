          <p>Following an $8 billion takeover, new Paramount chief David Ellison and his team have unveiled their plan to revitalize the media company by focusing on major film franchises and increasing production. The leadership intends to nearly double the studio's annual film output, with a strong emphasis on popular properties like “Top Gun,” “Star Trek,” and “Transformers,” while also pursuing original, filmmaker-driven projects. Ellison stressed a commitment to creating entertainment for a broad audience, aiming to move the company away from political divisions and re-establish Paramount as a top destination for Hollywood talent.</p>

          <p>Firefighters successfully contained a one-acre brush fire in Ernest E. Debs Regional Park in Highland Park on Wednesday afternoon. The blaze, which burned for approximately 40 minutes in dense, dry brush, prompted the brief closure of a nearby freeway exit but posed no immediate threat to homes and required no evacuations. Air and ground crews worked to extinguish the flames, and one firefighter was treated for apparent heat exhaustion at the scene. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation as crews remain to manage any remaining hotspots.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant flood threat in Juneau, Alaska, has subsided after the Mendenhall River's water levels receded from record highs. The flooding was caused by an "outburst flood" from the glacier-dammed Suicide Basin, which released a massive volume of water, pushing the river to a peak of 16.65 feet. Newly installed temporary barriers, known as Hesco barriers, were largely successful in preventing what could have been a catastrophic event, protecting hundreds of homes from severe damage. This annual event, intensified by climate change, highlights the ongoing environmental challenges faced by the region.</p>

          <p>A Texas state judge has ordered that the assets of Infowars, the company of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, be turned over to a court-appointed receiver for liquidation. The proceeds will go toward paying the $1.3 billion defamation judgment won by the families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims, whom Jones had falsely claimed were actors. This ruling paves the way for the seizure and sale of all company property, including the Infowars brand name itself. The families' lawyers expressed that this move will finally lead to accountability for Jones's prolonged and cruel harassment campaign.</p>

          <p>A large-scale study conducted in Sweden suggests that drug treatment for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can significantly reduce a range of negative life outcomes. Researchers found that individuals on ADHD medication had lower first-time instances of suicidal behavior, substance misuse, transport accidents, and criminal behavior. The findings, based on nearly 150,000 people, provide strong evidence for the wider benefits of medication beyond managing daily symptoms like impulsivity and inattention. This research could help patients and doctors make more informed decisions about treatment by highlighting the potential risks of untreated ADHD.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to U.S. tariffs aimed at curbing China's shipbuilding dominance, South Korean shipbuilders are increasing their investments in Southeast Asian nations like the Philippines. This strategic shift is seen as a way to overcome domestic constraints such as labor shortages and high costs, thereby enhancing their competitiveness against Chinese rivals. For example, HD Hyundai is investing $550 million to revive a defunct shipyard in the Philippines, which is expected to create 7,000 jobs. Analysts note that moving operations to regions with lower labor costs could be a viable long-term solution for these companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a heartbreaking loss to Paris St-Germain in the UEFA Super Cup, Tottenham Hotspur showed promising signs under new manager Thomas Frank. The team led 2-0 until the final minutes before a late comeback and a penalty shootout loss, but for 85 minutes, they effectively executed Frank's pragmatic, organized, and set-piece-focused strategy. Both of Tottenham's goals came from dead-ball situations, a hallmark of Frank's previous success at Brentford. While the late collapse indicates work is still needed, the performance suggests a clear tactical direction that could be built upon for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>This article explores the ongoing revolution in media consumption, where trust is shifting from traditional institutions to individual online creators. While this environment is ripe for misinformation, it has also given rise to a class of "evidence-based creators"—journalists and experts who provide factual, nuanced content on platforms like Instagram and TikTok. The author argues that these creators are building trust directly with audiences but lack the infrastructure for growth, legal protection, and collaboration. To thrive, this new media ecosystem needs innovations like independent certification systems and shared professional frameworks to help audiences identify credible voices.</p>

          <p>Brinker International, the parent company of Chili's, reported strong quarterly earnings, with same-store sales at the restaurant chain increasing by 23.7%. CEO Kevin Hochman credited this growth to a significant boost in marketing spending, which increased from $32 million to $137 million over three years, and the success of its standardized $10.99 value meal. The company has effectively used social media influencers and emphasized a simple, coupon-free value proposition to attract customers. This growth strategy is helping the company combat inflationary pressures on labor and goods by leveraging fixed costs and improving margins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin prepare to meet in Alaska, this article revisits the history of the territory's sale from Russia to the United States in 1867. The purchase, famously known as "Seward's Folly," was initially met with skepticism but ultimately proved to be a strategic acquisition for the U.S. The piece notes that even today, some in Russia question the legitimacy of the sale and view Alaska as historically Russian land. This historical context adds a layer of complexity to the upcoming high-stakes diplomatic meeting being held on former Russian soil.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams have seen their franchise valuation soar to $10.43 billion, making them the second most valuable team in the NFL, behind only the Dallas Cowboys, according to a new Sportico ranking. This marks a dramatic turnaround from a decade ago when the team, then in St. Louis, was valued at just $930 million. The increase is largely attributed to owner Stan Kroenke's vision and investment in the state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium and the surrounding Hollywood Park entertainment district. This valuation reflects the team's successful re-establishment in the lucrative Los Angeles market and its on-field competitiveness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An appeals court has denied rapper Tory Lanez's attempt to introduce new evidence in his case concerning the 2020 shooting of fellow artist Megan Thee Stallion. Lanez, who is currently serving a 10-year prison sentence, had sought to present a new statement from a security guard, but the petition was rejected by the California Court of Appeals. This decision marks another legal setback for Lanez, whose previous motion for a new trial was also denied in 2023. He was convicted in 2022 on three felony counts, including assault with a firearm, for the incident.</p>
