          <p>China Telecom Quantum Group has introduced what it claims is the world's first commercial cryptography system impervious to hacking, even by quantum computers. The system integrates Quantum Key Distribution and Post-Quantum Cryptography, creating an end-to-end quantum-secure architecture. China Telecom also completed the first cross-regional quantum-encrypted phone call between Beijing and Hefei, spanning over 1,000km, using the integrated system. This technology aims to address cybersecurity challenges posed by the rapid advancement of quantum computing, which threatens traditional encryption systems.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence has voiced concerns over President Donald Trump's consideration of accepting a $400 million jet from the royal family of Qatar, citing national security risks. Pence emphasized Qatar's history of "playing both sides" and suggested that accepting such a gift would be inconsistent with U.S. security and intelligence needs. He proposed that if Qatar wishes to make a gift, they should invest the $400 million in infrastructure on a U.S. military base. Experts have warned that converting the jet into Air Force One could take years and cost U.S. taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

          <p>Strawberry growers in the UK are anticipating a particularly sweet season in 2025, thanks to warm days and cool nights, which contribute to higher natural sugar levels in the fruit. Despite a dry spring, growers have irrigation systems in place to mitigate potential drought effects. The warmer weather has also accelerated the ripening process, leading to an earlier harvest. This positive outlook contrasts with the delayed ripening experienced in 2024 due to a wet winter. Consumers can look forward to enjoying exceptionally sweet strawberries this summer.</p>

          <p>Amid volatile markets, Wall Street analysts are recommending dividend stocks to provide a combination of upside potential and stable income. Three highlighted stocks include Chord Energy (CHRD), Chevron (CVX), and EOG Resources. Chord Energy is praised for returning 100% of its adjusted free cash flow to shareholders and offers a dividend yield of 6.8%. Chevron's outlook indicated a slowdown in the pace of its stock buybacks in Q2 2025 compared to the prior quarter amid tariff woes and the decision of OPEC+ to boost supply. At a quarterly dividend of $1.71 per share (annualized dividend of $6.84 per share), CVX stock offers a dividend yield of 4.8%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>US Treasury Reports $258 Billion Surplus in April, Second Largest in History</h2>

          <p>The U.S. government reported a $258.4 billion budget surplus in April 2025, driven by large individual tax deposits, marking the second-largest monthly surplus in U.S. history. Despite the surplus, the fiscal year-to-date deficit remains at $1.049 trillion due to higher spending than revenue. The surplus was attributed to the due date for final payments on prior-year taxes and the first installment of quarterly estimated taxes. The largest spending categories for the month were Social Security, net interest, Medicare, health, and national defense. (not investment advice)</p>
