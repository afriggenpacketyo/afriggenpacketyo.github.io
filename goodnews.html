          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced the resumption of trade talks with the United States after his government rescinded a planned digital services tax. The tax would have imposed a 3% levy on revenue from Canadian users of major tech firms like Google and Amazon. The reversal followed President Trump's threat to suspend negotiations, a move analysts describe as a significant political victory for the White House. Both countries are now working towards a July 21 deadline to negotiate a new economic and security relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's Foreign Minister, Johann Wadephul, made an unannounced visit to Kyiv to underscore his country's commitment to supporting Ukraine against Russia's ongoing invasion. Wadephul stated that Germany, Ukraine's second-largest backer, will continue to provide modern air defense, weapons, and economic aid. The visit highlights Europe's efforts to maintain support for Ukraine, particularly as the commitment from the United States has been questioned. Germany's top diplomat condemned the Russian president, asserting his goal is to conquer and subjugate Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Belarusian opposition blogger Sergei Tikhanovsky has been released from prison after five years, much of it spent in solitary confinement. He was freed as part of a deal following a rare visit to Minsk by a senior U.S. delegation. In an interview, Tikhanovsky described the harsh conditions of his imprisonment and his emotional reunion with his family, but insisted his spirit is not broken. His wife, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who became the face of the opposition, expressed joy at his return but cautioned against lifting sanctions on the Lukashenko regime.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that he has a group of "very wealthy people" prepared to purchase TikTok, with their identities to be revealed soon. The potential sale is necessary to comply with a 2024 law requiring the app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations due to national security concerns. Trump has extended the divestiture deadline to September 17, expressing a desire to keep the platform operational under new ownership. Any deal would likely require approval from the Chinese government, and it remains unclear if ByteDance is willing to sell.</p>

          <p>As England's women's national football team prepares to defend its European title, key questions remain about the starting lineup for manager Sarina Wiegman. A decisive 7-0 victory over Jamaica in their final warm-up match offered strong hints, with players like Jess Carter and Ella Toone making compelling cases for their inclusion. The fitness of key players like Lauren James and Georgia Stanway has been a major concern, but their recent minutes on the pitch are a positive sign. Despite pre-tournament retirements of several experienced players, the squad remains confident.</p>

This would place him in an elite group, as only six of the last 30 wrestlers promoted to the highest rank have won their inaugural tournament. The 25-year-old is the first Japanese-born yokozuna since his stablemaster, the former Kisenosato, in 2017. Onosato expressed his desire to energize his home prefecture of Ishikawa, which was affected by the Noto Peninsula earthquake earlier this year.</p>

          <p>China has announced it will "conditionally" resume imports of seafood from certain regions of Japan, partially lifting a ban imposed in 2023. The initial suspension came ahead of Japan's release of treated wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant, which was later expanded to a full ban on all Japanese aquatic products. The new measure still excludes imports from ten Japanese prefectures, including Fukushima and Tokyo. The move could be a step toward resetting diplomatic and trade relations, which were strained by the wastewater release issue.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, and new research is exploring why. Studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs are a primary cause. In particular, the regenerative braking system, which converts kinetic energy back into electrical energy to charge the battery, can cause low-frequency deceleration. This specific type of movement is known to provoke the queasy feelings associated with motion sickness, posing a comfort challenge for the expanding EV market.</p>
