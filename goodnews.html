          <p>The Supreme Court has blocked the Trump administration from deporting a group of Venezuelan migrants accused of gang membership, citing due process concerns.

          <p>Former President Joe Biden dismissed Special Counsel Robert Hur's report, which raised concerns about his mental acuity, shortly after being interviewed about his handling of classified documents. Audio recordings from Biden's October 2023 interviews with Hur revealed Biden struggling to remember key dates and events. In February 2024, Biden responded to questions about the report by asserting his competence and dismissing the special counsel's description of him as elderly with a poor memory. The article notes that Hur's report amplified Republican concerns about Biden's mental fitness, eventually leading to his withdrawal from the presidential race. </p>

          <p>A dust storm swept through the Chicago area, causing the skyline to disappear and prompting the National Weather Service to issue a dust storm warning, only the second time their Chicago office has ever done so.

The article notes that residents described the event as something out of the history books, with dirt and debris blowing in the wind.
