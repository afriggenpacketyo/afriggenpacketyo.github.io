          <p>Japan's consumer affairs center is alerting consumers about fraudulent websites selling rice at significantly reduced prices as rice prices surge. Complaints have increased since March, with some customers reporting non-delivery despite payment. Some victims received unrelated items like sunglasses instead of rice. The center advises consumers to carefully verify business operators and avoid unrealistically low prices, as rice prices have doubled due to poor harvests and limited government intervention.

          <p>Las Vegas is experiencing a decline in casual tourism due to rising prices driven by inflation, with hotel occupancy rates slightly down despite higher average nightly rates. While convention traffic remains strong, fewer international visitors are impacting the city's revenue, as they tend to stay longer and spend more. Construction and road closures are also causing heavy traffic, deterring some tourists. Despite these challenges, the city anticipates a resilient summer season with numerous concerts, festivals, and sporting events planned.</p>

Medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics continue to recommend COVID vaccines for these groups based on safety and efficacy data.

          <p>Norway is addressing the growing trend of school-leavers' Russ bus partying, where students spend weeks partying before exams. Concerns have arisen regarding the detrimental effects on teenagers' wellbeing, grades, and finances, with many going into debt to afford the buses. The government plans to move celebrations to the post-exam period to mitigate these issues. The Russ bus tradition dates back to the 1980s and has become a national phenomenon, causing concerns about social exclusion, peer pressure, and high costs.</p>

          <h2>Therapy Culture Linked to Rising Childlessness Rates</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece in The New York Times explores a potential link between therapy culture and rising childlessness rates among millennials and Gen Z. The author suggests that redefined standards of harm and trauma have led to an impossible standard for parenting. Adult children are increasingly likely to cut off contact with parents, often citing emotional abuse or feeling unsupported. This cultural shift may contribute to a dread of parenthood, as individuals fear they cannot meet the unreachable standards they hold their own parents to.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has agreed to transfer historic photos of enslaved people to the International African American Museum in South Carolina. The agreement ends a legal battle with Tamara Lanier, who claims to be a descendant of two people in the photos. The images, taken in 1850, are among the earliest depicting enslaved people in the United States. The photos were originally commissioned by a Harvard professor as part of discredited research to prove white superiority.</p>

          <p>Stablecoins, designed to maintain a stable value against assets like the U.S. dollar, have become a focal point in Washington, attracting new donors, investors, and voters. At Bitcoin 2025, Vice President JD Vance endorsed crypto, stating that stablecoins strengthen the U.S. economy. Lawmakers are working on legislation like the GENIUS Act to regulate stablecoin issuers, with potential votes in the Senate and House. The integration of stablecoins could unlock trillions in global demand for American debt, and the SEC is beginning to take a more industry-friendly approach to crypto. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A clinical trial suggests that an immunotherapy drug could significantly extend the lives of people with advanced head and neck cancer. The drug, pembrolizumab, doubled the length of time patients were cancer-free, from 2.5 years to five years. This marks a breakthrough in the treatment of this difficult-to-treat cancer after 20 years of limited progress. The immunotherapy drug is given before and after surgery, which researchers say helps the body learn to attack the cancer if it returns.</p>
