          <p>South Korea's Supreme Court has dismissed a $21,600 copyright claim against Pinkfong's viral hit "Baby Shark." US composer Jonathan Wright alleged the 2015 song copied his 2011 rendition, but the court ruled his version lacked sufficient originality for protection, upholding previous decisions. Both songs are based on a traditional children's melody, confirming Pinkfong's stance that their song is in the public domain. This ruling concludes a multi-year legal battle over the globally popular children's song.</p>

          <p>Wayne Rooney expressed "real disappointment" over Tom Brady's comments questioning his work ethic as Birmingham City's head coach. Rooney, sacked after 83 days, stated Brady, a minority owner, visited on a lighter training day and misunderstood football's demands compared to NFL. He highlighted Birmingham's prior disarray and the struggles of subsequent managers, noting the club's current success after significant investment. Rooney, while respecting Brady, found the portrayal unfair, emphasizing the different nature of football compared to NFL.</p>

          <p>This article explains BTecs, practical qualifications assessed through exams, coursework, and projects, as students await their results. BTec Firsts are Level 2 (GCSE equivalent), while BTec Nationals are Level 3 (A-level equivalent), often used for university entry or direct employment. The grading scale ranges from Pass to Starred Distinction. Recent Labour government policy has paused plans to scrap many BTecs, acknowledging their importance in various sectors and for diverse student needs, ensuring these vocational pathways continue alongside T-levels.</p>

The order cites "inefficient permitting processes" as deterrents to investment and innovation in the US space market.

The article notes a significant drop in alcohol use among women and highlights the rising popularity of non-alcoholic alternatives and no-drinking challenges. Economic factors and changing social norms also contribute to this decline.</p>
