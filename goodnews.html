          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed southeast of Bermuda and is moving northeast over the open ocean. The National Hurricane Center reported that the storm currently has maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. Forecasters predict Fernand will strengthen over the weekend, potentially becoming a hurricane by Monday before weakening later in the week. The storm is expected to remain well east of Bermuda and poses no immediate threat to land, following a similar path to Hurricane Erin from earlier in the month.</p>

          <p>President Trump has appointed Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia to lead the new U.S. National Design Studio, an agency tasked with revamping federal government websites. The studio aims to improve the usability, aesthetics, and user experience of public online services, drawing inspiration from platforms like the Apple App Store. This new agency is seen as a successor to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), previously headed by Elon Musk. Gebbia, who recently shifted his political alignment from Democrat to supporting Trump, has stated his goal is to make the U.S. the most beautiful and usable country in the digital world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Coyotes are increasingly adapting to urban environments across the U.S., with a pair nicknamed Romeo and Juliet becoming local fixtures in New York's Central Park. Originally native to the western U.S., their expansion eastward is attributed to the decline of predators and changes in land use. Local photographers and conservationists are documenting the animals to educate the public and promote safe coexistence, emphasizing that the coyotes are not a threat if left alone. In response to their growing presence, New York City has launched initiatives like WildlifeNYC to manage human-wildlife interactions and ensure the safety of both people and the animals.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new TikTok trend has emerged where Gen Z individuals hold public contests to find the best impression of a “performative male.” This archetype describes a man who adopts an alternative, intellectual, and sensitive aesthetic—such as reading feminist literature or listening to indie female artists—often to attract progressive women. While largely a lighthearted joke, the trend also taps into a deeper skepticism about whether these behaviors are genuine or a deceptive act. The discussion reflects a broader cultural conversation about evolving masculinity, privilege, and the difficulty of discerning authentic intentions in the modern dating landscape.</p>

          <p>The annual Notting Hill Carnival began in west London with its traditional children's parade, filling the streets with vibrant costumes, music, and dancing. Europe's largest street party kicked off at dawn with J'ouvert, a celebration where revelers cover themselves in colorful paint and powder to mark the start of the festivities. The event, which has been a staple of London culture for over 50 years, will also hold a 72-second silence on both days. This moment of reflection is to honor the 72 victims of the Grenfell Tower fire and others who have passed away in connection with the carnival's history.</p>

          <h2>Gina McCarthy Urges Continued Climate Action Despite Trump Administration's Policies</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy argues that despite the Trump administration's focus on fossil fuels and withdrawal from global climate leadership, the fight against climate change is far from over. She points out that states, cities, and corporations across the U.S. are continuing to pursue clean energy initiatives, driven by economic and environmental benefits. States like California, Florida, and Texas are setting records in renewable energy, and 84% of corporations are upholding their carbon reduction commitments. McCarthy emphasizes that market forces and local action are creating unstoppable momentum for a clean energy future, regardless of federal inaction.</p>

          <p>Todd Marinovich, the former USC and Raiders quarterback whose life has been a public narrative of prodigious talent and tragic downfall, has released a memoir to tell his own story. In an interview, Marinovich reflects on the cathartic but difficult process of writing about his past, including his complex relationship with his demanding father and his struggles with addiction. He clarifies misconceptions from his youth, such as the infamous "robo-quarterback" narrative, and details his wild experiences at USC and in the NFL. Now 47 and living in Hawaii, Marinovich explains that writing the book was an act of self-reconciliation after decades of defiance.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. Open brings tennis into the spotlight, the article highlights the sport's significant health benefits, positioning it as an ideal activity for all ages. Tennis provides a full-body, aerobic workout that improves bone density and cardiovascular health, with one study suggesting players live nearly a decade longer than sedentary peers. Beyond physical advantages, the sport enhances cognitive function by demanding complex motor coordination, rapid decision-making, and spatial awareness, which can help buffer against cognitive decline. Its low risk of catastrophic injury and social nature make it a uniquely sustainable and beneficial lifetime sport.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey indicates a significant drop in the frequency of parents reading aloud to young children, a trend the author argues is a missed opportunity for connection and development. Drawing from personal experience, the article posits that reading to a child is not just about fostering literacy but is a profound way for a parent to guide their child's understanding of the world. It is also a method for the parent to learn to read their own child's cues, expressions, and burgeoning personality. This shared activity creates a unique bond, transforming the act of reading from a solitary pleasure into a mutual experience of discovery.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article advocates for designing artificial intelligence to collaborate with human experts rather than attempting to fully automate their jobs, a goal for which current AI is often unready. Using examples from radiology and aviation, it illustrates how imperfect automation can undermine human expertise and lead to poor outcomes. Instead of aiming for full replacement, AI should be developed as a tool that complements human skills like context, ethics, and creativity. This collaborative approach, where AI provides data-driven insights and humans apply expert judgment, can lead to superior results and avoid the pitfalls of premature automation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book, "The First and Last Bank," proposes a novel approach to climate change by creating a system of community-based carbon banks. The idea, developed by anthropologist Gustav Peebles and artist Ben Luzzatto, suggests treating excess atmospheric carbon as a valuable, sacred commodity to be hoarded, much like the U.S. government sequesters gold. In their model, organic waste would be converted into biochar, a stable form of carbon, and deposited in local banks in exchange for a digital currency. This grassroots system aims to create a tangible, community-driven method for carbon sequestration without relying on government or corporate action.</p>

          <p>Chelsea FC has agreed to deals with Borussia Dortmund for midfielder Carney Chukwuemeka and defender Aaron Anselmino, bringing the club's total income from player sales this summer to over £270 million. Chukwuemeka is set for a permanent transfer for a fee of around £24 million, while Anselmino will join the German club on a season-long loan. These sales are crucial for Chelsea to comply with UEFA's financial regulations, which require the club to record a positive transfer balance to register new players for the Champions League.

          <p>Parts of the UK are expected to experience temperatures as high as 30°C on the August Bank Holiday Monday, potentially setting a record for the warmest late August holiday in Wales. This brief heatwave is attributed to warm, tropical air pushed towards the UK by the system that was formerly Hurricane Erin. However, the weather is set to turn unsettled by Tuesday as the remnants of the storm bring wet and windy conditions across most of the country. The change will mark the end of the current warm spell, with stronger winds and heavy, thundery downpours forecast for the remainder of the week.</p>
