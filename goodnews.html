          <p>A jury has awarded nearly $20 million in damages to six bystanders who were injured during a 2022 shooting involving Denver police in the city's Lower Downtown area. The incident occurred when officers opened fire on a suspect who had drawn a handgun, but the gunfire also struck several people in the surrounding crowd. One officer involved, Brandon Ramos, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and resigned from the force after a grand jury found he was not in immediate danger and failed to account for the crowd. The verdict sends a strong message regarding police conduct and accountability for public safety.</p>

          <p>Marianne Smyth, a serial fraudster known as the "Queen of the Con," was sentenced to four years in prison in Northern Ireland for swindling mortgage clients out of more than $155,000. The conviction was aided by the work of U.S. podcaster Johnathan Walton, who was himself a victim of Smyth in Los Angeles and chronicled her schemes in his podcast. Walton expressed disappointment with the sentence, arguing it was too lenient for a woman he described as an "inveterate con woman" with a long history of scams, including impersonating Jennifer Aniston. Smyth had fled to the U.S. after her crimes in Northern Ireland and was extradited after Walton's podcast listeners helped locate her in Maine.</p>

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is expected to meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, following recent retaliatory measures from both nations, including China's export controls on rare-earth elements and U.S. threats of further tariffs.

          <p>A new study indicates that the Galleri blood test can successfully detect more than 50 different types of cancer, potentially revolutionizing early diagnosis. Results from a trial in North America involving 25,000 adults showed the test identified cancer in nearly one in 100 participants, with cancer later confirmed in 62% of those positive cases. Crucially, more than half of the cancers were found at an early stage, and three-quarters were types that currently have no routine screening program, such as pancreatic and ovarian cancer. The NHS is currently conducting a larger trial, with results expected next year to determine its future use.</p>

          <p>A weekend trip to a Butlin's holiday park inadvertently saved the life of 31-year-old Charlotte Morjaria from Newport. After feeling a "pop" in her side while being playfully picked up during a game, she sought medical attention for what she suspected was a broken rib. A subsequent CT scan to check for internal damage revealed no fracture but discovered a large, previously unknown cancerous tumor on her kidney. Morjaria, who had attributed symptoms like fatigue and back pain to other factors, underwent surgery to remove her kidney and is now cancer-free, highlighting the unexpected way the diagnosis came about.</p>

          <p>After his father's death, Antony Easton discovered a hidden suitcase that revealed his family's secret history as wealthy German Jews named Eisner, whose fortune was stolen during the Nazi era. The contents led him on a decade-long investigation, uncovering a multi-billion-pound steel empire, lavish properties, and a collection of art lost to forced sales and Aryanization. Easton learned his grandparents entrusted their assets to a non-Jewish associate, Martin Hartig, who then claimed them as his own. While legal recourse for the property is gone, the investigation has led to the successful restitution of some artworks, including a painting from a Berlin museum.</p>
