          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that long-term interest rates are likely to increase as the economy evolves and policy remains in flux. He highlighted the possibility of more frequent and persistent supply shocks, creating challenges for the economy and central banks. While Powell didn't directly mention President Trump's tariffs, he acknowledged their potential to slow growth and increase inflation. The Fed has been cautious about easing policy after reducing its benchmark rate by a full percentage point last year, amidst these considerations.</p>

Despite partial paralysis, Smith has made significant progress through physical therapy and is back singing with his rock band.

Sales at U.S. stores rose over 3 percent, and e-commerce sales jumped more than 20 percent. Walmart kept its full-year financial forecast unchanged, but executives said tariffs are weighing on the company.

          <p>LA28, the committee planning the 2028 Summer Olympics in L.A., is partnering with Archer Aviation to assemble a fleet of electric air taxis to divert traffic. These air taxis will offer 10- to 20-minute flights between vertiports throughout the city, including SoFi Stadium and LAX. The initiative is part of a large-scale effort to create a ‚Äúcar-free‚Äù Olympics and improve sustainable transportation. Archer's air taxis will also provide emergency services and security support at the Games, with prices potentially on par with high-end ride shares like Uber Lux.</p>
