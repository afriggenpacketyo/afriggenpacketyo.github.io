          <p>King Charles III's visit to Canada is seen as a strong statement of Canadian sovereignty in response to President Trump's suggestions of annexation. Prime Minister Mark Carney invited King Charles to deliver the speech from the throne, emphasizing Canada's distinct national identity and constitutional monarchy. The visit underscores the historical differences between Canada and the United States, dating back to Canada's continued status as a colony after America gained independence. While Canadians have mixed feelings about the monarchy, Carney aims to showcase Canada's unique relationship with the Crown. The article notes that the King's presence and actions are carefully orchestrated to reflect his role as King of Canada.</p>
