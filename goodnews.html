          <p>A rare dust storm swept through northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, dramatically reducing visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue warnings. The storm, originating near Bloomington, Illinois, was driven by winds up to 70 miles per hour from thunderstorms, lifting dry soil into the air. Visibility dropped to a quarter-mile at Chicago Midway International Airport, marking the first time a dust storm warning was issued for the city. The event is considered unusual, with soil moisture levels in the area being exceptionally low, reminiscent of conditions during the Dust Bowl era.</p>

          <p>South Korea's presidential candidates are set to engage in their first televised debate, focusing on strategies to revitalize the country's struggling economy. The snap election, scheduled for June 3, follows the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol. Lee Jae-myung, the Democratic Party's candidate and frontrunner, aims to boost artificial intelligence investment and provide tax credits for domestic semiconductor manufacturing. Kim Moon-soo, representing the People Power Party, plans to establish a government agency for regulatory innovation and increase research and development spending. The former President was ousted last month over his short-lived imposition of martial law.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Rwandan refugees, who had been living in eastern Congo since the 1994 genocide, were repatriated on Saturday, according to the U.N. refugee agency. The return occurred after Rwandan-backed rebels seized key parts of the region. Most of the 360 refugees were women and children, transported across the border in buses provided by Rwandan authorities. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and Save the Children escorted the returnees, with plans to repatriate 2,000 people. The returnees will receive emergency assistance and reintegration support, marking the end of a long exile for some who were born in Congo and had never seen Rwanda.</p>

          <p>Five years after Brexit, Britain and the European Union are cautiously moving toward renewed cooperation, driven by a changing global landscape under President Trump's administration. A summit in London is expected to produce a defense and security agreement to bolster military security in Europe. The US is pulling back from global leadership on defense and free trade, and this may be a powerful incentive for greater cooperation with the bloc, along with the chance to reduce some of the costly trade barriers erected by Brexit. Discussions also include relaxing food trade rules and deepening energy cooperation, despite persistent sticking points like fishing rights and youth travel.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have announced the development of a stable fiber-optic gyroscope suitable for navigation in aircraft, ships, and oil rigs. The gyroscope, created by the Tianjin Navigation Instruments Research Institute and Jinan University, offers a more reliable method for measuring orientation and rotation. This is especially useful in inertial navigation systems, which do not rely on external signals and are therefore immune to interference, which is vital for military and security applications. Fiber-optic gyroscopes, including interferometric fiber-optic gyroscopes (IFOGs), are used in both military and civilian settings ranging from aerospace to weapons systems, oil platforms and autonomous vehicles.</p>

          <p>A 1993 Minneapolis murder case is revisited, focusing on a rare clue: bloody, bare footprints found at the crime scene. The victim, Jeanie Childs, was found stabbed to death in her apartment, with the footprints indicating the killer was barefoot. Investigators compared the footprints to multiple suspects, eventually using investigative genetic genealogy to identify Jerry Westrom as a potential match. Westrom's DNA was found at the scene, and his footprints were later compared to the crime scene prints, leading to his arrest and conviction.

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Walmart for blaming tariffs on potential price increases, asserting that the retailer should absorb the costs. This followed Walmart's warning that tariffs would force it to raise prices on its goods. Trump's intervention comes as he aims to prevent inflation amid his trade policies. The article notes that Walmart sources a significant portion of its products from abroad, particularly China and Mexico, making it susceptible to tariff impacts. This action is one of several companies that have said they will be forced to pass on the costs of tariffs to consumers.</p>

Offenders would not receive wages, but the earnings would be allocated to a fund for victim's groups.

          <p>A local government in China has detailed the penalties imposed on a young man who refused military service due to personal preference, as a warning to potential service dodgers. The 20-year-old was expelled from the army and now faces restrictions on employment, travel, and financial opportunities. The punishments, including a fine of 38,000 yuan (US$5,300), are intended to uphold the seriousness of military service and encourage eligible young people to understand its significance. This measure is part of a broader effort to strengthen military ranks and discourage draft evasion.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler surged ahead at the US PGA Championship with a strong finish to his third round, highlighted by an eagle and two birdies. He leads the tournament heading into the final round, aiming to capitalize on his opportunity to win a major. Despite scattered thunderstorms delaying the start of the day, Scheffler's impressive performance positioned him as the frontrunner. Scheffler has had only one victory so far this season after a freak hand injury at Christmas delayed his season, but that win did come in his most recent start at the Byron Nelson Classic - and it was by eight shots.</p>
