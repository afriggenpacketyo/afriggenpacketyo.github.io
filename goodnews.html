          <p>Japan has strongly requested that China take measures to prevent future close encounters between military aircraft after a near miss involving a Chinese J-15 warplane and a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force patrol plane over international waters in the Pacific. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi conveyed Japan's "serious concern" to China through diplomatic and defense channels, emphasizing the potential for collision due to the Chinese aircraft's maneuvers. Japan is on alert for increased Chinese military activity, including simultaneous operations of China's aircraft carriers in the Pacific, and will continue surveillance to defend its territory. The incident occurred when the Chinese fighter jet approached as close as 45 meters to the Japanese plane. </p>

          <p>Following trade talks in London, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the United States and China have reached an agreement to maintain the fragile truce established after earlier talks in Geneva. The agreement reportedly covers several contentious issues, including rare earth mineral shipments, student visas, and tariffs. China has been more reserved in its comments, stating that representatives will submit a report for President Xi Jinping's approval. Trump shared initial details on his Truth Social platform, stating that a U.S.-China accord was "done," though specifics remain limited. </p>

          <p>With U.S. restrictions limiting China's access to advanced semiconductors for artificial intelligence, Beijing is focusing on developing domestic alternatives, particularly through Huawei. U.S. curbs impact the entire semiconductor value chain, from design and manufacturing equipment to memory chips, prompting China to invest heavily in closing these gaps. While China has made progress, it still lags behind in key areas; Huawei's Ascend 910B GPU is nearly a full generation behind Nvidia's export-restricted chips, but is closing the gap. SMIC, China's largest chip foundry, is behind TSMC in manufacturing capabilities, and faces challenges in acquiring advanced chipmaking equipment from companies like ASML. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Musicians have paid tribute to Brian Wilson, the legendary frontman and co-founder of The Beach Boys, who has died at the age of 82. Bob Dylan said he had spent "years" admiring Wilson's "genius", while Sir Elton John described him as a "true giant" who had the "biggest influence" on his songwriting. Wilson's family said they were "heartbroken" and "at a loss for words" to announce his death. The Beach Boys were one of America's biggest bands, whose success rivalled the Beatles in the 1960s. </p>

          <h2>US Considers Extending Tariff Pause for Key Trading Partners</h2>

          <p>The United States may extend a 90-day pause on implementing steep tariffs on goods from its major trading partners if they continue to negotiate "in good faith," according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Bessent indicated that the administration has been in talks with 18 important trading partners and is willing to push the deadline beyond the initial 90 days for those engaging in productive negotiations. The pause, which runs until July 8, applies to country-specific tariffs under the reciprocal scheme and does not affect the baseline duty of 10 percent targeting imports from all parts of the world.

          <h2>Spending Review a Gamble on Patience in an Era of Impatience</h2>

          <p>The recent Spending Review reflects a government gamble on long-term investments at a time when the electorate is increasingly impatient for immediate results. While long-term capital spending aims to transform the public realm and boost economic potential, it requires patience and may not yield quick wins. Day-to-day spending is limited, and some budgets face cuts, which could lead to challenges in the short term. The government hopes that voters will remain patient as they wait for the benefits of these long-term investments to materialize.</p>
