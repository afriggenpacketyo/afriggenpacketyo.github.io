However, they are facing regulatory headwinds in Europe that mirror the scrutiny they've encountered in the U.S., including a proposed ‚Ç¨2 customs fee on previously customs-free small packages. This fee could significantly reshape their operations in Europe over the next few years, requiring them to invest more in compliance and operational transparency.</p>

          <p>A voluntary recall on Dr Pepper Zero Sugar has been upgraded by the FDA to Class II due to a serious health risk. The cans, produced by Pepsi Beverages Company, were mislabeled as ‚Äúzero sugar‚Äù but contained the full sugar content of regular Dr Pepper, around 39 grams. This poses a significant risk to individuals who need to avoid sugar, particularly those with diabetes, as consuming the mislabeled product could lead to hyperglycemia or even fatal ketoacidosis. The recalled cans were distributed in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, and customers are urged to return them for a full refund.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers to address elevated prices of the staple food. This move aims to make rice more affordable for consumers, particularly at smaller supermarkets and specialty shops. The released rice consists of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, and the ministry hopes the cheaper rice will bring down overall prices.

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have significantly decreased, with a massive reduction in fatal overdose risk, particularly among Gen Z. Data from the CDC shows that deaths among those under 35 dropped from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 in 2024. This decline is attributed to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less potent fentanyl being sold, more accessible addiction healthcare, and cautious drug use among teens and young adults. While the trend is promising, challenges remain for those struggling with severe addiction, and potential cuts to addiction service funding could jeopardize this recovery.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Institution asserted its independence by stating that it retains authority over personnel decisions, effectively rejecting President Trump's attempt to fire National Portrait Gallery Director Kim Sajet. The Smithsonian's statement emphasized that the organization is governed and administered by a Board of Regents and a Secretary, not the president. This move comes after Trump's social media post announcing Sajet's firing for being 'a highly partisan person, and a strong supporter of DEI.' The Smithsonian's statement suggests that personnel decisions will be made by the Secretary, Lonnie G. Bunch, not Trump.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Institution has asserted its independence in a statement that can be seen as a rejection of President Trump's attempt to remove National Portrait Gallery Director Kim Sajet. The statement emphasizes the authority of the Smithsonian's Secretary, Lonnie G. Bunch, over personnel decisions. The Smithsonian's move comes after the White House proposed a 12% reduction in funding to the institution and amid Trump's efforts to reshape federal cultural institutions. The Smithsonian's board, consisting of officials from all three branches of government, is committed to ensuring the institution remains nonpartisan and free from political influence.</p>
