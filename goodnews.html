          <p>The White House has clarified that no meeting is currently scheduled with Iran, contradicting President Trump's recent statement that talks would occur "next week." Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt affirmed that while the administration remains in close communication with Iranian officials and intermediaries, the immediate goal is to bring Iran to agree to a non-enrichment, civil nuclear program. To entice Iran back to negotiations, the administration is reportedly considering options such as facilitating access to billions in funds for a civilian nuclear program and offering sanctions relief, contingent on Iran committing to zero uranium enrichment.</p>

          <p>The UK government is reportedly set to announce a significant compromise on its proposed changes to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and Universal Credit benefits. According to sources, a deal has been reached with over 100 Labour backbenchers who had threatened to defeat the government's plans. The expected concessions include allowing existing claimants to continue receiving their current payment levels and fast-tracking support programs designed to help individuals find employment. This move represents a major climbdown by the government to avoid a potential legislative defeat on its key welfare reform policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has indicated that President Trump's upcoming July deadlines for reimposing tariffs on imports from numerous countries are "not critical" and could be extended. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the decision rests with the president, who could also unilaterally offer a reciprocal tariff rate if deals are not reached. This signaling of flexibility, which follows similar comments from other administration officials, suggests that tariffs may not automatically increase for countries engaged in "good faith" negotiations. So far, the U.S. has only announced framework trade agreements with China and the United Kingdom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Anna Wintour, a dominant figure in the fashion world for decades, is stepping back from her direct editorial duties at American Vogue after 37 years. A new position, head of editorial content for American Vogue, will be created, while Wintour will continue in her broader roles as Vogue's global editorial director and as chief content officer for parent company Cond√© Nast. This structural change aligns the U.S. publication with other international Vogue editions and allows the 75-year-old Wintour to focus more on her global and corporate responsibilities, while remaining at the top of the organization's masthead.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a period of decline earlier in the year, interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have risen slightly, but potential for a decrease remains this summer. This article identifies three key dates when rates could fall: the release of the June inflation report on July 15, and the conclusions of the Federal Reserve meetings on July 29 and September 17. A cooling inflation report or a decision by the Fed to cut its benchmark rate could lead lenders to lower variable HELOC rates. The September Fed meeting is considered the most likely catalyst for a rate reduction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Microsoft has announced it is retiring the iconic "blue screen of death," the error message that has signaled critical system failures on Windows computers since the early 1990s. The company is replacing it with a new black screen as part of an effort to "streamline the unexpected restart experience" in its upcoming Windows 11 24H2 update. Microsoft stated the change is part of a larger initiative to reduce disruption during system crashes, aiming to cut downtime to just two seconds for most users. The new black screen is scheduled to launch this summer, marking the end of a well-known, if often dreaded, era in personal computing.</p>

          <p>This article compares the potential interest earnings of depositing $10,000 into a short-term certificate of deposit (CD) versus a high-yield savings account in the current financial climate. While short-term CD rates are currently competitive, the analysis shows that the earnings difference is minimal. For example, a 6-month CD at 4.51% would earn just over $5 more than a high-yield savings account at 4.30%. Conversely, a 9-month CD would earn about $10 less. The choice between the two depends on a saver's outlook on future interest rate movements and their need for liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Mexican Supreme Court has unanimously ruled in favor of singer Sasha Sokol, setting a major legal precedent for victims of child sexual abuse. The court upheld a civil conviction against producer Luis de Llano for the abusive relationship he had with Sokol nearly four decades ago, when she was 14 and he was 39. This landmark decision establishes that the statute of limitations does not apply in civil cases involving the sexual abuse of minors, paving the way for other victims to seek justice.

These habits include being a lifelong learner, balancing strength with empathy, thinking in ecosystems rather than silos, focusing on building strong relationships, and being comfortable with constant change.

Trump later reacted positively to the nickname, saying it was used affectionately.
