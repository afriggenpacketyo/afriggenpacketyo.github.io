          <p>Following the conclusion of the 2025 Glastonbury Festival, thousands of attendees have begun their journey home from Worthy Farm in Somerset. The final night featured a headline performance by American pop star Olivia Rodrigo. As the crowds disperse, a large team of volunteers has commenced the massive cleanup effort, clearing the site of rubbish and leftover belongings. Organizers urged attendees to take their possessions with them and to leave campsites tidy, as the festival will now take a fallow year in 2026 before returning in 2027.</p>

          <p>A survey has revealed that same-sex partnership systems, first introduced in Tokyo's Shibuya Ward in 2015, are now available in local governments covering 92.5% of Japan's population. This marks a significant expansion of recognition for LGBT couples over the past decade. However, these partnership certificates are not legally binding and do not grant the same rights as marriage, such as inheritance or joint parental rights. While activists see this as major progress, they continue to advocate for the full legalization of same-sex marriage, as Japan remains the only G7 nation without it.</p>

          <p>A new trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States has officially commenced, providing preferential tariffs for British car and aerospace exports to the US. Under the deal, the first 100,000 UK-made vehicles will face a 10% tariff, a significant reduction. However, the UK's steel and aluminum sectors remain in a precarious position, still subject to a 25% tariff that could double if a separate agreement is not reached by the July 9th deadline. This uncertainty is causing major planning difficulties for steel manufacturers who ship products to American plants.</p>

          <p>A law enforcement association is highlighting a correlation between rising police budgets and declining homicide rates in several major U.S. cities, suggesting a rejection of the "defund the police" movement. Data from the first quarter of 2025 shows cities like Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and New York City, which increased their police funding, experienced significant drops in murders compared to the previous year. A spokesperson for the National Police Association stated that these trends indicate the public is "wholeheartedly rejecting" the push to reduce law enforcement resources. The article frames the situation as evidence that more police investment leads to less crime.</p>

Despite the company's "no snow you don't have to go" policy, Tui initially refused a full refund.

          <p>China has conditionally resumed imports of seafood from Japan, partially reversing a blanket ban that was imposed in August 2023.
