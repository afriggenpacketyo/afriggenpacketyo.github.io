          <p>Disney CEO Bob Iger believes that taking full control of Hulu will unlock a new level of growth for the company, particularly in its streaming business. Disney finalized its acquisition of NBCUniversal's stake in Hulu, resolving a long-standing dispute over the platform's valuation. Iger emphasized the benefits of bundling Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN into a single, seamless experience for consumers, which is expected to drive higher engagement and lower churn. The integration of Hulu strengthens Disney's direct-to-consumer business, potentially leading to long-term revenue and profit growth, as well as the company's strong theme park business.

          <p>A major international study involving nearly 300,000 children revealed a connection between screen time and emotional well-being. The study found that children who spend more time on devices are at a higher risk of developing aggression, anxiety, and low self-esteem, and vice versa. Time spent on gaming consoles was particularly linked to a greater chance of developing issues. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limiting recreational screen time for children between 2 and 5 years old, emphasizing that screens should not be the sole outlet for managing emotions.</p>

          <p>Hummingbird feeders, while intended to help the birds, can be deadly if not cleaned regularly. Sugar water left out too long can spoil, attracting microbes that cause infections, including candida. Infected birds can develop swollen tongues, making it difficult to eat and leading to starvation. It is recommended to clean feeders every two to three days in spring and fall, and daily or every other day in the summer. The solution is simple: mix one part refined white sugar with four parts drinking water, and avoid other sugars or red food coloring.</p>

          <p>The author, the daughter of immigrants, provides a personal perspective on Los Angeles, contrasting it with the negative narratives often portrayed in the news. She highlights the contributions of immigrants to the city's culture and economy, drawing on her own experiences and observations. She criticizes the stereotypes and sensationalized storytelling that overlook the resilience and generosity of immigrant communities. She argues that the current backlash against ICE raids demonstrates a city united with people who are not invaders or occupants, but are LA.</p>
