        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage outlined his party's proposals to alleviate financial pressures on families, including tax breaks for married couples and the removal of the two-child benefit limit. Farage emphasized that lifting the benefit cap is intended to support lower-paid workers, not to encourage a benefits culture. He also pledged to reverse government cuts to the winter fuel payment for 10 million pensioners. Labour Party chairwoman Ellie Reeves criticized Farage's proposals as unrealistic, likening them to the economic policies of Liz Truss. </p>

          <p>Businesses are utilizing the "first sale rule," a decades-old piece of legislation, to mitigate the impact of tariffs. This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the price of the initial sale in a series of transactions, potentially reducing costs by excluding intermediary profits. The first sale rule has gained traction during President Trump's administrations as tariffs increased. To apply the rule, businesses must ensure multiple sales occur between independent parties, prove the item's destination is the U.S., and document the first sale price. </p>

          <p>Johns Hopkins University is partnering with the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) to increase ideological diversity among its faculty, specifically targeting the underrepresentation of conservative professors. This initiative reflects a growing trend among universities to address ideological homogeneity, which some leaders believe is detrimental to academic discourse and higher education's reputation. The Trump administration has also pressured Harvard to hire more conservative professors or risk losing federal funding. The efforts aim to create a more balanced academic environment where students are exposed to a wider range of perspectives.</p>

          <p>A European-wide shift to nuclear power appears to be gathering momentum as countries hedge their bets in pursuit of more energy independence. Denmark is reconsidering its 40-year ban on nuclear power, Spain is reviewing its nuclear plant shutdown, and Germany has dropped its opposition to atomic energy. The renewed interest is driven partly by costs associated with renewables, notably solar and wind technologies. Denmark plans to analyze the potential of new advanced nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors, to complement solar and wind technologies, but does not plan a return to traditional nuclear power plants.</p>

          <p>Conductor John Mauceri experienced a rapid 40-pound weight gain in a matter of weeks, which was eventually diagnosed as pericardial constriction, a rare condition where the sac around the heart thickens.

Doctors initially struggled to identify the cause, but cardiologist Dr. Adam Skolnick suspected pericardial constriction and performed open-heart surgery to remove the thickened pericardium. Following the surgery, Mauceri recovered and returned to conducting, feeling healthier than he had in years.</p>
