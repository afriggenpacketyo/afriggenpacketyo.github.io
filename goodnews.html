          <p>Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves plans to announce a new Labour policy guaranteeing paid work placements for young people unemployed or out of education for 18 months. Those who decline the offer without reasonable cause could face benefit sanctions. This initiative aims to abolish long-term youth unemployment, building on a previous "youth guarantee" for 18-21 year olds. The scheme, to be detailed in November's Budget, will involve private companies covering some wages and be funded from existing budgets.</p>

Captain Luke Donald achieved consecutive Ryder Cup victories, a feat not seen since 1987, despite a strong American comeback attempt on Sunday on U.S. soil.

          <p>Moldova's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), led by President Maia Sandu, has taken a significant lead in parliamentary elections with nearly 90% of votes counted. This election is crucial for the country's EU aspirations, which Sandu warned faced "massive Russian interference." Despite claims of victory by a pro-Russian opposition leader and reports of bomb scares, the PAS is poised to win, though potentially falling short of an outright majority. The vote highlights Moldova's struggle with geopolitical influences, economic challenges, and corruption.</p>

The event was also marred by unruly spectator behavior and heckling directed at European players, particularly Rory McIlroy, prompting calls for improved fan conduct in future tournaments.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the release of U.S. citizen Amir Amiry, who was wrongfully detained in Afghanistan for nine months. This marks the fifth American citizen freed from Afghanistan this year, with Qatar credited for its vital diplomatic efforts in securing the release. Amiry, an American citizen who had received a special immigrant visa (SIV), was released without a prisoner exchange. Rubio affirmed that the Trump administration continues to work towards freeing other Americans still unjustly detained in the country.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is set to announce new Labour policy requiring migrants to demonstrate societal contribution to earn indefinite leave to remain. Proposals include high English proficiency, a clean criminal record, and community volunteering, extending the qualification period from five to ten years. Labour aims to differentiate itself from Reform UK's more stringent immigration stance, arguing their policy promotes integration and fair migration while maintaining secure borders.

          <p>Jim Cramer contends that the current AI buildout, characterized by massive spending from major tech companies, fundamentally differs from the dot-com bubble. He argues that today's capital projects are undertaken by financially robust companies, unlike the debt-laden startups of 2000. Cramer acknowledges skepticism about AI's immediate tangible benefits but highlights its strategic necessity for industry giants like Microsoft, Meta, and Google to maintain market dominance. He dismisses parallels to the previous bubble, emphasizing the self-funded nature of most hyperscalers and the proven track record of key investors like Nvidia's Jensen Huang.

          <p>As the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) approaches its 2026 review, Asian economies are advised to pay close attention due to their sharply increased trade and investment flows to North America. Asian exports to USMCA partners reached US$1.7 trillion in 2024, with foreign direct investment exceeding US$33 billion, particularly tripling to Mexico. This investment surge is driven by desires for USMCA tariff preferences, improved access to the Mexican market, and diversification of trading partners.

ByteDance will retain less than a 20% stake, with American investors like Oracle and Silver Lake holding the majority.
