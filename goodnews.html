          <p>Liam √ìg √ì hAnnaidh, a rapper with the Irish language hip-hop group Kneecap, was released on unconditional bail after appearing in a London court on a terror charge.

The case has drawn significant attention, with supporters protesting outside the court and Sinn F√©in MPs attending the hearing. √ì hAnnaidh denies the offense and intends to defend himself vigorously, with the next hearing scheduled for August 20.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Premier League has issued a warning about potential fixture changes at short notice due to the increased number of teams participating in European competitions. With nine teams in Europe, including six in the Champions League, there is a higher likelihood of Premier League games being moved after the initial fixture announcements. This is especially true if clubs progress to the knockout rounds of these competitions. The league will need to juggle TV fixtures, considering which Champions League representatives will play on Tuesdays and therefore cannot play in the coveted Sunday TV slot the previous weekend.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to reduce the impact of tariffs by modifying products to fit into lower-tariff categories. This involves altering materials, dimensions, or compositions to reclassify finished products under different harmonized system codes. Some companies are bundling or removing elements to qualify for lower duties based on specific exemptions. While legal, this practice allows businesses to strategically design products to minimize tariff liabilities, and is one of the few things businesses can do to try to get it right and reduce duty liability.

          <p>The UK Parliament has voted to decriminalize some late-term abortions, barring women in England and Wales from being investigated, arrested, or imprisoned for terminating their pregnancies. This represents the biggest reform to British abortion laws in nearly 60 years, although abortion is still regulated in clinical settings and assisting a woman in getting a late-term abortion can still be prosecuted. The new law aims to provide care and support to women rather than criminalization, according to MP Tonia Antoniazzi. The law now needs approval in the House of Lords.</p>

The team's success hinges on the health and performance of their starting rotation, including Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Shohei Ohtani, and Clayton Kershaw.
