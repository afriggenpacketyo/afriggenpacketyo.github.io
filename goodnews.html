        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes whether gold bars and coins are a smart investment this October, considering factors like price volatility and economic uncertainty. Gold prices have surged in 2025, driven by global uncertainty and strong central bank buying, making it a standout performer compared to traditional investments. While timing any investment is tricky, the article suggests that gold's record highs can signal continued momentum, with analysts projecting further upside potential. Inflation remains a concern, and gold has historically served as an inflation hedge, making it an attractive option for investors seeking stability and portfolio diversification, as it is not tied to corporate earnings or government debt. (not investment advice) The overall stability and potential for growth are reflected in the score.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Berkshire Hathaway has reached an agreement to buy Occidental Petroleum's petrochemical unit, OxyChem, for $9.7 billion in cash, marking Berkshire's largest deal since 2022. Occidental plans to use $6.5 billion of the proceeds to reduce debt, which will enable the company to restart buying back stock, according to CEO Vicki Hollub. Greg Abel, Buffett's successor as CEO, highlighted Hollub's commitment to Occidental's long-term financial stability, with the deal expected to close in the fourth quarter. Buffett initially invested in Occidental in 2019 to support its acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum, and Occidental intends to start redeeming Berkshire's preferred stock in 2029, as it grows its cash position. The relative stability of this acquisition is reflected in the score.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article addresses the common misconception that lower-priced stocks inherently have more upside potential than higher-priced stocks. It dispels this "low-price bias," explaining that a stock's price alone is not an indicator of value or potential returns. The article uses the example of International Paper versus Nvidia to illustrate that focusing on fundamental growth outlook and qualitative dynamics is more important than nominal price. The piece emphasizes that valuation and underlying fundamentals should drive investment decisions, not the stock price, and that investors should be aware of their own biases to make informed choices. The overall stability and potential for growth are reflected in the score.</p>

          <h2>Reconsidering Set-It-and-Forget-It Investment Strategy Amid Market Highs</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the S&P 500 reaches record highs, some experts suggest reconsidering the traditional "set-it-and-forget-it" investment strategy. Michael DeMassa argues that the S&P 500 is "broken" due to its market capitalization-weighted nature and heavy concentration in the technology sector. Instead, experts recommend diversifying investments by opting for a total market index fund or broadening exposure with funds that exclude S&P 500 stocks. Other strategies include equal-weighted S&P 500 index funds, with the goal of creating a more balanced portfolio that can withstand market pullbacks, particularly in areas like small cap, value, international, and bonds.

          <p>Social Security recipients will continue receiving their monthly checks during the government shutdown, as benefits are covered by mandatory spending. However, other Social Security services, such as benefit verifications and earnings record corrections, could be disrupted. The Social Security Administration (SSA) plans to keep nearly 90% of its employees on the job, but some services will be temporarily halted, and the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) announcement could be delayed. Despite potential service disruptions, Social Security payments will continue on their usual schedule, providing reassurance to recipients. The relative stability of payments is reflected in the score.</p>

          <p>German Unity Day, celebrated on October 3, commemorates the reunification of East and West Germany in 1990, following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The date was chosen to avoid overshadowing the tragic events of November 9, 1938, known as Reichspogromnacht. Celebrations are typically quiet, with events and open houses in most cities, and an official festival organized by one of the federal states. Despite political efforts, a recent poll indicates that Germany has yet to fully overcome its division, with only 35% of respondents believing that East and West have largely grown together. The overall sense of unity and remembrance is reflected in the score.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Robinhood Markets CEO Vlad Tenev predicts that the tokenization of real-world assets will spread to financial markets globally, stating that "tokenization is like a freight train" that will eventually transform the financial system. He expects most major markets to have a framework for tokenization within five years, with the practice gaining traction once there is greater regulatory clarity. Robinhood began offering tokenized U.S. stocks to customers in the European Union, and Tenev believes this will become the default way to gain exposure to U.S. stocks outside the U.S. The potential for innovation and growth is reflected in the score.</p>

The difficult winter also saw England knocked out of the T20 World Cup in the group stages last autumn, and led to scrutiny surrounding the team's fitness, attitude and ability to perform in high-pressure situations. In their home summer, Sciver-Brunt oversaw a clean sweep in both white-ball formats against West Indies in her first series in charge but they were subsequently beaten in both series against a far superior India, who are hosting the World Cup with Sri Lanka.

          <p>This article reflects on Jane Goodall's advocacy for animal rights, veganism, and meat reduction, highlighting her radical empathy and moral imperative to challenge humanity's tyranny over nonanimals. Goodall despaired at the horrors of factory farming and opposed invasive animal experimentation, often clashing with scientists who believe animal experimentation is essential. She advocated for ending biomedical testing on chimps and supported animal rights groups like PETA, challenging mainstream scientific norms and prompting a reevaluation of animal experimentation ethics. Her willingness to break convention and push against received norms made her widely beloved within the animal rights movement. The positive impact of her work is reflected in the score.</p>

          <p>Tesla reported a 7% increase in quarterly vehicle deliveries, totaling 497,099, before a key tax credit for electric vehicle buyers in the U.S. expired. Despite the increase in deliveries, Tesla's production declined compared to the previous year, with 447,450 vehicles produced. The company's third quarter was impacted by a sales slump in Europe, partially offset by increased sales in the U.S. due to buyers rushing to take advantage of the expiring tax credit. The stock price has been on a tear, jumping 40% in the third quarter, and the company deployed 12.5 GWh of its storage products, including Megapack and Megablock systems.

          <p>Tesla reported a surprise increase in sales in the third quarter, likely benefiting from a rush by consumers to take advantage of a $7,500 tax credit before it expired on September 30. Sales rose to 497,099, compared with 462,890 in the same period last year, defying analysts' expectations of a slight decline. The gain follows two quarters of steep declines, as people turned off by CEO Elon Musk's foray into right-wing politics avoided buying his company's cars and even protested at some dealerships. Despite the controversy surrounding Musk, the increase in sales is a positive sign for the company. The overall potential for growth is reflected in the score.</p>

          <p>A study has revealed that the ocean hidden under the icy shell of Saturn's moon Enceladus contains complex organic molecules, offering further evidence that it could host extraterrestrial life. Data collected by the Cassini space probe showed that the ocean has many elements needed for life, including salt, methane, carbon dioxide, and phosphorus.
