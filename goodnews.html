          <p>A new report reveals that customer complaints against U.S. airlines surged to a record 66,675 in 2024, a 9% increase compared to a 4% rise in passenger volume. The U.S. PIRG Education Fund attributes this surge to issues like cancellations, delays, refunds, and mishandled luggage, with Frontier Airlines receiving the highest rate of complaints per passenger. The report also notes that airlines mishandled fewer bags and wheelchairs compared to the previous year, though millions of bags were still lost or damaged. Passengers are increasingly voicing concerns and seeing results due to consumer protections passed last year.</p>

          <p>President Trump concluded his Middle East trip with pledges from Gulf states to deepen business ties with U.S. companies, particularly in artificial intelligence, with Nvidia and AMD now permitted to sell advanced chips to Saudi, Emirati, and Qatari customers. David Sacks and Sriram Krishnan, Trump's A.I. advisors, negotiated the deals, raising security concerns that the technology might reach China, prompting some officials to consider pausing the agreements. Shares in Nvidia and AMD soared following the announcements, but the deals face potential antitrust headwinds. The State Department is reportedly pushing back against the European Union‚Äôs digital content laws.</p>

          <p>MPs are debating proposed changes to a bill that would legalize assisted dying in England and Wales for terminally ill adults expected to die within six months. The debate includes issues such as the role of doctors, ensuring no obligation to provide assistance, and preventing medical staff from raising the option of assisted dying first. Concerns were raised about vulnerable individuals feeling pressured and the eligibility of people with anorexia. The government remains neutral on the bill, with MPs given a free vote based on their conscience.</p>

He described their relationship as a "good personal relationship" and joked about his yoga skills after a viral beach photo. The CBS interview was reportedly disrupted by Hudson's interventions, leading to a delayed interview and accusations of a "false narrative" from Belichick.</p>

Higher docking fees for vessels made in China, imposed by the US, could shift some orders to South Korea, according to an expert. However, despite a recent de-escalation in the tariff war, the US Trade Representative's decision to increase docking fees on Chinese-made vessels still stands, creating uncertainty for the shipbuilding industry.</p>

Experts advise that the only rule to follow is to ensure the house is tidy enough for guests to relax, emphasizing that connection and spending time with friends are more important than a spotless home. Personal standards are often shaped by past experiences and social media, which can create unrealistic expectations. It's better to focus on making the hangout space comfortable and to suspend judgment about others' living spaces.</p>
