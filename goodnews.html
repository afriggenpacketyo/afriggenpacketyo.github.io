        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is fast-tracking two major reservoir projects in East Anglia and south Lincolnshire, designating them as "nationally significant" to expedite the planning process and bolster England's water supplies. These projects, aimed for completion in 2036 and 2040, seek to enhance resilience against future droughts, especially given the increasing likelihood of hotter, drier summers due to climate change. While the water industry welcomes this initiative, some experts advocate for managing water usage through waste reduction and recycling, and local communities have expressed concerns about potential disruptions. The government intends to legislate to automatically deem the other seven proposed reservoirs as "nationally significant" too, streamlining the process further.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs imposed after his second term are illegal, arguing that they exceed the constitutional limits on Congress's ability to delegate tariff authority to the president. The US Court of International Trade's decision in V.O.S. Selections v. United States and Oregon v. Department of Homeland Security argues that Trump's reliance on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant unlimited tariff authority. The court also found that the tariffs, justified as a response to the trade deficit and drug trafficking, do not adequately address these issues. The decision, which can be appealed, may significantly restrict Trump's ability to impose broad tariffs.</p>

          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Donald Trump exceeded his authority by imposing reciprocal tariffs, a major setback to his economic agenda. The U.S. Court of International Trade determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to unilaterally implement sweeping duties. The Trump administration has appealed the ruling, while Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield hailed the decision as a victory for working families and small businesses, arguing that the tariffs were unlawful and economically devastating.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 21:44:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Golden eagles are increasingly venturing into England from southern Scotland, raising hopes that they may establish nesting sites after being absent for years. This resurgence is largely attributed to the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project (SSGEP), which has successfully translocated juvenile and sub-adult eagles from the Scottish Highlands. While it is still early to determine if they will settle permanently, the birds have been spotted in Northumberland, the North Pennines, the Lake District, and as far as Lancashire and Yorkshire. The last resident golden eagle in England disappeared from the Lake District in 2015, but conservationists are optimistic about their return.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is set to depart from the Trump administration, concluding his role as a "special government employee" after approximately 130 days.

As a special government employee, Musk's appointment was limited, and he has recently faced criticism for his views on the budget bill.

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has ordered the Trump administration to lift a pause on certain immigration applications, finding it was not in the public interest for immigrants to lose their legal status. The ruling affects immigrants from Afghanistan, Latin America, and Ukraine, whose ability to remain and work in the U.S. had been threatened. The judge agreed with pro-immigrant advocates that the government's actions were arbitrary and violated federal administrative law. The decision is a second rebuke to the administration's efforts to scale back parole programs.</p>
