          <p>Following complaints related to the Oasis reunion tour, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority has ordered Ticketmaster to provide clearer information about its pricing practices. The company has agreed to disclose 24 hours in advance if it plans to use a tiered pricing system for events. Furthermore, Ticketmaster will offer more detailed price information to customers waiting in online queues. These changes aim to increase transparency and prevent consumers from being surprised by fluctuating ticket costs.</p>

          <p>After a challenging season at Bayern Munich, Dutch midfielder Ryan Gravenberch has experienced a remarkable resurgence at Liverpool, establishing himself as one of Europe's top players in his position. Initially signed by Jurgen Klopp, his performance has soared under new manager Arne Slot, who has utilized him effectively in a holding midfield role with greater attacking freedom. Gravenberch has become a key player for the Premier League leaders, demonstrating improved offensive contributions this season.
