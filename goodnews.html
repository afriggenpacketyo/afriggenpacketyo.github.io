          <p>OpenAI employees are reportedly facing obstacles in donating their equity to charities, despite the company's soaring valuation and employees becoming "paper millionaires." The article details that OpenAI's unique equity structure, stemming from its origins as a non-profit, requires company approval for equity transfers, hindering philanthropic donations. Employees have raised concerns in internal discussions, but the company has deprioritized the issue, citing the need to manage its cap table. This situation highlights the tension between OpenAI's non-profit roots and its current for-profit trajectory, and the challenges employees face in realizing the value of their equity for charitable purposes.</p>
