          <p>President Trump posthumously honored conservative activist Charlie Kirk with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award, on what would have been Kirk's 32nd birthday. During a White House ceremony, Trump praised Kirk as a "fearless warrior for liberty" and a key ally who helped shape his movement and secure young voter support. The medal was accepted by Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, following his fatal shooting on a Utah college campus a month prior. Prosecutors have charged a 22-year-old with aggravated murder in connection with his death.</p>
