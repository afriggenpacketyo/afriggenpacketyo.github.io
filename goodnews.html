          <p>An independent Member of Parliament, Rupert Lowe, admitted to mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants." He had posted a picture on social media with an urgent call for authorities to intercept the vessel and demanded mass deportations. After HM Coastguard confirmed the boat's occupants were raising money for motor neurone disease research, the MP apologized for the false alarm. He subsequently pledged to donate £1,000 to their cause, and the rowers, who include a former Royal Marine, found the incident "hilarious."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed all federal agencies to permanently erase records of employee COVID-19 vaccination status, noncompliance with past mandates, and exemption requests. Issued by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the guidance is framed as a reversal of "harmful pandemic-era policies" from the previous administration. Agencies are now prohibited from using an individual's vaccination history in any employment decisions. Unless an employee chooses to opt out, all related information must be removed from their personnel files, with agencies required to certify compliance by September 8th.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a landmark peace agreement at the White House, officially ending decades of conflict over the South Caucasus region. Brokered by the Trump administration, the deal establishes a major new transit corridor named the "Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity" connecting the two nations. Both leaders credited President Trump with achieving a breakthrough that had eluded international mediators for years. The agreement is also seen as a significant geopolitical development, diminishing Russia's historical influence in the region while deepening U.S. engagement.</p>

          <p>Apple's stock experienced its largest weekly gain since July 2020, rising 13% and adding over $400 billion to its market capitalization. The surge followed CEO Tim Cook's White House meeting with President Trump, where Apple announced plans to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts over the next four years. This move, which includes buying more U.S.-made chips, was praised by Trump, who suggested the company would be exempt from future tariffs. The announcement alleviated investor concerns about the potential negative impact of tariffs on Apple's profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from Realtor.com indicates that home prices are experiencing modest declines in certain U.S. regions, offering some relief in a tight housing market. The largest drops in median listing prices are concentrated in the South and West, with cities like Austin and Miami seeing significant decreases due to rising inventory and a boom in new construction. Conversely, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to face high prices and limited supply, creating a divided real estate landscape across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trent Rockets started their season in The Hundred cricket tournament with a commanding six-wicket victory over the Birmingham Phoenix. The Rockets' success was founded on an excellent bowling performance, with New Zealand's Lockie Ferguson taking three wickets for 20 runs, which restricted the Phoenix to a modest total of 122-6. Despite an early wicket in their chase, the Rockets' batters, led by Tom Banton's 43 runs, comfortably reached the target with 22 balls to spare. The comprehensive win suggests the Rockets could be a strong contender this year.</p>

          <p>Shares of rare earth miner MP Materials rose over 4% after the company reported a narrower-than-expected quarterly loss and record production of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide, a key component in magnets for electric vehicles and electronics.

Drawing on insights from author Kelly Corrigan, it suggests that simple activities like a three-minute dance break or taking phone calls while walking can effectively reset one's mood and overcome mental blocks. The key insight is to work with the body's natural energy rhythms rather than fighting against them. These micro-adjustments are presented not as distractions, but as an essential part of the creative process itself.</p>

          <p>Tonia Haddix, a Missouri woman featured in the HBO documentary series “Chimp Crazy,” has been sentenced to 46 months in prison for perjury and obstruction of justice. The charges stemmed from her false claim that a chimpanzee named Tonka, who had appeared in several movies, had died. In reality, she was hiding the primate in her basement to prevent his court-ordered transfer to a sanctuary, a case initiated by the animal rights group PETA. Haddix admitted to the deception in the documentary, stating that Tonka was "on the run with me."</p>

          <p>Italian football club AC Milan has expressed keen interest in signing Manchester United's Danish striker, Rasmus Hojlund. This development comes just over a week after Hojlund himself publicly affirmed his commitment to staying at Old Trafford, even with the prospect of increased competition for his position. The transfer speculation is amplified by the news that Manchester United has reportedly agreed to terms with another forward, Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig. Hojlund's future at the English club now appears less certain amid these developments.</p>
