        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has begun mass production of the world's first non-binary AI chip, a breakthrough led by Professor Li Hongge at Beihang University. This innovation overcomes limitations in traditional computing by merging binary and stochastic logic, resulting in improved fault tolerance and power efficiency. The chip is designed for intelligent control applications, such as touch displays and flight systems, and could potentially circumvent US chip restrictions. By combining traditional binary numbers with stochastic numbers, the new Hybrid Stochastic Number (HSN) system aims to address the power and architecture challenges facing current chip technologies. This development could position China as a leader in advanced computing technology. The fact that China is innovating in the AI chip sector is positive.</p>
