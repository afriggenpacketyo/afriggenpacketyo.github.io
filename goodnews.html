        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has lifted its export restrictions on crucial chip-design software to China, as confirmed by leading semiconductor software firms Synopsys and Cadence. The companies are now working to restore access for their Chinese customers, reversing a policy implemented in May that required licenses for such exports. This move impacts the U.S.-dominated electronic design automation (EDA) market, where Synopsys, Cadence, and Siemens EDA hold a significant majority of the global share. The decision signals a potential de-escalation in the ongoing technology trade tensions between the two economic powers.</p>

          <p>Armenia is actively seeking to deepen its relationship with China and elevate it to a strategic partnership, according to its top diplomat, Ararat Mirzoyan. This diplomatic pivot comes as Armenia diversifies its foreign relations beyond its traditional reliance on Russia, particularly following Moscow's perceived failure to intervene in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Upset with its former ally, Armenia announced its withdrawal from the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation. The move to strengthen ties with Beijing represents a significant shift in the geopolitical alignment of the South Caucasus nation.</p>

          <p>China has developed a record-setting hydropower turbine with a single-unit capacity of 500 megawatts, the largest in the world. The massive 80-tonne turbine, developed over four years by Harbin Electric Machinery Company, is set to be installed at the Datang Zala Hydropower Station on a tributary of the Nu River in Tibet. Constructed from durable and corrosion-resistant martensitic steel, the turbine is described as the "heart" of the hydropower unit.

          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings (IPOs) is experiencing a dramatic rebound, with new listing volumes soaring to $14 billion in the first half of the year, an eightfold increase from the same period in 2024. This surge, which positions the city to potentially become the world's top listing destination, is driven by a wave of Chinese companies seeking to raise capital. Factors fueling the boom include supportive policies from Beijing, a slower pace of listings on mainland exchanges, and fears of delisting from U.S. markets. This renewed enthusiasm marks a significant turnaround after several years of lackluster activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's executive order that severely restricted the ability of migrants crossing the southern border to seek asylum. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president exceeded his legal authority, stating that the executive branch cannot unilaterally create an "alternative immigration system" that supplants laws enacted by Congress. The judge acknowledged the challenges at the border but affirmed that the Constitution and existing laws grant aliens present in the U.S. the right to apply for asylum. The decision has been stayed for 14 days to allow for a government appeal.</p>

          <p>A new Pew Research Center study reveals a significant political shift, with Donald Trump securing 48% of the Latino vote in the 2024 presidential election, a substantial increase from his 36% share in 2020. Political experts suggest this trend reflects a growing populist sentiment among Latino voters rather than a simple shift to conservatism. Analysts theorize that disillusionment with the Democratic Party's handling of the economy and immigration, combined with a desire to distance themselves from anti-immigrant rhetoric, contributed to the change. The findings challenge long-held assumptions and signal a more dynamic and evolving Latino electorate.</p>

          <p>Rock icon Ozzy Osbourne is set to perform one last show, reuniting with his original Black Sabbath bandmates for a farewell concert in their hometown of Birmingham. The 76-year-old frontman, whose career has been defined by both pioneering heavy metal and infamous off-stage antics, has faced increasing health issues, including Parkinson's disease and spinal injuries. The show, titled "Back to the Beginning," is being hailed as a monumental event for heavy metal, featuring influential bands like Metallica and Slayer. Despite previous retirement teases, this concert is widely seen as the true swansong for the legendary "Prince of Darkness."</p>
