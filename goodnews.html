          <p>This article explores the potential benefits of investing in gold before the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, citing the metal's recent record-breaking price run and its traditional role as a hedge against inflation. With a high probability of an interest rate cut, which typically boosts gold prices, some investors are considering acting now to avoid being priced out. The piece also notes that ongoing economic uncertainty, inflation, and geopolitical tensions could further drive up the price of gold, making it a protective asset for portfolios.

          <p>The United States and Australia have signed a significant agreement on critical minerals, establishing an $8.5 billion project pipeline to strengthen supply chains independent of China. The deal involves joint investment in rare earths processing in Australia, a sector currently dominated by Beijing. This strategic partnership aims to ensure a stable supply of materials essential for defense, technology, and manufacturing, coming at a time of heightened trade tensions and recent Chinese export controls on these vital resources.</p>

The article suggests that in the current political climate, Democrats may value her aggressive style, and the increased name recognition from the incidents could paradoxically help her campaign.</p>
