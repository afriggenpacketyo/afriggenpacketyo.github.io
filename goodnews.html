          <p>Prince Harry has stated his wish for reconciliation with the Royal Family in a BBC interview following his unsuccessful appeal regarding his UK security arrangements. He expressed feeling 'devastated' by the court's decision and voiced concerns about bringing his family to the UK without adequate protection, citing numerous disagreements with family members which he claims to have forgiven. Prince Harry emphasized the importance of family and expressed sadness that his children might not experience his homeland due to the ongoing security dispute, which he feels has left him and his family vulnerable. He also mentioned that he will not be seeking further legal challenges and feels the decision was a 'family dispute'.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new training program called CHAT (Changing Talk) is being implemented in nursing homes and hospitals to reduce the use of elderspeak, a form of communication that resembles baby talk and is often directed towards older adults. The program, which includes videos and interactive sessions, aims to educate caregivers on the negative impacts of elderspeak, such as increased resistance to care and reduced autonomy. Studies have shown that CHAT training can significantly decrease the use of elderspeak and improve communication, leading to better outcomes for older adults, while also lowering the use of antipsychotic drugs.</p>

          <p>In Montana, nine Republican state senators have formed an unusual alliance with Democrats, creating a majority that has sidelined Republican leaders on key votes. These senators, dubbed the 'Nasty Nine,' have prioritized policy over party loyalty, supporting initiatives such as Medicaid expansion, a child tax credit, and maternal health care access. This bipartisan cooperation has drawn criticism from within the Republican Party, with the state party even censuring the nine senators. Despite the backlash, the senators maintain that they are prioritizing the needs of their constituents and supporting Governor Gianforte's agenda.</p>

          <p>Five people survived for 36 hours in an alligator-infested swamp in the Amazon after their plane made an emergency landing due to engine failure. The pilot, Andres Velarde, reported that the plane lost altitude and was forced to land near the Itanomas River in Bolivia. The survivors, including three women, a child, and the pilot, stood on top of the plane, surrounded by alligators. They were eventually rescued by local fishermen and transported to a hospital, having survived by eating cassava flour one of the passengers had brought and believing that petrol leaking from the plane kept the predators at bay.</p>

Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, in his first major test, seeks a strong mandate to navigate the country through potential economic downturns and trade tensions with the U.S. While the PAP is expected to retain power, the election serves as a gauge of Wong's leadership and the enduring dominance of the ruling party.</p>
