          <p>In a "Face the Nation" interview, Vice President JD Vance confirmed the administration feels very confident that 20 hostages held by Hamas will be released soon, marking a significant step towards a sustainable peace in the Middle East. He credited President Trump's non-traditional diplomatic approach, involving figures like Jared Kushner, for achieving the breakthrough. Vance also addressed the deployment of 200 U.S. troops, clarifying they will serve a monitoring and mediation role from Central Command, not as ground troops in Gaza, while Muslim-majority nations will provide security forces for rebuilding efforts.</p>

          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, certain common habits can lead to mentally weak children. The article outlines seven toxic behaviors to avoid, including rescuing kids from every struggle, modeling perfection, silencing their big feelings, and prizing achievement over effort. Instead, parents are encouraged to let children face age-appropriate challenges, take responsibility for their own mistakes, validate emotions, and teach the value of rest, thereby building resilience and emotional intelligence.</p>

          <p>An advice columnist tackles the question of whether it's acceptable to engage with the Harry Potter universe despite author J.K. Rowling's anti-trans views. The writer argues that it is possible to separate the art from the artist, noting that many beloved works have problematic creators. Instead of simply "offsetting" purchases with donations, the columnist suggests a more transformative approach: engaging with the content critically and in community, discussing its flaws and positive messages to generate social good, much like how religious communities have long interrogated their own canonical texts.</p>
