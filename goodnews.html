The event was supported by over 200,000 spectators and featured famous faces like Joe Wicks and Tommy Fury. Kenyan Alex Mutiso won the men's elite race, while Sheila Chepkirui won the women's elite race. The founder, Sir Brendan Foster, noted the event's growing popularity, particularly among younger runners and women, with many participants raising money for various charities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a record-setting 42nd drawing without a winner, the Powerball jackpot reached an estimated $1.8 billion, with winning tickets eventually sold in Texas and Missouri. An analysis of the lottery data highlights the significant impact of state taxes on the take-home prize. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery winnings, allowing winners to keep a larger portion of their prize after federal taxes are deducted. In contrast, states with high income tax rates, such as New York, result in the lowest after-tax payouts for jackpot winners, illustrating a wide variance in the actual value of the prize depending on the winner's location.</p>

          <p>The South Korean government has announced a successful negotiation with the United States for the release of over 300 of its citizens who were detained during a major immigration raid. The workers were arrested at a Hyundai electric vehicle battery plant currently under construction in Georgia. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained 475 people in the raid, part of the Trump administration's broader immigration crackdown. South Korea expressed "concern and regret" over the incident and is arranging a charter flight to bring the workers home once final administrative procedures are complete.</p>

          <p>English cricketer Jacob Bethell has expressed that he "probably should have played a bit more" during a challenging first home summer in international cricket. The 21-year-old all-rounder, who had a strong debut Test series last winter, found his opportunities limited this season. After missing a Test against Zimbabwe due to his Indian Premier League commitments, he was not selected for the first four matches against India. Bethell acknowledged the lack of game time but suggested the break might have been beneficial, as he now looks ahead to a busy schedule.</p>

          <h2>Guide to Pausing Federal Student Loan Payments as Deferment and Forbearance Use Rises</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 07:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of federal student loan borrowers are using deferment and forbearance options to pause their monthly payments, with over a quarter of borrowers now in this status. While these tools can prevent default and its severe credit consequences, they come with significant differences and potential costs. Deferment may prevent interest from accruing on certain subsidized loans, making it a preferable first option for those who qualify based on economic hardship or unemployment. Forbearance is more widely available but typically allows interest to accumulate, which can substantially increase the total debt owed over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With over half of Americans developing high blood pressure by age 40, often without symptoms, it remains a "silent killer" increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and dementia. New American Heart Association guidelines recommend early intervention, including lifestyle changes like a low-sodium diet, exercise, and stress reduction once blood pressure exceeds 130/80 mm Hg. For those with readings of 140/90 or higher, starting on medication is advised to protect long-term health. The article stresses that catching and treating hypertension early can add years of healthy life by preventing severe damage to the heart, kidneys, and brain.</p>

          <h2>Experts Offer Guidance on Investing in Gold as Prices Reach Record Highs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With gold prices surging to record highs this year, gaining about 35% to near $3,600 an ounce, many investors are looking to add the precious metal to their portfolios. Experts suggest that gold is seen as a safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty and low interest rates. For most individuals, financial advisors recommend gaining exposure through low-cost, liquid exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of physical gold, such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). This method is considered more efficient than buying and storing physical bullion, and it's generally advised to limit gold allocation to a small portion, typically under 3%, of a diversified portfolio.

          <p>The burgeoning rivalry between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz will see its next chapter in the US Open men's final, marking the third straight Grand Slam final between the two. Their rivalry, dubbed 'Sin-caraz,' has been hailed as the future of men's tennis since a memorable quarter-final match at the same tournament three years ago. This year, Sinner won the Australian Open and Wimbledon titles, while Alcaraz claimed the French Open, with the two players sweeping the majors for the second consecutive season. The New York final will decide not only the champion but also the world number one ranking, which Alcaraz can reclaim with a victory.</p>

          <p>The third-ever observed interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, is exhibiting highly unusual properties, according to observations from four major telescopes including the Hubble and James Webb. While believed to be a comet, data reveals it has the highest carbon dioxide-to-water ratio ever seen in such an object and was active at a much greater distance from the Sun than typical comets. Furthermore, it displays a teardrop-shaped dust cocoon but lacks a distinct cometary tail, adding to its mystery. Scientists are analyzing the data to understand its origins, which may involve formation in an environment with higher radiation than our own solar system.</p>

          <p>A Utah judge has struck down the state's Republican-drawn congressional map, ruling that the legislature unconstitutionally overrode the will of the voters. In 2018, Utah citizens approved a proposition to create an independent redistricting commission, but the GOP-led legislature later ignored its recommendations and passed its own gerrymandered map. The rejected map had strategically divided Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County among four districts to ensure Republican victories. The court has ordered lawmakers to draw a new, fairer map, a decision hailed as a significant victory for voting rights and a rebuke to partisan gerrymandering.</p>

          <p>In a speech ahead of Donald Trump's state visit, Lord Peter Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to Washington, described the U.S. President as a necessary "risk-taker" challenging a stale political status quo. Mandelson's address focused on advocating for a strong U.S.-UK technology partnership in strategic areas like AI and quantum computing to compete with China. He argued that Trump's "America First" policy does not mean "America Alone" and that the president has brought fresh energy to international conflicts. He also suggested that Brexit has made the UK a more attractive investment partner for the U.S. by freeing it from European regulations.</p>

          <p>The recent transfer window highlighted a growing financial disparity between Spain's La Liga and England's Premier League, with English clubs outspending their Spanish counterparts by more than five to one. This difference is not due to a lack of ambition but rather a strategic choice by La Liga to enforce strict economic controls and prioritize long-term financial sustainability. Implemented in 2013 to combat widespread club debt and bankruptcy, these rules limit spending to generated revenue, forcing clubs to be more disciplined. While this has reduced the league's glamour, Spanish clubs remain highly competitive in European competitions, relying on strong youth academies to develop talent.</p>

          <p>The company Pray.com is attracting hundreds of thousands of views with its "AI Bible" YouTube channel, which uses artificial intelligence to create cinematic, action-movie-style depictions of biblical stories like the Book of Revelation. While the company reports positive feedback, particularly from younger audiences who find the content engaging, some theologians are critical of the approach. These critics argue that turning scripture into "edutainment" reminiscent of the Marvel Universe reduces its spiritual power and misrepresents its core messages. The controversy highlights a broader tension between using modern technology to spread religious teachings and preserving the theological integrity of the source material.</p>
