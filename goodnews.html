          <p>A partial collapse of a large industrial tunnel under construction in Los Angeles prompted a major rescue operation, but all 31 workers inside managed to reach safety. The workers were approximately six miles into the tunnel and 400 feet underground when the cave-in occurred. They were able to navigate over the debris to a tunnel boring machine and were then transported to the surface without any major injuries. Officials praised the workers for their calm response in a highly dangerous situation, turning a potentially tragic event into a successful rescue.</p>

          <p>The UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has granted Royal Mail permission to cease second-class letter deliveries on Saturdays. This reform to the Universal Service Obligation (USO) is intended to help the company manage costs amid a long-term decline in letter volumes. Under the new rules, Royal Mail must still deliver first-class letters six days a week, but delivery targets for both first and second-class mail will be slightly relaxed. The change is aimed at ensuring the financial sustainability of the postal service while maintaining essential delivery functions.</p>

          <p>A former official from China's central bank has argued that the yuan possesses the potential to become a safe-haven currency, citing the country's institutional credibility and strong macroeconomic fundamentals. The official noted the yuan's stability during recent global stress events, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the shock from US tariffs. For the yuan to achieve this status, however, greater flexibility in capital controls and increased foreign participation in its markets would be necessary. This perspective contributes to the ongoing debate about the internationalization of the yuan amid shifting global economic dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The market for weight-loss drugs in China is rapidly expanding, with projections suggesting it could become a US$150 billion industry. This growth is fueled by rising obesity rates and the recent approval of more effective medications, mirroring trends seen in Western countries. Innovent Biologics is the first domestic company to receive approval to market such a drug in the country. With numerous other producers vying for a share, this nascent market is poised for intense competition and significant growth in the coming years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vienna is frequently cited as a successful example of housing policy, largely due to its extensive and stable social housing sector, which comprises 43% of the city's housing units. This system, which serves a wide range of income levels, helps keep rent prices significantly lower than in the private market and dampens overall rent inflation. Originating in the "Red Vienna" era of the 1920s, the model has been maintained through long-term political commitment and is funded in part by a levy on employee salaries. While challenges in accessibility exist, Vienna demonstrates that prioritizing housing as a basic need is an achievable policy goal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team at the Beijing Institute of Technology has successfully created a "cyborg bee" by equipping it with the world's lightest brain controller. The device, weighing only 74 milligrams, is strapped to the bee's back and uses three needles to send electronic pulses to its brain. These pulses create illusions that can command the insect's flight path, directing it to turn, advance, or retreat with a high degree of accuracy. This technological achievement represents a significant step forward in the field of bio-robotics and remote control of living organisms.</p>

          <p>A large section of the iconic Sycamore Gap tree, which was illegally felled in 2023, has been installed as a permanent public memorial in Northumberland. The trunk is now the centerpiece of an exhibition at The Sill National Landscape Discovery Centre, near where the tree once stood. The installation, designed by artist Charlie Whinney, allows visitors to touch and interact with the wood, and is surrounded by benches inscribed with public messages of hope and remembrance. The memorial aims to transform an act of vandalism into a symbol of community resilience and love for nature.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has announced a new measure to combat high youth unemployment by offering a one-time subsidy to companies that hire unemployed individuals aged 16 to 24. Employers can receive up to 1,500 yuan for each new young hire who is given a formal contract and for whom social insurance contributions are paid for at least three months. This policy, in effect until the end of the year, is part of a broader effort to stabilize the labor market amid sluggish economic growth.

          <p>Shares of WK Kellogg, the North American cereal company, skyrocketed over 56% in after-hours trading following reports that it is in advanced takeover talks with Ferrero. The Italian confectionery giant, owner of brands like Nutella and Ferrero Rocher, is reportedly close to a deal valued at around $3 billion. A successful acquisition would give Ferrero a dominant position in the U.S. breakfast cereal market. The move comes as traditional food companies face challenges from shifting consumer preferences toward healthier options and rising operational costs. (not investment advice)</p>

A recent spike in housing prices and associated household debt has become a primary concern for financial stability, leading the central bank to prioritize this over stimulating growth. While the economy has shown signs of slowing, the bank is taking a cautious approach due to the risks posed by household debt, which is uniquely structured around the country's "jeonse" rental deposit system.
