          <p>During the Pittsburgh Steelers training camp, quarterback Aaron Rodgers has implemented a peculiar rule for his suitemate, wide receiver DK Metcalf. The two are sharing a dorm with a shared bathroom, and Rodgers has requested that Metcalf not flush the loud toilet at night to avoid disturbing his sleep. Metcalf recounted a humorous incident where he texted Rodgers late at night to confirm he was awake before flushing. Despite the odd rule, Rodgers expressed that he enjoys the dorm life and the opportunity it provides to connect with his teammates.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 17:30:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing regulations to protect pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, particularly from new residential developments. Under the proposed changes, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing new properties. The reforms also aim to streamline the process for opening new establishments in disused shops and encourage outdoor dining and performances to revitalize struggling town centers. This initiative comes in response to several high-profile cases where beloved venues faced closure threats due to noise issues, and amid a steady decline in the number of pubs across the country.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 17:26:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Voters in Taiwan have rejected a large-scale effort to recall 24 opposition lawmakers, allowing the China-friendly Kuomintang (KMT) party and its allies to retain their controlling majority in the legislature. The recall campaign was initiated by civic groups who accused the lawmakers of undermining national security and obstructing the agenda of President William Lai's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The failure of the recall means the current political gridlock, which has seen the opposition block budgets and judicial appointments, is likely to continue. This result emboldens the opposition while presenting a significant challenge for President Lai's administration for the remainder of his term.</p>

          <p>A deaf Mongolian man, who communicates via sign language, has been released from an ICE detention center in Southern California after being held for months without access to a qualified interpreter. A federal judge had ordered officials to provide an interpreter, ruling that holding proceedings without one violated the man's civil rights under federal disability laws. His attorneys argued his detention was akin to solitary confinement, as he was unable to communicate or participate in his own asylum case. The man, who sought asylum after being assaulted in Mongolia due to his disability, has now been reunited with his sister in Virginia.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi completed a two-day visit to the Maldives aimed at reinforcing diplomatic and economic relations with the strategically located island nation. The visit comes after a period of strained ties, as Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu was elected on a pro-China platform and previously secured the withdrawal of Indian military personnel. Amid concerns over the Maldives' struggling economy, Modi unveiled a $565 million credit line and inaugurated several India-funded infrastructure projects. The visit signals a potential mending of relations, with both leaders emphasizing their historic partnership in a region of significant geopolitical competition.</p>

          <p>England's hopes of securing a victory against India in the fourth Test at Old Trafford may hinge on the fitness of captain Ben Stokes. After a stellar first-innings performance, Stokes did not bowl on day four as India mounted a strong defense, with England's assistant coach citing stiffness and soreness. The talismanic all-rounder, who has a history of injuries, appeared weary in the field, raising concerns about his ability to contribute with the ball on the crucial final day. His absence from the bowling attack would be a significant blow to England as they push to win the match and level the series.</p>

          <p>Actress Gwyneth Paltrow has been hired as a 'very temporary' spokesperson for Astronomer, the tech company whose CEO resigned after a viral KissCam incident.

In a promotional video, Paltrow, the ex-wife of Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, deftly avoided the scandal while noting the company's newfound public interest. The move is a clear attempt by the data workflow automation company to steer the narrative away from the controversy and back towards its business operations.</p>
