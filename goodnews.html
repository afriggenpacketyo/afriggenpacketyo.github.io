          <p>A small meteorite that struck a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been identified by a planetary geologist as being 4.56 billion years old, making it older than Earth itself. The space rock, which left a dent in the homeowner's floor, is believed to have originated from the breakup of a large asteroid between Mars and Jupiter about 470 million years ago. Scientists are proposing to name it the McDonough Meteorite, marking the 27th meteorite ever recovered in Georgia. The event highlights how modern technology and public awareness are helping to recover more of these celestial objects.</p>

The Crew-10 mission, commanded by Anne McClain, landed safely west of San Diego after a 17.5-hour journey from the International Space Station. This was the first NASA-sponsored crew to land in the Pacific, a change made by SpaceX to ensure debris from the capsule's trunk section falls harmlessly away from populated areas.

The meeting underscores European allies' concerns that they must be part of any peace solution, especially after Trump signaled a deal might involve Ukraine ceding territory.</p>

          <h2>North Korea Begins Dismantling Propaganda Loudspeakers at Border, South Korea Says</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korea removing some of its propaganda loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border. This action follows South Korea's own dismantling of its speakers, which were used for anti-Pyongyang broadcasts, as a step to ease tensions. The tit-for-tat psychological warfare had recently escalated, with the North blasting irritating sounds in response to the South's K-pop and propaganda messages. While this represents a small de-escalation, tensions may flare again with the upcoming annual U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises.</p>

          <p>A development team has completed a $104 million project to convert the long-abandoned 19th-century campus of St. John's College in Brooklyn into a luxury apartment building. The property, now named The Hartby, features 205 units, including 62 designated for affordable housing, and preserves many of the original building's historic details like exposed brick and arched windows. The developers secured a 99-year ground lease from the adjacent church, which was keen to see the deteriorating landmark preserved and repurposed, creating a new community asset and income source.</p>

          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who created the well-known "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals three decades ago, has updated his advice for today's retirees. In a new book, he argues that due to more sophisticated portfolio diversification, the safe withdrawal rate is now closer to 4.7%, and could even be higher for many. Bengen's research suggests that retirees are often too conservative and could spend more without outliving their savings. He recommends strategies like annual rebalancing and a rising equity glide path to maximize retirement income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition is celebrating the work of Rachel Ruysch, a 17th-century Dutch artist who was one of the most famous and successful still-life painters of her era, even more so than contemporaries like Rembrandt and Vermeer. Growing up as the daughter of a renowned anatomist and embalmer, Ruysch developed a unique, scientifically precise style. She specialized in creating lush, complex bouquets featuring exotic flowers from around the world, often set against dark backgrounds and teeming with meticulously rendered insects and small creatures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Australian scientist, Karl Kruszelnicki, asserts that the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle can be easily solved with logic and statistics. He argues that there is no supernatural force at play, and the number of ships and planes that have gone missing in the area is proportionally the same as any other heavily traveled region of the ocean. This explanation, which points to a combination of high traffic volume, human error, and notoriously volatile weather, is supported by organizations like NOAA and the insurance market Lloyd's of London.</p>
