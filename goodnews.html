          <p>The world's most powerful solar telescope, located atop a volcano in Hawaii, has captured a detailed image of sunspots using its new Visible Tunable Filter (VTF). Scientists hope the VTF will help predict damaging solar storms that can disrupt Earth's communications and electrical grids. The National Solar Observatory (NSO) described the sunspots as areas of intense magnetic activity. The telescope's construction faced protests from native Hawaiians who view the land as sacred, but researchers are optimistic about its potential to mitigate the impact of geomagnetic disturbances.</p>
