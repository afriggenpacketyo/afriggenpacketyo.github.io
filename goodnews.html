          <p>With U.S. credit card debt remaining at historically high levels, financial experts are advising consumers on how to qualify for debt settlement or forgiveness. The process involves negotiating with creditors to pay less than the total amount owed, but requires demonstrating genuine financial hardship. Key steps include organizing financial documents, thoroughly documenting the hardship with proof like medical bills or termination letters, and researching reputable debt settlement firms. Experts stress the importance of getting any final settlement agreement in writing to ensure legal protection and proper credit reporting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Three major chemical companies—Chemours, DuPont, and Corteva—have agreed to a significant settlement with the state of New Jersey. The firms will pay $875 million over 25 years to resolve claims related to environmental pollution, including contamination from toxic PFAS, often called "forever chemicals." These substances, used in products like non-stick cookware, do not easily break down and are linked to serious health issues. This agreement is part of a larger trend of litigation against chemical companies for PFAS pollution, which resulted in over $11 billion in settlements during 2023.</p>

          <p>With certificate of deposit (CD) rates remaining relatively high, savers are weighing whether to lock in long-term rates or opt for the flexibility of short-term accounts. Currently, an inverted yield curve means short-term CDs are often paying higher rates than long-term ones, a sign that markets may expect the Federal Reserve to cut rates soon. Financial experts advise that the choice depends on individual goals; those needing access to funds soon might prefer a short-term CD, while those seeking predictable income could benefit from locking in a multi-year rate now.

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society indicates that lowering the recommended age for colorectal cancer screening to 45 is having a positive impact. The studies found a significant increase in screenings among people aged 45-49, which corresponds with a sharp rise in the diagnosis of early-stage, more treatable cancers in this age group. Health experts are encouraged by the findings, as detecting and removing precancerous polyps can prevent the disease entirely. The results underscore the success of the updated guidelines in improving early detection and saving lives.</p>

          <p>A practicing neurologist has shared a list of four specific foods he avoids to protect his brain health, offering advice beyond general warnings about processed items. He cautions against eating from damaged or bulging cans due to the risk of botulism, a potent neurotoxin. He also advises avoiding certain large reef fish from tropical areas that can carry ciguatoxin, and undercooked pork, which can cause a parasitic brain infection. Finally, he warns against unpasteurized milk, a source of dangerous pathogens that can lead to severe neurological damage.</p>

          <p>A new book by wealth manager Barry Ritholtz, titled "How Not to Invest," focuses on teaching investors how to build wealth by avoiding common mistakes. The book highlights behavioral errors such as "denominator blindness," where investors overreact to large point drops in the market without considering the percentage change. It also warns against trusting market prognosticators and panicking during downturns, noting that a significant portion of investors who panic-sell never reinvest in stocks. The central theme is that long-term success often comes from avoiding destructive, short-sighted decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Yum Brands delivered quarterly results that fell short of Wall Street's expectations, as its Pizza Hut and KFC chains faced declining sales in the United States. Both brands saw a 5% drop in U.S. same-store sales, which executives attributed to an "insufficient value message" in a challenging consumer environment. However, the company's overall performance was bolstered by the continued strength of Taco Bell, which reported a 4% increase in same-store sales. The mixed results highlight the diverging performance of Yum's major brands within its home market.</p>
