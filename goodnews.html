          <p>AI startup Anthropic has agreed to a settlement of at least $1.5 billion to resolve a class-action lawsuit filed by authors who accused the company of large-scale copyright infringement. The authors alleged that Anthropic illegally used their books, sourced from pirated datasets, to train its artificial intelligence models. As part of the agreement, Anthropic will pay approximately $3,000 per book and has committed to destroying the datasets containing the copyrighted material. If approved, this settlement would represent the largest publicly reported copyright recovery in history, sending a significant message to the AI industry regarding the use of protected works.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has ruled that the Trump administration's attempt to terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Venezuela and Haiti was unlawful. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen effectively blocks the administration from ending the legal protections and work permits for these individuals. In his decision, the judge criticized the Department of Homeland Security's action as unprecedented in its speed and a violation of the law. The ruling safeguards the status of these migrants unless it is overturned by a higher court on appeal.</p>

          <p>Following his death at age 91, industry experts are reflecting on Giorgio Armani's legacy as both a revolutionary designer and a masterful business leader who built a global empire. Armani was celebrated for popularizing the "power suit" for both men and women, creating a new aesthetic of sophisticated, ready-to-wear office attire that projected confidence. A key to his success was maintaining full control over his company, allowing for a consistent vision across a diverse portfolio that expanded from luxury clothing to perfumes, cosmetics, and home furnishings. His strategic use of celebrity endorsements, starting with dressing Richard Gere in "American Gigolo," also set a new standard for fashion marketing.</p>

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot grows to an estimated $1.7 billion, a new analysis of government data highlights which states have the highest lottery spending. Massachusetts residents lead the nation, spending an average of $915 per year on lottery tickets, followed by Rhode Island at $573 annually. At the other end of the spectrum, North Dakotans spend the least, at just $50 per year. The report notes that lottery sales can be a significant source of state revenue, accounting for an average of 1% of a state's general funds and as much as 3% in states like Rhode Island and South Dakota.</p>

          <p>An analysis of crime data examines the claims made by President Trump about Chicago being a "murder capital" and a "hell hole." According to FBI data from 2024, Chicago's violent crime rate was down 11% from the previous year and ranked 29th out of 37 large U.S. cities, lower than New York and Los Angeles. While Chicago did record the highest total number of homicides of any U.S. city, its homicide rate per 100,000 people ranked tenth. The article notes that crime analysts caution against simple city-by-city rankings due to differences in how data is reported and how city borders are drawn.</p>

          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed the sharp tone of her written response to a dissenting opinion from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. In a recent case concerning nationwide injunctions, Barrett said that Jackson's "spirited argument" merited an equally "spirited response." However, she emphasized that their professional disagreements are confined to legal interpretation and do not affect their personal relationship as colleagues and friends. Quoting her former mentor Justice Antonin Scalia, Barrett stated her approach is to "attack ideas... not attack people," dismissing any suggestion of personal animosity between them.</p>

          <p>The eight largest U.S. technology companies saw their combined market capitalization increase by $420 billion this week, reaching a total of $21 trillion. A significant driver was a favorable court ruling for Google in its antitrust case, which limited the remedies and removed a major uncertainty for both Alphabet and Apple, causing their stocks to rally. Additionally, chipmaker Broadcom's stock surged after it announced a new $10 billion AI chip contract with a major customer. These gains highlight the continued dominance of megacap tech firms, which now account for approximately 36% of the S&P 500's total value.</p>

          <p>The recent disappointing jobs report, which showed a rise in unemployment to 4.3% and minimal job growth, could lead to a positive outcome for homebuyers and homeowners. A weakening labor market increases the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to stimulate the economy at its upcoming meeting. Lenders have already begun pricing in an anticipated rate cut, contributing to a recent decline in mortgage rates to an 11-month low. The anemic employment data may prompt the Fed to implement a larger-than-expected rate reduction, which would likely cause mortgage and refinancing rates to fall even further.</p>

          <p>Following the release of a weaker-than-expected August jobs report, the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage saw its most significant one-day drop in over a year. The rate fell 16 basis points to 6.29%, its lowest level since October of the previous year, breaking out of the high 6% range where it had been for months. This sharp decline is a direct market reaction to the employment data, which increases the likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.

          <p>Following the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has initiated a wide-ranging cabinet reshuffle in an effort to reset his government. Instead of simply filling the vacant positions, Starmer has opted for a significant shake-up, appointing new individuals to major offices of state, including a new home secretary and a new foreign secretary. This move is seen as an attempt by the prime minister to seize a moment of crisis and reassert his authority and his government's focus on delivery. The reshuffle represents a critical moment, as Starmer confronts a challenging political landscape and aims to re-energize his administration.</p>

In a statement, the DOT said it would reconsider such "extra-statutory requirements" that go beyond what Congress has mandated.
