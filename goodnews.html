          <p>Ric Edelman, former head of Edelman Financial Engines, argues that the traditional 60-40 portfolio (60% stocks, 40% bonds) is no longer suitable for long-term retirement planning due to increasing longevity. Edelman suggests investors should allocate 70% to 80% of their portfolios to equities to ensure sufficient funds for a longer life expectancy, potentially reaching 100 years or more. He emphasizes the importance of considering advancements in health technology and biotech that could significantly extend lifespans, requiring larger retirement savings. According to Fidelity Investments, a retired couple aged 65 in 2024 may need as much as $315,000 saved just to cover health care expenses in retirement.</p>

          <p>Kendrick Lamar and SZA's co-headlining Grand National Tour at MetLife Stadium showcased their individual strengths and complementary styles. The performance balanced Lamar's principled stoicism with SZA's exuberant moodiness, creating a dynamic and engaging experience. Lamar's set list acknowledged his recent conflict with Drake but emphasized his shift towards anthemic songs. SZA's visuals focused on spiritual rebirth and emotional healing, though her intimate songs sometimes got lost in the stadium's vastness. The concert highlighted how competing visions of vengeance can coexist and even be the same.</p>

          <p>The Camogie Association is facing mounting pressure to relax its rule mandating skorts, with county and club teams advocating for the option to wear shorts. Former Antrim camogie All-Star Jane Adams argues the enforcement of skorts "screams sexism" and urges the association to "be transformational" and change the rule. A recent Gaelic Players Association survey revealed that 70% of players experienced discomfort while wearing skorts, and 83% desired the choice to wear shorts. The Camogie Association has called a Special Congress for May 22 to vote on the issue, after the Kilkenny and Dublin teams were forced to change into skorts before their Leinster Championship semi-final.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to release Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student, stating that her detention could chill the speech of noncitizens. Judge William K.

Ozturk, a doctoral student from Turkey, had been detained since March 25 and faced deportation proceedings allegedly due to an essay critical of Israel. The judge's decision follows criticism that the government is abusing the immigration system to deport international students.</p>

          <p>Individuals can collect Social Security benefits while receiving annuity payments, as Social Security does not restrict income from annuities. Annuities can supplement Social Security, offering predictable payouts for life or a set period. However, claiming Social Security before full retirement age reduces the monthly check, and annuity income can affect Social Security taxation. Consulting a retirement income specialist can help optimize the combination of Social Security and annuity income, ensuring a more stable and predictable financial future.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With home equity interest rates currently lower, homeowners should consider the smartest ways to pay off a HELOC. One approach is to take advantage of the interest-only payment period by paying more than just the interest, utilizing lower rates to accelerate payoff and protect against future rate increases. Homeowners should monitor the interest rate climate for opportunities to make larger payments, and strategically use the HELOC for eligible home repairs and renovations, as interest charges can be tax-deductible. Consulting a lending expert or home equity lender is recommended to build a personalized repayment strategy.</p>
