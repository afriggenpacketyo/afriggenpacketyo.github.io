          <p>Dwayne Johnson is taking on his most ambitious role yet, portraying real-life MMA fighter Mark Kerr in the dramatic film "The Smashing Machine," a significant departure from his usual action-oriented projects. Johnson underwent extensive makeup and prosthetics daily to transform into Kerr, who battled drug addiction and depression, a role he says allowed him to "rip myself open" emotionally. This shift reflects his desire for artistic fulfillment beyond box office success, drawing on personal trauma from his youth. Director Benny Safdie paired Johnson with Emily Blunt, with the actor acknowledging initial fears about tackling such a raw and vulnerable character.</p>

          <p>A child psychologist, drawing on research from over 200 parent-child relationships, outlines nine essential practices for raising children with exceptional social skills, emphasizing emotional safety and authentic connection. These practices include openly discussing feelings, modeling empathy, fostering genuine confidence, teaching conflict resolution, and validating children's emotions. The article stresses the importance of helping kids recognize social cues, allowing them to resolve minor conflicts independently, and treating mistakes as learning opportunities. Ultimately, listening more than lecturing enables children to become empathetic, resilient, and capable of forming strong, healthy relationships throughout their lives.</p>

          <p>The article revisits the pivotal 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, which unanimously declared the "separate but equal" doctrine unconstitutional, overturning nearly 60 years of legal segregation. It highlights the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's (NAACP) relentless legal strategy, led by attorney Thurgood Marshall, in challenging racial discrimination in America. While the ruling did not immediately eradicate all forms of segregation, it served as a monumental step towards achieving civil rights and pushing the United States closer to its foundational ideals of equality. Marshall later became the first African American Supreme Court Justice in 1967.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the decertification of Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency and a broader initiative to reform the nation's organ transplant system. This decisive action follows years of documented patient safety failures and violations, including disturbing reports of patients mistakenly declared dead before organ procurement. Kennedy emphasized the Trump administration's commitment to prioritizing patient safety and restoring public trust in the organ donation process, criticizing previous inaction. The goal is to ensure ethical practices and encourage organ donation, addressing a critical shortage with over 100,000 people on the waiting list.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has completely exited its highly profitable, long-term equity investment in the Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD, initially acquired in 2008 at Charlie Munger's recommendation. The divestment, which began in August 2022, was confirmed after Berkshire Hathaway Energy's Q1 financial filing listed the investment value as zero. Buffett previously indicated that geopolitical risks, particularly concerning Beijing's claim over Taiwan, influenced the decision to reduce similar holdings. This strategic move highlights Berkshire's careful consideration of global political stability in its investment portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States conducted a trilateral military exercise, "Freedom Edge," with Japan and South Korea without deploying an aircraft carrier, a notable deviation from previous practice. This decision has sparked varied interpretations among analysts regarding its implications for US-China relations. Some suggest it indicates a desire by the US to de-escalate tensions and boost engagement with Beijing and Pyongyang. Others believe it reflects the Trump administration's push for greater contributions from Asian allies in containing China within the strategically vital first island chain, signaling a potential shift in regional defense strategy.</p>
