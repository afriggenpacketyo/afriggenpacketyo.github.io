          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed to 5.1% in April, missing analysts' expectations and indicating that consumption remains a concern for the Chinese economy. Despite this, industrial output grew by 6.1%, exceeding forecasts, suggesting that the impact of U.S. tariffs was less severe than anticipated. Fixed-asset investment also saw a slight decrease, and the urban unemployment rate eased to 5.1%. Following a meeting between U.S. and Chinese trade representatives, a trade truce was established, leading global investment banks to raise their forecasts for China's economic growth.
