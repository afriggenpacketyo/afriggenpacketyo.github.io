          <p>Analysts are urging China to adopt a pragmatic approach to South Korea's new government, led by President Lee Jae Myung, as Seoul and Tokyo deepen their cooperation. Lee's foreign policy prioritizes shared international challenges, with his inaugural overseas visit to Japan marking a significant shift in diplomatic precedent since 1965. From Beijing's perspective, there is little reason for high expectations, suggesting a need for a realistic view of Seoul's evolving diplomacy. This strategic alignment, often framed as a response to the 'China challenge,' underscores a broader effort among the US, Japan, and South Korea to address regional security and economic interests, potentially reshaping East Asian power dynamics.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is hosting Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever in Berlin for separate diplomatic discussions. Talks with Carney focused on deepening bilateral ties, foreign policy, and economic issues, as Ottawa seeks closer European relations amid US tariff disputes. Carney recently visited Kyiv for Ukraine’s Independence Day, adding a layer of context to the foreign policy discussions. Merz's meeting with De Wever, on his inaugural visit, will cover bilateral cooperation, European affairs, and international security. These high-level visits underscore Germany's active role in fostering international partnerships and addressing shared challenges across the continent and with global allies.</p>

          <p>Transport for London (TfL) is launching a campaign urging passengers to use headphones or hands-free kits for mobile devices, aiming to curb the "disruptive behaviour" of playing music or making calls on loudspeakers. TfL research indicates 70% of commuters find such noise a nuisance, with some experiencing it as stressful, particularly individuals with heightened sensitivities like autism. Posters will appear on the Elizabeth line and other services, accompanied by social media outreach, with commuters widely backing the move. This initiative seeks to foster a more considerate and stress-free environment on public transport, acknowledging the increased use of mobile devices due to expanded 4G/5G coverage across central London.</p>

Filmed near her Montecito home, the series features celebrity friends and personal anecdotes, revealing details like her daily hot breakfast ritual and how Prince Harry first expressed his love while camping in Botswana. While the Duke of Sussex and their children do not appear on screen, the article notes the show avoids discussion of royal family rifts. Meghan also shares that what she misses most about the UK is Magic Radio, providing a lighthearted personal touch to her current lifestyle and interests.</p>

          <p>China is set to significantly expand its national carbon market to include major polluting industries by 2027, three years ahead of its original schedule. This initiative, outlined in new guidelines, also introduces absolute limits on emissions, a stricter standard than the current intensity-based caps. The move aims to boost demand in the often-sluggish carbon market and demonstrates China's determination to meet its climate targets, having become the world's biggest carbon polluter. Steel, aluminum, and cement sectors will be added this year under less stringent initial rules, marking a crucial step in the country's efforts to curb emissions and drive a more aggressive climate pathway, potentially spurring significant economic shifts.</p>

          <p>Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley faces a significant dilemma regarding whether to play in the upcoming tournament, a decision he describes as "defining" and "the biggest of my life." No playing captain has been seen since 1963, and combining the roles is considered challenging due to extensive captaincy duties and the risk of criticism regardless of the outcome. While Bradley is a top-ranked player and several teammates desire his participation, concerns exist about potential criticism if the US team loses with him playing or not. This quandary adds an intriguing subplot to the Ryder Cup, with Bradley set to announce his wildcards soon, while the European team, led by Luke Donald, appears in a more settled state.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has rescheduled its Super Heavy-Starship's 10th test flight to Tuesday night after two prior attempts were scrubbed due to an oxygen leak and an electrically charged cloud. This milestone mission aims to demonstrate fixes and upgrades following three catastrophic failures earlier this year. A successful flight is crucial for accelerating launch cadence, particularly for testing autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers next year, a key requirement for NASA's Artemis moon landing program by 2027 and eventual Mars missions. While thousands of engineering challenges remain, including perfecting orbital refueling, NASA officials express optimism based on SpaceX's rapid iteration and past successes with Falcon rockets, despite some expert skepticism about the 2027 moon landing timeline.</p>

Trump indicated his administration seeks to "get along good" with China and mentioned a recent conversation with President Xi, hinting at a potential visit to China later this year. This move signals a potential de-escalation in a previously tense area of US-China relations, focusing on educational exchange and fostering broader diplomatic ties, despite past rhetoric.</p>

          <p>Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, the long-elusive leader of the Sinaloa cartel, has pleaded guilty in a Brooklyn courtroom to US drug trafficking charges, expressing remorse for his role in fueling drug violence in Mexico and the United States. Zambada, 75, admitted to overseeing a vast operation that trafficked at least 1.5 million kilograms of cocaine and bribed Mexican officials, accumulating hundreds of millions annually. His arrest last year and subsequent plea mark a "landmark victory" for US anti-cartel efforts, ensuring he will spend the rest of his life in prison. This development also highlights the ongoing deadly power struggles within the cartel in Sinaloa, where his arrest touched off violent clashes between rival factions.</p>

This advancement in xenotransplantation, the transplantation of organs across species, offers a potential solution to the global organ shortage crisis.
