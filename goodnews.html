          <p>Christopher Kennedy, a 75-year-old man diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), has been given a new lease on life after a successful double-lung transplant. Initially given less than a year to live, Kennedy was resistant to the idea of a transplant but eventually agreed to the procedure at the Cleveland Clinic. Despite his age and post-surgery complications, his recovery has been remarkable, with his lung capacity now at 98%. The article details his journey from an unexpected diagnosis to his return to daily activities, including training a new hospital therapy dog he named Encore to celebrate his second chance.</p>

          <p>According to sources, US President Donald Trump is interested in visiting China this autumn, with officials in Washington and Beijing working to arrange a trip for October or November. A previously rumored September visit is reportedly off the table. The potential summit could occur either before or after the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in South Korea. The discussions follow a recent meeting between the two countries' top diplomats, which was described as positive and a crucial step toward a leader-level engagement. Hurdles remain, but there is said to be a consensus among high-level officials to make the visit happen.</p>

          <h2>Employer-Sponsored Student Loan Repayment Benefits Gain Traction</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 09:59:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More employers are offering student loan reimbursement benefits, a trend accelerated by new provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that make such contributions permanently tax-free for employees. The act allows employers to contribute up to $5,250 annually toward an employee's student loans without it being counted as taxable income. This development provides more certainty for companies that were hesitant to adopt the benefit, which was previously a temporary provision. As federal loan repayment options narrow, these workplace benefits are becoming an increasingly important tool for attracting and retaining talent struggling with student debt.

          <p>Irina Krynina, a Russian mother, left her life in Russia and moved to Ukraine to be near her partner, a Russian soldier who was captured while fighting. After arriving and finding her partner changed by the war, she founded the project "Our Way Out" to help other families of Russian POWs. Krynina visits camps, records video messages from prisoners to send to their families, and delivers parcels, providing a vital link and proof of life. Her work, which she says aims to show Russians the reality of the war, has placed her on Russia's "foreign agents" blacklist, but she continues her efforts.</p>

          <p>China has launched a global action plan for artificial intelligence, signaling an escalation in the technological competition with the United States. Announced at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, the plan calls for international cooperation and the establishment of a global AI organization. This move comes just days after the U.S. released its own AI strategy. Premier Li Qiang emphasized China's willingness to share its technology, particularly with nations in the Global South. Analysts suggest this is creating two distinct camps in AI development, with China favoring a multilateral approach while the U.S. builds a coalition with its allies.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 09:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article posits that Justin Bieber's surprise album, "Swag," has unexpectedly delivered the true song of the summer with its hit single "Daisies." The author argues that in a year of cultural malaise, the album's downtempo, R&B-influenced, and sonically muffled production provides a soothing and reflective sound that resonates more than upbeat party anthems. The music, influenced by indie producers, is described as serene and sad yet intricate, capturing a collective mood of burnout and a desire for stability over passion. This contrasts with last year's hedonistic hits, suggesting a broader cultural shift toward more reserved and melancholic pop music.</p>

          <p>Brazil is undertaking a massive public health initiative by breeding and releasing millions of mosquitoes engineered with the Wolbachia bacteria to fight dengue and other viruses. These "Wolbitos," or good mosquitoes, carry a bacterium that prevents the dengue virus from replicating inside them, thus stopping transmission to humans. A pilot program in the city of Niterói resulted in a roughly 90% drop in dengue cases, along with significant reductions in Zika and chikungunya. The Brazilian government is now scaling up the project, aiming to protect 140 million people over the next decade with this innovative and self-sustaining biological control method.</p>

It notes that for an elite athlete with pre-existing health conditions, securing a comprehensive plan is crucial. The piece also contrasts the current situation with the pre-Affordable Care Act era, when athletes could be denied coverage entirely, illustrating the persistent link between work and health benefits.</p>
