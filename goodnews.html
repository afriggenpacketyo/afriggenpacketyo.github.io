          <p>The article reports that the UK Parliament is set to debate the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, which would legalize assisted dying for terminally ill adults in England and Wales, after significant changes were made to it. The bill has undergone intense scrutiny and several amendments, including removing the need for a High Court judge to sign off on each request. The government also quietly revised its impact assessment, reducing the upper estimate for assisted deaths in the first year. MPs will have a free vote on the bill, which has divided Parliament, with strong opinions on both sides, but ultimately, the passing of the bill would be a historic change for society.</p>

          <p>Trade ministers from Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) nations convened in South Korea amidst concerns over U.S. tariffs. The meeting provided an opportunity for countries to engage with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer before the expiration of a 90-day pause on tariffs. Many countries, initially planning to send vice ministers, instead sent ministers to push for meetings with Greer. The article explains that President Trump had imposed tariffs on goods from numerous countries, claiming they exploited the U.S. through trade surpluses, but later suspended them for negotiations. Tensions between the U.S. and China loomed large, impacting the region's economic outlook, with APEC cutting its growth forecast due to trade frictions and policy uncertainty.</p>

The article notes that while the realism of these figures is debated, the Gulf states aim to be at the forefront of partnerships with the U.S. in business, military, and technology. The Gulf states see President Trump as a business-first leader who symbolizes fast money, big defense, and access to American tech, and they are competing with other regions for closer relations with the U.S. administration.</p>
