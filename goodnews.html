          <p>The UK is set to allow foreign states to own up to 15% of British newspapers and news magazines under new laws. This change follows a previous ban enacted after a takeover bid for the Telegraph and the Spectator by RedBird IMI, which was backed by the Abu Dhabi ruling family. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy stated the changes would protect "media plurality" while helping publishers "raise vital funding". The decision was made after consultations revealed that a complete ban was considered too restrictive for securing financing.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has endorsed two bills aimed at simplifying housing development in urban areas. Newsom emphasized the need to cut red tape to address the state's housing crisis. The governor's revised budget proposal includes provisions to reform the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and remove other obstacles to new housing. Assembly Bill 609 and Senate Bill 607, sponsored by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks and state Sen. Scott Wiener respectively, seek to ease the permitting process for infill projects and clarify CEQA exemptions.</p>

          <p>The Santa Monica City Council has approved a proposal to turn the Third Street Promenade into an entertainment zone by allowing public drinking. The new policy will permit visitors to purchase alcoholic beverages from participating businesses and consume them outdoors on Fridays through Sundays from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m., beginning in June. The goal is to revitalize the commercial district, which has experienced declining foot traffic since 2019. Participants must be 21 or older and wear a wristband, with some residents expressing concerns about potential increases in crime and homelessness.</p>

          <p>According to this New York Times article, overdose deaths in the United States decreased by nearly 30,000 last year, signaling progress in combating the public health crisis. The data, released by the CDC, shows declines in all major drug use categories and in most states. Public health experts attribute the improvement to changes in the illicit drug supply, increased access to treatment, and naloxone use. However, proposed funding cuts to federal health programs, including those addressing the drug crisis, raise concerns about sustaining this progress, even as drug fatalities remain high.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump announced a $96 billion contract for Boeing to supply Qatar with 210 planes. The announcement occurred during a trip to Doha, coinciding with criticism over Trump's plan to accept a luxury jet from the Qatari government. The White House claims the aviation agreement will support 154,000 American jobs annually. Trump has defended Qatar's offer of a Boeing 747-8 jetliner to use as Air Force One, citing the age and underwhelming nature of the current presidential aircraft.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed a pause to the enrollment of more low-income immigrants without legal status for state-funded health care benefits in 2026, citing a $12 billion budget deficit. The decision is driven by higher-than-expected costs and economic uncertainty related to federal tariff policies. The freeze will not affect those already enrolled in Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program, and will not impact children. Starting in 2027, adults with "unsatisfactory immigration status" on Medi-Cal will have to pay a $100 monthly premium.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses how the resentencing of Lyle and Erik Menendez has brought the culture and politics of the 1990s under scrutiny. The brothers' lawyer argued that the criminal justice policies of that era, such as three-strikes laws and long sentences, led to their harsh punishment. The media landscape has changed significantly, with two Netflix shows and social media campaigns fueling new interest in the case. The article also discusses how the brothers' claims of sexual assault were treated with skepticism at the time, and how that attitude has evolved.</p>
