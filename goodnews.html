          <p>Tommy Fello, a 71-year-old restaurateur, experienced a debilitating stroke that left him with no movement in his left arm and leg, with traditional therapies yielding only minor improvements. His recovery significantly advanced after receiving the Vivistim System, an FDA-approved implant that uses vagus nerve stimulation during rehabilitation. This first-of-its-kind technology enhances the brain's neuroplasticity, allowing for greater and faster improvements in motor function. Fello, the first patient at Cleveland Clinic to receive the implant, has shown remarkable progress, regaining function and reducing pain. Experts believe this device and similar emerging technologies could revolutionize stroke recovery, offering renewed hope for patients.</p>

The project is a key component of a broader vision to create a cross-continental railway connecting the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.

          <p>The impending "great wealth transfer" includes an estimated $25 trillion in real estate, posing significant financial and emotional challenges for families. This article outlines five strategies for wealthy parents to effectively pass down properties to their children, minimizing taxes, costs, and potential disputes. Key advice includes transferring real estate through wills or trusts to leverage a "step-up in basis" for capital gains tax benefits, and using LLCs and trusts to shield assets from lawsuits. Additionally, families are encouraged to establish clear operating agreements for shared properties and to set aside liquid assets for upkeep, while also preparing for the possibility that some heirs may wish to sell their share.

          <p>South Park's latest season is gaining record ratings for its direct and "vicious" satire of the Trump administration, notably parodies of figures like Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Vice President JD Vance. This approach stands out amidst a media landscape where other outlets, including parent company Paramount Pictures, have faced pressure from the administration. While Paramount recently underwent a merger requiring an ombudsman to address "bias," its CEO defended South Park's creators as "equal opportunity offenders." The show's success, generating millions of viewers across cable and streaming, suggests that its uninhibited critique resonates with audiences, proving that strong financial performance can sometimes outweigh political pressures in the entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>Medtronic PLC, the world's largest medtech company, has appointed John Groetelaars and Bill Jellison to its board and established Growth and Operating Committees, following engagement with activist investor Elliott Investment Management. This move addresses long-standing investor frustration over Medtronic's stagnant stock performance and underwhelming mid-single-digit revenue growth despite its market leadership. The Growth Committee will focus on portfolio management and M&A opportunities, while the Operating Committee aims for gross margin expansion, an area where Medtronic has lagged peers. These governance changes, along with the planned diabetes business spin-off and new product developments, signal a strategic shift towards long-term growth and improved shareholder value.

          <h2>Florida Pioneers Climate-Resilient Urban Planning Amid Increasing Hurricane Threats</h2>

          <p>Following the devastating impact of Hurricane Ian in 2022, which caused nearly $120 billion in damage, Florida is increasingly focusing on climate-resilient urban planning. Communities like Babcock Ranch are designed to withstand major storms, featuring native plants for water absorption, repurposed rock mines for stormwater management, and homes built with impact-resistant materials. This approach proved successful during Ian, attracting residents seeking safer alternatives to vulnerable coastal areas. While some cities assist low-income residents in rebuilding smarter, challenges remain, including high insurance costs and declining federal support for mitigation efforts under the current administration. Experts emphasize the significant long-term financial benefits of investing in preventive resilience measures.</p>

          <p>A new wave of younger, social-media savvy Democratic candidates is launching primary challenges against long-serving incumbents, driven by frustration with what they perceive as an ossifying and out-of-touch party establishment. These insurgents, including Liam Elkind and Everton Blair, argue that party elders have failed to act with sufficient urgency against the Trump administration's policies, leading to a sense of "sleepwalking into dystopia." They advocate for new energy, a clearer vision for working-class Americans, and a more effective communication strategy beyond simply opposing Trump. While facing resistance from incumbents who highlight their experience, these challengers believe the current political moment demands a fundamental reimagining of the Democratic Party's approach.</p>

          <p>Eddie Horne, a 75-year-old Florida man, has finally received his high school diploma, fulfilling a lifelong goal decades after his education was derailed by severe abuse at the notorious state-run Dozier School for Boys. Horne, who attended the school in the 1960s, endured molestation, vicious beatings, and neglect at the institution, which was eventually shuttered in 2011 after investigations confirmed widespread abuse. He pursued his diploma through a compensation program for Dozier victims, aiming to inspire others to overcome life's setbacks. This achievement represents a profound personal victory for Horne, who now plans to seek employment as a criminal justice specialist.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Empower report indicates that Americans, on average, believe the ideal retirement age is 58, significantly younger than the current typical retirement ages of 64 for men and 62 for women. However, financial experts caution that retiring early carries substantial risks, especially given increasing lifespans and the need for 30-40 years of non-working income. Key considerations include ensuring sufficient savings to avoid shortfalls during economic downturns and securing healthcare coverage before Medicare eligibility at 65. The article emphasizes the importance of aggressive early savings and understanding one's financial needs, noting that many who retire early do so due to health or employment issues, rather than financial stability.

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has resumed its eruptions, dramatically shooting lava 100 feet into the air from its summit crater, Halemaumau. This marks the 31st such display since December, characteristic of one of the world's most active volcanoes. The eruption is contained within the summit, posing no threat to nearby homes, allowing visitors and residents to safely witness the spectacle at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain that magma continuously rises from the Earth's interior, building pressure until it erupts in powerful fountains. While the intensity of the fountains may vary, Kilauea's activity is a natural and awe-inspiring process, deeply intertwined with Native Hawaiian cultural stories of the volcano goddess Pele.</p>

          <p>Japan is broadening its defense ties, notably with the United Kingdom and other allies, amidst perceived mixed signals from the United States and growing concerns over China's influence. This month, British and U.S. F-35B fighter jets conducted historic landing and launching exercises on the Japanese destroyer-carrier JS Kaga, as part of a multinational exercise in the Philippine Sea involving 11 ships and 23 aircraft. Analysts suggest these joint trainings lay the foundation for tactical integration and enhance familiarity with the region's military geography. The move indicates Japan's strategic efforts to strengthen its security posture and diversify its alliances in the Indo-Pacific, navigating complex geopolitical dynamics with an eye on regional stability.</p>

          <p>A central Berlin street, historically known by a name with racist connotations, is finally set to be renamed after a prolonged legal battle. The street, previously referred to respectfully as M-Strasse, will be honored with the name of Anton Wilhelm Amo, the first Africa-born scholar to earn a European doctorate in 1734. The original name stemmed from the 18th-century practice of bringing enslaved Africans to Germany as "court moors," embodying a history of violence against Black people. This renaming, which follows decades of lobbying by civil society groups, is celebrated as a significant act of decolonization and a crucial step in recognizing Black history, achievement, and resilience within Germany.</p>
