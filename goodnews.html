          <p>The White House has announced a potential trade deal with China, though specifics remain unclear. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the Geneva talks as "productive," promising further details.

          <p>An opinion piece argues against viewing the artificial intelligence (AI) race solely through the lens of US-China competition. The author contends that unbridled AI development poses immense risks, potentially leading to a world where everyone loses. The simplistic narrative neglects the agency and interests of third parties, including countries, multinational organizations, and corporations not fully aligned with either Beijing or Washington. While AI model training is resource-intensive, model performance is only one aspect of the equation, and a more nuanced perspective is necessary.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has pledged to overhaul the UK's immigration system with stricter English tests for visa applicants and their adult dependents. Migrants will need to wait ten years to apply for settlement instead of five, though a fast-track will be available for certain skilled workers. Critics warn the new rules could split families, but research suggests migrants value language skills for integration and employment. The plan aims to make settlement a privilege earned, not a right, amidst successive governments' struggles to reduce net migration.</p>
