          <p>Dennis Alexander, the 29-year-old leader of a drug-trafficking organization based in Pittsburgh, has been sentenced to 9 to 18 years in prison. He pleaded guilty to distributing various controlled substances, including fentanyl and heroin, across Allegheny and Beaver counties. According to the Pennsylvania Attorney General's office, the investigation involved multiple law enforcement agencies and documented numerous sales to informants or undercover officers. Alexander, who has two prior felony drug convictions, was also charged with illegally possessing a firearm.</p>

          <h2>Historical Analysis Suggests 1979 Iranian Revolution Was a Contingent Event, Not an Inevitability</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of Scott Anderson's new book, "King of Kings," supports the argument that the 1979 Iranian Revolution was not a predetermined outcome but rather a result of historical contingency and miscalculation. The analysis highlights how the Shah's hubris, coupled with the U.S. government's ignorance and inaction, created a power vacuum that Ayatollah Khomeini skillfully exploited. Anderson's work suggests the revolution's success hinged on specific actions and errors in the months leading up to it, rather than a grand, structural cause. The article concludes that understanding this event as an "accident" of history offers a more instructive lesson than searching for a single culprit.</p>

          <p>Following a post-earnings drop, Amazon's stock showed signs of recovery, with analysts attributing the recent weakness to concerns over its cloud computing market share against competitors like Google and OpenAI. Jim Cramer suggested that increased investment in Nvidia chips could help Amazon's cloud division accelerate its growth. Meanwhile, investors are looking ahead to Walt Disney's upcoming quarterly earnings, with hopes for continued strength in its theme parks and progress toward profitability in its streaming services. The article notes that a slight dip in Disney's stock price ahead of the report could be beneficial for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals turning 70, an annuity can be an attractive option for securing a guaranteed retirement income stream, especially given current economic uncertainties. Experts suggest that buying an annuity at this age can result in higher monthly payments due to shorter life expectancy calculations by insurers. However, potential drawbacks include a lack of liquidity, high fees, and the risk of not recouping the initial investment if one's health is poor. The article advises that the decision depends heavily on individual circumstances, including health, other income sources, and financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Students in Scotland have received their exam results, with data from the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) showing a modest rise in pass rates for National 5, Higher, and Advanced Higher qualifications compared to last year. The attainment gap between students from the most and least deprived areas also narrowed slightly. Additionally, the university admissions service, Ucas, reported a record number of Scottish youth being offered university or college placements. While some mail deliveries were delayed by a storm, the overall results were described by the education secretary as "very positive."</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024, including a notable 14.9% drop in murder and a 18.6% decline in motor vehicle thefts. This continues a downward trend from the spike seen after the COVID-19 pandemic. While the FBI did not speculate on the reasons for the decline, experts note that while most crime types are below pre-pandemic levels, aggravated assaults remain elevated. The report compiled data from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, covering about 95% of the U.S. population.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied Sean Combs's request for release on bail ahead of his October sentencing hearing, ensuring he will remain in custody. Combs was convicted on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. His defense team argued for his release with a $50 million bond, but the judge ruled that his circumstances had not changed since bail was last denied. The judge cited evidence of violence presented during the trial and deemed Combs a flight risk, concluding that these factors outweighed concerns about his conditions in jail.</p>

          <h2>Experts Outline Steps to Qualify for Credit Card Debt Forgiveness</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt at historically high levels, financial experts are advising consumers on how to qualify for debt settlement, also known as credit card debt forgiveness. To improve their chances of success, individuals should first organize their finances and obtain their credit reports to understand their total debt load. It is also crucial to document evidence of financial hardship, such as job loss or medical bills, as creditors need to see a verifiable reason to settle for less than the full amount. Finally, experts recommend getting any settlement agreement in writing before making payments. (not investment advice)</p>
