          <p>Travelers without a Real ID, passport, or other federally recognized document will face additional security screening at U.S. airports, but will still be allowed to fly, according to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. This announcement comes as the federal deadline to enforce the Real ID law approaches. Noem stated that 81% of travelers already have compliant identification and that the TSA will accept passports and tribal IDs. The Real ID law was enacted in response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to establish more secure identification standards.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio is merging the Palestinian Affairs Office into the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, reinstating a diplomatic framework established during President Trump's first term. This decision will unify the U.S. diplomatic mission in Israel's capital under the U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee. The move reverses the Biden administration's 2022 establishment of the U.S. Office of Palestinian Affairs and aligns with the U.S. Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, which recognizes Jerusalem as Israel‚Äôs capital. The State Department emphasized the U.S. remains committed to its relationship with Israel and securing peace in the region.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada met with President Trump, aiming to assert Canada's sovereignty while avoiding public conflict, days after winning election on an anti-Trump platform. Carney emphasized that Canada is ‚Äúnot for sale‚Äù and will not become the 51st U.S. state. Despite previous criticisms and tariff disputes, Trump struck a conciliatory tone, praising Carney's electoral victory. The meeting addressed trade relations and foreign affairs, including discussions on Russia-Ukraine and Iran. The two leaders agreed to continue talks to improve their trading relationship, though no breakthroughs were achieved.</p>

          <p>A couple visiting Boston claims they were forced out of the Liberty Hotel after a security guard accused one of them of being a man in the women‚Äôs restroom. Ansley Baker and her girlfriend, Liz Victor, both cisgender women, said a security guard demanded Baker leave the stall, leading to a confrontation. The hotel initially accused the women of sharing a stall, but later said it was suspending the security officer and conducting retraining for staff on inclusive practices. The incident highlights tensions between the administration and the LGBTQ+ community, with some of Donald Trump‚Äôs earliest moves in office targeting transgender rights.</p>
