          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire, ending tensions that had escalated following an attack on Indian-controlled Kashmir, according to Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar. President Trump announced the ceasefire on social media, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that the US mediated the agreement. The ceasefire comes after days of cross-border fire and strikes, with civilian casualties reported on both sides, and rising tensions following an April attack on Hindu tourists in Kashmir. India had previously accused Pakistan of attacking 26 locations across India, while Pakistan denied involvement in the April attack and said it was conducting retaliatory strikes.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972 for a Venus mission but stranded in Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction, reentered the Earth's atmosphere. The European Union Space Surveillance and Tracking confirmed the uncontrolled reentry, while the European Space Agency's space debris office indicated the spacecraft reentered after it failed to appear over a German radar station. The spacecraft, weighing half a ton, was built to withstand a landing on Venus, leading experts to believe some parts might have survived the descent. The chances of anyone getting hit by debris were exceedingly low, according to scientists.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily halted the Trump administration's sweeping government overhaul, citing that Congress did not authorize large-scale staffing cuts and agency restructuring. Judge Susan Illston sided with a group of unions, non-profits, and local governments in blocking mass layoffs known as ‚Äúreductions in force‚Äù for 14 days. The ruling is the broadest against the government overhaul led by Elon Musk, with dozens of lawsuits challenging the work of the ‚Äúdepartment of government efficiency‚Äù (Doge). The judge scheduled a hearing for May 22 to consider a longer-lasting preliminary injunction.</p>

          <p>A deadly terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war, resulting in missile and drone strikes. After U.S.-led mediation talks, the countries agreed to a ceasefire. The rivalry between the two countries stems from the partition of India in 1947 and the dispute over the Kashmir region. Both nations claim all of Kashmir as their own territory, but each controls only part of it. The conflict has led to multiple wars and a pro-independence insurgency in Indian-administered Kashmir.</p>

The company also agreed that the strategic committee will conduct a strategic review, during which the investor designated directors will be appointed to the strategic committee.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues that progressives should be concerned about the rapidly falling rates of family formation in the US and the rest of the world. An aging and shrinking population means a massive decrease in expected quality of life in the future, with fewer people to support a larger elderly population and fewer people to do the things that make life richer and more interesting. The author suggests that progressive policies such as less expensive housing, universal pre-K, support for new parents, better schools, and more affordable healthcare could help address the issue.</p>

          <p>Researchers have found that a spear tip carved from bone, unearthed from Russia in 2003, is as old as 80,000 years, meaning it could not have been created by modern humans. Homo sapiens didn't venture into Europe until about 45,000 years ago, so the most likely spear-wielders in this case were the Neanderthals (Homo neanderthalensis). The spear tip joins a few other recent finds that demonstrate Neanderthals developed techniques specific to working with bone, such as scraping and flat cutting. The bone was likely once part of a bison.</p>

All nine patients in the trial produced healthy immune cells capable of fighting infections, and none of the patients who participated in the trial have had severe infections since their treatment. Five years after participating in the study, the Langenhop children are doing well, and the therapy is now under review with the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
