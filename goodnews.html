          <p>A new company named Jams, backed by prominent athletes like Alex Morgan and C.J. Stroud, is launching a line of frozen peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to challenge the market dominance of Smucker's Uncrustables. Jams aims to attract health-conscious consumers by using no seed oils, artificial ingredients, or high-fructose corn syrup, and by offering more protein than its competitor. The product will be sold exclusively at 3,000 Walmart stores nationwide at a slightly higher price point than Uncrustables. Despite the significant challenge, the founder is betting on the appeal of higher-quality ingredients for athletes and families.</p>

          <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has stated its intention to maintain a 'moderately loose' monetary policy to support the nation's goal of approximately 5% economic growth for the year. A deputy governor of the bank explained that the full effects of previous supportive measures have yet to be realized due to inherent policy lags. The central bank will carefully monitor economic conditions and market performance before implementing any future adjustments. This strategy is designed to stimulate domestic demand, stabilize public expectations, and ensure the achievement of China's annual economic and social development objectives.</p>

          <p>As part of its annual Han Kuang military exercises, Taiwan's navy conducted a live-streamed drill simulating the deployment of naval mines to deter a potential invasion. The exercise, held off a naval base in Kaohsiung, featured fast minelaying boats deploying various types of sea mines, which are considered a cost-effective asymmetric weapon. Concurrently, military police in Taipei practiced urban warfare tactics, using the city's metro system for the pre-dawn transport of troops and supplies. These drills are designed to bolster Taiwan's combat readiness and defensive capabilities against a possible cross-strait conflict.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Defends Headquarters Renovation Project Amid Trump Administration Attacks</h2>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has quietly pushed back against escalating criticism from the Trump administration regarding its $2.5 billion headquarters renovation. In response to accusations of mismanagement and extravagance from officials like OMB Director Russell Vought, the Fed published a new 'Frequently Asked Questions' page on its website. The page clarifies that the project is a necessary modernization of historic buildings, not an 'ostentatious overhaul,' and refutes claims of new VIP dining rooms. The Fed also explains that cost increases are due to unforeseen conditions like asbestos, and notes that the project is self-funded, not paid for by taxpayers.</p>

          <p>During the first visit by an Indian foreign minister in five years, China's Vice-Premier Han Zheng urged both nations to respect each other's concerns and promote stable bilateral relations. Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar expressed confidence that the discussions would maintain a positive trajectory for their relationship. Jaishankar specifically noted the appreciation in India for the resumption of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra, a significant pilgrimage in Tibet that was suspended for five years due to border tensions and the pandemic. The meeting signals a mutual desire for continued normalization of ties and practical cooperation.</p>

          <p>Buckingham Palace has announced that U.S. President Donald Trump has accepted an invitation from King Charles III for a second state visit to the United Kingdom, scheduled for September 17-19. The visit is unprecedented, as second-term presidents are not traditionally offered a full state visit. Trump and the First Lady will be hosted at Windsor Castle, as Buckingham Palace is undergoing renovations. The event will involve senior members of the Royal Family and include a ceremonial welcome and a state banquet, serving as a significant moment of soft diplomacy amid ongoing trade and geopolitical discussions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Chinese humanoid robot start-ups AgiBot and Unitree Robotics have secured a significant contract worth $17.3 million from state-owned China Mobile, the world's largest telecom operator. The two-year deal involves AgiBot supplying full-size humanoid robots and Unitree providing smaller, more nimble machines. This large-scale order reflects a broader government strategy to accelerate the adoption of advanced robotics within state-owned enterprises. The move aligns with China's goal to make humanoid robots a transformative technology, similar to computers and smartphones, and to establish a leading position in the global industrial landscape.</p>

          <h2>Former NYC Rent Board Member Defends Rent Freeze Proposals as Necessary Lifelines</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 08:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this op-ed, former NYC Rent Guidelines Board member Leah Goodridge argues that proposals for a rent freeze, like those from mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, are not unrealistic but are vital lifelines for many New Yorkers. Drawing on her experience as a tenants' rights attorney, she asserts that a rent freeze is a proven tool, having been implemented four times in the last decade to address affordability crises. Goodridge contends that criticism of rent freezes is part of a broader agenda by landlord interests to deregulate and ultimately dismantle the rent stabilization system, which protects over a million households from excessive rent hikes and unjust evictions.</p>

          <p>This article explores the long and varied history of queerness, challenging the modern binary gender model by examining how different societies have treated non-normative identities. It highlights periods of acceptance, such as in ancient Greece and Rome where same-sex relationships were common, and contrasts them with eras of persecution, often justified by religious texts. The piece discusses historical figures from Leonardo da Vinci to Anne Lister, whose coded diaries detailed her lesbian relationships. It also touches upon the existence of third-gender identities in various cultures, emphasizing that diversity in gender and sexuality is not a new phenomenon but a long-standing part of human history.</p>

          <p>The UK government has launched a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, suggesting that the state-owned enterprise could be transformed into an employee-owned mutual organization. This proposal, aimed at rebuilding trust and changing the organization's culture after the Horizon IT scandal, has been discussed for over a decade. The consultation will also seek public input on the services the Post Office should provide, especially as a hub for banking in communities where high street banks are closing. While a shift to a mutual model would be complex, it is being considered as a long-term option to ensure financial and operational stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article refutes the characterization of the YIMBY ('yes in my backyard') movement as a centrist or conservative cause, arguing it is fundamentally a progressive, populist effort. The author contends that advocating for fewer building restrictions is an attack on the 'regulatory capture' by wealthy landowners who use zoning laws to create artificial housing scarcity and inflate their property values. This dynamic functions like a cartel restricting supply to keep prices high. The piece asserts that building more housing is a natural ally of anti-monopoly goals, as it aims to unrig the market, expand access for all, and combat the cost-of-living crisis.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, who recently won the Democratic primary for New York City mayor, has centered his campaign on affordability, with his proposal for universal free childcare resonating strongly with families. The plan, funded by taxes on corporations and the wealthy, responds to a crisis where average childcare costs exceed $26,000 annually. Activists and parents, burdened by the immense cost, see the policy as a winning issue that addresses financial strain and gender inequality. While facing political hurdles, the proposal builds on the success of the city's universal pre-K program, signaling a growing demand for childcare to be treated as a public good.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 06:54:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's headline consumer inflation rate fell to a lower-than-expected 2.10% in June, extending a slide to its lowest point in over six years. The continued easing, driven by declining food prices, provides more room for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to continue its monetary policy relaxation after a significant rate cut in May. Economists expect inflation to remain low, aided by strong crop production and a good monsoon season, which should boost consumer purchasing power. These conditions could help accelerate India's economic growth, which was a faster-than-expected 7.4% in the previous quarter. (not investment advice)</p>
