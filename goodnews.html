          <p>The UK Aids Memorial Quilt, comprising 42 quilts and 23 textile panels representing nearly 400 individuals who died from HIV/Aids in the UK, is being showcased at the Tate Modern's Turbine Hall. The quilt, created in 1994 by loved ones of the deceased, serves as a reminder of those lost and offers a chance for collective grieving. The project was initiated by Scottish activist Alistair Hulme after witnessing the American version of the quilt, with individuals like Frankie O'Reilly and Cathy John contributing panels to honor their loved ones and aid in their healing process. The exhibition, initiated by author Charlie Porter, aims to allow more people to view the quilt and provide an opportunity to grieve after the stigma surrounding HIV prevented proper mourning in the past. The quilt includes tributes to notable figures like novelist Bruce Chatwin and actors Denham Elliot and Ian Charleston, symbolizing love, friendship, and dedication.</p>

          <p>China is aggressively developing its domestic AI chip ecosystem in response to U.S. restrictions on advanced semiconductor imports. The U.S. curbs hinder China's access to critical technologies across the semiconductor value chain, from design and manufacturing equipment to memory chips. The Chinese government is investing heavily to bridge these gaps, achieving some breakthroughs but still facing significant challenges. Huawei's HiSilicon is emerging as a potential competitor to Nvidia, with its Ascend 910B and upcoming 910C GPUs showing progress, though still lagging behind Nvidia's offerings; SMIC, China's largest chip foundry, is working to improve its manufacturing capabilities, but remains behind TSMC in advanced chip production. Despite these efforts, China's AI chip ecosystem still faces hurdles, particularly in acquiring advanced chipmaking equipment and memory components.</p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines present contrasting views on the chancellor's Spending Review, with some praising it as "renewing Britain" while others criticize it as a "reckless splurge". The NHS and defense are highlighted as major beneficiaries, while police and other departments may face financial constraints. Tax increases are predicted by several papers as inevitable to balance the budget, while the Daily Mirror commends the plans for prioritizing the majority over the privileged few. The Financial Times supports directing funds towards affordable housing and energy security but calls for broader tax reforms and training for construction workers and engineers. The Daily Star suggests the spending plans are a transparent bid to regain momentum from Reform UK.</p>

President Lee's decision aligns with his campaign promise to restore trust and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula. The broadcasts, which included propaganda messages and K-pop music, had resumed in June 2024 after North Korea launched trash-filled balloons towards the South, escalating psychological warfare between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has unveiled a Spending Review that allocates an extra ¬£29bn per year to the NHS in England, alongside increased funding for defense and housing. The government aims to "renew Britain" through investments in artificial intelligence and transport projects, but some departments, including the Foreign Office and the environment department, will face budget constraints. The review has been described as a "spend now, tax later" approach, with predictions of future tax increases to balance the books.

          <p>Chinese court astronomers in 1408 documented the appearance of a mysterious new star, which has now been confirmed as a nova. The detailed record, including the star's size and brightness, has helped modern astronomers narrow down its possible location. The astronomers reported the star as "about the size of a cup-shaped oil lamp, with a pure yellow colour, smooth and bright," interpreting it as a heavenly endorsement of Emperor Yongle's reign. The discovery, reported in The Astronomical Journal, provides unprecedented insights into the celestial event and settles a long-standing debate about its nature.</p>
