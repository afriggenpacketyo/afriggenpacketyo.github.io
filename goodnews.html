          <p>Interpol has successfully identified a woman whose body was found in a Dutch nature reserve in 2004, solving a 21-year-old cold case. The victim, known as "The Woman with the German keys," was identified as Eva Maria Pommer, a 35-year-old German citizen, thanks to a public tip following television broadcasts in the Netherlands and Germany. This marks the fourth success for Interpol's "Identify Me" campaign, which seeks to identify deceased women found under suspicious circumstances across Europe. The breakthrough was confirmed via DNA analysis after a Dutch foundation traced a lead about a missing German woman.</p>

          <p>A recent HSBC survey of high-net-worth entrepreneurs reveals that 57% are considering moving to a new country within the next year. The primary motivations are not tax avoidance but rather business expansion, new investment opportunities, and a better quality of life, including improved safety and education. Singapore emerged as the most popular potential destination, followed by the UK, Japan, and Switzerland. While tax efficiency was a factor for only a third of respondents, the desire to experience a new culture was a particularly strong driver for U.S. entrepreneurs looking to relocate.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is now in effect in Gaza, with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) repositioning troops along newly established lines. This action is the first step in an agreement that will facilitate the release of all hostages held by Hamas within 72 hours of the IDF's redeployment. In exchange, Israel will release over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners and allow more humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. To support and monitor the agreement, U.S. Central Command is establishing a coordination center in Israel with approximately 200 U.S. service members, who will not enter Gaza but will provide logistical and security expertise.</p>

          <p>Early investors in Nvidia, many of whom bought the stock based on recommendations from CNBC's Jim Cramer long before the recent AI boom, have seen transformative financial returns. At a recent event, these everyday investors shared how their conviction in the chipmaker's long-term vision for computing has paid off, with some turning initial investments of a few thousand dollars into hundreds of thousands. Their stories highlight the success of a buy-and-hold strategy, as they held on through stock splits and market volatility. The investors credited their success to understanding the company's fundamental potential beyond its initial focus on gaming graphics.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's visit to India has resulted in agreements to deepen cooperation on trade, defense, and technology, marking a significant moment for UK-India relations. The visit comes as both nations seek to diversify partnerships following the Trump administration's imposition of high tariffs on Indian goods. The leaders focused on ratifying a new trade deal that will slash tariffs on products like textiles, cars, and whisky, aiming to boost two-way trade by $34 billion by 2040. This strategic partnership is seen as a way for India to mitigate economic headwinds from Washington and could serve as a model for a future EU-India trade agreement.</p>

          <p>Costco has quietly become one of the world's largest clothing retailers, with its apparel sales growing nearly 40% from $7 billion to $9.7 billion between 2019 and 2024. This segment now generates more revenue than established retailers like Old Navy and Abercrombie & Fitch. The company's success is driven by offering a mix of popular brands, its private Kirkland Signature label, and opportunistic purchases that create a "treasure hunt" shopping experience. By leveraging its vast membership base and reputation for value, Costco has built a formidable apparel business, attracting attention and even legal challenges from major brands like Lululemon.</p>

          <h2>Financial Advisor Identifies Over-Caution as the Primary Mistake for Young Investors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 09:38:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Josh Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, the biggest investment mistake young people make is being too conservative, focusing more on avoiding losses than on pursuing growth. He argues that with decades of compounding ahead of them, young investors should be fully invested in the stock market rather than holding significant amounts in cash or bonds. Historically, stocks have outperformed other asset classes over the long term, making them essential for building wealth and outpacing inflation. For beginners, Brown recommends using low-cost, broad-market index funds or ETFs to achieve diversified exposure without the risks of individual stock picking. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has reportedly reduced the list of potential candidates for the next Federal Reserve chair to five individuals after an extensive interview process. The finalists include current Fed officials Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, former National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and BlackRock's Rick Rieder. Bessent is said to be seeking a candidate with experience in economics and regulation who is open to new ideas about monetary policy and potentially reducing the Fed's size and scope. The final decision will be made by President Trump, with a nominee likely to be appointed to a governor's seat by January.</p>
