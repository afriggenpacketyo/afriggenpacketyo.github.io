          <p>Nvidia shares experienced a significant jump in premarket trading following strong earnings reports, which sparked a global rally in semiconductor stocks. Despite a $4.5 billion write-off due to U.S. export restrictions to China, Nvidia's financial results exceeded market expectations, alleviating concerns about dwindling demand for its GPUs. The surge in Nvidia's stock also boosted shares of other U.S. companies like Marvell and Qualcomm. The semiconductor industry has been grappling with headwinds from tariff policies and export limitations, but Nvidia's performance suggests continued strong demand for AI-related technologies. </p>

          <p>A House Republican budget bill proposes expanding the qualified business income (QBI) deduction, a tax break for "pass-through" businesses like partnerships, S-corporations, and sole proprietorships. Currently, certain white-collar professionals cannot claim the QBI deduction once income exceeds certain limits. The House bill would change the phaseout calculation, potentially providing a bigger tax break for some of these professionals. Critics argue the QBI deduction disproportionately benefits high-income taxpayers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article discusses how stock market investors have learned to profit from President Trump's tariff policies, coining the term "TACO trade" (Trump Always Chickens Out). The strategy involves buying stocks after Trump announces tariffs and selling them when he inevitably reverses course. The article highlights several instances where Trump's tariff threats caused market downturns, followed by rallies when he backed down. The author argues that Trump's habit of acting through bluster has permeated his policymaking, and investors have learned to anticipate his reversals. (not investment advice)</p>
