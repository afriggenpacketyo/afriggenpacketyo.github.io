          <p>An unnamed US official stated that the latest high-level discussions between Iran and the United States regarding Tehran's nuclear program concluded positively, indicating encouragement from the US negotiators. The talks, which aim to curb Iran's uranium enrichment activities in return for the easing of US sanctions, have reached an agreement to move forward with technical elements. The next round of negotiations, coordinated by Oman, will continue to address the differences between the two countries, with both sides acknowledging the difficulty yet usefulness of the discussions to better understand each other's positions and find realistic solutions. Despite red lines from both sides regarding uranium enrichment, diplomatic efforts are ongoing to avert future military action.</p>

          <p>In an interview, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby discussed recent radar outages at Newark International Airport and assured the public that flying in and out of Newark is safe due to backup procedures and pilot training. United has proactively reduced flights to accommodate airport capacity and ongoing runway construction, prioritizing customer safety and minimizing disruptions. Kirby acknowledged a decrease in demand due to safety concerns but noted that demand has stabilized, and larger airplanes are being used to maintain seat numbers. He emphasized the need to upgrade the air traffic control system and expressed optimism about the FAA's commitment to improving technology and staffing.</p>

          <p>Patricia Clarkson stars in "Lilly," a film chronicling Lilly Ledbetter's fight for equal pay against Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. The article details Ledbetter's discovery that she was paid significantly less than her male colleagues, leading to a Supreme Court case that she ultimately lost due to the statute of limitations. However, her efforts led to the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which President Obama signed in 2009, effectively ending the statute of limitations on fair-pay claims. Clarkson reflects on the importance of Ledbetter's journey and her own experiences with unequal pay in Hollywood, emphasizing the need for continued advocacy for equal treatment in the workplace.</p>

          <p>A group of Quakers are marching over 300 miles from New York City to Washington D.C. to protest the Trump administration's crackdown on immigrants. This march, rooted in a long tradition of Quaker activism for justice and peace, seeks to show solidarity with migrants and other targeted groups. The protestors aim to deliver a copy of the Flushing Remonstrance, a 17th-century document advocating for religious freedom, to the US Capitol. They view it as a reminder to uphold the principle that all are welcome, emphasizing the need to challenge policies that contradict constitutional law and human dignity.</p>

          <p>Pope Leo XIV, the first American-born pope, led Mass on Sunday, calling for peace and wishing Happy Mother's Day, marking a blend of continuity and change for the Catholic Church. As Robert Prevost, he was known as a tennis-loving, Wordle-playing, White Sox fan from Chicago. Papal biographer Austen Ivereigh noted Prevost's unique combination of qualities as an evangelizer, statesman, and governor. The new pope, who previously served as a missionary in Peru, has identified artificial intelligence as a major threat and aims to build a more inclusive church.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced that the UK will end the recruitment of care workers from abroad, requiring firms to prioritize hiring British nationals or extending visas of existing overseas workers. This policy shift aims to reduce net migration by up to 50,000 lower-skilled workers over the next year. In addition to visa changes, the government plans to implement new training commitments to encourage unemployed individuals to re-enter the workforce, and will introduce a fair pay agreement for care workers to attract domestic talent. While the opposition supports ending overseas recruitment, they advocate for an annual migration cap exceeding the government's reduction target.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic explores the trend of parents building intentional communities with friends to create a support system reminiscent of extended families. Driven by the challenges of raising children in a society that often isolates nuclear families, some parents are choosing to live near or even with close friends to share childcare, household responsibilities, and emotional support. The article highlights the benefits of this arrangement, including reduced stress, increased social interaction, and the exposure of children to diverse perspectives, while also acknowledging potential challenges such as differing parenting styles and the need for clear communication.</p>

          <p>A cover story in The New York Times Magazine explores the influence of sibling relationships in shaping personalities and outcomes, noting that siblings often mold each other as much as parents do. Research suggests that this "sibling spillover effect" is more powerful in disadvantaged families, where siblings spend more time together. While birth order psychology is largely discredited, younger siblings may gravitate towards sports to find a domain of their own. The story also touches on how parental assessments of children can influence their academic paths and the role of genetics in shaping personalities and environments.</p>
