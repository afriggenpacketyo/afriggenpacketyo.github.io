          <p>The Los Angeles Rams defeated the Dallas Cowboys 31-21 in their preseason opener, with rookie running back Blake Corum making a strong case for a larger role in the offense. Corum rushed for 32 yards and two touchdowns, demonstrating his potential to help share the workload with star running back Kyren Williams. Quarterback Stetson Bennett also had a solid performance, completing 16 of 24 passes for 188 yards and two touchdowns, though he did throw an interception. The game highlighted the Rams' emerging talent as they prepare for the upcoming NFL season.</p>

          <h2>Fashion Industry Reportedly Shifting from 'Quiet Luxury' to Bolder 'Loud Luxury' Styles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-09 22:14:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The fashion industry is experiencing a shift away from the understated "quiet luxury" trend towards more visible and bold "loud luxury" styles, characterized by large logos and distinctive designs. This change is driven by luxury brands like Gucci, Burberry, and Moncler attempting to reignite consumer interest and rebound from a period of softer sales. Analysts suggest this sartorial shake-up, spurred by new creative directors and management, is a cyclical move to inject novelty into the market. The trend also reflects a divide where ultra-luxe brands maintain high prices while others use more accessible pricing and bold branding to attract a wider audience. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A crew of four astronauts successfully returned to Earth, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California in a SpaceX capsule. The mission was significant as it relieved two NASA astronauts who had been stranded on the International Space Station for nine months due to issues with their Boeing Starliner capsule. This marked NASA's first Pacific splashdown in 50 years, a strategic shift by SpaceX to reduce debris risk over populated areas. The returning crew, comprising American, Japanese, and Russian astronauts, completed a 146-day mission, orbiting the Earth over 2,300 times.</p>

          <p>Ali Akbar, believed to be the last traditional newspaper hawker in Paris, is set to receive the Order of Merit, one of France's highest honors. For over 50 years, the 72-year-old has been a beloved figure on the city's Left Bank, selling copies of Le Monde with a shout. Akbar has witnessed the dramatic decline of his trade, from selling 80 papers an hour in the pre-internet era to around 30 per day now, but continues for the joy and independence the job provides. The honor, to be bestowed by President Emmanuel Macron, recognizes his unique contribution to French culture.</p>

          <p>A new adaptation of "War of the Worlds" starring Ice Cube has received overwhelmingly negative reviews, with some critics labeling it one of the worst films ever made. The movie, which initially scored 0% on Rotten Tomatoes, has ironically attracted public interest due to its poor reception, embodying the "so bad it's good" phenomenon. This article explores why audiences are often drawn to critically savaged films, finding them more entertaining and memorable than bland, forgettable blockbusters. Experts suggest that the charm of watching an earnest but failed attempt can be more compelling than a polished but soulless production.</p>

          <p>Six months after its release, the Chinese AI app DeepSeek continues to impact the tech industry, despite falling from the headlines. Its launch challenged the American-led assumption that bigger and more expensive models were always better, demonstrating that efficient engineering could yield powerful results at a fraction of the cost. While concerns over data privacy and links to the Chinese government persist, some US startups continue to use the model to save money. The event also served as a "Sputnik moment," intensifying the US-China AI rivalry and prompting American firms like OpenAI to release their own smaller, open models.</p>

          <p>Apple's stock experienced its largest weekly gain in over five years, rising 13% and adding more than $400 billion to its market capitalization. The surge followed CEO Tim Cook's appearance at the White House, where he announced plans to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts over the next four years. In response, President Trump indicated that Apple would be exempt from potential future tariffs on imported chips, alleviating investor concerns about a significant financial hit to the company. The successful meeting, combined with strong quarterly earnings, has bolstered investor confidence in the tech giant. (not investment advice)</p>
