          <h2>Eurozone Inflation Remains Steady, ECB Rate Cuts Still Possible Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 05:53:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Euro zone inflation held steady at 2.2% in April, defying expectations of a decrease, while core inflation rose to 2.7%. Despite the lack of decline, economists suggest that temporary Easter-related effects are influencing services inflation, which may reverse in the coming months, potentially paving the way for further interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank (ECB). However, uncertainty surrounding potential tariff escalations introduces a degree of risk, as increased tariffs could lead to higher inflation in Europe. ECB President Christine Lagarde emphasized that the central bank would remain extremely data-dependent when making future interest rate decisions.</p>
