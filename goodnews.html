          <p>Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice refuted claims of disarray within the party following Chairman Zia Yusuf's initial resignation and subsequent return in a different capacity. Tice attributed Yusuf's brief departure to exhaustion from the demanding role and stated that the party is reorganizing to better distribute responsibilities. Yusuf, who initially resigned after criticizing a party MP's remarks on banning the burka, will now focus on the party's "Doge unit," tasked with identifying spending cuts at councils. The party anticipates appointing a new chairman and deputy chairman in the coming week.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering implementing stricter online safety measures, including time limits on social media use for children. Proposals under consideration include a two-hour cap on individual social media apps and a 10 PM curfew.

          <p>Pomona College is experiencing a growing movement among students and faculty to reduce the pervasiveness of technology in campus life. Students are advocating for more tech-free classes and creating spaces for unplugged socializing, while professors are experimenting with limiting or banning electronic devices in their classrooms. The college is uniquely positioned to implement such changes due to its small size, ample resources, and focus on fostering a close-knit community. The hope is that by creating tech refuges, Pomona can differentiate itself and better prepare students to think critically and engage meaningfully in the real world.</p>

She defended the Library of Congress's role in providing free access to information and inspiration, emphasizing the importance of "Freedom to Read." Hayden also addressed the White House's concerns about diversity, equity, and inclusion, finding it puzzling to consider inclusivity as a negative.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's policies have diminished China's long-held fear of "peaceful evolution," a strategy the U.S. allegedly used to undermine communist regimes. The author, born in China in the 1960s, recalls being taught to be vigilant against American conspiracies aimed at overthrowing the Communist Party. However, the author contends that the U.S. has shifted away from nation-building efforts and lecturing other countries on governance, reducing the perceived threat of American subversion.</p>

The industry is trying to attract younger people to the field, and wages have increased, but some workers say that's not enough.</p>
