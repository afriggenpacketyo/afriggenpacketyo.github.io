          <p>An excerpt from actor Tim Curry's upcoming memoir, "Vagabond," reflects on his identity as a lifelong wanderer and performer, shaped by an itinerant upbringing and a career playing varied roles. He recounts a humorous yet telling incident where he was accused of being an imposter at a screening of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show," the film that launched him to fame. Curry explains that the book is not a traditional Hollywood tell-all but a mosaic of his life, exploring his creative journeys and his recovery from a debilitating stroke in 2012. He embraces the term 'vagabond' to describe his restless spirit and constant reinvention.</p>

          <p>Actor-director Ben Stiller discusses his new documentary, "Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost," which examines the lives and marriage of his famous parents, comedy duo Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara. The film delves into the tension between their public act and private life, revealing Anne's unfulfilled dream of being a serious actress and her subsequent struggles with alcohol. Stiller explains that the project became a deeply personal journey of self-reflection, forcing him to confront his own marital issues and patterns of behavior as a parent. The documentary uses newly discovered audio recordings made by his father to provide an honest, raw look at his family's legacy.</p>

          <p>Four years after the Taliban's return to power silenced women's sports in Afghanistan, a newly formed women's refugee football team is set to represent the country in a FIFA-sanctioned tournament in the UAE. Players, who now live in countries like the UK and Australia, view this as a significant responsibility to represent Afghan women whose rights have been stripped away. The team's participation marks a major step toward official recognition by FIFA, following tireless advocacy from exiled players. For many on the squad, it will be an emotional reunion and a powerful statement of resilience against the oppressive regime in their homeland.</p>

          <p>Pakistan and Afghanistan's Taliban government have agreed to an immediate ceasefire following more than a week of intense and deadly fighting along their shared border. The agreement, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, aims to establish mechanisms for lasting peace and stability in the region. The clashes, the most severe since the Taliban regained power in 2021, were fueled by Pakistan's accusations that the Taliban harbors militant groups. Under the new terms, the Taliban has reportedly agreed not to support groups that carry out attacks against Pakistan, with further talks scheduled to take place in Istanbul.</p>

          <p>Jared Kushner, a key negotiator of the Israel-Hamas peace agreement, stated that the success of the 20-point plan hinges on establishing a "viable alternative" to govern Gaza. In a "60 Minutes" interview, Kushner acknowledged that Hamas will likely use violence to try and reassert control, a prediction underscored by recent clashes and a U.S. warning about potential Hamas attacks on Palestinian civilians. The peace plan calls for an interim governing body of Palestinians and international experts to run Gaza. Kushner emphasized that if this new governance structure is successful, Hamas will ultimately fail, ensuring long-term security for the region.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's government has unveiled a plan to create 400,000 additional jobs in the clean energy sector by 2030, aiming to double the workforce in renewables like wind, solar, and nuclear power. The strategy includes establishing five "technical excellence colleges" and launching programs to retrain veterans and oil and gas workers for green energy roles. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated the initiative is essential for reducing energy bills long-term and providing well-paid, secure jobs in industrial communities. The plan comes as the government faces pressure to address the cost-of-living crisis and accelerate the transition to a net-zero economy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article commends two federal district court judges for blocking President Trump's attempts to deploy National Guard troops to Portland and Chicago. The author argues that the judges courageously spoke truth to power by finding the administration's rationale for the deployments, which described the cities as "war-ravaged," to be "untethered to the facts." The piece contrasts these lower court rulings with what it calls the Supreme Court's deference to the president. It calls for the judiciary to remain vigilant against executive overreach and to reject justifications not based in reality, thereby upholding constitutional law over potential martial law.</p>

          <h2>UK Energy Secretary Hints at Potential VAT Cut on Energy Bills to Address Cost of Living</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-19 08:59:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has suggested that the government is considering cutting the 5% VAT on household energy bills as part of its efforts to address the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. While he refrained from confirming any specific plans ahead of the November Budget, Miliband acknowledged the affordability challenges facing the country. The potential move comes as the government faces pressure to lower energy costs, with Labour having previously pledged to reduce average bills by £300 a year by 2030 through a transition to clean energy. A VAT cut could save the average household approximately £86 per year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Chinese robotics company, MyActuator, has experienced a significant increase in orders from American clients rushing to purchase components before potential new U.S. tariffs take effect. The Suzhou-based firm, which makes modules for humanoid robots, received over 1,000 new orders in a single week after President Trump threatened 100% tariffs on all Chinese imports. A company source noted that clients explicitly cited the tariff threat as the reason for their emergency purchases, forcing the manufacturer's factories to work overtime. The surge in demand highlights how businesses are preemptively navigating the volatile trade relationship between the U.S. and China. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Medicare's open enrollment period continues, beneficiaries are advised to carefully evaluate their coverage options for the upcoming year rather than automatically renewing their current plans. Experts stress the importance of comparing traditional Medicare with private Medicare Advantage plans, weighing tradeoffs between provider networks, out-of-pocket costs, and supplemental benefits like dental or vision. It is also crucial to verify that all necessary prescription drugs are covered under new Part D plans, as formularies can change annually. The ongoing federal government shutdown may cause delays in accessing information, so beneficiaries are encouraged to be patient but thorough in their research.</p>
