Most major retailers and grocery chains, including Walmart, Home Depot, and Trader Joe's, will operate with regular or slightly modified hours. However, essential services such as the U.S. Postal Service, major banks, and U.S. stock markets will be closed in observance of the holiday. The guide also notes that while most restaurants and fast-food chains will be open, customers should verify local hours as they may vary by location.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has successfully negotiated a deal to acquire England international center-back Marc Guehi from Crystal Palace. The 25-year-old defender is scheduled to undergo a medical examination and finalize a long-term contract with the Premier League champions. The agreement was reached after Liverpool increased their initial offer of £35 million. Guehi played his final game for Crystal Palace in a 3-0 victory over Aston Villa, where he served as captain and scored a goal, though he refrained from commenting on his future after the match.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) has approved a development strategy extending to 2035, aimed at fostering a multipolar global order. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced that the plan sets a clear direction for the regional security bloc over the next decade. The move comes as the SCO acknowledges escalating geopolitical tensions as a significant threat. During the summit, the group presented a unified stance against unilateral actions and in support of the WTO-centered multilateral trading system, implicitly criticizing U.S. policies under President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has retracted its subpoena for former Special Counsel Robert Mueller to testify regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. A committee aide confirmed the withdrawal was due to new information about Mueller's health, which prevents him from being able to testify. The New York Times recently reported that the 81-year-old former FBI director was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2021. The subpoena was part of a broader committee investigation seeking depositions from former Justice Department officials who served during the time Epstein was under FBI investigation.</p>

          <p>A recent coronal mass ejection from the sun is expected to create an aurora borealis display visible across parts of Canada and up to 18 U.S. states. According to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center, the solar eruption will interact with Earth's magnetic field late Monday into early Tuesday. The resulting geomagnetic storm could make the northern lights visible in states as far south as Illinois and Oregon. While this event is not anticipated to be as intense as the major storm in spring 2024, it offers a significant opportunity for sky-gazers to witness the phenomenon.</p>

          <p>Piotr Szczerek, a Polish CEO, has issued a public apology after a video of him taking a hat intended for a young boy from tennis player Kamil Majchrzak at the US Open went viral. Szczerek claimed he mistakenly believed the player was tossing the hat to him and described his action as a "huge mistake" not done with malicious intent. He stated that he has since returned the hat to the boy and apologized to the family. Majchrzak, the player involved, later met with the young fan to give him a new cap and other merchandise, calling the original incident a moment of confusion.</p>

          <p>ScotRail, the national rail operator of Scotland, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares on its trains, making weekday travel significantly cheaper for commuters. This policy, which follows a trial period, aims to incentivize more people to use trains instead of cars. The change will result in substantial savings, with fares on routes like Edinburgh to Glasgow dropping by nearly 50%. The Scottish government, which owns ScotRail, anticipates the annual cost of the subsidy to be between £40 million and £45 million, viewing it as a sustainable investment in the rail network and a financial relief for passengers.</p>

The only new member is Rasmus Hojgaard, who qualified automatically and replaces his twin brother Nicolai. This high level of continuity is unusual in the event's history and reflects Donald's strategy to counter the challenge of playing an away match in the United States.</p>

          <p>As interest rates show signs of decline, financial experts suggest that short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) currently offer the highest returns for savers. Six-month CDs are identified as a "sweet spot," providing attractive yields without locking up funds for extended periods. While longer-term CDs historically offered better rates, the present inverted yield curve makes shorter terms more lucrative. Experts also discuss the strategy of CD laddering—spreading investments across multiple terms—as a way to balance high returns with liquidity and hedge against future rate drops.

          <p>Amanda Goetz, a two-time startup founder, shares her experience with severe burnout, which led to panic attacks and hospitalization while she was building her company and solo-parenting. She advises ambitious individuals to move away from "toxic grit"—or hustle without intention—and embrace a strategy of "sustainable ambition." This involves intentionally scheduling cycles of hard work followed by periods of proactive rest, rather than working until the point of collapse. Goetz suggests re-evaluating priorities every few weeks and adopting a rhythm, such as two weeks of intense work followed by one week of reduced intensity, to maintain long-term well-being and success.</p>

In contrast, Putin is expected to visit India in December for their annual bilateral summit.

          <p>This article provides a guide to identifying ultra-processed foods (UPFs) that are commonly found in American diets and can make weight loss more difficult. Many breakfast items like sugary cereals and flavored oatmeal, lunch staples such as prepackaged sandwiches and most cold cuts, and dinner components like jarred pasta sauces with added sugars are classified as UPFs. Even seemingly healthy snacks like granola bars, veggie chips, and rice cakes often undergo significant industrial processing. Nutrition experts advise consumers to check ingredient lists for additives not typically used in a home kitchen and to prioritize minimally processed, real foods for a healthier diet.</p>

          <p>The All England Club has indicated it will not change the format of the Wimbledon mixed doubles tournament, despite the recent success of a revamped event at the US Open. The US Open's pre-tournament competition attracted top singles players and large crowds, prompting stars like Emma Raducanu to suggest other Grand Slams adopt a similar model. However, Wimbledon officials consider their traditional mixed doubles event a key part of the tournament's identity and believe doubles competitions are already well-attended. The club's ability to expand its schedule is also limited by space constraints and the need to preserve its grass courts.</p>
