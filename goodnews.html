          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that he engaged in discussions with leaders from both Thailand and Cambodia, who are now reportedly seeking an immediate ceasefire to end deadly border conflicts. Trump indicated on social media that peace seems to be a natural outcome and linked future trade agreements to the cessation of hostilities. This development comes after the United Nations Security Council held an urgent meeting to address the fighting, which has resulted in at least 33 deaths and displaced over 130,000 people. The long-standing dispute primarily revolves around the contested Preah Vihear temple.</p>

          <p>Director Gurinder Chadha has confirmed that a sequel to the 2002 hit film "Bend It Like Beckham" is being developed, over two decades after the original's release. Chadha stated that the success of England's Lionesses and the changing landscape for women in football make it an opportune time to revisit the characters. The new installment, potentially a film or TV series, is tentatively planned for 2027 to coincide with the movie's 25th anniversary and the Women's World Cup. Chadha hopes to reunite the original cast for the project.</p>

          <h2>New Wearable Sensor Aims to Prevent Dehydration and Heatstroke</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 14:17:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Texas have developed a non-invasive wearable sensor designed to continuously monitor a person's hydration levels in real time. The device uses bioimpedance, sending a small electrical current through the body to measure tissue hydration, and transmits the data to a smartphone. This technology could help prevent dehydration-related health issues such as heatstroke, kidney stones, and cardiovascular problems. The creators envision its use not only for the general public and athletes but also for patients with chronic conditions, aiming to make hydration monitoring more accessible and proactive.</p>

          <p>In the fourth Test at Old Trafford, India mounted a strong resistance against England, closing the fourth day at 174-2 and trailing by 137 runs. After an early setback at 0-2, an unbroken partnership between Shubman Gill (78) and KL Rahul (87) frustrated the English attack. Earlier, England captain Ben Stokes scored his first century in over two years, a knock of 141 that helped his team to a formidable total of 669. While England remains the favorite to win the match and the series, India's determined performance has kept their hopes of a draw alive.</p>

          <p>In a significant recall election, Taiwanese voters have rejected an effort to remove 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to flip the legislative majority it lost in the last election. The outcome means President Lai Ching-te's administration will likely continue to face significant legislative resistance from the KMT and its allies. KMT chairman Eric Chu framed the result as a choice for stability over political infighting.</p>
