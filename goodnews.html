          <p>Europe's initial public offering (IPO) market is experiencing a significant uptick, fostering optimism for a broader wave of public debuts despite continued private market interest. Several companies across diverse sectors, including fintech and defense, have recently listed or are planning to, indicating renewed confidence. Bank of America noted a surge in IPO activity, suggesting the product is again a viable exit route in Europe, driven by factors like low volatility and attractive dollar-based returns. This rebound follows a prolonged period of sluggishness compared to Asian and U.S. markets, with investor perspectives on listings showing improvement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing majority of countries worldwide now recognize Palestine as a state, with recent endorsements from the UK, Canada, Australia, and Portugal signaling a notable shift in Western policy. Despite this widespread recognition, full sovereignty and UN membership remain elusive due to strong opposition from key powers like the US, which vetoed a full membership bid in April 2024. The article explains the historical progression of recognition, noting that over 150 countries have officially acknowledged Palestine, with increased diplomatic efforts following Israel's ongoing war in Gaza. This global trend aims to support a two-state solution, despite Israeli condemnation.</p>
