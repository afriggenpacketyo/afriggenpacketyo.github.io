        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The IRS has updated the federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for the 2026 tax year to account for inflation, a move designed to prevent "bracket creep." This annual adjustment means Americans will need to earn more before moving into a higher tax bracket. For 2026, the standard deduction will be $32,200 for married couples filing jointly and $16,100 for single filers, with additional relief available for seniors under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. This article details how the progressive tax system works and the potential impact of recent tax legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Los Angeles author D.J. Waldie reflected on his work and the necessity for Angelenos to connect with their city's complex history. Waldie argues that a lack of historical awareness has contributed to poor policy decisions and that fostering a genuine love for the city is crucial for its future. He advocates for moving beyond Hollywood clichés to appreciate the everyday realities of Los Angeles, suggesting that this deeper understanding allows residents to actively shape the city's identity, especially in a challenging political climate.</p>

          <p>Levi Strauss & Co. announced third-quarter profits that surpassed Wall Street expectations, attributing the success to targeted price increases and a strategic shift towards direct-to-consumer sales. The company's gross margin grew to 61.7%, and it has raised its full-year sales growth forecast to 3%, up from a previous estimate of 1-2%. CEO Michelle Gass stated that the price hikes have not negatively impacted consumer demand, and the company continues to expand its offerings beyond traditional denim, with non-denim clothing now comprising nearly 40% of its business.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stock prices for U.S. rare earth mining companies surged after China announced new licensing requirements for exporting products containing these critical minerals. The move is seen as an effort by Beijing to tighten its control over the global technology supply chain, a sector it currently dominates. This has fueled speculation that the Trump administration will accelerate investments in domestic rare earth production to reduce U.S. dependency on China, as these minerals are vital for defense, electronics, and electric vehicles.

          <p>Hungarian novelist László Krasznahorkai has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize in Literature, a selection that recognizes his experimental and often bleak literary style. His work frequently explores themes of political oppression and existential dread, using long, labyrinthine sentences to reflect his characters' alienation. While his novels are rooted in the atmosphere of Soviet-era Hungary, their themes of social dysfunction and the normalization of chaos are considered timeless and universally relevant. The article suggests his novel "The Melancholy of Resistance" as an ideal starting point for new readers.</p>

          <p>Israel and Hamas have agreed to the initial phase of a U.S.-brokered peace plan, which is expected to begin with a ceasefire once approved by the Israeli Cabinet. According to the agreement, Israel will pull back troops from parts of Gaza, after which Hamas will have 72 hours to release 20 living hostages. In exchange, Israel will free approximately 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, and hundreds of trucks carrying humanitarian aid will be allowed into Gaza. Subsequent phases of the plan, which address the long-term governance of Gaza and disarmament, will require further negotiations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that while President Trump's brokered Israel-Hamas deal is a significant diplomatic success, it also deeply entangles the United States in the region's future. The author suggests that by "patching" the conflict, the Trump administration now "owns" the complex and challenging implementation process. This includes overseeing Hamas's disarmament, managing a multinational stabilization force, and navigating the fraught politics of Gaza's reconstruction. The success of this long-term endeavor will be a major test of the administration's foreign policy commitment and expertise.</p>

          <p>The new film adaptation of "Kiss of the Spider Woman," directed by Bill Condon, is praised as a "sexual and scatological dazzler." The story centers on two prisoners in 1980s Argentina—a stern political revolutionary (Diego Luna) and a gay window dresser (Tonatiuh)—who escape their grim reality by recounting the plot of a fictional musical starring Ingrid Luna (Jennifer Lopez). The review highlights strong performances, particularly from newcomer Tonatiuh and a surprisingly tender Diego Luna, while celebrating Jennifer Lopez's commanding presence in the glamorous film-within-a-film sequences.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay from The Atlantic's archives reflects on the profound personal and cognitive journey of learning and embracing a second language. The author recounts their own experience moving from Spain to the U.S. and how English shifted from a practical tool to an integral part of their identity, used for writing, thinking, and forming relationships. The piece touches on the limits of translation, the supposed cognitive benefits of multilingualism, and how mastering a new language is an odyssey that can create new versions of oneself, a journey that may be lost as technology like real-time AI translation becomes more common.</p>
