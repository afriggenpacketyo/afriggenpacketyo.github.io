          <p>Former Navy SEAL Matt Maasdam has announced his Democratic candidacy to challenge Republican Representative Tom Barrett for Michigan's 7th Congressional District. This sets up a primary contest against former U.S. Ambassador Bridget Brink, as Democrats aim to flip the key seat in the 2026 midterm elections. The district, which includes Lansing, was previously held by Democrat Elissa Slotkin before her successful Senate run. Maasdam is emphasizing his military service and a desire to find bipartisan solutions, positioning himself against Barrett, who is also a military veteran and won the competitive race in November.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new biography examines the career of Claire McCardell, a revolutionary American fashion designer from the mid-20th century whose influence remains widespread yet often uncredited. McCardell championed comfortable, practical clothing for women, introducing innovations like pockets, side fasteners, ballet flats, and denim for womenswear. She rejected the restrictive European styles of the era, focusing instead on an "American Look" that prioritized freedom of movement and ease of wear for active women. Though a household name in her time, her legacy is less prominent than contemporaries like Christian Dior, yet her design philosophy is embedded in modern everyday apparel.</p>

          <p>Marks & Spencer's CEO, Stuart Machin, announced that the retailer's online operations should be fully restored within four weeks following a major cyber attack in April. The attack disrupted online shopping and supply chains, forcing the company to estimate a profit hit of around ¬£300 million for the year. While online orders have resumed in most of the UK, services like click-and-collect and operations in Ireland remain offline. The company is now focused on restoring full service and getting its main distribution center in Castle Donington back to normal operations by August.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is selling a portion of its holdings in the semiconductor and software company Broadcom, booking a substantial profit. The move follows the stock's strong performance, having risen nearly 90% since its April lows and significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the past year. While remaining bullish on Broadcom's long-term potential in artificial intelligence, the sale is a disciplined move to manage the position's size and take profits. The decision also aligns with the club's strategy of raising cash when market momentum indicators suggest conditions are overbought and a pullback is possible. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Hawaiian and Qatar Airways Offer Fastest In-Flight WiFi, Study Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 08:53:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis by Ookla has ranked Hawaiian Airlines and Qatar Airways as the top providers of in-flight WiFi, largely due to their use of Starlink's satellite internet service. Starlink's low-earth orbit constellation enables faster download and upload speeds, providing a superior connectivity experience for passengers. Other airlines performing well include Spirit, Air Canada, and Delta, which offer better-than-average median download speeds. The study highlights a global trend of airlines upgrading their WiFi services, with more carriers like United and SAS partnering with Starlink to improve gate-to-gate connectivity for travelers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Internet infrastructure company Cloudflare will now block AI crawlers from scraping website data by default, a significant move to protect content creators. The new policy requires website owners to explicitly grant permission for AI bots to access their data, disrupting the current model where AI companies freely train their models on vast amounts of online information. Cloudflare, which handles roughly 16% of global internet traffic, argues this change will restore power to publishers who have lost traffic and revenue to AI-generated summaries. The company will also offer a "pay per crawl" model, allowing publishers to charge for access.</p>

The funding, split between secured notes and strategic equity investment, will be used to develop its AI solutions, including the Grok chatbot and one of the world's largest data centers. This massive capital infusion provides xAI with significant resources to compete with industry leaders like OpenAI and Anthropic. The company is already operating a supercomputer with 200,000 GPUs and plans to expand its infrastructure further to advance its AI models.</p>
