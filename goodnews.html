          <p>Lt. Col. George E. Hardy, the last surviving Tuskegee Airman who flew combat missions in World War II, has passed away at the age of 100. Hardy, who was the youngest Red Tail fighter pilot, completed 21 missions in Europe and later served in the Korean and Vietnam Wars. His legacy is celebrated for courage, resilience, and perseverance against racism, both domestically and abroad. Despite his decorated military career, which earned him numerous honors including the Distinguished Flying Cross, Hardy considered his education his greatest achievement.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that the return of Donald Trump to power could signal a 'reverse convergence' in US-China relations, moving away from ideological competition. Historically, the West has pushed a convergence theory, expecting societies to become more alike as they industrialize. However, the author argues that the US now appears to be adopting approaches similar to China's regarding political legitimacy and matters of war and peace. This shift implies a potential end to the ideological framework that has long defined the relationship between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>The UK has successfully grown its first commercial rice crop in east England, an experiment driven by climate change and the country's hottest summer on record. Ecologist Nadine Mitschunas, the UK's pioneering rice-grower, cultivated nine varieties in mini paddy fields, with promising results for several strains. This trial, a collaboration with the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, aims to explore future food sources and address climate change by re-wetting peat soils to lock in greenhouse gases. While commercial viability is still distant, it represents a significant step towards adapting UK agriculture to a warming climate.</p>

          <p>Tech billionaire Larry Ellison and his son, David, are rapidly expanding their influence in US media, with deals involving major companies like Paramount and potential bids for Warner Brothers Discovery. Larry Ellison's close relationship with President Trump, a known Republican megadonor, has reportedly facilitated these ventures, including Oracle's involvement with TikTok. David Ellison's Skydance recently acquired Paramount, gaining control over CBS, and is rumored to be eyeing CNN. Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, express concerns about this concentration of power and potential political influence, especially given recent changes at CBS following the Paramount acquisition.</p>

          <h2>Indian Researchers Win Ig Nobel Prize for Studying Smelly Shoes and Shoe Racks</h2>

          <p>Two Indian researchers, Vikash Kumar and Sarthak Mittal, have won an Ig Nobel Prize for their study on how foul-smelling shoes impact the user experience of shoe racks. Their humorous yet inventive scientific endeavor confirmed that shoe odor, caused by the bacterium Kytococcus sedentarius, is a significant problem, leading many to keep footwear outdoors. The team's experiments demonstrated that a brief exposure to UVC light effectively kills the bacteria and eliminates the smell. This led to a prototype for a UVC light-equipped shoe rack, offering a novel solution to a universal household issue.</p>

          <p>Tesla's new family-friendly electric vehicle, the Model Y L, launched in China in August 2025, has already sold out its September and October allocations, with over 35,000 orders on launch day. This strong demand positions Tesla more competitively in China, the world's largest EV market, amidst global sales struggles and increased competition. By expanding cabin space and lowering the price, the Model Y L broadens its appeal, accelerating EV adoption and reducing heat-trapping transportation pollution. The article highlights the environmental and economic benefits of EVs, encouraging consumers to consider solar charging for further savings.</p>

          <p>Europe secured a commanding 11½–4½ lead over the United States heading into the final day of the Ryder Cup, requiring only two and a half more points for retention. The European team delivered an 'ugly' day for the Americans, both on and off the course, with widespread reports of thuggish and personal insults from US galleries directed at European players. Despite the hostile environment and a minor on-course scuffle involving Justin Rose and Bryson DeChambeau, Europe maintained its focus, with players like Tommy Fleetwood contributing significantly to their historic pre-singles lead.</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's new memoir, 'Life, Law, & Liberty,' offers insights into his 30-year tenure, during which he often served as the swing justice on contentious cases. Kennedy, who viewed his Western origins as central to his perspective, notes that 'the cases swung, not me,' as the court became increasingly conservative. He expresses deep concern over the current state of American discourse and the tone of some Supreme Court opinions, fearing for democracy's survival. The article highlights his pivotal votes on same-sex marriage and abortion, revealing his personal and judicial struggles with these complex issues.</p>

          <h2>Effectiveness of Collagen Supplements for Skin Aging Remains Debated</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The efficacy of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging is a subject of ongoing debate, with some dermatologists expressing skepticism despite anecdotal evidence. While collagen is vital for skin integrity, its journey through the digestive system and targeted delivery to skin cells is complex. Marine collagen, in peptide form, is considered most effective among types due to its higher Type 1 collagen content. However, industry-funded studies often show significant improvements in skin hydration and elasticity, while independent research frequently finds no substantial effect. Experts emphasize sun protection, a healthy diet, and quitting smoking as more impactful for skin health than supplements.</p>

          <p>St Helens snatched a sensational 16-14 Super League play-off eliminator victory against Leeds Rhinos, with Shane Wright scoring a try on the final play of the game. The dramatic win came after an energy-sapping match where Saints played much of the second half without forward Matty Lees, who left due to his wife going into labor. Leeds had held a 12-6 lead at halftime and wasted several opportunities to extend it, ultimately succumbing to a mesmerizing 16-pass move that culminated in Wright's match-winning touchdown. St Helens will now advance to a semi-final against Hull KR.</p>

          <p>Fifty years after China and the European Union established formal diplomatic relations, an article examines how China has dramatically surpassed Europe in the race for a high-tech future. In 1975, Chinese officials observed that their country was at least two decades behind Europe in science, technology, and industry. This initial assessment spurred China's reform and opening-up policies, leading to decades of rapid growth and modernization. The article suggests that China has effectively flipped the technology script, highlighting its significant progress and current leadership in various technological sectors compared to its European counterparts.</p>

A taskforce identified Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as the most promising initial sites. Housing Secretary Steve Reed is set to announce these plans, emphasizing Labour's commitment to housebuilding as central to economic growth. The initiative, echoing post-war housing booms, proposes development corporations with special planning powers to ensure 40% affordable housing and investment in local services.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that China's global initiatives represent the reform needed by the United Nations, which is currently at a 'make-it-or-break-it moment.' The author criticizes the UN General Assembly President for embodying contradictions, particularly Germany's role as a principal arms supplier to Israel. The article posits that while the UN faces a crisis of survival, traditional powers like the US and Germany are enabling conflicts, such as the destruction in Gaza. This perspective suggests that China's approach could offer a more effective pathway for global governance and conflict resolution.</p>
