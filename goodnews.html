          <p>A grassroots campaign called "Adopt a Corner" has emerged in Southern California, with local residents stationing themselves at Home Depot locations to monitor U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The volunteers, who describe themselves as regular people, aim to protect vulnerable day laborers by providing information and documenting potential raids. This suburban activism reflects a growing disapproval of the administration's deportation policies. The movement highlights a shift from large-scale protests to localized, community-based efforts to support immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>A viral social media claim, allegedly from a retired pilot, stating that Donald Trump's plane flew to Jeffrey Epstein's private island 37 times has been found to be without evidence. The island, Little St. James, does not have an airstrip capable of landing a plane like Trump's, as visitors typically arrived by helicopter or boat. The Facebook user who originated the claim used a profile picture with a pin from a commercially available pilot costume. There are no credible flight records or news reports to substantiate the widely circulated allegation.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat rising social isolation, the city of Seoul has opened "warm-hearted convenience stores," which are safe spaces designed to help lonely individuals connect. These centers offer free food, such as instant ramen, and a welcoming, cafe-like atmosphere where visitors can chat with social workers and each other. The initiative was prompted by a growing number of "lonely deaths" and a realization that nearly 40% of households in the capital are single-person. The program aims to provide comfort and low-pressure social interaction for an aging population and isolated youth.</p>

After realizing his mistake, Lowe apologized for the "false alarm" and pledged a £1,000 donation to their cause.

          <p>The Canadian government announced it is lowering the price cap on seaborne Russian crude oil from $60 to $47.60 per barrel. This move brings Canada in line with actions already taken by the European Union and the United Kingdom. The coordinated effort aims to further ratchet up economic pressure on Moscow and limit a key source of revenue funding Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine. The price cap mechanism allows non-G7 countries to purchase Russian oil using Western shipping and insurance services only if the price is below the set limit. (not investment advice)</p>
