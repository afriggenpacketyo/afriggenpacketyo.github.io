          <p>An 18th-century Italian painting titled "Portrait of a Lady," which was looted by the Nazis during World War II, has been recovered in Argentina. The artwork by Giuseppe Ghislandi was rediscovered after it appeared in an online real estate listing posted by the daughter of the fugitive Nazi officer accused of stealing it. Dutch journalists investigating the officer's past spotted the painting, leading to a police investigation and its eventual surrender to authorities. The painting originally belonged to Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker, whose heirs have been seeking to recover hundreds of missing works from his collection.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region saw gains on Thursday, mirroring a rally in technology stocks on Wall Street that boosted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Japan's Nikkei 225, Australia's S&P/ASX 200, and South Korea's Kospi all traded higher in early sessions. The positive movement came despite underlying fears about the global economy, with bond markets remaining a key focus for investors. A recent U.S. court ruling that deemed most of the Trump administration's tariffs illegal has raised questions about future tariff revenues, contributing to pressure on long-term borrowing costs globally.

          <p>Shares for the fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters surged by 25% after the company reported that its marketing campaigns featuring actress Sydney Sweeney and athlete Travis Kelce are driving strong sales. The company's second-quarter performance exceeded expectations, with executives attributing the success to increased customer engagement and awareness from the high-profile endorsements. The ad campaign with Sweeney for its denim line generated significant public debate, which ultimately boosted its visibility. The positive sales trend is expected to continue into the fall season, reflecting the powerful impact of celebrity partnerships on the brand's market performance. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants, ruling that the current situation does not constitute an "invasion or predatory incursion." The administration had invoked the wartime law to expel hundreds of individuals accused of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang. The court determined that encouraging illegal immigration is not equivalent to an armed invasion, rejecting the government's legal justification for the rapid deportations. This ruling marks a significant legal setback for the administration's strategy of using obscure and powerful statutes to enact its immigration policies.</p>

          <p>The city of Shaoxing in China has introduced a novel stimulus measure to boost its local economy by offering subsidies to people who host large banquets. Under the new policy, individuals holding events with five or more tables and spending over 10,000 yuan (US$700) will be eligible for financial incentives of up to 5,000 yuan. This initiative is part of a broader effort to invigorate consumer spending across multiple sectors, including catering, retail, and housing.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration acted illegally when it froze over $2.2 billion in research funding for Harvard University. Judge Allison D. Burroughs stated the administration used allegations of campus antisemitism as a "smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault" and failed to follow the proper legal process before halting the funds. The frozen grants supported over 900 vital research projects, including studies on Alzheimer's, cancer, and heart disease. While criticizing Harvard for not adequately addressing antisemitism, the judge concluded that the funding freeze was punitive and disconnected from the issue, representing a major victory for the university and academic freedom.</p>

          <h2>Montana Ranchers Embrace Regenerative Agriculture and Local Co-op to Ensure Survival</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In Montana's Blackfoot Valley, ranchers are challenging the industrial food system by adopting sustainable practices and a direct-to-consumer model. The Mannix family, who has worked their land for over 140 years, co-founded the Old Salt Co-op with other ranches to process their livestock locally and sell beef directly through their own butcher shop and restaurants. This approach is a response to the existential threats of big agriculture and extreme weather, which squeeze producer margins. The co-op focuses on regenerative ranching, a method that uses livestock to improve soil health and ecosystem resilience, allowing them to increase grass production even in dry years.</p>

          <p>An agreement has been negotiated to prevent approximately 98,000 North Carolina voters from being disenfranchised in an ongoing legal battle. The Department of Justice, under the Trump administration, had sued the state to block voters who registered without providing a driver's license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number. After intervention from the Democratic National Committee and voting rights groups, a settlement was reached that allows these voters to provide the missing information via a provisional ballot at the polling place. This resolution marks a significant victory for voting rights advocates against the DOJ's recent focus on voter fraud over ballot access.</p>

          <p>The public affairs network C-SPAN has secured distribution agreements with YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, ensuring its availability to millions of streaming subscribers. This move comes after C-SPAN made a public plea for wider distribution as its traditional revenue from cable and satellite providers has declined sharply due to cord-cutting. The nonprofit, which provides unfiltered coverage of U.S. government proceedings, has faced significant financial deficits. The new deals will add all three C-SPAN channels to the base packages of these major streaming platforms, helping to secure the network's future and broaden access to its programming for a new generation of viewers.</p>

          <p>As Utah's Great Salt Lake continues to shrink to crisis levels, scientists have made a surprising discovery of mysterious, groundwater-fed oases hidden beneath the exposed lakebed. Researchers from the University of Utah identified reed-covered mounds and other surface disturbances that suggest a vast underground plumbing system is pushing fresh water up from below. This discovery has stunned scientists, who are now mapping these hidden freshwater reserves. The findings could have significant implications for the region's hydrology and may offer new strategies for restoring the fragile lakebed crusts and reducing the hazardous dust pollution caused by the lake's decline.</p>

Anisimova displayed fearless and aggressive baseline play, overcoming an early break to control the match with powerful groundstrokes and maintain her composure in critical moments. The win is a significant milestone for the 24-year-old, who took a mental-health break in 2023 and has now reached the semi-finals on all three Grand Slam surfaces.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) has settled a lawsuit filed by parents over educational failures during the COVID-19 pandemic. The agreement, reached five years after the initial disruption, will provide an estimated 100,000 of the district's most vulnerable students with at least 45 hours of high-intensity tutoring per year. The lawsuit alleged that the district failed to provide adequate live instruction and technology, disproportionately harming Black and Latino students. The settlement also mandates regular student assessments, teacher training, and more transparent public reporting on academic progress, though it comes too late to benefit students who were in high school when the pandemic began.</p>
