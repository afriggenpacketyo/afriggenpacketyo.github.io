          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire to de-escalate tensions that have been escalating since an April attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir, according to announcements from both countries' officials and U.S. President Donald Trump. The agreement was brokered after talks mediated by the United States, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirming the involvement of Vice President JD Vance and himself in the negotiations. This decision follows days of cross-border fire and strikes, with each side accusing the other of provocation, which began after an attack on Hindu tourists that India blamed on Pakistani-backed militants. India has denied causing any damage to Pakistan's military infrastructure and rejects Pakistan's claims of destroying the Indian S-400 system.</p>

          <p>A preliminary magnitude 4.1 earthquake struck near Greenback, Tennessee, and was felt in parts of Georgia and North Carolina, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Residents in Atlanta and western North Carolina reported feeling the tremors, but there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries. The Eastern Tennessee seismic zone is one of the most active in the Southeast, and earthquakes are not uncommon in the region. In December 2018, a 4.4 magnitude earthquake centered in Decatur, Tennessee, shook homes as far away as Atlanta, indicating the area's susceptibility to seismic activity.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, made an uncontrolled reentry into Earth's atmosphere after a failed mission to Venus. The European Union Space Surveillance and Tracking confirmed the reentry after the spacecraft failed to appear on subsequent orbits. Experts had anticipated that some or all of the half-ton spacecraft, built to withstand Venus's harsh conditions, might survive the descent. The U.S. Space Command is still collecting data to confirm the spacecraft's demise, highlighting the challenges of tracking space debris and the potential risks associated with uncontrolled reentries.</p>

The median home in the metro area sold for $225,000 at the end of March, up 12.5% from a year earlier, making it relatively affordable for buyers earning $60,000 to $80,000. The region struggles with a deep inventory shortage, with just 913 homes for sale at the end of March, down 8.1% from a year ago.</p>

          <p>Personal finance guru Ric Edelman is urging Americans to increase their financial literacy and advocating for better financial education in schools. He expressed concern that many young investors are drawn to get-rich-quick schemes and overly complex financial products, and are getting their information from unreliable sources like TikTok. Edelman emphasizes the importance of seeking financial advice from credible sources and being wary of corporate America's tendency to complicate consumer finance. He notes that while 27 states now require high school students to take a semester-long personal finance course for graduation, more needs to be done to prepare young people for financial success.</p>

          <p>The article argues that falling birth rates and declining family formation rates are becoming increasingly partisan issues, which is detrimental to finding solutions. It asserts that ensuring the economy and society support people in deciding whether they want children, and the ability to have as many children as they want, is too important to surrender to the culture wars. The author suggests that progressive wins, such as less expensive housing, universal pre-K, support for new parents, better schools, and more affordable healthcare, could be connected to pronatalism.</p>

The therapy, led by Dr. Donald Kohn, essentially allows a patient to be their own stem cell donor by correcting the gene in their stem cells and reintroducing them into the body. Five years after participating in the study, the Langenhop children are doing well and the therapy is under review with the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
