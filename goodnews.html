          <p>President Trump announced that he is doubling tariffs on steel imports to 50% during a visit to a U.S. Steel mill near Pittsburgh. This decision follows a recent agreement regarding Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel, which Trump characterized as ensuring the American company remains under U.S. control. The move aims to further secure the steel industry in the United States and protect American jobs, with promises of no layoffs or outsourcing. The United Steelworkers union, however, remains cautious, emphasizing the need for written commitments and prioritizing workers' interests over shareholder gains.</p>

          <p>UK Defence Secretary John Healey anticipates defence spending will rise to 3% of GDP by 2034, aligning with Prime Minister Keir Starmer's plans to increase it to 2.5% by April 2027. The strategic defence review, based on this trajectory, will prioritize military and security spending, including deploying new "digital" experts to protect troops from enemy drones. New funding will be partially sourced by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income, a move that has faced criticism.

Higher hotel rates, with the average nightly rate on the Strip reaching $203 in April, and increased costs for everyday items like coffee are impacting tourists. The city is also seeing fewer international visitors, who tend to stay longer and spend more, further affecting revenue.

          <h2>Norway to Reschedule School-Leavers Celebrations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 19:30:50 EDT</div>

          <p>Norway is planning to reschedule school-leavers' celebrations to take place after exams, addressing concerns about the detrimental effects of weeks-long partying on teenagers' wellbeing and grades. The tradition of "russebuss," or party buses, has been criticized for promoting heavy drinking, drug use, and social exclusion. The government aims to create a more inclusive graduation celebration by moving the festivities to the post-exam period. The current system, which sees celebrations coincide with the exam period, has been linked to declining academic results and increased pressure on young people.</p>
