          <p>European stock markets are poised for a positive open as investors await a key U.S. jobs report, which is expected to influence the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rate cuts. Sentiment improved after U.S. payroll data bolstered expectations for a September rate cut without signaling a severe economic downturn, with CME's FedWatch tool indicating a 99% probability. All eyes are on the August jobs report to confirm a 'Goldilocks' scenario of labor market softness. This article also notes British retail sales and house prices saw gains in July and August respectively.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK retail sales volumes increased by 0.6% in July, surpassing analysts' forecasts, attributed partly to sunny weather and the women's Euro football tournament. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) released the figures after a two-week delay due to data quality concerns, an issue for which the ONS's director general apologized, outlining improvement plans. Despite the monthly rise, sales in the three months to July were down 0.6% compared to the previous quarter, with strong online and clothing sales partially offsetting declines in supermarkets and household goods.</p>

          <p>President Javier Milei's administration is prioritizing Argentina's copper potential to boost its volatile economy, driven by surging global demand for electrification and renewable energy. A new Large Investment Incentive Regime (RIGI) offers significant benefits to large-scale investors, with mining projects, particularly copper, attracting substantial interest from major players like BHP and Glencore. Experts consider Argentina an exciting new copper story, comparing its potential to Western Australia's iron ore boom. This article highlights the estimated $47 billion opportunity for the economy through 2040, contingent on policy consistency and social acceptance.</p>
