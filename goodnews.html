          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that his government will expedite ambitious national projects to bolster Canada's economy in response to tariffs imposed by President Trump. The plan involves narrowing down a list of "nation-building" projects, such as pipelines and nuclear reactors, and creating a framework for approving them within two years. The goal is to strengthen Canada's autonomy and resilience amid trade threats from the US. Carney called the latest tariffs "unjustified and unlawful" and announced that trade talks with the US will resume.</p>

          <p>South Koreans are voting for a new president in a snap election triggered by the impeachment of Yoon Suk Yeol, who faced charges over his imposition of martial law. Pre-election surveys suggest Yoon's liberal rival, Lee Jae-myung, is likely to win due to public frustration with conservatives. The new president will face challenges such as a slowing economy, President Trump's trade policies, and North Korea's nuclear threats. Lee has preached patience over Trump's tariff policy, while Kim has said he would meet Trump as soon as possible.</p>
