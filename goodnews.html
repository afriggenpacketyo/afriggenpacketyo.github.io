          <p>Rep. Chip Roy is advocating for new legislation that would grant Congress greater oversight of federal spending, building on the foundation laid by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The proposed bill would provide lawmakers with real-time access to Treasury Department invoices exceeding $25,000, as well as visibility into payments made to individual recipients of federal benefits and federal employees. Roy emphasizes that this legislation would equip Congress with the necessary tools to identify and address wasteful spending, regardless of which party controls the White House. This initiative comes after Musk's departure from his federal government role and his criticism of congressional spending.</p>

          <p>With persistent inflation impacting savings, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer an opportunity to earn returns that can outpace inflation while providing a safe investment option. Current national average CD yields range from 1.70% to 2.00% APY, but top CDs offer significantly higher rates, particularly from online banks. Strategies for securing a good CD rate include considering short-term CDs and laddering CDs to take advantage of the inverted yield curve. Investing in CDs can help individuals lock in high rates and protect their savings with FDIC or NCUA insurance, ensuring a secure and potentially lucrative savings approach (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Maria Foscarinis' book, "And Housing for All: The Fight to End Homelessness in America," argues for housing to be recognized as a human right to address the homelessness crisis effectively. The book examines the origins of the crisis, highlights inadequate responses, and proposes solutions, incorporating personal stories and legal career insights. Foscarinis dismantles the myth that homelessness is a personal failure, asserting it's a policy failure perpetuated by bipartisan decisions. She advocates for the "Housing First" model and emphasizes that acknowledging housing as a fundamental human right is essential for lasting change.</p>

          <p>Current mortgage rates are averaging around 6.97% for a 30-year mortgage and 6.14% for a 15-year mortgage, while refinance rates are similar. Securing a great rate involves strengthening your credit profile, shopping around for different lenders, and considering shorter loan terms. Experts suggest that the Fed's potential pause in rate hikes could provide some relief for borrowers. Borrowers should compare the details of new loans against existing mortgages, factoring in fees and interest rates to ensure affordability (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Dame Vera Baird KC, the new interim chair of the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), has pledged to do "whatever it takes" to reform the embattled legal appeals body.

Baird's appointment follows the wrongful conviction of Andrew Malkinson, and she aims to increase public confidence in the organization's work investigating potential miscarriages of justice.

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has confirmed that more people will be eligible for the next winter fuel payment in the UK, reversing a previous decision to limit the payment to those receiving pension credit or another means-tested benefit. The government's 2024 decision to restrict the payment had drawn criticism, as it excluded millions of older people. Details about the revised eligibility criteria are expected to be outlined in the Spending Review on June 11, with full details to follow in the Budget later in the year. The winter fuel payment provides financial support to help with energy costs during the coldest months.</p>
