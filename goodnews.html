        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the signing of a peace plan between Israel and Hamas, Germany has outlined its potential role in Gaza's future, focusing on humanitarian aid and reconstruction rather than military involvement. Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged an initial €29 million for immediate aid and indicated a much larger sum will be available for rebuilding efforts, co-hosting a donor conference with Egypt. The ceasefire has also renewed debate within Germany about resuming full weapons exports to Israel, which were partially halted during the conflict. The German government is proceeding cautiously, seeking clarity on the proposed international coalition for Gaza's interim control before making further commitments.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Uruguay's senate has passed a law to decriminalize euthanasia, making it the first country in Latin America to do so via legislative action, distinguishing it from Colombia and Ecuador where courts made the decision. The law permits a healthcare professional to perform euthanasia for mentally competent adults suffering from an incurable illness causing "unbearable suffering," without requiring a terminal diagnosis. This reinforces Uruguay's reputation as one of the most socially liberal nations in the region, having previously legalized recreational marijuana, same-sex marriage, and abortion. The move faced opposition from the Catholic Church but was ultimately successful in the highly secularized country.</p>

          <p>The British Library has posthumously reissued a reader's card to celebrated Irish writer Oscar Wilde, 130 years after it was revoked following his 1895 conviction for "gross indecency." At the time, Wilde was imprisoned for his homosexual relationships, which were then a criminal offense. The library stated the gesture is intended to acknowledge the "injustices and immense suffering" he faced. Wilde's grandson, Merlin Holland, will collect the new card on what would have been the author's 171st birthday. The library holds significant works by Wilde, including handwritten drafts of his plays and the poignant letter he wrote from prison, "De Profundis."</p>

          <p>Paxos, the blockchain firm that partners with PayPal, accidentally created $300 trillion worth of the PayPal PYUSD stablecoin due to a technical error during an internal transfer. The company stated that it quickly identified the mistake and "burned," or destroyed, the excess tokens within approximately 20 minutes, confirming that no customer funds were at risk. The incident highlights the operational risks in the digital currency space, as the erroneously minted amount was more than double the world's estimated total GDP. PYUSD is the sixth-largest stablecoin, with a market capitalization of over $2.6 billion, and is backed by U.S. dollar deposits and equivalents.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has withdrawn from her last two scheduled events of the year in Tokyo and Hong Kong, choosing to end her season early to recover from a recent illness. The 22-year-old had been visibly struggling in recent matches, retiring from a first-round match in Wuhan and requiring medical attention during a loss at the Ningbo Open. Despite the disappointing end, the season was largely positive for Raducanu, who climbed back into the world's top 30. It has also been confirmed that she will continue working with her coach, Francisco Roig, into the 2026 season.</p>

          <p>Ali Riley, the 37-year-old captain of the New Zealand national soccer team and Los Angeles' Angel City FC, is retiring at the end of the current season. Her decision follows a challenging year in which she battled a chronic nerve injury, underwent IVF treatment, and lost her childhood home in a fire. Riley's career spans five World Cups, four Olympic Games, and spells at top European clubs like Bayern Munich and Chelsea. She cites being able to end her career on her own terms as a major achievement and plans to remain involved in advocating for women's sports, particularly for better support for athletes pursuing motherhood.</p>

          <p>The annual ShakeOut earthquake drill is being held across California to remind residents of the best safety practices during a seismic event, as experts warn a major quake is inevitable. The core message is to "drop, cover, and hold on" under a sturdy object, as studies from past quakes show this action significantly reduces injury from falling debris. Officials advise against running outside, which can be more dangerous due to falling glass and building facades. In addition to participating in the drill, residents are urged to secure heavy furniture, consider seismic retrofits for older homes, and use early warning apps like MyShake.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a bill designed to fast-track the study of psychedelic drugs for treating conditions like PTSD and depression, a move strongly supported by veterans' advocacy groups. The legislation, AB 1103, streamlines the approval process within the state's Research Advisory Panel, allowing FDA-approved studies of Schedule 1 drugs to proceed more quickly. Proponents, including former Navy SEAL Marcus Capone, argue that psychedelic therapies like ibogaine hold immense potential for veterans struggling with trauma where conventional treatments have failed. The new law aims to remove bureaucratic delays and empower researchers to advance studies with greater urgency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu's government has survived two no-confidence votes in parliament, narrowly avoiding collapse. The key to his survival was a promise to suspend President Emmanuel Macron's highly contentious pension reform until after the 2027 presidential election, a move that secured the support of Socialist lawmakers. The first motion, brought by the hard-left France Unbowed party, failed by just 18 votes. While the government remains in place, the close result underscores the fragility of Macron's centrist alliance in a deeply divided National Assembly, signaling continued political challenges for the remainder of his term.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking third-quarter profit, with net income surging 39.1% from the previous year to NT$452.3 billion. The world's largest contract chipmaker beat analyst estimates, largely due to sustained high demand for advanced artificial intelligence processors from clients like Nvidia and Apple. Citing the strengthening AI megatrend, TSMC raised its full-year revenue growth forecast for 2025 to the mid-30% range. The company's most advanced 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer chips were significant drivers of revenue, underscoring the critical role TSMC plays in the global AI supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>
