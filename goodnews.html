          <p>Eddie Horne, a 75-year-old man, has fulfilled a lifelong goal by receiving his high school diploma decades after his education was cut short by severe abuse at the notorious Dozier School for Boys. Horne attended the brutal Florida reform school in the mid-1960s and later dropped out of high school to support his family, but never gave up on his promise to himself to graduate. He achieved his diploma through a compensation program established by the Florida legislature for victims of abuse at Dozier and a similar institution. Horne expressed immense joy at his accomplishment and hopes his story inspires others to overcome obstacles and never give up.</p>

          <p>Dermatology research indicates that standard sunscreens, while effective against UV radiation, do not protect against visible light, which can worsen hyperpigmentation and melasma, particularly in people of color. Tinted sunscreens, which contain iron oxides, have been shown to effectively block this spectrum of light. Experts like Dr. Jenna Lester and Dr. Adam Friedman advocate for their use to address these cosmetic but psychosocially impactful skin conditions. However, challenges remain, including a limited range of shades available to match diverse skin tones and a need for standardized recommendations for visible light protection in the industry.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed its eruption, sending fountains of lava up to 100 feet into the air within its summit crater on Hawaii's Big Island. This marks the 31st eruptive event since December, with the activity currently contained and posing no threat to homes. The U.S. Geological Survey is closely monitoring the volcano, whose frequent episodes are driven by magma building up in chambers beneath the surface. For Native Hawaiians, the eruption holds deep cultural significance as an embodiment of the volcano goddess Pele, connecting them to ancestral stories and traditions.</p>

Club owner Doug King described the acquisition as a "pivotal moment" that secures the club's long-term stability and future, ending years of uncertainty for supporters. Since leaving their previous ground in 2005, the club has faced numerous challenges with stadium ownership and had to play at different venues. The purchase allows the club to invest in facilities and fan experience, with King stating it is a statement of ambition and a source of immense pride for the team and its community.</p>

          <p>Recent multinational military exercises, including the landing of British and U.S. F-35B fighter jets on a Japanese warship, signal Japan's strategy to broaden its defense collaborations beyond its traditional alliance with the United States. Analysts suggest that perceived mixed signals from the U.S. are prompting Tokyo to build a more diverse network of security partners to counter potential threats, particularly from China. The exercise in the Philippine Sea, involving six nations, demonstrates a growing tactical integration among allied forces in the Indo-Pacific. This move is seen as a way for Japan to enhance its regional security architecture and ensure stability.</p>

          <h2>Berlin Street with Racist Name to be Renamed After 18th-Century Black Philosopher</h2>

          <p>After a protracted legal battle, a central Berlin street named "Mohrenstrasse" will be officially renamed to honor Anton Wilhelm Amo, the first African-born scholar to earn a doctorate in Europe. The original name, using an archaic and derogatory German term for Black people, has been a subject of controversy for decades, with activists arguing it perpetuates a racist legacy tied to colonialism and slavery. The renaming ceremony is set for the International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition. This change represents a significant step in Germany's ongoing efforts to decolonize public spaces and acknowledge its colonial history.</p>

          <h2>South Park Regains Satirical Edge in the Era of Trump's Second Term</h2>

          <p>The 27th season of "South Park" is being lauded for successfully satirizing the second Trump administration, a feat many other comedy shows have struggled with. The show's creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, have avoided clichéd impersonations by using their signature style to depict Trump and his allies, such as portraying the president with the same animation and voice used for Saddam Hussein in their 1999 film. By focusing on mean-spirited but pointed caricatures and self-referential humor, the show has managed to land blows that feel both fresh and cathartic. This approach has allowed "South Park" to remain a relevant and potent comedic voice in a challenging political landscape.</p>

          <p>President Trump has initiated an overhaul of the White House Rose Garden, replacing its iconic lawn with stone paving in a style reminiscent of his Mar-a-Lago resort. The $1.9 million project, funded by private donations, was justified by Trump as a practical measure to prevent soggy ground, particularly for women wearing high heels. The new design features a stone patio, a new drainage system, and patio tables with umbrellas matching those at his Florida property. While the change is significant, the White House Historical Association notes that the executive mansion has always evolved with different administrations, and the surrounding flower beds will remain.</p>

          <p>As the US Open begins, Iga Swiatek is the clear favorite in the women's draw, having built momentum with a significant title win at Wimbledon and a strong hard-court season. Her main competitors include world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, who is seeking to overcome a series of near misses at major tournaments this year. In the men's game, the dominance of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner continues, with the two young stars having contested the last two Grand Slam finals. The key question remains whether any other player, including veterans like Novak Djokovic or rising talents like Ben Shelton, can break their hold on the top of the sport.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Turkish government is exploring new regulations aimed at reducing significant food waste generated by all-you-can-eat buffets, particularly the large traditional breakfasts popular in hotels and restaurants. According to the Waste Prevention Foundation of Turkey, the country discards approximately 8.7 million tons of food annually. Presidential advisors are drafting proposals that could rein in the size of standard breakfast packages, encouraging more à la carte options and allowing guests to customize their meals to prevent waste. While the goal is to address an issue of "national security," the proposals have met with some skepticism from tour operators who question their feasibility.</p>

          <p>Lucy Guo, the 30-year-old co-founder of Scale AI who recently became the youngest self-made woman billionaire, maintains a rigorous daily routine that includes 5:30 a.m. wake-ups, double workout sessions, and no lunch breaks. Guo advocates for a relentless work ethic, suggesting new founders need to work 90-hour weeks to succeed and that a "996" schedule (9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week) still allows for work-life balance. Her perspective embodies a hardcore Silicon Valley work culture, though it contrasts with other entrepreneurs who argue such an approach is outdated and detrimental to employee retention and smart work.</p>

The 32-year-old entrepreneur from Greater Manchester began with a small salon and, through determination and innovative use of online classes and social media, grew her business exponentially. A key turning point was the viral success of her eyeshadow base on YouTube and her record-breaking sales on TikTok Shop.
