She attributes their lasting bond to an easy connection and feeling destined to be together, especially after his life-altering stroke in 2013. Mary famously defied medical advice to "pull the plug" during his recovery, highlighting her unwavering support. The couple also discussed Travis's use of AI to continue his music career and current "More Life Tour."</p>

          <p>Manhattan office leasing surged over 20% in August, reaching 3.7 million square feet, well above the 10-year monthly average. This robust activity suggests the yearly volume could exceed 40 million square feet for the first time since 2019, driven by a return to office, low unemployment, and a re-emergence of key industries like tech and legal. The "flight to quality" has tightened availability in newer buildings, while overall availability fell to its lowest since January 2021. Average asking rents also increased by 1% from July, though they remain 6% lower than March 2020 levels.</p>

Researchers are finding hundreds of new species wherever they look, highlighting that we are in a "Golden Age of species discovery." This effort is considered vital for understanding ecosystems, detecting threats, and completing a comprehensive inventory of life on Earth, potentially by 2040.</p>
