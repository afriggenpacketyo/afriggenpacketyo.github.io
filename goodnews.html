          <p>Tijuana's Kenia Enr√≠quez, an interim WBC boxing champion, has signed an exclusive multi-fight deal with the MMA organization Combate Global. Enr√≠quez expressed frustration with the World Boxing Council for a lack of opportunities to unify her title, accusing the organization of protecting the current champion. Feeling her boxing career had stalled, she made a successful MMA debut in March and will now focus on this new discipline. This move reflects a growing trend of boxers transitioning to MMA when they feel disrespected or sidelined within their original sport, seeking the opportunities and attention they feel they deserve.</p>

          <p>Insiders at Nvidia, including CEO Jensen Huang, have sold more than $1 billion worth of company stock over the past year, with approximately half of those sales occurring in the last month. The significant sell-off coincides with the chipmaker's stock reaching new highs, driven by the boom in artificial intelligence. Filings show Huang recently sold about $15 million in shares as part of a pre-announced plan to sell up to 6 million shares. Despite the insider sales, Nvidia's stock has continued to perform strongly, recently regaining its position as the world's most valuable company. (not investment advice)</p>

Passengers, including the first Nigerian to fly to space, experienced several minutes of weightlessness and viewed Earth through the capsule's large windows. The mission concluded with the reusable booster and the passenger capsule making safe, separate landings, marking another milestone for the sub-orbital space tourism industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising temperatures, animal welfare charities are urging dog owners to take extreme precautions, as exercising dogs in hot weather is a leading cause of heat-related illness. The RSPCA advises against walks in the heat, as dogs can only sweat through their paws and can overheat quickly. Key signs of heatstroke include heavy panting, lethargy, and difficulty breathing. Experts recommend checking pavement temperature with the back of your hand and walking dogs only in the very early morning or late evening. For super-hot days, keeping dogs indoors with air conditioning or a fan is the safest option.</p>

The announcement comes after the U.S. government ordered TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to sell its American arm over national security concerns regarding user data.

Despite the strong start, the movie will need sustained ticket sales to be profitable against its reported $200 million budget.
