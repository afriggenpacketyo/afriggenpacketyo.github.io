          <p>The New York State Legislature has passed a bill that would allow terminally ill individuals to end their lives with medical assistance, now awaiting Governor Kathy Hochul's signature. This legislation, often referred to as medical aid in dying, permits eligible patients to request and receive medication to hasten their death, providing them with greater autonomy over their end-of-life care. The bill includes safeguards to ensure that patients are making informed decisions and are mentally competent. If signed into law, New York would join a growing number of states that have legalized this practice. The passage of the bill marks a significant shift in the state's approach to end-of-life care.</p>

Discussions focused on easing U.S. restrictions on chipmaking software, jet engine parts, and ethane sales, with the U.S. seeking assurances that China would restore critical mineral flows. Both sides expressed optimism, with expectations of a "short meeting with a big, strong handshake" and the potential removal of export controls. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple is expected to unveil a new software design called ‚ÄúLiquid Glass‚Äù at its upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference, set to be incorporated into iOS 26. This innovative interface represents a departure from the current "flat design," featuring a glossy, translucent aesthetic. The "Liquid Glass" interface is anticipated to lay the groundwork for future hardware products, including a 20th-anniversary iPhone, known internally as the ‚ÄúGlasswing,‚Äù slated for launch in 2027. This design overhaul will be consistent across all of Apple's operating systems, enhancing the visual appeal and paving the way for hardware innovations.</p>

          <p>A cross-party group of MPs has criticized the UK's statutory parental leave system, deeming it "one of the worst in the developed world" and reinforcing outdated gender stereotypes. The Women and Equalities Committee report calls for "bold" action, including increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and extending paternity leave to six weeks, implemented in a phased approach. The report highlights the inadequacy of the current system, where eligible parents receive ¬£187.18 a week or 90% of their average earnings, whichever is lower. The government has stated it is reviewing parental leave entitlements.</p>

Investing in these companies as part of a diversified portfolio could potentially yield significant returns over the next decade.

          <p>New government guidance in England allows teachers to use artificial intelligence to save time on marking and administrative tasks, freeing them up for more face-to-face interaction with students. Teachers can use AI to automate routine tasks, such as marking quizzes and writing letters to parents, but must remain transparent about their use of AI and verify its results. The Department for Education emphasizes that AI should only be used for "low-stakes" marking. While the Association of School and College Leaders supports the use of AI to free up time for teaching, they acknowledge there are still "big issues" to be resolved.</p>
