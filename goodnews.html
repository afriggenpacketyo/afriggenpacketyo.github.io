          <h2>Maersk Cuts Container Market Outlook Amid US-China Tariff Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk has revised its global container market volume growth forecast downward due to increasing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty stemming from U.S.-China trade tensions. While the company posted stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profits, it warned that current U.S.-China trade tariffs could restrict global container market volumes. Maersk now expects container volume growth to be between -1% and 4% for 2025, a revision from its previous forecast of 4% growth. The company's CEO noted that the first quarter's strong demand was a continuation of the previous year's robust economy, but the tariff landscape sparked by the Trump administration is creating complexities for the shipping industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nintendo forecasts selling 15 million units of its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026, while also reporting its fiscal fourth-quarter and full-year results. The company's projections are tempered by concerns over U.S. tariff rates, particularly on products manufactured in Vietnam, where Nintendo produces its consoles. Despite these concerns, analysts predict strong sales for the Switch 2, citing a large existing user base for the original Switch. Nintendo's President acknowledged that additional tariffs could impact demand in the U.S., and CEO of Kantan Games noted the tariffs create an unclear future for Nintendo, making it hard to make sales predictions.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a trade agreement with Britain, marking the first such deal since the imposition of tariffs on numerous trading partners. The agreement is anticipated to be a significant win for both countries, aiming for closer economic cooperation. Details of the agreement remain unclear, but discussions have included lowering British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, as well as removing taxes on U.S. technology companies. British officials have been pursuing a trade agreement with the United States since Brexit to offset weaker relations with Europe.</p>

          <p>During Teacher Appreciation Week, union leaders emphasize the financial hardships and pressures faced by K-12 teachers, including low salaries and unreimbursed expenses. They say teachers are feeling demoralized due to scrutiny of their teaching methods and proposed federal funding cuts. The National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers presidents advocate for better pay and resources, highlighting the need for more teachers to reduce class sizes and provide well-rounded education. The Trump administration's proposed cuts to the Education Department are a major concern, as federal money supports the rights of students with disabilities and provides a portion of total funding for public K-12 schools.</p>

          <p>A trade deal with the U.S. is a significant achievement for Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his government, especially after facing pressure to rethink domestic policies following poor local election results. The UK has been eager for a deal of this sort with the US since President Donald Trump unleashed his wave of global tariffs. The finalized deal with India and an agreement with the US provide a clear political boost for Starmer.
