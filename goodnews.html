        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of the highly anticipated boxing match between Canelo Álvarez and Terence Crawford, sports analysts are divided on the likely outcome, presenting compelling arguments for both fighters. Crawford's supporters highlight his technical prowess, adaptability, and potential to expose Canelo's perceived decline, despite moving up two weight classes. Conversely, those favoring Canelo emphasize his significant size and power advantage, extensive experience at super-middleweight, and strategic selection of opponents throughout his career. The article details how Crawford's speed and boxing intelligence could challenge Canelo, while Canelo's strength and ability to control the fight's pace could ultimately overwhelm the smaller Crawford, making the bout a fascinating clash of styles.</p>

          <p>Following days of deadly anti-corruption protests that toppled the previous administration, calm has returned to Nepal's capital as Sushila Karki was sworn in as the nation's first female interim prime minister. The youth-led 'GenZ' demonstrations, which left over 50 people dead, led to the dissolution of parliament, with new elections now scheduled for March 5. Karki, a 73-year-old former Supreme Court Chief Justice with a reputation for fighting graft, was appointed after negotiations involving the army, the president, and protest leaders. The appointment marks a significant political shift after widespread unrest fueled by a social media ban and prolonged economic difficulties, offering a potential path toward stability.</p>

          <p>In an effort to address both its declining birth rate and the need to bolster its scientific workforce, Shanghai has introduced a new subsidy program for female researchers. The initiative, starting with the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, will provide a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (US$7,010) to 20 new mothers. To qualify, applicants must be under 40, have given birth within the last two years, and hold a doctoral degree with a senior professional title. This program is designed to support women in science returning to their careers after childbirth, tackling two of China's major policy challenges simultaneously.</p>

Despite the grueling heat, host nation Japan celebrated its first medal as Hayato Katsuki secured bronze in the men's 35km race walk. The event marks a significant moment for Tokyo, which hosted the 2020 Olympics without spectators due to the pandemic, and now welcomes enthusiastic crowds back to its National Stadium. However, the severe conditions took a toll, with several competitors collapsing or requiring medical assistance after their races, prompting organizers to move up the start times for the upcoming marathons.</p>

          <p>Apple's newly released iPhone 17 series has seen exceptionally strong demand in China, with pre-order sales quickly surpassing previous records. Within the first minute of availability, sales on the e-commerce platform JD.com exceeded the entire first-day volume of last year's iPhone 16 series. The high demand caused technical difficulties on Apple's official website, with customers reporting slow payment processing. In major cities like Shanghai, all in-store pickup slots for the high-end iPhone 17 Pro Max were booked within 20 minutes, and wait times for new orders now extend into mid-October, signaling a robust start for the new product line in the key Chinese market.</p>

The Chinese brands positioned themselves as technology-focused, featuring advanced in-car tech and gadgets to attract consumers. In response, European giants like BMW, Volkswagen, and Mercedes defended their home turf with their own major displays, though concerns remain about their pace of innovation compared to their fast-moving Chinese rivals.</p>

Despite the quake's strength, there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries from the sparsely populated region. The Pacific Tsunami Warning System initially issued a threat advisory but quickly rescinded it, confirming that there was no danger of a tsunami impacting the area. The peninsula is a seismically active region and experienced a series of powerful quakes in July 2025.</p>
