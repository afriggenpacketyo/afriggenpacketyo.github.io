          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The ruling prevents the Department of Homeland Security from revoking the program in September, with the judge stating the administration lacks the authority to vacate a TPS designation before its scheduled expiration in February 2026. The decision provides temporary relief for Haitians who rely on the status for legal residency and work permits. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, asserting its authority to enforce immigration laws.</p>

          <p>The number of migrants apprehended for crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally dropped to a historic monthly low in June, with just over 6,000 recorded apprehensions. This continues a significant decline in illegal immigration that the Trump administration attributes to its aggressive deportation policies and enhanced border security measures. The current figures are a stark contrast to the record-high numbers seen under the previous administration. The administration's strategy includes swift deportations, halting migrant releases, and a messaging campaign encouraging unauthorized immigrants to self-deport.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has implemented the nation's most stringent law regulating PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," which are linked to serious health issues. The legislation, called "Amara's Law," is named after Amara Strande, who advocated for the ban while dying from a rare cancer at age 20. The law will phase out the sale of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032, targeting chemicals that have contaminated local groundwater for decades. The effort was inspired by Strande's powerful testimony, which highlighted the public health crisis faced by her community.</p>
