          <p>This opinion article from Fox News asserts that President Trump is winning a battle against liberal media outlets. The author cites the defunding of NPR and PBS, staff departures at The Washington Post, and legal settlements with news organizations as evidence of Trump's success. The piece contrasts these media challenges with the administration's reported policy achievements, framing it as a victory over long-standing adversaries. It argues that no president since Ronald Reagan has been as willing or effective at fighting back against media criticism.</p>

The selection prioritizes cohesion, with eleven players starting all three tests, as the team aims for a historic clean sweep. The Wallabies will be missing key players due to injury.</p>

          <p>A new report from Microsoft has identified the occupations least likely to be affected by generative artificial intelligence, with many blue-collar and hands-on professions topping the list. Researchers analyzed user interactions with AI and found that roles requiring physical work, such as painters, nursing assistants, and automotive repairers, had the lowest exposure. In contrast, white-collar jobs involving information gathering and communication, like translators and writers, were at the highest risk. The findings suggest a potential shift in job stability, making skilled manual labor more secure in the age of AI.</p>

His persistent attacks on the final stage ultimately helped exhaust Pogačar, enabling his teammate Wout van Aert to secure a prestigious stage win. The piece frames Jorgenson's performance as a triumph of dedication and teamwork.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is launching its first European Stargate-branded AI data center in Norway, a joint venture with British firm Nscale and Norwegian energy company Aker. The facility aims to house 100,000 Nvidia GPUs by the end of 2026 and will be one of Europe's largest, running entirely on renewable power. This move is part of a broader initiative to build out global AI infrastructure and supports Europe's push for "sovereign AI," which requires data to be processed on European soil. OpenAI will be an "off-taker," purchasing capacity from the new center.</p>

          <p>Malaysian airlines, including AirAsia, are showing interest in China's domestically produced C919 passenger jet as an alternative to aircraft from Boeing and Airbus. According to Malaysia's transport minister, the long waiting times for new planes from the two dominant manufacturers are driving regional carriers to seek other options. China's Commercial Aircraft Corporation (Comac) is promoting the C919 as a more readily available and cheaper narrowbody airliner. This growing interest from Southeast Asia could represent a significant opportunity for China to break into the global aviation market.</p>

The move was sharply criticized by Israel's U.N. ambassador but praised by others as a concrete step toward lasting peace.</p>

The artifacts were unearthed in 1898 from a stupa in northern India and had been in a private British collection for over a century. They will now be placed on permanent public display in India.</p>

Despite the U.S. imposing 25% duties, analysts suggest Washington is hesitant to alienate India, viewing it as a strategic partner and a key "China plus one" manufacturing alternative.
