          <p>Germany has intensified border controls since September 2024, deploying approximately 13,000 to 14,000 federal police officers at its land borders. National police chief Dieter Romann expressed satisfaction with the initial outcomes, asserting that the Federal Police, with its substantial workforce, should effectively manage border security. Romann dismissed concerns about overburdened personnel, emphasizing the support received for the implemented measures. The reinforced border checks aim to address security concerns without compromising operational areas such as train stations. Optimism for Germany's border security is reflected in these measures. </p>

          <p>Rev Dr Liz Theoharis and Noam Sandweiss-Back argue that strategies from historical poor people's movements are crucial for resisting Donald Trump's proposed legislative cuts. They highlight the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO) as an example of effective grassroots organizing, emphasizing the importance of unity, independent leadership, and projects of survival. The authors advocate for a new social contract that uplifts those at the bottom of society, drawing inspiration from the Johnnie Tillmon model, which recognizes the power of poor people to drive transformative change.

          <p>A contributor to the Los Angeles Times argues that the Trump administration's actions against universities, such as defunding research and dictating admissions, have united previously divided campus factions. While universities have faced internal strife over issues like free speech and discrimination, the external threat from the government has fostered a sense of common cause. The author suggests that maintaining this unity requires accepting diverse viewpoints and prioritizing the survival of universities as independent institutions.
