          <p>David French reflects on the example set by Justice David Souter, who retired from the Supreme Court in 2009, highlighting the importance of knowing when to step aside from positions of power. The article notes the current trend of politicians and judges remaining in office at advanced ages, potentially hindering progress and transformation. French contrasts this with Souter's decision to prioritize a life beyond the court, emphasizing the value of humility, kindness, and a focus on family over career success. The New York Times article suggests that society should value those who willingly make way for the next generation.</p>

          <p>Juan Soto's initial performance with the New York Mets has been met with scrutiny despite his overall strong play, leading to questions about whether he is struggling or simply adjusting to a new environment. While Soto's numbers are still above average, they haven't reached his usual elite levels, causing some anxiety among fans. The article argues that Soto's track record and underlying statistics suggest he will soon return to his typical form, and that the current concerns are an overreaction to a small sample size.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two new studies have identified the genetic mutation responsible for orange coat color in cats, thanks to the collaboration between scientists and hundreds of cat owners. Researchers collected DNA samples from cat shows and spay-neuter clinics, identifying a missing piece of DNA near the ARHGAP36 gene responsible for the orange mutation. The Stanford team found that the mutation activates the ARHGAP36 gene, which gets specifically turned on in pigment cells where it is not normally active. The Guardian article highlights the usefulness of feline color genetics as a scientific tool for discovery and public engagement.</p>
