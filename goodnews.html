          <p>Amid trade tensions with the US, the UK and India are deepening their partnership through a new Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement. The deal, which slashes tariffs on goods like textiles, cars, and whiskey, is expected to significantly boost bilateral trade and provide India with alternative markets. This strategic move aims to mitigate the economic impact of US tariffs, strengthen supply chains, and reinforce India's position as a global manufacturing hub, potentially serving as a model for a future EU-India trade pact.</p>

          <p>Costco has quietly grown its apparel business into a nearly $10 billion annual enterprise, surpassing sales of established retailers like Old Navy and Abercrombie & Fitch. The company's success stems from offering popular brands alongside its private Kirkland Signature label and employing an "opportunistic" buying strategy that creates a "treasure hunt" shopping experience. This growth has not gone unnoticed, as evidenced by a recent lawsuit from Lululemon, signaling that major apparel brands now view the wholesale giant as a serious competitor in the fashion market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Josh Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, the most significant error young investors make is prioritizing downside protection over potential upside growth. He advises that due to their long time horizon, young people should be fully invested in the stock market rather than holding cash or bonds, which can lose value to inflation. For beginners, Brown recommends using low-cost, broad-market index funds or ETFs to build a diversified portfolio, emphasizing that compounding over decades is a powerful tool for wealth creation.

          <p>Morgan Stanley is significantly broadening its clients' access to cryptocurrency investments, removing previous restrictions based on wealth and risk tolerance. Starting October 15, the firm's financial advisors will be able to offer crypto funds to all clients for any account type, including retirement accounts. This move follows the U.S. government's more favorable stance toward digital assets and represents a major step by the world's largest wealth manager to embrace the growing asset class. The firm will use automated monitoring to ensure client portfolios do not become overly concentrated in volatile crypto assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid a high-interest-rate environment, home equity loans and HELOCs are viable borrowing options for homeowners with significant equity. Current average rates for these products are considerably lower than those for personal loans or credit cards, making them attractive for accessing large sums of money. With the potential for the Federal Reserve to cut rates later in the year, the costs for these borrowing methods could decrease further, though homeowners must remember their property serves as collateral for the loan.

          <p>Gold continues to be a popular investment, often viewed as a safe-haven asset and a hedge against inflation during periods of market uncertainty. As of October 10, 2025, the price of gold is approximately $3,986 per ounce, though this value is subject to constant fluctuation. The price is influenced by a range of factors, including global supply and demand, economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability. Central bank policies and currency movements, particularly the strength of the U.S. dollar, also play a significant role in determining its market value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has reportedly reduced the list of potential candidates for the next Federal Reserve chair from eleven to five following a series of in-depth interviews. The remaining contenders include current Fed officials Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, as well as Kevin Hassett, Kevin Warsh, and BlackRock's Rick Rieder. Bessent is said to be seeking a candidate with broad experience who is open to new ideas about monetary policy and potentially paring back the Fed's scope. The final decision will be made by President Trump, likely after another round of interviews concludes later this year.</p>

          <p>A significant price difference has emerged between the London spot market for silver and U.S. futures, which may cause silver stockpiled in the U.S. to be shipped back to London. Traders had previously moved large quantities of silver to the U.S. to avoid potential tariffs, creating a surplus in COMEX vaults while causing a shortage in London. This scarcity in London has driven up physical prices and lease rates to unusually high levels. Analysts suggest this arbitrage opportunity is now profitable enough to reverse the flow of the metal across the Atlantic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The IRS has adjusted federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for the 2026 tax year to account for inflation, a move designed to prevent "bracket creep." This means taxpayers will be able to earn more income before being pushed into a higher tax bracket. For 2026, the standard deduction will increase to $32,200 for married couples filing jointly and $16,100 for single filers. These adjustments, along with provisions from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, are expected to provide tax relief for many Americans when they file their returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a new survey, over 70% of U.S. adults report that their monthly debt payments are a major obstacle to building savings or wealth. With collective credit card balances reaching near-record highs, many Americans are struggling financially, yet most are not utilizing available debt relief strategies. Experts recommend five key steps for managing debt: creating a detailed budget, negotiating lower interest rates with creditors, exploring debt consolidation through balance transfers or personal loans, understanding the risks of debt settlement companies, and consulting with a nonprofit credit counselor for a structured repayment plan.</p>

At a time when faith in democracy is waning globally, Machado's unwavering belief that engagement can bring about a more just and free society serves as a powerful inspiration.

          <p>This article recounts the memorable and bizarre period when Dutch football legend Edgar Davids served as player-manager for Barnet FC from 2012. Despite his storied career, Davids joined the struggling lower-league club, bringing a top-tier mentality that both inspired and clashed with the squad. His tenure was marked by on-field brilliance, a near-miraculous (but ultimately failed) fight against relegation, and eccentric behavior, including wearing the number 1 shirt and occasionally skipping away games. Though his time ended abruptly, Davids remains a fondly remembered figure who brought an unprecedented level of attention and intensity to the club.</p>
