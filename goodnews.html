          <p>According to this article, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is seeking a limited success with a trade agreement with the United States, focusing on mitigating recent tariff increases rather than achieving a broad free trade deal. The agreement addresses concerns about tariffs on the car industry, offering some relief to companies like Jaguar Land Rover. While opponents criticize Starmer for overstating the deal's significance, it avoids contentious issues like the NHS and food standards. The article emphasizes that the agreement's details are still emerging and industries will scrutinize them for specific implications.</p>
