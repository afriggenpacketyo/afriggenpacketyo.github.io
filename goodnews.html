          <p>JB Straubel, a co-founder of Tesla, is pioneering a new energy solution through his company, Redwood Materials, by repurposing old electric vehicle batteries to power AI data centers. This initiative addresses the massive energy demand created by the AI boom by giving a second life to batteries that still retain usable capacity. The company is creating microgrids, with its first major project in partnership with Crusoe helping to power a large-scale AI data center in Texas. This innovative approach offers a scalable and cost-effective method for providing 24/7 renewable power, positioning Redwood Materials in the competitive energy storage market.</p>

In light of the strong performance and robust demand, Axon also raised its full-year revenue guidance. The growth was broad-based, with its TASER unit revenue increasing by 19% and its software and services division growing by about 39%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides an in-depth timeline of the Karen Read murder case, which captured national attention. It traces the events from the January 2022 death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, through the complex investigation and two separate trials. The timeline details the prosecution's allegations that Read struck O'Keefe with her vehicle and left him to die, as well as the defense's counter-narrative of an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement. The case concluded with Read's acquittal on murder and manslaughter charges, though she was convicted of driving under the influence, bringing a dramatic end to the legal saga.</p>

          <h2>New Class Action Lawsuit Against FIFA Over Transfer Rules Could Reshape Global Soccer</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 11:59:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major class action lawsuit has been launched against FIFA, arguing that its transfer regulations have unlawfully suppressed player incomes for two decades. The Dutch foundation Justice for Players (JFP) is representing potentially 100,000 footballers in Europe, with damages estimated to be in the billions. The case stems from a European Court of Justice ruling in favor of player Lassana Diarra, which found that certain FIFA rules illegally restricted player movement. Legal experts suggest this lawsuit could be as transformative as the 1995 Bosman ruling, potentially rewriting the rules of player mobility and contractual autonomy in the sport.</p>

The plan includes a new government-backed investment vehicle to raise up to $13 billion this year to boost production. Pemex, the world's most indebted energy company with nearly $99 billion in financial debt, will also lead development in key oil fields and build new pipelines. Officials stated that by 2027, Pemex should be able to cover its own debt payments and investment needs without support from the finance ministry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The interim head of NASA has directed the agency to accelerate its plans to place a small nuclear power plant on the moon, setting a target for late 2029. The directive emphasizes the need for the U.S. to establish a lunar reactor before China and Russia, who are planning a joint nuclear-powered base by the mid-2030s. Officials warn that the first nation to deploy a reactor could establish a "keep-out zone," hindering the U.S. Artemis program. The proposed 100-kilowatt reactor, part of the Fission Surface Power program, will rely on microreactor technology that has not yet been commercially built in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles FC is set to complete the signing of South Korean national team captain Son Heung-min from the English Premier League's Tottenham. The deal involves a transfer fee reported to be a new MLS record, potentially as high as $26 million, surpassing the league's previous high of $22 million. The acquisition of the 33-year-old superstar is seen as a major coup for both LAFC and the league, expected to significantly boost the team's performance and generate substantial marketing and sponsorship opportunities. The move is also seen as beneficial for Son's preparation for the 2026 World Cup in North America.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the think tank Third Way reveals a growing divide in workplace advancement between women with and without a college degree. Over the past two decades, the share of college-educated women in the workforce has increased by nine percentage points, while participation for women without a degree has risen by less than one point. The report attributes this divergence to changes like the rise of flexible and remote work, which primarily benefit white-collar professionals. These roles are also more likely to offer benefits like paid leave and childcare subsidies, which are less common in the service-sector jobs often held by noncollege-educated women.</p>

          <h2>New History of Iranian Revolution Argues It Was a Contingent, Accidental Event</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book by Scott Anderson, "King of Kings," challenges grand theories about the 1979 Iranian Revolution, arguing it was not a historical inevitability but a contingent event shaped by miscalculations and accidents. The book focuses on the hubris of the shah, who missed growing dissent, and the profound ignorance of the U.S. government, which was oblivious to the threats facing its key ally. Anderson's account suggests the revolutionary camp, led by Ayatollah Khomeini, won by outsmarting both the shah and his American backers. This perspective shifts the focus from deep cultural or religious causes to the specific actions and inactions of key players in the critical months leading to the revolution.</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club discussed the recent decline in Amazon's stock, which fell roughly 10% after its latest earnings report due to concerns about its cloud computing dominance. The club believes Amazon can recover by increasing its investment in Nvidia chips to enhance its cloud services. Looking ahead, the club expressed hope for Walt Disney's upcoming earnings report, anticipating continued strength in its theme parks and improved profitability in its streaming division. The slight dip in Disney's stock ahead of the report was viewed as a positive development, potentially preventing a "sell the news" event. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For individuals turning 70, purchasing an annuity can be a strategic move to secure a guaranteed retirement income stream, but it requires careful consideration. The decision depends on factors like personal health, family longevity, and overall financial situation. While buying an annuity later in life typically results in higher monthly payments, it also means the principal becomes illiquid. This article explores the trade-offs, noting that the ideal time to buy is often between 70 and 75, when retirees can command high payouts while still having a reasonable life expectancy to benefit from the investment.

          <p>Bangladesh's interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, has announced that the country will hold general elections in February 2026. This will be the first election since a mass student-led uprising in August 2024 overthrew the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who had been in power for 15 years. Yunus, who leads a caretaker government, made the announcement on the first anniversary of Hasina's ouster, which was celebrated by thousands in the capital, Dhaka. He stated that his administration's goal is to ensure the election is conducted in a fair and peaceful manner before transferring power to an elected government.</p>

          <p>Students in Scotland have seen a slight increase in exam pass rates for National 5, Higher, and Advanced Higher qualifications compared to last year. The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) also reported a narrowing of the attainment gap between students from the most and least deprived areas. Over 147,000 candidates received their results, with the admissions service Ucas noting a record number of young Scots have been offered university or college placements. While some mail deliveries of certificates were delayed by weather, digital results were largely unaffected, marking a positive day for the country's education system.</p>
