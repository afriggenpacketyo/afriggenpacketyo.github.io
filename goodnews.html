          <p>This article discusses how sports coaches can play a critical role in helping young men navigate toxic masculinity, especially with the rise of online influencers shaping their minds. Jordan Puente, who was once expelled from school and on a troubled path, found guidance through a sports coach and mentor, Roddy Slater, who used weightlifting and mentorship to transform his life. UK Coaching found that sports coaches were the most trusted profession among 18 to 24-year-olds, even more than teachers, nurses, and social workers, highlighting their potential to positively influence young men.</p>

          <p>During President Donald Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, the Gulf states engaged in elaborate displays of opulence to deepen ties with the U.S. and advance their economic agendas. Qatar and the U.S. agreed on a $1.2 trillion "economic exchange," Saudi Arabia promised to invest $600 billion in the U.S., and the UAE committed to a 10-year, $1.4 trillion investment framework. The Gulf states are competing with other regions, like Europe, for closer relations with the U.S. administration, aiming to secure access to advanced technologies and strengthen their positions in the evolving world order.</p>

          <p>Beijing is intensifying efforts to bolster its domestic market to reduce vulnerability to external tariff shocks, even with a tentative ceasefire in the trade war with the United States. Premier Li Qiang emphasized the importance of strengthening "domestic circulation" to enhance economic self-reliance by creating a robust, unified domestic market. Analysts suggest that the confrontation with Washington has added urgency to China's efforts to boost domestic demand and reduce the economy's dependence on overseas trade, realizing that exports can no longer be the dominant growth driver.</p>

          <p>Richemont, the owner of Cartier, reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales, indicating that wealthy consumers continue to spend despite global economic uncertainty. The group's revenues increased by 7% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in its Jewellery Maisons division, which includes Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels. While sales declined in the specialist watchmakers segment, overall performance remained robust, with annual sales rising across most regions except Asia Pacific. Despite ongoing global uncertainties, Richemont's Chairman Johann Rupert emphasized the company's agility and discipline, noting that pricing power could offset some global headwinds.</p>

The treatment, which involves pinpoint targeting using CRISPR technology, has shown promising results, allowing KJ to eat more protein and reducing his need for medication.

          <p>An extensive genetic analysis has traced the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas, revealing that Native Americans are descendants of Asian populations, particularly from the West Beringian region. The study also found that early migrants to South America formed distinct, isolated groups due to environmental conditions. Led by researchers at the GenomeAsia 100K consortium, the work could provide new insights into disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations, who have faced significant population declines, and confirms human presence in South America dating back at least 23,000 years.</p>

          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April as investors sought refuge from U.S. markets following President Donald Trump's trade actions. Overseas investors bought 8.21 trillion yen worth of equities and long-term bonds, the largest net inflows since 1996, driven by institutional investors seeking diversification. However, with the U.S. softening its trade stance, confidence in U.S. assets is being restored, potentially impacting the appeal of Japanese assets, though some analysts expect Japan to maintain a reasonable trade deal with the U.S.</p>
