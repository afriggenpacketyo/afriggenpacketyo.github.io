        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government has begun releasing cheaper stockpiled rice directly to retailers in an effort to alleviate the burden of soaring rice prices on households. Major supermarket chains and home appliance companies have started selling the rice at reduced prices, leading to high demand and quick sell-outs. Consumers expressed relief at the lower prices, noting little difference in taste from newly harvested rice. This initiative aims to effectively curb rice prices by bypassing auctions and directly supplying retailers with government-held reserves.</p>
