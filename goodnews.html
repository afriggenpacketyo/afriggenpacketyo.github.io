          <h2>School Restricts Outdoor Play Due to Buzzard Nesting in Playground</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-03 04:24:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A primary school in east London has restricted pupils from playing outside after a buzzard nested in the playground, leading to concerns about potential attacks as the bird guards its nest. Havering Council has offered advice and deterrents, including hiring a falconry expert, but options are limited since buzzards are a protected species. The school is using the situation as a learning opportunity, with children creating art and stories about the buzzard, nicknamed "Brenda," and regularly visiting a nearby outdoor learning facility. The school has had to think about how to risk assess the situation, as this is an unusual situation.</p>

          <p>Train services between Glasgow and London have been disrupted due to a fallen tree damaging overhead electric lines in southern Scotland. Avanti West Coast reported that all lines were blocked between Lockerbie and Carstairs, affecting services until 14:00. Passengers have been advised to use alternative services or seek a refund, while Network Rail Scotland is working to repair the lines and expects to reopen them by 11:30.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Red Bull made two key errors during the Spanish Grand Prix, first by instructing Max Verstappen to return a position to George Russell after an incident in Turn One, despite stewards later determining no penalty was warranted. The team's decision was based on perceived historical precedents and a belief that a penalty was imminent, but the stewards ultimately ruled that Russell had lost control, justifying Verstappen's actions. Secondly, Red Bull's decision to pit Verstappen for fresh hard tires under the safety car was questioned, as Verstappen vocally disagreed with the call, with Horner admitting they should have left him on his soft tires.</p>

Lee currently holds a sizable lead in opinion polling, with 49% of respondents favoring him to become president, compared to 35% for his closest rival, Kim Moon Soo of the conservative People's Power Party.</p>
