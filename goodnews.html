          <p>A fact-check article debunks widespread social media claims that Generation Z is spearheading a US church revival, frequently citing a Barna Group study. While the study indicates a slight increase in attendance frequency among existing Gen Z churchgoers compared to older generations, it does not suggest a surge in overall Gen Z church attendance. The crucial distinction is that the data measures how often existing churchgoers attend, not the proportion of the entire generation attending. Other research, like Pew Research Center surveys, consistently shows that Gen Z remains significantly less religious than older Americans, with an overall nationwide decline in church attendance.</p>

          <p>Dutch authorities made an unusual discovery when two century-old hand grenades, dating from 1925, were found hidden within a consignment of French onions heading to a factory in the Netherlands. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) confirmed the projectiles were consistent with pre-1925 French and German manufactured chemical weapons, though the exact chemical fill remains unidentified. The mysterious presence of these historical weapons in a food delivery has prompted an investigation into their origins. The grenades are slated for destruction at a specialized facility in Belgium, as the Netherlands lacks the necessary infrastructure for such disposal.</p>

          <p>An arrest has been made in connection with the Palisades Fire, a devastating incident that caused widespread destruction in Los Angeles County and resulted in a dozen fatalities earlier this year. Federal and local law enforcement officials are scheduled to announce a "significant development" in the criminal investigation into the fire, which also burned over 23,000 acres and destroyed nearly 7,000 structures. This breakthrough offers a potential step towards accountability and justice for the victims and communities profoundly affected by the catastrophic event. The fire ignited on January 7th, burning for more than three weeks and causing immense damage.</p>

          <p>The German government has increased its economic growth projections, now expecting a modest 0.2% growth in 2025, up from a previous zero forecast, and raising its 2026 estimate to 1.3%. This revised outlook anticipates a low-level recovery by autumn 2025, with internal economic dynamics gaining speed by the year's end, supported by federal financial and economic measures. Economy Minister Katherina Reiche noted that a substantial part of this growth would stem from higher state financing, particularly for infrastructure and defense investments. However, the projections face criticism for relying on increased public debt, alongside calls for lower energy prices and taxes.</p>

          <p>Joan B. Kennedy, the first wife of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, has died at the age of 89. A classically-trained pianist and model, she endured a tumultuous marriage marked by family tragedies, her husband's infidelities, and her personal struggles with alcoholism and mental health. She stood by Ted Kennedy through significant scandals, including the Chappaquiddick incident.

          <h2>Trump's New Tax Law Boosts Capital Gains Exclusion for Startup Founders and Investors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 10:17:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" introduces significant changes to capital gains tax, expanding the Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) exemption from $10 million to $15 million for stock acquired after July 4, 2025. This revision, along with a tiered exclusion system and an increased gross asset limit for C corporations, makes C corp status more attractive for rapidly scaling startups and their investors. Experts believe these changes could be a "game-changer" for startup capital formation, encouraging investment and offering greater flexibility for realizing gains. However, most small businesses not planning rapid exits may still prefer pass-through entities due to double taxation concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A reporter aboard the Doctors Without Borders ship, Geo Barents, in the Mediterranean, captured a poignant moment of dolphins swimming alongside the migrant rescue vessel, bringing a "soaring" feeling to the crew. This experience offered a rare respite from the exhausting and often traumatizing humanitarian work, where the crew had saved 258 lives in just ten days. The migrants, many fleeing Libya, embark on perilous journeys seeking a chance at Europe. The article highlights how, even in this sometimes cruel world, such instances of natural beauty remind those on the front lines that life and hope persist amidst immense human struggle.</p>

          <h2>UK Conservatives Propose Abolishing Stamp Duty on Primary Homes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 09:11:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kemi Badenoch, leader of the UK Conservative Party, announced a surprise proposal to abolish stamp duty on the purchase of main homes if her party forms the next government. This policy aims to "unlock a fairer and more aspirational society" and help millions achieve home ownership, according to Badenoch. While the move is intended to boost the housing market and appeal to voters, particularly younger ones, it comes with a significant estimated cost of £9 billion. The Conservatives claim this will be funded by welfare budget and foreign aid savings, but the proposal is likely to face scrutiny regarding its fiscal implications and impact on other public services.</p>

          <p>The two most prominent women's players' unions in the US, the WNBPA and NWSLPA, have found strength through collaboration, launching joint campaigns like "Pay Us What You Owe Us" to advocate for fair pay and better conditions. This solidarity extends beyond public messaging to behind-the-scenes educational programs and joint statements on issues like federal immigration raids. The WNBPA, founded in 1998, has served as an example for the younger NWSLPA, with their relationship evolving into one of reciprocity. As investment in women's sports rises, the unions emphasize that collective action is crucial to ensure players remain at the forefront of this momentum.</p>

          <p>Cocoa prices have plummeted to a 20-month low, with U.S. futures for December delivery falling 1.4% to around $6,090 a ton, extending significant weekly losses. This downturn follows a period of elevated prices and a high of $12,931 in mid-December. Investment banks like Citi and Societe Generale are now warning that the commodity is "extremely oversold," with money managers taking historically weak speculative positions. This "oversold signal" suggests a vulnerability to short covering, where a rush to buy back borrowed assets could trigger a short squeeze and push prices higher. J.P.

          <p>US public and political sentiment towards Israel has undergone a remarkable transformation, with polls indicating a significant decline in support and a rise in sympathy for the Palestinian cause, two years after the Oct. 7 attack. This shift, fueled by the Gaza war's devastating impact and high Palestinian death toll, is particularly pronounced among Democrats and younger Republicans. Analysts suggest this represents a fundamental, permanent change, potentially diminishing the influence of pro-Israel lobby groups like Aipac and impacting future US foreign policy. The article notes that while policy changes may take time, the evolving public perception is undeniable.</p>

The review notes that recent rule changes, like the pitch clock, have successfully revitalized interest for some fans, including the reviewer.

          <p>The Taliban foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, is set to visit New Delhi, signaling India's strategic pivot towards engagement with the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, despite not formally recognizing it. This week-long visit, enabled by a UN travel ban exemption, aims to discuss counterterrorism, trade, and humanitarian aid. Muttaqi is expected to seek approval for an official envoy and expanded consulates, as India carefully balances humanitarian contacts with limited diplomatic ties. The move also coincides with souring relations between Pakistan and the Taliban, allowing India to potentially regain strategic influence in Afghanistan and neutralize China's efforts to mend Kabul-Islamabad ties.</p>

          <p>Amazon is launching prescription drug kiosks at several One Medical clinics in Los Angeles, allowing patients to receive medications "within minutes" of their doctor visits. These vending machine-like kiosks, operated by Amazon Pharmacy, aim to remove barriers to prescription fulfillment by bringing the pharmacy directly to the point of care. This initiative comes as traditional pharmacy chains struggle with falling margins and increased competition. Amazon's expansion further into the healthcare industry, following its acquisitions of PillPack and One Medical, signals a continued effort to disrupt the complex US healthcare landscape. The company plans to expand these kiosks to more locations soon.</p>
