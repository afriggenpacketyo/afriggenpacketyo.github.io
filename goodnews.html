          <p>Japan's core inflation rate reached 3.7% in May, the highest since January 2023, exceeding economists' expectations and surpassing April's 3.5%. Headline inflation was 3.5%, marking the 38th consecutive month above the Bank of Japan's 2% target. The "core-core" inflation rate, excluding fresh food and energy prices, increased to 3.3% from 3% the previous month, closely monitored by the BOJ. Despite holding rates steady at 0.5% earlier in the week, the central bank acknowledged the continued pass-through of wage increases to selling prices, supporting core inflation; however, the bank anticipates a slowdown in inflation due to an economic deceleration and Japan's GDP shrank 0.2% in the quarter ended March, reflecting declining exports.

          <p>Meta is aggressively pursuing AI talent, recently hiring Daniel Gross, CEO of Ilya Sutskever's Safe Superintelligence, and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. Meta previously attempted to acquire Safe Superintelligence, valued at $32 billion, but Sutskever declined the offer. Gross and Friedman will join Meta, working on products under Alexandr Wang, while Meta gains a stake in NFDG, their venture capital firm. This move escalates the AI talent war, with Meta, Google, and OpenAI competing to develop powerful large language models and artificial general intelligence, and Meta has reportedly offered substantial signing bonuses to lure OpenAI employees.</p>
