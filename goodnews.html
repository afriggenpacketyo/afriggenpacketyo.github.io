          <p>A mother and her nine-year-old son, lost in a remote California forest en route to a Boy Scouts camp, were successfully rescued after a search crew located their "HELP" notes. The pair became stranded when their GPS directed them onto old logging roads, leading to a loss of signal and their car getting stuck approximately 10 miles from the nearest paved road. Reported missing after not arriving at camp, a volunteer search-and-rescue team utilized a location-sharing app and camper sightings to find their notes. Authorities highly commended their preparedness, including packing food and water, staying with their vehicle, and the boy using his Scout whistle, which ultimately facilitated their safe discovery.</p>

          <p>Hadrian, a defense manufacturing startup, has successfully closed a $260 million Series C funding round, co-led by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Lux Capital. The company plans to utilize this significant investment to construct a new 270,000-square-foot factory in Mesa, Arizona, and expand its existing Torrance, California, facility. This expansion aims to bolster its shipbuilding and naval defense capabilities, leveraging robotics and artificial intelligence to "supercharge American workers" and address U.S. defense production needs. Hadrian's CEO emphasized the goal of a "quantum leap above China's manufacturing model" and the creation of 350 local jobs.</p>

The government plans to expand this resource 20-fold over the next five years and invest billions in "AI Growth Zones" across Scotland and Wales. Officials emphasize AI's potential for "huge, unimaginable advances" in disease cures and productivity, while also preparing the workforce and aiming to position the UK as an "AI maker" globally.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement that Coca-Cola agreed to use cane sugar in its U.S. cola, experts weighed in on the health differences between cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup. While minor chemical differences exist, dietitians emphasize that excessive consumption of either, especially in sugary drinks, has similar negative health impacts, including links to Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and liver disease. Though corn syrup involves more processing and some studies suggest a link to higher inflammation, both sweeteners have a similarly high glycemic index and provide "empty calories." Health organizations, including the American Heart Association, strongly recommend limiting overall added sugar intake, regardless of its specific source.</p>

          <p>An Idaho judge has lifted a sweeping gag order in the Bryan Kohberger quadruple murder case, following his guilty plea earlier this month. Kohberger admitted to the brutal stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students at a rental home near campus in 2022, thereby avoiding a potential death sentence. A coalition of news organizations had requested the gag order be lifted, arguing its primary purpose of ensuring an impartial jury was no longer relevant after the plea. The judge agreed, citing the public's and press's First Amendment rights to receive information about the high-profile case as "paramount," enabling greater transparency surrounding the investigation and its resolution.</p>

          <p>Stargazers in the UK can anticipate the Perseid meteor shower, one of the brightest and fastest annual displays, active from July 17 to August 24. This spectacular celestial event occurs as Earth passes through debris from Comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle, causing tiny particles to vaporize and create visible streaks of light in the atmosphere. Optimal viewing conditions require a dark, clear sky away from light pollution, with the best time typically between midnight and an hour before sunrise in the northern hemisphere. Viewers are advised to check local weather forecasts for clear skies and allow their eyes time to adjust to the low light for the best chance to spot the meteors.</p>
