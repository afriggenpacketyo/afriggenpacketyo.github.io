        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Climate Change Committee reports increasing adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps, but stresses the need for further progress to meet net-zero targets. While electric car sales are rising and expected to reach price parity with petrol cars soon, heat pump adoption lags behind targets despite recent growth. The committee highlights the importance of making electricity more affordable for households to incentivize the switch to cleaner technologies. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband acknowledges the advice and reiterates the government's commitment to lowering energy bills by becoming a clean energy superpower. Optimism surrounds the achievability of net-zero by 2050, with greenhouse gas emissions already significantly reduced since 1990.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York City Democratic mayoral primary showcases the ideological divide within the party, pitting left-wing candidate Zohran Mamdani against moderate Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, advocates for affordability measures like free public transportation and universal childcare, attracting support from young and progressive voters. Cuomo, seeking a political comeback, emphasizes experience and competence, appealing to older voters and black voters. The race is seen as a proxy war between the left and moderate factions within the Democratic Party. The outcome of the primary could signal the direction of the party as it seeks to challenge Trump.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has issued a partial injunction against the Trump administration, preventing it from withholding funds previously allocated to 14 states for electric vehicle charger infrastructure. The lawsuit, led by attorneys general in California, Colorado, and Washington, argued that the administration's actions violated congressional intent. Judge Tana Lin ruled that the states were likely to succeed in their lawsuit, asserting that the administration's reasoning was insufficient to override congressional intent. The Trump administration had previously suspended approval of state electric vehicle infrastructure deployment plans, citing a need to review underlying policies.</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have discovered that stars nearing the end of their lives slow their spin, providing insights into how new stars are born. Analyzing data from the Gaia space telescope, researchers found that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago. This faster spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form. The study provides direct evidence that the galaxy's star-forming clouds have become more turbulent over time, offering a new perspective on the Milky Way's history.</p>

Recent moves include expanding tradable futures contracts for foreign institutional investors and considering allowing foreign currencies to be used as collateral for trades settled in yuan. While global finance institutions are interested in diversifying to China, strict capital controls and a relatively opaque system have discouraged large-scale investment. (not investment advice)</p>
