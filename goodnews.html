          <p>The UK government has made significant concessions on its proposed welfare reforms after facing a substantial rebellion from over 100 of its own Labour MPs. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall announced that planned cuts to disability and sickness benefits will now only apply to future claimants, protecting current recipients. This U-turn, which may cost up to ¬£3 billion, was made to ensure the bill's passage and follows intense internal party pressure and criticism.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates a split in the luxury property market, driven by economic uncertainty and high interest rates. The ultra-wealthy, with a net worth over $30 million, are increasingly making all-cash purchases and remain active, viewing real estate as a stable asset. In contrast, the less affluent but still wealthy are acting more cautiously due to borrowing costs, leading to an increase in price reductions on listings. This divergence highlights how different segments of the wealthy are navigating the current economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This review praises Charlie English's new book, "The CIA Book Club," as a thrilling account of how literature was used as a weapon against Soviet domination in Cold War-era Poland. The book details the CIA-funded program that smuggled forbidden books like George Orwell's "1984" into the Eastern Bloc to counter communist propaganda. The reviewer highlights the book's success in documenting the oral history of the Polish resistance and its powerful reminder of how stories and access to information can fuel a fight for freedom.</p>
