        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia is set to become the first country to eliminate all sexual activity-based restrictions on plasma donation, with changes starting next month. The new rules, approved by the country's health products regulator, are estimated to expand the donation pool by 625,000 people. Previously, men who had sex with men in the previous three months were banned from donating blood or plasma, but now most people in a sexual relationship of 6 months or more with a single partner will be eligible to donate blood, regardless of their gender or sexuality. The updated approach to blood donations will be implemented sometime in 2026. </p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed that Meta Platforms attempted to recruit OpenAI employees with signing bonuses reaching $100 million and substantial annual compensation packages. Altman noted that Meta views OpenAI as a primary competitor, acknowledging Meta's aggressive pursuit of AI talent due to the shortcomings of their own AI initiatives. Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, is reportedly investing heavily in assembling a top AI team for its "superintelligence" AI lab. These efforts follow delays in the release of Meta's latest flagship AI model, highlighting Zuckerberg's frustration with Meta's AI standing and willingness to invest billions in top talent.</p>

          <p>The G7 leaders launched an action plan to reduce risks in critical mineral supply chains, largely due to overdependence on China. The plan aims to protect economic security against nonmarket practices.

The G7 will develop a road map for standards-based markets for critical minerals by year-end and increase investment in responsible projects.

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's policy of only allowing male and female gender designations on U.S. passports. Judge Julia Kobick ruled that the policy likely discriminates on the basis of sex and is rooted in prejudice toward transgender Americans. The ruling extends a previous order, suspending the policy for all Americans and allowing applicants to choose their gender identity or select "X" on passport applications. Trump's executive order sought to define gender based on biological reality, arguing that efforts to erase sex in language and policy harm women and the American system.</p>
