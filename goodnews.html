          <p>Aaron Rodgers has officially signed a one-year contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers, worth up to $19.5 million with incentives, including a $10 million guarantee. This decision ends months of speculation about whether Rodgers would return for his 21st NFL season or retire after his time with the New York Jets. Rodgers had previously expressed openness to various possibilities, including retirement, but ultimately chose to continue his career in Pittsburgh. His arrival is expected to address the Steelers' quarterback situation, as he will compete with Mason Rudolph for the starting position, following Russell Wilson and Justin Fields signing with New York teams. The Steelers hope that Rodgers will be the answer to their problems at the quarterback position.</p>

          <p>Under the leadership of new head coach Charlotte Edwards and captain Nat Sciver-Brunt, the England women's cricket team achieved a clean sweep in both the T20 and one-day international series against the West Indies. While this victory marks a positive start to Edwards' tenure, it is tempered by the understanding that tougher challenges lie ahead, particularly with the upcoming series against India and the 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. The article cautions against reading too much into this series win, noting that England has historically performed well in home bilaterals but struggled on the global stage. Questions remain about whether this "new" England team can perform under pressure when it truly matters, especially considering past disappointments. The team hopes to keep up the momentum as they look to the future.</p>

          <p>The escalating feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has sparked concerns among Republicans about potential divisions within the party ahead of the midterm elections. The public spat, marked by social media attacks and personal insults, could undermine efforts to pass key legislation and energize critics of Trump's agenda. While some Republicans downplay the long-term impact, others acknowledge that Musk's criticism carries weight and could influence voters. Despite the tensions, there have been hints of a potential reconciliation, with both sides appearing to soften their rhetoric. This is an evolving story that may have consequences for the Republican party.</p>

          <p>Despite the recent fallout between President Trump and Elon Musk, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) continues its work within various government agencies.

          <p>Labour's major financial backers are pressuring Rachel Reeves to explore wealth taxes instead of implementing cuts in the upcoming spending review. A TUC-commissioned poll indicates that the public mostly favors taxing corporations and the wealthy to generate revenue for public services. This pressure comes after Angela Rayner encouraged Reeves to consider eight wealth taxes rather than cutting departmental budgets. The TUC also criticizes the Office for Budget Responsibility, suggesting its forecasts negatively affect spending plans. The unions are pushing for the government to prioritize public services and industrial renewal, even if it means increasing taxes on the wealthiest.</p>
