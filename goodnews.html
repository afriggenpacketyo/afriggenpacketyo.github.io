          <p>Eurostar has announced a significant expansion, ordering up to 50 "Celestia" double-decker trains from Alstom in a €2bn deal, marking the first time such trains will operate through the Channel Tunnel. This move aims to boost the company's fleet by nearly a third, with initial services beginning in 2031, and is projected to increase annual passenger numbers from 19.5 million to 30 million. The expansion includes an €80m investment in the crucial Temple Mills depot in London. However, regulatory reviews are ongoing regarding shared access to this depot for potential rival operators, highlighting the competitive landscape for cross-Channel rail services. The initiative signifies a major step in enhancing rail travel capacity and comfort.</p>

          <p>Manchester City defender Kerstin Casparij, with 48 caps for the Netherlands, has spoken about her journey to accepting her identity as an openly gay woman, having grown up in a small Dutch town where being gay was not openly discussed. She realized her preferences for girls from a young age but only found a sense of normalcy and community within women's football at 15. Now 25, Casparij is a vocal advocate for LGBTQ+ inclusivity, using her platform to support campaigns, wear rainbow laces, and serve as a patron for the LGBTQ Foundation. She aims to be a role model, providing the representation she wished for as a child, and promoting safe spaces for queer women.</p>

          <p>British lender Barclays has upgraded its full-year guidance, now expecting a Return on Tangible Equity (RoTE) greater than 11% and net interest income exceeding £12.6 billion, while also announcing a surprise £500 million ($667 million) share buyback. CEO C. S. Venkatakrishnan cited consistent capital generation over nine quarters as the basis for bringing forward distribution plans and moving to quarterly buyback announcements. Despite third-quarter pre-tax profit slightly missing expectations and a £235 million charge related to the UK's car loans scandal, Barclays' shares rose, reflecting strong investment banking income that contributed to a 35% year-to-date surge in its stock.

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets displayed a mixed performance, with South Korea's Kospi and Japan's Topix indices achieving new closing records, as investors reacted to Japan's latest trade data and new political leadership. Japanese exports in September saw a 4.2% year-on-year increase, fueled by strong demand from Asia, though this fell slightly short of analysts' predictions. The new Japanese cabinet, notably including the nation's first female finance minister, was inaugurated. South Korea's Kospi climbed 1.56% to an all-time high, partly driven by a surge in LG Chem shares following calls for corporate governance changes.

          <p>Jennifer Saunders will reunite with her iconic Absolutely Fabulous co-star Dame Joanna Lumley in the upcoming Christmas special of the sitcom "Amandaland," where Saunders will portray Joan, the sister of Lumley's character, Felicity. Joan is humorously characterized as a "ball of country-living, enthusiastic upper-class bluster," promising a distinct dynamic from Felicity. Saunders expressed her excitement about joining the cast for this festive episode, which will precede the show's second series airing in 2026. This reunion is a highly anticipated event for fans, building on the duo's celebrated comedic history and their previous Bafta-winning performances in the popular 1990s British sitcom.</p>

          <p>Apple is reportedly facing substantial engineering difficulties in the development of its ambitious foldable 18-inch iPad, potentially delaying its release from 2028 to 2029 or beyond. The device, internally designated J312, is anticipated to carry a price tag of approximately $3,000 and represents a key part of Apple's drive for innovative new products. Key challenges include optimizing the device's weight, integrating advanced features, and perfecting the complex 18-inch organic light-emitting diode display technology. Unlike a rumored foldable iPhone, prototypes of this tablet lack an external display, adopting a laptop-like form factor when closed. These obstacles underscore the considerable technical and financial investment required for such groundbreaking technology.</p>

          <p>Storm Benjamin, designated by Météo France, is anticipated to bring substantial heavy rain and strong winds to the United Kingdom on Thursday, although the most severe effects are projected for France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The Met Office has issued yellow severe weather warnings for both wind and rain across various regions of England and Wales, indicating a potential for localized flooding and significant travel disruptions. Forecasts suggest rainfall could accumulate between 20-50mm, accompanied by wind gusts reaching 45-55mph, with isolated coastal areas potentially experiencing up to 75mph. While the UK might largely encounter typical autumnal conditions, the storm's overall intensity necessitates preparedness for possible impacts.</p>

          <p>India is reportedly nearing a trade deal with the U.S. that could see Washington significantly reduce tariffs on Indian exports, potentially to 15%-16% from the current 50%. As part of this agreement, New Delhi is considering scaling back its oil purchases from Russia and possibly increasing its import quota for non-genetically modified corn from the U.S. U.S. President Donald Trump indicated that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured him of reduced Russian oil imports, while also threatening "massive" tariffs if India did not comply. The finalization of this trade agreement is anticipated to be announced at the upcoming ASEAN summit, marking a significant shift in bilateral economic relations. (not investment advice)</p>

CEO Ted Sarandos stated that AI would help creators tell stories "better, faster and in new ways" and expressed confidence that it would not replace human creativity. These comments come amid broader industry concerns about AI's potential impact on human jobs and the use of human-made content, previously a central issue in Hollywood labor disputes.</p>

          <p>New York City's mayoral candidates are gearing up for their final debate, with Democrat Zohran Mamdani seeking to maintain his frontrunner status against former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is aggressively urging Republican Curtis Sliwa to withdraw. Cuomo, running as an independent, frames Sliwa as a "spoiler" and is making a last-ditch effort to appeal to conservative and moderate voters, arguing he is the more viable candidate to prevent a Mamdani victory. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, plans to focus on local issues and voter concerns, while navigating expected attacks on his political resume and the city's future under his leadership. The dynamic highlights the intense political maneuvering in the final stretch of the election.</p>

          <p>A woman in Kew expressed "shock" after being fined £150 for pouring a small amount of coffee down a road gully in west London, an act she considered responsible to prevent spilling it on a bus. Three enforcement officers issued the penalty under Section 33 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, which makes it an offense to dispose of waste in a way that could pollute land or water. Burcu Yesilyurt, unaware of this specific regulation, found the interaction intimidating and believes the fine is disproportionate, calling for clearer public signage. Richmond Council, reviewing body-worn camera footage, affirmed its officers acted professionally and objectively in enforcing policies designed to protect the borough's waterways.</p>

          <p>The Spanish soccer league has officially canceled its plans for Barcelona to play a regular-season match against Villarreal in Miami this December, attributing the decision to "uncertainty that has arisen in Spain over the past few weeks." Despite having secured approvals from UEFA and the Spanish federation, the league encountered increasing domestic resistance from players, various clubs, and fan groups who actively protested the international fixture. The game promoter, Relevent, also acknowledged that there was insufficient time to adequately organize an event of this magnitude. While the league expressed regret over the lost opportunity for global expansion and revenue, critics, including Real Madrid, maintained that playing abroad would undermine competitive fairness.</p>

Musk, however, defended SpaceX's rapid advancement and confidently predicted that Starship would ultimately accomplish the entire lunar mission.

In another season opener, the Golden State Warriors secured a 119-109 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers, despite Luka Doncic's impressive 43-point effort. The Lakers played without an injured LeBron James and were hampered by turnovers and poor third-quarter play, highlighting early season challenges for the team.</p>
