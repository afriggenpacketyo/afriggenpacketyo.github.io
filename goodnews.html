          <p>The White House is implementing a restructuring of the National Security Council (NSC), resulting in staff reductions and reassignments, with some aides being placed on administrative leave. The changes come weeks after President Trump appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio as the national security adviser, replacing Mike Waltz. Andy Baker, Vice President JD Vance's national security adviser, and White House deputy chief of staff Robert Gabriel will take on top roles as deputy national security advisers. The restructuring is driven by a desire to streamline the NSC and ensure staff loyalty to the President, following previous accusations of disloyalty.</p>

          <p>Four top partners at Paul Weiss, including Karen Dunn, Bill Isaacson, Jeannie Rhee, and Jessica Phillips, have announced their departure from the firm to form their own law firm. This comes after Paul Weiss reached a deal with President Trump to avoid an executive order that would have restricted its business, a decision that has drawn criticism from associates, other firms, and Democrats. The departing partners, including prominent Democratic lawyer Karen Dunn and former Mueller prosecutor Jeannie Rhee, did not address the deal with Trump in their email to former colleagues, expressing gratitude for their time at the firm.</p>

          <p>Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, stated that the United States is increasingly recognizing Japan's economic importance following discussions with U.S. Cabinet members. During meetings with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in Washington, Akazawa discussed trade, nontariff barriers, and economic security. Both officials agreed on the need to conclude a trade deal as soon as possible. Akazawa also requested the removal of additional tariffs imposed on Japan. The talks occurred after a phone conversation between Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump, who agreed that the forthcoming talks should be "productive."</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming tour dates after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain condition causing issues with hearing, vision, and balance. The iconic singer was advised by his doctor to refrain from performing and undergo physical therapy. Normal pressure hydrocephalus occurs when cerebrospinal fluid builds up inside or around the brain, disrupting brain-related functions, and can be treated with a surgical procedure to implant a shunt. Fans who purchased tickets will be automatically refunded, and Joel looks forward to returning to the stage when he can.</p>

The leak originated from the attic of Ginsburg Hall, which opened in September and houses advanced technology, including robotics labs and a two-story lab for autonomous aerial vehicles. The building, which is LEED platinum certified, has been closed for repairs, and researchers have been notified to check their equipment. The university's facilities planning and management department is managing the repairs, but there is no estimated timeline for how long repairs will take.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that Anna's Hummingbirds in the western United States are adapting to human influence, specifically the use of hummingbird feeders. The study found that the beaks of these birds have become longer and more slender, allowing them to access nectar more efficiently from feeders. Male beaks have also grown pointier to compete with other males at the feeders. This has also led to the hummingbird expanding its range further north. The study also noted the influence of the growing abundance of eucalyptus forests.</p>

While the speech will be written on the advice of Canada's government, it is anticipated to convey a message of solidarity with Canada, balancing this with the UK's relationship with the US.
