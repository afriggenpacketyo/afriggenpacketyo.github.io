          <h2>Judge Temporarily Halts Trump Administration's Agency Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 23:01:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from implementing sweeping cuts and layoffs at 20 federal agencies, responding to a lawsuit from federal employee unions. The judge ruled that the administration likely exceeded its legal authority in ordering the downsizing as part of a cost-cutting drive led by the Department of Government Efficiency. The restraining order prevents agencies from laying off staff or putting workers on administrative leave to comply with the executive order. The order remains in effect for at least 14 days while the judge considers the case, impacting agencies like the OMB, SSA, and departments of State, Treasury, Commerce, and Veterans Affairs.</p>

          <p>Police in Bristol are focusing on disrupting and criminalizing men who buy sexual services, rather than targeting sex workers themselves, in an effort to combat night-time exploitation. Dedicated teams are engaging with street sex workers while disrupting kerb crawlers, following the National Police Chiefs' Council's recommendation to safeguard vulnerable women and target the men. Plain clothes officers monitor red-light areas via CCTV, issuing community protection warnings to men found loitering with sex workers, restricting their access to certain areas. The Op Boss team has dealt with 145 offences in an 18-month period, sending over 1,000 men on a course to prevent reoffending and educate them about the vulnerabilities of sex workers.</p>

          <p>Texas lawmakers are advancing Senate Bill 17, legislation designed to prevent governments and entities tied to countries like China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from purchasing land in Texas that could pose a national security risk. The bill empowers the state's attorney general to investigate, block, and reverse land deals made by entities affiliated with governments deemed national security threats. Exemptions are included for U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and property intended as a personal homestead. The bill is a response to concerns about foreign actors acquiring land near critical infrastructure, such as military bases and food processing plants.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK has become a popular filming location for Hollywood blockbusters due to generous tax incentives, lower labor costs, and centralized national funding for film. In 2024, 65% of UK production spending came from major US film studios and streaming giants, amounting to ¬£1.37 billion. Recent films like Barbie, Jurassic World: Dominion, and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny have utilized UK studios and locations, saving millions through tax rebates. However, proposed tariffs on movies made in foreign countries have raised concerns, with potential impacts on moviegoers through increased ticket prices and subscription rates.</p>

          <p>Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene announced she will not run in the upcoming Georgia Senate race against Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff, citing her unwillingness to "fight for a team that refuses to win." This decision follows Governor Brian Kemp's choice not to seek the Republican nomination, leaving the primary field open. Greene's polling numbers against Ossoff lagged behind Kemp's, influencing her decision despite her strong fundraising abilities and loyalty to former President Trump. The Georgia seat is crucial for both parties' Senate ambitions, as Republicans aim to expand their majority, while Democrats seek to maintain control.</p>

          <p>Japanese figure skating prodigy Taiga Nishino, at just 15 years old, is showing significant potential after mastering two quadruple jumps. Although too young to compete at the next Winter Olympics, Nishino has drawn comparisons to junior champion Rio Nakata. He recently landed a quad toe loop in competition and previously executed a quad salchow, indicating a rapid improvement in his jumping ability. Nishino, who has grown nearly 10 centimeters in the past year, aims to achieve strong results at the world junior championships and Junior Grand Prix Final next season.</p>

The agreement settles several claims Texas made against the search giant in 2022 related to geolocation, incognito searches, and biometric data. The state argued that Google was unlawfully tracking and collecting users' private data, including voiceprints and records of face geometry.

          <p>Elton John and Dua Lipa are among over 400 British musicians, writers, and artists calling on the prime minister to update copyright laws to protect them from artificial intelligence. They want the PM to back an amendment to the Data (Use and Access) Bill that would require developers to be transparent with copyright owners about using their material to train AI models. The artists say failing to give that protection would mean them "giving away" their work to tech firms. The letter comes amid mounting concern from artists over the inclusion of their works, and material protected by copyright, in the data used to develop generative AI systems.</p>

          <p>California public health officials have announced an annual quarantine on mussels that aren‚Äôt commercially harvested, cautioning that naturally occurring toxins make the species potentially poisonous to humans this time of year. The quarantine, which runs through Oct. 31, warns against eating all types of sport-harvested mussels off the West Coast due to the risk of paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid biotoxins. Commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt from the quarantine because they are required to submit frequent samples to the state Department of Public Health for testing.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, was freed from ICE custody after a federal judge in Vermont ordered her release on bail. Ozturk was detained in March after her visa was revoked by the Trump administration, allegedly due to her political speech. The judge criticized the government for not producing any evidence against her aside from an op-ed she co-wrote in her student newspaper. Her legal team argued that she was being targeted because of her criticism of the university's response to resolutions approved by the Tufts Community Union Senate.</p>
