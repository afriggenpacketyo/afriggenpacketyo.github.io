          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University pro-Palestinian activist who was arrested by ICE agents in New York City in March. Judge Michael Farbiarz denied a motion by the government to stay the ruling for seven days, indicating that he will issue an order requiring Khalil's release today. Khalil, a green card holder married to an American citizen, had been detained based on the Secretary of State's determination that his presence posed a risk to foreign policy, but the judge later sided with the government on grounds of misrepresentation on his green card application. The judge asked the parties to consult with a magistrate judge about conditions for Khalil's release on bail.</p>

          <p>Brent oil prices experienced a decline of over 2% following President Donald Trump's decision to delay potential strikes against Iran, expressing hope for upcoming negotiations regarding the Islamic Republic's nuclear program. Brent, the global benchmark, fell $2.12, or 2.69%, to $76.73 per barrel, while U.S. crude oil rose 4 cents to $75.18 per barrel. Despite Trump's stance, Israel is intensifying its attacks on Iran, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordering the military to escalate strikes on strategic and government targets after an Iranian missile struck a hospital in southern Israel. The decision to postpone military action is providing space for diplomatic efforts, yet tensions in the region remain high. (not investment advice)</p>

The companies argued that Trump lacked authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose the tariffs. The U.S. Court of International Trade previously blocked Trump's tariffs, but a federal appeals court allowed them to remain in effect pending arguments on the case.

          <p>Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski has voiced concerns regarding potential cuts to Medicaid and food benefits in President Trump's proposed "big, beautiful bill," particularly as they would affect her constituents in Alaska. While she has not issued any absolute deal-breakers, Murkowski has emphasized the importance of communicating her concerns throughout the legislative process. She highlighted that Alaska faces some of the highest healthcare costs in the country, with 40% of the state's children relying on Medicaid. Murkowski supports addressing entitlement spending but opposes measures that disproportionately harm the most vulnerable.</p>

          <p>States are forfeiting hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue to attract data centers, with tech giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google benefiting from these exemptions. These tax breaks, intended to spur economic activity, have sparked debate due to the limited job creation and immense electricity consumption associated with data centers. While some states like Virginia have seen moderate economic benefits from data center incentives, others are experiencing significant revenue losses. Critics argue that these tax breaks disproportionately benefit large corporations at the expense of taxpayers and public services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament has approved a bill allowing terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to end their lives, paving the way for significant social change. The Terminally Ill Adults Bill passed with a vote of 314 to 291 and will now be scrutinized by the House of Lords. If approved by the Lords, the government will have up to four years to implement the measures, potentially making assisted dying available by 2029. The vote followed an emotionally charged debate, with supporters emphasizing the importance of compassion and safeguards, while critics raised concerns about coercion and the protection of vulnerable individuals.</p>
