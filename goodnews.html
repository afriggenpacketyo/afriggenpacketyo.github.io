          <p>Democrat Zohran Mamdani, a leading candidate in the New York City mayoral race, has publicly challenged President Trump to a debate, aiming to bypass what he perceives as a "puppet" in the form of Andrew Cuomo. This move follows Cuomo's call for a series of mayoral debates and comes amidst White House interest in the race, with Trump reportedly exploring options to consolidate the field. Mamdani criticized Trump's policies, particularly cuts to SNAP benefits for New Yorkers, while Cuomo asserted Mamdani lacks majority support. The current four-way race, with Mamdani polling ahead, is expected to see more twists before Election Day, setting the stage for a dynamic political contest.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump finalized a trade deal with Japan, implementing a 15% baseline tariff on most Japanese goods, including autos, while Tokyo agreed to invest $550 billion in U.S. projects and increase agricultural imports. The agreement, reached after months of negotiations, also grants Japan "breakthrough openings" in various sectors. This article notes the deal's potential impact on global supply chains and major auto manufacturers like Toyota. Concurrently, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces significant political pressure and calls for his resignation at home due to recent election losses and internal party discontent, making the timing of the deal significant for his leadership.

          <p>President Donald Trump reiterated his warning of impending "fairly substantial" tariffs on semiconductor imports, specifically targeting companies that do not shift production to the U.S. However, he signaled that firms like Apple, which have committed significant investments to domestic manufacturing, would be exempt. Speaking at a White House dinner with tech leaders, Trump offered few details but emphasized the administration's long-standing effort to onshore the semiconductor supply chain. This article highlights the administration's strategy to incentivize domestic production through tariffs and exemptions, impacting major players like TSMC and Samsung, who have already pledged billions for U.S. plants.

          <p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett publicly defended her strong criticism of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's arguments regarding universal injunctions, stating her remarks were "warranted" in a recent majority opinion. Speaking at Lincoln Center to promote her new book, Barrett clarified that her disagreement was with legal ideas, not a personal attack, emphasizing her deep respect for Jackson. The core of the debate centers on the appropriate scope of judicial power, particularly concerning the use of universal injunctions by lower courts that have frequently blocked policies of the Trump administration. This rare public appearance provided valuable insight into the Supreme Court's internal dynamics and Barrett's judicial philosophy, highlighting ongoing legal discussions about governmental authority and the judiciary's role.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has petitioned the Supreme Court to permit him to fire Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, who was previously reinstated by lower courts after her termination. The White House argues Trump acted lawfully, citing recent Supreme Court decisions affirming presidential authority over executive agency heads. Slaughter, a Democratic appointee whose term extends to 2029, has stated her intention to serve it out, emphasizing her focus on her work. This legal challenge is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to assert influence over federal agencies, raising significant questions about the independence of regulatory bodies and the extent of presidential removal powers in the context of "cause" for dismissal.</p>

While acknowledging their consumer appeal for tasks like booking travel, Arora emphasized that businesses would be wary of the AI agents' autonomy due to concerns over credentials and enterprise security. He predicted major tech companies would develop these browsers, but without built-in security features, they would likely be restricted from corporate use within 24 months.

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court upheld an injunction preventing the State Department from enforcing a Trump administration policy that aimed to restrict transgender and nonbinary Americans from obtaining passports accurately reflecting their gender identities. This decision follows President Trump's executive order to recognize only male and female biological genders, reversing a previous Biden administration policy allowing an "X" gender marker. The American Civil Liberties Union sued, arguing the policy was discriminatory and unconstitutional. The appeals court affirmed a lower court's finding that the policy reflected "unconstitutional animus" and would cause "immediate and irreparable harms," marking a significant legal victory for transgender rights advocates.</p>
