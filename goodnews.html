          <p>Tesla's stock price has recovered some ground following a public disagreement between Elon Musk and President Trump, which had initially caused a sharp decline in share value. The stock rose by over 5% in morning trading after falling 14% the previous day due to Trump's threat to remove government contracts from Musk's companies. Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives remains optimistic about Tesla's future, citing the potential of its autonomous vehicle technology, despite the recent volatility caused by the spat. Musk's net worth decreased significantly due to the stock drop, but analysts believe the situation will stabilize as both parties need each other. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla stock has climbed approximately 5% as it attempts to recover from the fallout of a public argument between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. The feud had resulted in a significant drop in Tesla's market capitalization, with analysts attributing the volatility to investor concerns over the strained relationship. Despite the tensions, analysts suggest that both Musk and Trump need each other, and a potential reconciliation could benefit Tesla's stock. The situation highlights the impact of political dynamics on the financial markets and the interconnectedness of business and government relations.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz progressed to his second consecutive French Open final after Lorenzo Musetti retired due to injury in the fourth set of their semi-final match. Alcaraz was leading 4-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-0, 2-0 when Musetti, who had been aiming for his first major final, was forced to stop due to a thigh problem. Alcaraz expressed sympathy for Musetti's situation, acknowledging that it's never fair to win in such a manner. The defending champion will now face either Novak Djokovic or Jannik Sinner in the final, seeking to secure his second Roland Garros title.</p>

          <p>Scottish Labour's Davy Russell won the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election, taking the seat from the SNP with a majority of 602 votes. The by-election was triggered by the death of SNP MSP Christina McKelvie, who had represented the constituency since 2011. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar hailed the victory as proof that his party had "proven the pollsters wrong."

          <p>The stock market is experiencing a rebound following a positive update on nonfarm payrolls, with the U.S. economy adding 139,000 jobs in May and the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2%.

Investors are encouraged by the data, as a strong labor market supports consumer spending, which is a significant driver of the U.S. economy.
