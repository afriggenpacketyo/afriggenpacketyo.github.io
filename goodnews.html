          <p>Chongqing, China's largest inland city, has transformed into a global rail hub connecting Asean and Europe, offering a faster and more reliable trade route amid geopolitical risks. The city's rail networks provide access to markets in Germany, Russia, and Singapore, positioning it as a central node in the global economy. Shipping goods from Asean to Europe via Chongqing is reportedly 10 to 20 days faster than traditional sea transport. This development highlights China's deepening global trade footprint and its ambition to become a crucial link between Asia and Europe.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that Iran provided "early notice" of missile strikes targeting the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, characterizing Iran's response to U.S. bombings of Iranian nuclear sites as "very weak." Trump also announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire starting at midnight ET, though neither country has confirmed this. Diplomatic sources indicated that the counterattack was expected and calibrated, with U.S. and Qatari officials preparing over the weekend. Trump claimed the strikes caused minimal damage and no casualties, urging both Iran and Israel to pursue peace and harmony.</p>

          <p>NHS England will offer at-home HPV test kits to women who have delayed cervical screening. The kits, available from January, contain a long cotton-wool bud to swab the lining of the vagina. This initiative aims to address barriers such as embarrassment, discomfort, and lack of time that prevent women from attending screenings. Women who have rarely or never attended cervical screening will be offered a self-sample kit to complete at home.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>RBN Energy executive Rusty Braziel stated that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil shipping passage, because it would harm its own economy. Braziel noted that Iran exports 1.7 million barrels a day through the strait. Braziel also warned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China pose serious issues for exporters, as the market may no longer see U.S. exporters of energy commodities as trustworthy suppliers. He said that the market has already concluded that Iran won't close the strait, pointing out that oil prices dropped on Monday. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump's high-risk maneuver may pay off if the limited damage and lack of further Iranian attacks lead to earnest negotiations.</p>
