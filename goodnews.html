          <p>A group of White South Africans arrived at Dulles International Airport after being granted refugee status by the Trump administration. This decision follows President Trump's directive to resettle South Africans of European descent, citing discrimination by South Africa's post-apartheid government, an allegation strongly denied by the South African government. The group includes families with children and were greeted by U.S. officials. This move has sparked debate about the criteria for refugee status and the U.S.'s role in addressing alleged discrimination abroad.</p>

          <p>After a deadly terrorist attack on the Indian side of Kashmir, India and Pakistan engaged in airstrikes and retaliatory measures, escalating tensions between the two nuclear powers. The conflict, marked by contradictory statements and disinformation, brought the region to the brink of war. President Trump announced a cease-fire agreement mediated by the U.S., with both countries claiming victory. The clashes involved strikes deeper into each other's territory than in the past 50 years, raising alarms about strategic sites and prompting international concern.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order asking drugmakers to voluntarily reduce prices of key medicines in the U.S., but the order lacks clear legal authority to mandate lower prices. The administration would consider regulatory actions or importing drugs from other countries if drugmakers don't comply. The order also calls on federal agencies to investigate why European countries get lower prices. Pharmaceutical stocks rose on the news, as the order was viewed as less damaging than anticipated. Trump directed his ire toward European governments that have negotiated lower prices, threatening to use trade policy to push them to pay more.</p>
