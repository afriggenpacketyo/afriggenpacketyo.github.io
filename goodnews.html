          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amidst economic challenges and a volatile international landscape. Voters are primarily concerned with the rising cost of living and housing affordability, overshadowing global issues stemming from Washington. Both major parties have offered limited solutions to address these economic pressures. The opposition leader's attempts to emulate Trump's rhetoric have not resonated well with voters. This New York Times article emphasizes a shift away from major parties towards independent candidates, reflecting a broader dissatisfaction with the current political offerings.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Tim Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snakes. Current antivenoms are species-specific, but Friede's mission could lead to a universal antivenom. Researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies that, combined with a drug, protected mice from fatal doses of 13 of 19 deadly snake species.</p>
