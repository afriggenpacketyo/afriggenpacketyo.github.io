        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study led by Chinese researchers suggests that liquid water may be present in the Martian crust, just a few kilometers beneath the surface. Analyzing seismic waves from marsquakes recorded by NASA's InSight lander, the team identified a zone best explained by water-saturated rock. If confirmed, this underground layer could hold a significant amount of water, potentially matching what scientists believe to be Mars' missing water. The discovery could reshape understanding of Mars' water cycle and the possibility of habitable environments on the planet.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs are causing German companies to rethink their investments in the United States, despite Germany's significant historical investment in the U.S. manufacturing sector. Surveys indicate that German manufacturers are pulling back from investing in the U.S. due to concerns about tariffs. Instead, many German firms are keeping their investments at home, encouraged by a new government focused on reducing bureaucracy and energy prices. German companies emphasize that their U.S. investments were driven by market access and local production, not political pressure.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the duality of China's economy, highlighting its technological prowess alongside economic challenges such as sluggish consumer spending and a housing crisis. Despite advancements in AI and manufacturing, China faces issues like unemployment and reliance on exports.
