          <p>As autumn approaches, stargazers can look forward to several notable celestial phenomena. Key events include Saturn reaching its opposition on September 21st, making it appear at its largest and brightest for the year. Additionally, the Orionid meteor shower, originating from Halley's Comet, will be active from early October to early November, peaking around October 22nd. The article notes that viewing conditions for the Orionids will be ideal due to the peak coinciding with a new moon, minimizing light pollution. Other events are also mentioned for sky-watching enthusiasts.</p>

          <p>Three Austrian nuns in their 80s have defiantly returned to their former convent after being moved to a care home against their will. With the help of former students and a locksmith, Sister Bernadette, Sister Regina, and Sister Rita re-entered the Kloster Goldenstein convent, where they had lived and worked for decades. The nuns stated they were unhappy in the care home and were exercising their right to live in the convent until the end of their lives. Church authorities have expressed disapproval, citing the nuns' health and the unsuitability of the convent for proper care.</p>

          <p>Shacole Fox, a Cincinnati makeup artist, was walked down the aisle at her wedding by her 79-year-old landlord, Gil Pulliam. Fox, who never knew her father, was struggling with the painful void as her wedding day approached. Sensing her situation, Pulliam, who owns the building where her studio is located, offered to escort her, an offer she enthusiastically accepted. Fox described the moment as feeling "like a wound had been healed in my heart," creating an unexpected and powerful father-daughter bond. The story highlights a touching act of kindness that transcended a typical landlord-tenant relationship.</p>

          <p>Gustavo Dudamel has officially begun his tenure as the music and artistic director designate of the New York Philharmonic, opening the orchestra's fall season. His debut program featured a world premiere by Leilehua Lanzilotti, Bartók’s Piano Concerto No. 3, and Charles Ives’ Symphony No. 2. The performance was met with enthusiasm, signaling a new chapter for the celebrated orchestra, which hopes to recapture the widespread attention it held during the Leonard Bernstein era. While Dudamel officially takes the full title in 2026, his significant presence this season marks the de facto start of his leadership in New York.</p>

          <p>As new students prepare for university, current first-years are offering tips on navigating the transition, from social life to mental health. They advise new students, or "freshers," not to worry excessively about making friends, as everyone feels similarly anxious, and to find social activities beyond clubbing if that is not their preference. The article also includes perspectives from a commuting student, who emphasizes organization, and a student who was the first in her family to attend university, who stresses the importance of using support systems and managing burnout. The overarching message is to be kind to oneself and remember that university is a learning curve.</p>

          <p>Sean Astin, widely known for his role as Samwise Gamgee in “The Lord of the Rings,” has been elected the new national president of the SAG-AFTRA union. Astin secured 79% of the vote, succeeding Fran Drescher, who led the union through a major strike in 2023. He will now lead the 160,000-member union into new contract negotiations with major studios next year. Key challenges on the horizon include the industry's consolidation, the rise of artificial intelligence, and productions moving overseas. Astin expressed a determined outlook, stating it feels like a moment to "get to work" rather than celebrate.</p>

Cook emphasized the benefits of domestic manufacturing for creating economic hubs and supporting local communities. The partnership between Apple and Corning dates back to the first iPhone in 2007.

          <p>The California state legislature has passed Senate Bill 79, a significant housing bill designed to increase density by overriding local zoning laws near public transit. The bill, which now heads to the governor's desk, allows for the construction of taller, denser apartment buildings near bus and train stations, including in some single-family neighborhoods. Proponents argue the measure is a necessary step to address the state's severe housing shortage and affordability crisis. However, critics, including the Los Angeles City Council, contend that it is a "one-size-fits-all" mandate that strips local control over responsible development.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's search for the next Federal Reserve chair has expanded to include Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income. Rieder reportedly interviewed with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is leading the selection process. The administration is considering multiple candidates, including former Fed governors, as it seeks new leadership and structural changes at the central bank. Rieder, like current chair Jerome Powell, comes from a Wall Street background rather than traditional academic economics. President Trump has been openly critical of the Fed's interest rate policies, demanding significant cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

Officials had accused Cook of improperly claiming both her Atlanta and Michigan homes as primary residences to gain favorable mortgage and tax terms. However, the loan document suggests she was transparent with her lender about the Atlanta home's intended use. Cook has consistently denied any wrongdoing and is currently suing the president to prevent her dismissal from the Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>
