          <p>A federal judge has ruled against the Trump administration's decision to freeze $2.2 billion in grant funding for Harvard University. The court found the action was likely illegal retaliation for the university's refusal to alter its policies on diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as other First Amendment-protected activities. The ruling vacates the freeze, which had halted numerous critical research projects, including studies on tuberculosis and veterans' mental health, that the judge noted were unrelated to the administration's stated concerns about antisemitism.</p>

          <p>Former NFL quarterback Tom Brady offered a critical assessment of the current state of the league, suggesting that today's players are "coddled a little bit more" than in previous eras. In an interview with Kevin Hart, Brady contrasted the modern approach with past expectations, where players were told to "get the work done." He believes that while there are more distractions, players with a strong work ethic have greater opportunities to succeed, highlighting Patrick Mahomes as a quarterback with the will to win and the potential to "duplicate history."</p>

          <p>Veteran all-rounder Ravi Bopara scored a remarkable 45-ball century to lead Northamptonshire to a seven-run victory over Surrey in a rain-shortened T20 Blast quarter-final. The 40-year-old's explosive innings of 105 not out from 46 balls was crucial in lifting his team to a total of 154-4 from their 14 overs. Despite a strong effort from Surrey captain Sam Curran, who scored an unbeaten 69, his team fell short in the chase. The victory secures Northamptonshire's first appearance at Finals Day since 2016, the year they last won the tournament.</p>

          <p>A politically diverse group of U.S. Representatives, from progressive Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to conservative Chip Roy, has introduced the "Restore Trust In Congress Act." This bipartisan bill aims to ban members of Congress and their immediate families from trading individual stocks while in office. Supporters argue the measure is crucial for restoring public trust and ensuring lawmakers are not influenced by their personal financial portfolios when making policy decisions. The bill reflects widespread public support for such a common-sense reform to prevent self-enrichment.</p>

The Canadian player won the nerve-racking, four-hour match 4-6, 7-6 (7), 7-5, 7-6 (4), demonstrating resilience in crucial moments. This marks a significant return to form for Auger-Aliassime, who has struggled with injuries and confidence in recent years after reaching a career-high ranking of No. 6 in 2022. The win continues a devastating streak for de Minaur, who has now lost in all six of his Grand Slam quarter-final appearances.</p>

          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the "Restore Trust in Congress Act," is gaining momentum as it aims to prohibit members of Congress, their spouses, and dependent children from owning or trading individual stocks. The legislation combines several previous proposals and is supported by a wide political spectrum, from Rep. Chip Roy to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The bill would mandate the sale of existing stocks and impose a 10% penalty on the value of any investment that violates the ban. Supporters argue it is a critical step to prevent potential conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has ruled that the Trump administration acted unlawfully when it terminated over $2 billion in federal research grants to Harvard University. The judge found the action was illegal retaliation for the university's refusal to comply with White House demands for policy changes. The court order reinstates the frozen funding, which supports hundreds of research projects, and prohibits the government from making similar future cuts. The judge suggested the administration's stated reason, concerns about antisemitism, was a "smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault" on universities.</p>

          <p>Democrats have successfully negotiated an agreement with the Department of Justice to ensure approximately 98,000 voters in North Carolina are not removed from the rolls. The DOJ had previously sued the state, demanding it block voters who registered without providing a driver's license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number. The Democratic National Committee intervened, arguing the move violated the National Voter Registration Act. The new consent order allows these voters to provide the required information via a provisional ballot at the polling place.</p>

          <p>American Eagle's stock soared over 20% after the retailer reported second-quarter earnings that significantly beat Wall Street expectations and re-issued a positive full-year outlook.

Despite some backlash, the campaign led to increased traffic, new customer acquisition, and sold-out products.
