          <p>The United Kingdom and India have signed a free trade agreement projected to boost their annual bilateral trade by more than £25.5 billion (over $34 billion) by 2040. The historic deal will slash tariffs on a wide range of goods, including textiles, automobiles, and Scotch whisky, with 92% of UK exports to India seeing reduced or eliminated duties. Key provisions include a phased reduction of the 150% tariff on Scotch whisky and lower duties on cars. The agreement is seen as a strategic victory for both nations, aiming to boost wages, lower consumer prices, and strengthen their respective positions in global trade negotiations.

          <p>China has stepped into a mediation role following recent deadly border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia, urging both nations to exercise restraint and de-escalate the situation. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson emphasized that both countries are "friendly neighbors" and important ASEAN members, expressing hope that they will resolve their differences peacefully, in line with the bloc's traditions. The intervention comes after a significant escalation in the long-running border dispute, which involved artillery and rocket fire, resulting in multiple fatalities. China's involvement highlights its growing diplomatic influence in regional conflicts within Southeast Asia.</p>

          <h2>UFC Fighter Robert Whittaker Discusses Return to Competition After Severe Dental Injury</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 01:51:35 EDT</div>

          <p>Former UFC middleweight champion Robert Whittaker is set to return to the octagon against Reinier de Ridder, nine months after suffering a severe dental injury in a fight. During his last bout, a face crank submission caused his bottom teeth to cave in, requiring surgery to remove several teeth and install implants. Whittaker humorously noted that while the injury was unpleasant, his life is now much better with the new implants, as his teeth had been previously weakened. Now driven by a desire to be an example for his children, the 34-year-old is preparing for his upcoming fight in Abu Dhabi.</p>

          <h2>English Football Association Opposes Expanding VAR's Powers in Soccer</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 01:37:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The chief executive of England's Football Association, Mark Bullingham, has stated there is no need to expand the use of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system in soccer. This position comes amid reports that the sport's law-making body, IFAB, might consider widening VAR's authority to include decisions on corner kicks and second yellow cards. Bullingham argued that the game already experiences enough interruptions with the current VAR model and that the FA is satisfied with the system as it is. While the FA will consider any formal proposals, its current stance signals strong opposition to increasing the technology's scope in officiating.</p>

          <p>This week's film releases include the superhero reboot 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps,' directed by Matt Shakman. The article praises the film's 1960s aesthetic and its self-contained story that doesn't rely on previous franchise entries, highlighting the dynamic between stars Pedro Pascal and Vanessa Kirby. Also reviewed is Kiyoshi Kurosawa's psychological thriller 'Cloud,' about an online reseller whose business spirals into paranoia and violence. Other films discussed are 'Diciannove,' an Italian coming-of-age drama from a protégé of Luca Guadagnino, and 'Shoshana,' a historical thriller from Michael Winterbottom about pre-state Israel in the 1930s.</p>

          <p>During President Donald Trump's visit to Scotland, the United Kingdom is looking to resolve outstanding issues in its recent trade agreement with the United States. While a deal with a 10% baseline tariff was established, key elements remain unsettled, including the removal of a 25% tariff on UK steel and aluminum and disagreements over a British digital services tax. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to meet with Trump to refine the pact. Analysts suggest a potential trade-off could see the U.S. drop metal tariffs in exchange for the UK removing the digital tax, which would be a positive development for UK-U.S. relations.

          <p>In a UK-first initiative, individuals in Wales with conditions like coeliac disease will receive pre-loaded debit-style cards to purchase gluten-free food. This new system, launching later this year, offers an alternative to the current model of obtaining specific food items on prescription from a pharmacy. The Welsh government aims to "de-medicalise" the process, giving patients more choice and flexibility at supermarkets, shops, and online stores. While the program is praised for its convenience, some participants from a pilot scheme noted that the financial support provided only partially covers the significantly higher cost of a gluten-free diet.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang emphasized the importance of a healthy economic relationship between China and the European Union, characterized by both cooperation and competition. Speaking at a business symposium with EU leaders, Li stated that deepening collaboration in areas like services trade, green technology, and innovation is the "only right choice" for both sides. He argued that amid rising global protectionism, a strong China-EU partnership could serve as a stabilizing anchor for global trade and supply chains. The symposium was attended by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and nearly 60 representatives from European businesses and chambers of commerce.</p>

          <p>USC football coach Lincoln Riley stated he feels more "refreshed and recharged" than he has in a long time, despite facing immense pressure to win in his fourth year. Coming off a disappointing 7-6 season, Riley believes the program is now built and focused on making small refinements rather than major fixes. He credits his new general manager for easing his personnel duties and points to the nation's top-ranked 2026 recruiting class as evidence of the program's strong momentum. Despite a decline in wins over his first three seasons, Riley expressed confidence in the team's progress and its potential to succeed in close games.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and Australia have deepened their AUKUS security partnership by signing a 50-year treaty to support each other's nuclear-powered submarine programs. This move reinforces the trilateral pact, which also includes the United States, at a time of some uncertainty about Washington's long-term commitment. The agreement is expected to generate tens of thousands of jobs and could lead to £20 billion in British exports over 25 years. The defense pact is a cornerstone of the countries' efforts to ensure collective security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region amid growing concerns over China's military expansion.</p>

          <p>A rescue operation is in progress in northern British Columbia, Canada, to free three miners trapped underground following a mine collapse. The workers are located in the Red Chris copper and gold mine after a fall of ground blocked their exit. Officials have been using specialized drones and a remote-controlled scoop to assess the situation and begin clearing a large debris pile. The miners are sheltering in a specially designed refuge chamber with sufficient air, food, and water. However, communication with the trio was lost after a second cave-in, making re-establishing contact a top priority for the rescue teams.</p>
