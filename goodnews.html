        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An exploration of art history reveals the evolving depiction of children, from religious icons and political tools to symbols of innocence and individuality. In early modern Europe, portraits of royal children were used for marriage politics, strategically presenting them as desirable matches to expand dynastic power. As the bourgeoisie rose, they emulated this practice, while depictions of peasant children shifted from ridicule to symbols of piety. The modern concept of a carefree childhood emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries, a theme that photography later made more accessible and spontaneous for families.</p>

          <p>AC Milan midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek has returned to the England national team after a nearly seven-year absence, a period during which he says he "completely forgot" about international play. His last appearance was in 2018, before a severe Achilles rupture in 2019 derailed his career and led to a difficult mental recovery. Now 29, Loftus-Cheek credits his self-belief and a successful move to Italian club AC Milan for his resurgence and recall to the squad. He expressed that during his long hiatus, he became just a fan of the team, having gotten used to not being selected.</p>

          <p>Analysts at Morgan Stanley project a significant improvement for China's struggling property market in the latter half of the year. Following a challenging first half, the bank predicts that sales for major developers will decline at a much slower pace, potentially picking up in the fourth quarter. The optimistic forecast is based on developers' positive guidance, expectations of recovering profit margins, and a large inventory of completed homes in major cities. This outlook suggests the sector may be moving past the worst of a slump that has persisted for nearly five years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged to a new record high as the World Gold Council announced plans to trial a digital form of the precious metal. This initiative aims to standardize a digital layer for gold, which could revolutionize the physical market by enabling new methods for trading, settling, and using bullion as collateral. The price increase is also fueled by investors seeking a safe-haven asset amid global economic uncertainty and the prospect of U.S. interest rate cuts.

          <p>For the first time, professional women's football in England will feature minimum salary requirements for players in the top two tiers, the Women's Super League (WSL) and WSL 2. The new rule, introduced by the league's governing body, ensures players can earn a "full-time wage" from the sport, addressing the issue of many athletes having to juggle part-time jobs. This change is part of a broader effort to professionalize the game, which also includes increased standards for high-performance environments and player welfare. The specific salary thresholds will be based on factors like age, league, and experience.</p>

The author dismisses concerns about quarterback Matthew Stafford's health and the offensive line, instead highlighting the team's ascending young defense and a strengthened receiving corps featuring newcomer Davante Adams. Citing the leadership of coach Sean McVay and a relatively weak schedule, the piece argues that the Rams have all the necessary components to make a deep playoff run and contend for the championship.</p>

          <p>Contrary to a prevalent cultural narrative, a new national survey indicates that married mothers report being happier than unmarried women and married women without children. The study found that 19% of married mothers described themselves as "very happy," a higher percentage than other groups. These women were also most likely to feel their lives have a clear sense of purpose and meaning. The article suggests that while marriage and motherhood present challenges like feeling overwhelmed, they also provide unique benefits such as reduced loneliness and a profound sense of purpose that contributes significantly to overall life satisfaction.</p>

          <p>The location of Adolf Hitler's former bunker in Berlin, now an unremarkable parking lot, has become a notable destination for 'dark tourism.' Despite the absence of any visible remains, tourists flock to the site, guided only by a small informational plaque. This phenomenon highlights Germany's complex relationship with its Nazi past, as authorities have long resisted officially marking the site for fear of it becoming a neo-Nazi shrine. The story of the bunker's post-war history reflects a society grappling with how to handle sites associated with perpetrators while memorializing their victims, creating a 'repugnant market' for this type of tourism.</p>
