        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS is facing a critical blood shortage and is appealing for 200,000 new donors to register, particularly those with O negative blood, which is universally compatible. Low blood stocks prompted an "amber alert" last year, impacting patient treatment, and the situation has not improved significantly. The NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) aims to increase regular donors from 800,000 to over one million to ensure a stable supply. A "red alert" could lead to treatment delays, though urgent cases would still be prioritized, and the NHSBT is focusing on recruiting more Black donors due to their higher likelihood of possessing blood types crucial for treating sickle cell disease. The NHS is working to simplify the donation process by opening new centers and providing more convenient appointment options.</p>

          <p>The U.S. National Guard, comprising the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, serves a wide range of duties, including disaster relief and ensuring internal security. The governor typically commands reservists deployed within their respective states, while the U.S. president assumes command during nationwide deployments. Recently, President Trump overrode the authority of California's governor to deploy the National Guard in Los Angeles amidst protests against ICE immigration raids, citing national security concerns. The National Guard consists of approximately 419,000 reservists, and individuals can join by meeting certain physical, mental, and legal requirements, with typical duties including one weekend per month and two weeks per year.</p>

Ed arrived in Christiana on May 30, and his owner reported him missing the next day, and the zebra was spotted running along Interstate 24, forcing deputies to shut the roadway. The zebra quickly became the subject of internet memes, and the pursuit of Ed came a month after a runway kangaroo shut down a section of Alabama interstate.</p>

The tomb complex, believed to be over 1,500 years old, contains two burial chambers with six stone tombs each, and the discovery adds to the rich collection of archeological sites in the Idlib province. The director of antiquities in Idlib noted that the presence of the cross and pottery fragments indicates the tomb dates back to the Byzantine era. Local residents hope the discovery will lead to economic renewal through tourism and fair compensation for property owners.</p>
