        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Canadian government has reversed its plan to implement a digital services tax that would have affected major U.S. technology companies. The decision came after U.S. President Donald Trump announced he was terminating all trade discussions with Canada in response to the proposed 3% levy. Ottawa stated the move was made in anticipation of a new comprehensive trade arrangement, allowing negotiations to resume ahead of a previously set timeline. The tax, enacted last year, would have applied retroactively and was set to be collected this week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pride Month concluded with marches across the globe where communities both celebrated LGBTQ+ identity and protested against rising political attacks. In New York City, the theme "Rise Up: Pride in Protest" highlighted opposition to recent policies targeting transgender people, while in Budapest, thousands defied a government ban on LGBTQ+ public events. The events underscored a dual purpose: joyful resistance and a continued fight for rights and inclusion. This year's demonstrations occurred ten years after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage, a milestone celebrated amid new challenges.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Glastonbury Festival wrapped up after five days of music, featuring headline performances from Olivia Rodrigo and The 1975, as well as surprise sets from Pulp and Lorde. A key emotional moment was Lewis Capaldi's unannounced return to the stage to finish the set he had to abandon in 2023 due to health issues, which was met with a powerful crowd reception. The festival also saw controversy with the band Bob Vylan's anti-Israel chants and was attended by numerous celebrities, including Harry Styles and Andrew Garfield. The event will now take a fallow year, returning in 2027.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 20:00:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has officially lifted its comprehensive ban on Japanese seafood imports, which was imposed in August 2023. The ban was a response to Japan's release of treated radioactive water from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant, a move Beijing strongly opposed. The two nations had agreed in May to begin the process of resuming trade, and the lifting of the ban marks a significant step in de-escalating the diplomatic and economic friction over the issue. However, it may still take several months for procedural steps to be completed before physical shipments of seafood from Japan to China can resume.</p>

Parker, a Sparks legend who also won a title with her hometown Chicago team, was honored at halftime as her No. 3 jersey was raised to the rafters. On the court, Chicago's Angel Reese dominated the game with 24 points and 16 rebounds, proving too much for the Sparks to handle. Despite a strong second-half surge fueled by Emma Cannon, the Sparks were unable to secure a victory on the celebratory occasion.</p>
