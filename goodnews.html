          <p>A UK government minister confirms they are advocating for a deal that would allow UK passport holders to use EU e-gates at airports. The UK and EU are scheduled to hold their first bilateral summit since Brexit, with the aim of reaching agreements on trade and security issues. The minister hopes to reduce red tape to lower food prices but also acknowledged that 'nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.' Concerns have been raised by Conservative MPs regarding the UK potentially becoming a 'rule taker' by aligning with EU standards.</p>

          <p>Two volumes of the Zidanku Silk Manuscripts, dating back to around 300BC, have returned to Beijing from the United States after 79 years abroad. These manuscripts, considered the oldest ancient classics found in China, were illegally excavated in 1942 and later acquired by an American collector. The repatriation followed diplomatic efforts after the Smithsonian published a new ethical returns policy. Volume I, a larger work, remains privately owned, with efforts underway to secure its return as well.</p>

The operation was performed on a 41-year-old man who had lost much of his bladder capacity due to cancer treatments. The doctors plan to conduct bladder transplants on four more patients as part of a clinical trial to assess outcomes and complications. The procedure aims to provide an alternative to using bowel tissue, which can lead to complications, and represents a significant advancement in transplant medicine.</p>

          <p>This New York Times guest essay discusses how Desi Arnaz, a Cuban immigrant, challenged racial barriers in 1950s television with "I Love Lucy." Despite initial skepticism from network executives, Arnaz's charm and talent made Ricky Ricardo a beloved character, breaking new ground for Latino representation. Arnaz's success led to innovations in television production and syndication, and he became a prominent Latino entertainment executive. The article argues that Arnaz's story offers valuable lessons for promoting diversity and inclusion in Hollywood today, emphasizing the importance of embracing differences and challenging preconceived notions.</p>
