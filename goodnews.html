          <p>Representative Michael McCaul, a prominent Texas Republican and influential figure in foreign policy, has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, concluding an 11-term career in Congress. Having chaired both the House Homeland Security and Foreign Affairs Committees, McCaul expressed a desire to pursue a new challenge in national security. His tenure was marked by strong advocacy for U.S. support for Ukraine and a multi-year investigation into the Afghanistan withdrawal. McCaul's departure comes amid redistricting efforts in Texas and adds to a growing number of congressional retirements.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has announced the recall of more than 100,000 Paris Hilton Mini Beauty Fridges due to a significant fire and burn risk. The recall affects specific 4-liter and 10-liter models manufactured before August 2024, following at least 27 reports of the units overheating and catching fire. Although no injuries have been reported, consumers are urged to immediately stop using the fridges, unplug them, and contact the importer, Epoca International, for a full refund. The products were sold at major retailers like Walmart and Ross, as well as online.</p>

          <p>A Delta Air Lines flight bound for Boston made a safe emergency landing at Miami International Airport shortly after takeoff on Saturday due to a bird strike. The incident, involving flight DL1300, reportedly affected one of the aircraft's engines, prompting the crew to return to the airport as a precaution. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed the event, and Delta reported that there were no injuries to any passengers or crew members. After a delay, the flight eventually continued its journey and arrived in Boston approximately two hours behind its original schedule.</p>

          <p>England's head cricket coach, Brendon McCullum, anticipates a "short" and straightforward selection meeting for the upcoming Ashes tour of Australia. He indicated that the core of the squad is largely settled, with the main point of discussion being the choice of a second spinner to support Shoaib Bashir. McCullum confirmed that the team will not take a specialist backup wicketkeeper and could include as many as seven seam bowlers in a 17-player group. The squad announcement is expected in late September, following a T20 series against Ireland which McCullum will skip.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles star Saquon Barkley is reportedly building a significant investment portfolio, channeling millions of his NFL earnings into venture capital funds and technology startups. His investments are said to include prominent companies like AI firm Anthropic, Elon Musk's Neuralink, and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund. Adopting a strategy to live off his endorsement deals, Barkley aims to grow his nearly $80 million in career salary and bonuses to create long-term wealth. This financial approach was partly motivated by a severe 2020 injury, which highlighted the finite nature of a professional football career.</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has officially launched her campaign for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party, emphasizing the need for unity to secure a second term in government and defeat the Reform UK party. Speaking in Sunderland, she paid tribute to her predecessor, Angela Rayner, and pledged to continue a strong campaigning role if elected. Phillipson is competing against former Cabinet colleague Lucy Powell for the position, which became vacant after Rayner's resignation over her tax affairs. The contest is viewed by some as a test of the Prime Minister's leadership following recent high-profile government departures.</p>
