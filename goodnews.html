          <p>In a major NHL trade, the Toronto Maple Leafs have sent All-Star forward Mitch Marner to the Vegas Golden Knights. The deal, reportedly a sign-and-trade agreement, sends center Nic Roy to Toronto in return. Marner, a cornerstone of the Maple Leafs for nine seasons, was approaching free agency and now joins a talented Vegas roster that includes stars like Jack Eichel and Mark Stone. This move marks a significant shift for Toronto as they continue their quest for a Stanley Cup, while bolstering the Golden Knights' offensive power. The trade resolves a key offseason question for the Maple Leafs ahead of the free agency period.</p>

          <p>GE Appliances has announced a $490 million investment to move its washer and dryer production from China to a new plant in Kentucky, a move that will create 800 American jobs. An executive from the company stated that while the decision aligns with their long-term strategy of manufacturing products closer to their consumers, recent U.S. trade policies and tariffs on Chinese imports accelerated the timeline. The company plans to cease its manufacturing operations in China once the new Louisville facility becomes fully operational, which is expected by early 2027. This reshoring effort reflects a broader trend among U.S. companies adjusting to the current economic and policy environment.</p>

          <p>The Privy Council in London, the highest court of appeal for the Cayman Islands, has upheld the territory's 2020 Civil Partnership Law, securing legal recognition for same-sex couples. The ruling rejected a challenge that argued the island's governor had overstepped his authority by enacting the law after the local legislature voted it down. This decision is a significant victory for LGBTQ+ rights advocates, who believe it provides legal certainty for same-sex couples on the islands. Campaigners also suggest the judgment could set a positive precedent for similar legal battles in other British overseas territories where LGBTQ+ rights are still being contested.</p>

          <p>Film producer Randall Emmett has been removed from the Writers Guild of America's "strike list" after paying over $630,000 to resolve a long-standing debt. The payment settles a dispute from 2019 where Emmett's former production company failed to pay compensation and benefits to four writers for a television project that was never produced. This resolution means WGA members are now permitted to work with Emmett and his current production company, Convergence Entertainment Group. The move clears a significant professional obstacle for the producer as he seeks to move forward with new projects, including a planned collaboration with director Martin Scorsese.</p>

          <p>The United States is considering a multi-billion dollar missile defense system, dubbed the "Golden Dome," as part of its strategy to counter China's military modernization in the Indo-Pacific. The proposed system would utilize a sophisticated network of satellites and space-based sensors designed to intercept long-range missiles, potentially enhancing U.S. homeland defense. Analysts suggest that if developed, the Golden Dome could serve as a significant deterrent, particularly in a potential conflict scenario involving Taiwan. However, the project faces considerable questions regarding its technological feasibility, overall cost, and the practical challenges of implementing such an advanced and expansive defense shield.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread concern that President Trump's tariffs would trigger a new wave of inflation, U.S. prices have remained relatively stable. Economists point to several short-term strategies that companies have employed to absorb the initial impact of the new trade policies. These tactics include "front-loading" inventory by pre-ordering goods before tariffs took effect, temporarily absorbing the increased costs to avoid alienating customers, and utilizing legal loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay duty payments. While these measures have buffered consumers from immediate price hikes, experts caution that the effects of the tariffs will likely become more apparent in the latter half of the year.

The order cancels a 2004 declaration that froze Syrian government assets but keeps other sanctions in place, including those mandated by Congress under the Caesar Act. The action directs the administration to evaluate further sanctions relief, which could provide leverage in diplomatic talks and open doors for reconstruction and foreign investment as the new transitional government takes hold.</p>
