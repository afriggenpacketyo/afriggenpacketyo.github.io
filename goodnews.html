          <p>NATO's 32 military chiefs held a virtual summit to reaffirm their support for Ukraine and discuss security guarantees as part of a potential peace agreement. The meeting, which included the new Supreme Allied Commander Europe, Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, focused on providing credible commitments to prevent future invasions. These discussions occur as former President Trump engages in diplomatic efforts to broker a settlement between Russia and Ukraine. Russia has criticized the talks, asserting that any security discussions conducted without its participation will not be effective.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports of permanent magnets surged for the second consecutive month, reaching a six-month high of 5,577 tonnes in July. This increase follows a government pledge to expedite export permit approvals for the critical rare earth derivative. Permanent magnets are essential components for various high-tech products, including electric vehicles, wind turbines, and military hardware. The European Union remains the largest importer, with Germany and the United States also significantly increasing their purchases, highlighting global dependence on China's supply chain for these materials.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department has dismantled a major cargo theft ring that operated out of two hardware stores in Montebello and Huntington Park. Authorities recovered an estimated $4.5 million in stolen goods, including power tools and e-bikes from brands like Dyson and DeWalt, which were pilfered from trains, trucks, and cargo ships. The owner of the business, Dojoon Park, has been arrested on suspicion of receiving stolen property and faces significant prison time. The investigation, a collaboration with Union Pacific and Port Police, highlights a growing sophistication in organized retail crime and its impact on supply chains.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has announced it will stop offering volume discounts for enterprise-level purchases of its Microsoft 365 software suite and other cloud applications, starting November 1st. The change, which affects new and renewing agreements, is intended to create a more consistent and transparent pricing model across all purchasing channels. Analysts suggest this move was likely factored into the company's strong revenue guidance for the fiscal year. While some partners estimate the change could result in price hikes of 6% to 12% for affected clients, it also aims to generate more revenue per user. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several communities in Southern California, including Orange County, are banning the sale and possession of synthetic kratom products due to growing public health concerns. Kratom is an herbal supplement derived from a Southeast Asian tree, but officials are specifically targeting products containing concentrated levels of 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH), an alkaloid that can produce opioid-like effects. The FDA has not approved kratom for any use and has recommended that 7-OH be classified as a restrictive illegal drug. In the absence of state or federal regulation, local governments are taking action to address the potential for abuse and the marketing of these products to minors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Layoffs for nearly 300 Los Angeles city employees have been avoided thanks to cost-cutting agreements reached with two major unions. The Los Angeles Police Protective League agreed to a voluntary program where members can take time off in exchange for previously worked overtime hours, saving 222 civilian LAPD jobs. Additionally, the Engineers and Architects Association authorized a deal for its members to take up to five unpaid vacation days, saving another 63 positions. These deals significantly reduce the number of layoffs proposed by Mayor Karen Bass to address a billion-dollar budget shortfall.</p>

          <p>Actress Suranne Jones, star of the new Netflix political thriller "Hostage," says that playing the role of a British prime minister has changed her perception of politics. In the series, her character's husband is kidnapped, forcing her into an alliance with the French President, played by Julie Delpy. To prepare for the role, Jones conducted extensive research, including visiting the House of Commons and speaking with former prime ministers, which gave her a deeper understanding of the personal cost of holding a powerful position. Both Jones and the show's writer insist the series is entertainment set in a political world, rather than a direct commentary on current events.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Friar, announced that the company achieved its first-ever $1 billion revenue month in July, highlighting its rapid growth since the launch of ChatGPT. Despite this financial milestone, Friar emphasized that the company's biggest challenge is the "voracious" demand for computing power required to train and run its AI models. This immense need for GPUs and other resources is driving OpenAI to seek new partners like Oracle and Coreweave to diversify its supply, though Microsoft remains a crucial, intertwined partner. The company anticipates spending trillions on data centers to meet future demand for its technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to U.S. fund manager Franklin Templeton, Hong Kong's stock market rally still has potential for further growth due to attractive valuations and reduced uncertainty regarding U.S. tariffs. A portfolio manager at the firm noted that while the Hang Seng Index has surged over 25% this year, its price-to-earnings ratio of around 10.8 remains reasonable compared to U.S. markets. The firm believes that diminishing risks from trade tensions will improve the predictability of corporate earnings, maintaining a constructive outlook on both Hong Kong and mainland Chinese stocks.
