          <p>Intel's stock surged following reports that the Trump administration is discussing taking a stake in the company to support its domestic manufacturing efforts. As the only U.S. company capable of making the most advanced chips domestically, this move aligns with the administration's goal of increasing high-tech production in the United States. The potential government investment would help fund Intel's new factories in Ohio, a project that has faced recent slowdowns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Palantir's Explosive Growth Driven by Government Contracts and Retail Investor Interest</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 13:38:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data analytics company Palantir has seen its stock surge over 1,700% since its 2020 public debut, reaching a market valuation of over $430 billion. A significant driver of this growth has been lucrative government contracts, particularly with the U.S. military, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. The company's astronomical rise has also been fueled by strong interest from retail investors, pushing its valuation to levels that far exceed those of tech giants with much larger revenues.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in seven years, boys in the UK have achieved a higher percentage of top A-level grades (A* or A) than girls, with a narrow margin of 28.4% to 28.2%. This shift is partly attributed to the growing popularity of STEM subjects like mathematics, which are taken by significantly more boys and tend to yield more high grades. While girls still make up the majority of A-level entrants overall, the trend reversal has sparked discussions about subject choices and academic support for both genders.</p>

          <p>A Glasgow schoolgirl, Rebecca Young, has been recognized by Time magazine as one of its "girls of the year" for inventing a solar-powered blanket to help homeless people stay warm. She designed the device at age 12, and it was later turned into a working prototype by an engineering firm, with dozens distributed to a local homeless charity. For her inspiring invention, Rebecca was honored by Time and its partner Lego, which created a mini-figure in her likeness.</p>

          <p>While President Trump has taken federal control of Washington D.C.'s police, legal experts suggest it would be far more difficult to do so in other cities like Los Angeles or Chicago. D.C.'s unique status as a federal district gives the president direct authority that does not extend to states, where governors command their own National Guard units. Any attempt to deploy federal troops for domestic law enforcement in a state would face significant legal challenges under the Posse Comitatus Act.</p>
