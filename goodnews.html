          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced in a memo that the central bank plans to reduce its staff by 10% over the next few years. This reduction will involve offering a voluntary deferred resignation program to eligible employees. The move aims to consolidate functions, modernize practices, and ensure the Fed is appropriately sized to meet its mission. The announcement comes amid pressure from the Trump administration for cost cuts across civil service agencies, though Powell's memo did not explicitly mention this as a factor.</p>

          <p>A military parade is planned in Washington, D.C., to mark the Army's 250th anniversary, coinciding with President Trump's birthday. The parade is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million and will involve over 100 vehicles, thousands of soldiers, and potentially 50 helicopters. Abrams tanks will also be featured, with metal plates laid down to protect the streets. While the White House claims the cost will be shared, the event has drawn criticism from Democrats who view it as a wasteful display of ego.</p>

          <p>The World Bank announced it has cleared Syria's $15.5 million debt following payments from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, making the country eligible for grants to support reconstruction and economic recovery.

The Syrian government has also signed an $800 million deal with DP World to develop the port of Tartus, signaling growing confidence among international investors. However, significant challenges remain, including widespread infrastructure damage and ongoing sectarian violence.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett questioned the Trump administration's stance on following federal court precedent during oral arguments related to birthright citizenship. Barrett pressed U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer on whether the administration would respect lower court rulings, specifically regarding a Second Circuit Court of Appeals decision. Her remarks sparked mixed reactions, with some liberals praising her for challenging the administration and conservatives criticizing her perceived lack of loyalty to President Trump. The court's ruling could hinge on the votes of Justices Gorsuch and Barrett.</p>
