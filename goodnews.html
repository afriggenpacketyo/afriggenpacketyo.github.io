          <p>Actress Drew Barrymore revealed that her daughter demonstrated remarkable quick thinking during a serious e-bike accident in France. After suffering a severe injury that ripped her elbow open while mountain biking, the daughter used her own bra to create a makeshift tourniquet, an action that likely prevented a more severe outcome. Barrymore shared the story on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," expressing her amazement at her daughter's presence of mind during the frightening ordeal. The incident, which required days of emergency room visits, ultimately ended with the daughter making a full recovery, highlighting her resilience in a critical situation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Ian Goldin, a professor of globalisation at the University of Oxford, the concept of globalisation is far from dead; instead, it is alive and well, particularly in Asia. He asserts that the region's rapid economic growth and poverty reduction are direct results of its integration into the global economy. Goldin suggests that globalisation is becoming more fragmented and regional, with its center of gravity shifting towards Asia as the U.S. partially withdraws. He also notes that while the benefits of interconnectedness are growing, so are the associated risks, such as pandemics, which are also a manifestation of a globalized world.

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz secured his sixth Grand Slam title by defeating his rival Jannik Sinner in a compelling four-set final at the US Open. The Spanish player's dominant performance, particularly his strong serving, allowed him to reclaim the championship he first won in 2022 and regain the world number one ranking from Sinner. The match, which was delayed due to heightened security for President Trump's attendance, marked the third major final between the two players in 2025. At just 22 years old, Alcaraz is now the second-youngest man in the Open era to achieve six Grand Slam victories, underscoring his position at the top of men's tennis.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that Hong Kong is experiencing a significant economic and social revival, with tourism and business travel returning to pre-pandemic levels. The city's financial markets are booming, positioning it to potentially lead the world in IPO fundraising this year, a sign of its unique capitalist status within China. However, the article contends that to secure its future, Hong Kong must actively work to cement its role as a global financial hub amid ongoing geopolitical tensions. It suggests that Beijing should encourage more international engagement and support the city as a base for multilateral institutions to preserve its distinct advantages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Much of California is set to experience a significant drop in temperatures, with coastal areas forecasted to be 5 to 15 degrees below normal for this time of year. The shift brings sweater weather to the Bay Area, which already endured an unusually cold summer, while offering some relief from recent heat waves in Los Angeles. A thick marine layer is expected to cover Southern California, bringing potential drizzle, while parts of Northern California may see scattered showers. This unusual weather pattern is attributed to an upper-level low-pressure system moving in from the Pacific, disrupting the state's typical post-Labor Day heat.</p>

          <p>The German national football team secured a much-needed 3-1 victory against Northern Ireland in their 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign. The win in Cologne brought a sense of relief for coach Julian Nagelsmann's side, which had been criticized after a disappointing performance against Slovakia in their previous match. After a sloppy first half, key substitutions and a world-class free-kick goal from Florian Wirtz helped turn the game in Germany's favor. The result puts Germany back on track in their qualifying group, with a crucial final match against Slovakia in November now looming as a decisive contest for topping the group.</p>

          <p>A total lunar eclipse captivated observers around the world, creating a celestial phenomenon commonly known as a "Blood Moon." The striking event occurs when the Moon passes directly into the Earth's shadow, or umbra, causing it to take on a dramatic reddish-orange hue. This color is the result of sunlight filtering through Earth's atmosphere and scattering onto the lunar surface. The spectacle was visible in its totality across numerous countries, providing a visually stunning display for astronomers and casual sky-gazers alike. The event highlights the predictable yet awe-inspiring mechanics of our solar system.</p>

          <p>In response to President Trump's threats of a federal crackdown on crime and immigration, churches across Chicago are becoming centers for community support and calm resistance. Faith leaders are using their pulpits to quell fears, inform residents of their rights, and urge preparedness in Black and Latino communities, where trust in law enforcement is often fragile. Many local leaders and residents oppose the intervention, arguing it is an unnecessary and inflammatory action. Instead of calling for a military presence, church leaders like Rev. Marshall Hatch are advocating for more community resources to address the root causes of violence, promoting a message of resilience against what they term authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>Rising English cricket star Jacob Bethell scored his first professional century in a one-day international against South Africa, a milestone that intensifies the discussion about his role in the upcoming Ashes series. The talented 21-year-old all-format batter has long been tipped for success but had not previously recorded a century in any professional format. While some analysts believe his aggressive, free-scoring style is ideal for Australian pitches, others question his experience in long-form red-ball cricket. This performance strengthens his case, but it remains uncertain if it will be enough to force England's selectors to change their established lineup for the crucial Test series.</p>

He warned that historical examples show that when political leaders take control of central banks, it often leads to inflation and economic hardship. The statement underscores a traditional view of central bank autonomy, even as questions persist about the White House's influence over the institution. (not investment advice)</p>
