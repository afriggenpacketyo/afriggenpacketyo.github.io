          <p>Eric Trump has suggested that he or another member of the Trump family might consider a presidential campaign after his father's term concludes. In an interview, he stated that the political path "would be an easy one" if he chose to pursue it, citing his dissatisfaction with many current politicians. However, he also expressed hesitation, questioning whether he would want to subject his own children to the "brutality" his family has experienced over the last decade. While prominent Republicans like JD Vance and Marco Rubio are seen as likely 2028 contenders, Eric Trump's comments keep the possibility of a continued Trump political dynasty in the public conversation.</p>

          <p>The Eastern Kentucky Remembrance Project (EKRP) is a community coalition dedicated to honoring the memory of Black individuals who were victims of racial terror lynchings in the region. The group recently installed a historical marker for Fred Shannon, a Black musician who was lynched by a mob in 1924 after being falsely accused of murder. By collecting soil from lynching sites and placing markers, the EKRP aims to confront a painful and often overlooked part of local history. The project has personal significance for many members, some of whom have discovered their own relatives were victims, highlighting the importance of acknowledging these atrocities to ensure they are not forgotten.</p>

          <p>Throughout June, communities across the globe have participated in Pride Month events, celebrating the LGBTQ community and advocating for equal rights and inclusion. This article provides a photo-essay of these celebrations, from Washington, D.C., to Kathmandu, showcasing the vibrant parades and festivals. Pride Month commemorates the 1969 Stonewall Uprising in New York City, a pivotal moment that is widely considered the start of the modern LGBTQ rights movement. First federally recognized in the U.S. in 1999, the annual event continues to be a powerful symbol of both progress and the ongoing struggle for equality, with major marches and gatherings taking place worldwide.</p>

          <p>In an unusual business move, Trader Joe's has opened a new store in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, directly across the street from one of its existing locations that has been operating since 1973. The company initially planned to close the older, smaller store but decided to keep both open, citing the tremendous business in the area. The new branch is about 40% larger and features a much-desired underground parking garage, addressing the cramped conditions of the original lot. While some customers have quickly embraced the new store's space and convenience, others remain loyal to the cozy, familiar atmosphere of the older location, creating a unique side-by-side grocery shopping dynamic.</p>

          <h2>Commentary: The Spirit of Pride Lies in Diversity, Not in Respectability Politics</h2>

          <p>This opinion piece argues against the idea that the LGBTQ+ community should police its more flamboyant members to gain broader acceptance, a concept known as respectability politics. The author criticizes conservative gay figures who attempt to create a divide by defining what constitutes a "normal gay," suggesting this approach betrays the movement's history. The article emphasizes that the fight for LGBTQ+ rights was started by drag queens and gender-nonconforming individuals at Stonewall and that the movement's strength has always been its diversity. True progress, the author contends, comes from celebrating this diversity and rejecting attempts to sanitize the community for mainstream approval, not from internal division.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the case of Elmer "Geronimo" Pratt, a Black Panther Party leader convicted in 1972 for a murder his lawyer, Johnnie Cochran Jr., was convinced he did not commit. Pratt maintained his innocence, claiming he was framed by law enforcement as part of the FBI's COINTELPRO program to neutralize Black nationalist groups. He was ultimately exonerated after 27 years when it was revealed that prosecutors had hidden key evidence, including the fact that their star witness was a police informant. The case, which Cochran called a "twilight zone of deceit," haunted him for his entire career and stands as a stark example of official corruption and the lengths to which authorities went to crush perceived subversives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant local political upset, voters in the conservative stronghold of Huntington Beach, California, overwhelmingly passed two ballot measures to protect their public libraries. The measures successfully dismantled a controversial parent review board that would have controlled children's book selections and blocked the potential privatization of the library system. These policies had been pushed by a city council dominated by a MAGA-aligned supermajority. The victory for the grassroots "Protect HB" coalition, which brought together residents from across the political spectrum, is being seen as a powerful rebuke of extremist politics and a hopeful sign that such movements can be defeated even in deeply conservative areas.</p>

Rauhin, a 24-year-old female, and her three offspring left from Adventure World amusement park in Wakayama Prefecture for the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding. Their departure marks a significant moment for the zoo, which has had a successful joint breeding program with China since 1994, raising 17 cubs. The two remaining pandas in Japan, located at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo, are also scheduled to return to China by next February, potentially ending an era of panda diplomacy between the two nations.</p>

          <p>President Trump is navigating a pivotal week, balancing major domestic policy pushes with critical foreign policy developments. The administration is celebrating a favorable Supreme Court ruling that limits nationwide injunctions against his executive orders and touting a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. However, significant challenges remain, including the uncertain fate of his "big, beautiful bill" in the Senate and a looming deadline to finalize numerous international trade deals. The confluence of these high-stakes events at home and abroad could prove to be a defining moment for his presidency, with immense pressure to deliver on his legislative and economic promises.

          <p>In a farewell address to the Social Democratic Party (SPD) congress in Berlin, former German Chancellor Olaf Scholz defended his government's policies while also being self-critical. He warned against illusions about Vladimir Putin's intentions in Ukraine, stating the Russian president aims to expand his conquests and must not be allowed to change borders by force. Scholz affirmed the decision to strengthen Germany's military (the Bundeswehr) and enhance cooperation within NATO as a necessary response to this turning point. He also called for greater solidarity within Germany, suggesting that high earners should contribute more to finance the country's defense capabilities instead of discussing tax cuts.</p>
