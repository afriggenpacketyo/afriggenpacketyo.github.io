          <p>FedEx reported strong quarterly earnings and revenue, surpassing analysts' estimates, and announced achieving its $4 billion cost-cutting goal while aiming for an additional $1 billion in savings next fiscal year. CEO Raj Subramaniam highlighted the company's successful structural cost reduction amid ongoing challenges, expressing confidence in transformation initiatives focused on network integration and cost reduction. Despite the positive results, FedEx stock experienced a slight drop in after-hours trading due to current-quarter profit guidance that fell slightly short of Wall Street expectations. The company's fiscal 2026 guidance includes further cost-cutting reductions, and FedEx is proceeding with plans to spin off its Freight division into two publicly traded companies.</p>

          <p>Anthropic, an AI company, secured a legal victory in a copyright case, with a judge ruling that using legally purchased books to train its AI model, Claude, did not violate U.S. copyright law. The judge determined that this use of copyrighted books was "quintessentially transformative" and aligned with "fair use" doctrine, likening it to a reader aspiring to be a writer. However, the court found that Anthropic may have infringed copyright laws by downloading millions of pirated books, leading to a separate trial scheduled for December. This ruling sets a potentially important precedent for similar disputes involving AI companies and copyright infringement.</p>

The summit, scaled back to accommodate Trump's schedule, includes discussions on increasing defense investment and supporting Ukraine, following recent Russian attacks. Germany has committed to meeting the 3.5% GDP defense spending target by 2029, driven by concerns over Russian aggression.</p>
