          <p>Conservation scientists are analyzing the DNA of the Druids Oak, an 800-year-old tree in Buckinghamshire, to uncover the genetic secrets behind its remarkable longevity and resilience. The project, involving The Woodland Trust and the Arboricultural Association, aims to understand how ancient oaks survive threats like climate change and disease. Researchers hope this genetic information will help in selecting the most robust oak trees for future planting, aiding in the restoration of Britain's woodlands. These iconic trees are vital ecological keystones, supporting over 2,300 species and playing a crucial role in biodiversity.</p>

          <p>In Memphis, Tennessee, radio host Bev Johnson is being celebrated for her 42-year career at WDIA, the first all-Black radio station in the United States. Since its inception in 1947, WDIA has served as a vital cultural and informational hub for the Black community, providing news ignored by mainstream outlets and promoting civil rights activism. Johnson, affectionately known as "your girlfriend" to her listeners, continues this legacy by hosting experts who offer free advice on legal and medical issues. The station played a pivotal role in saving the Lorraine Motel, where Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, which is now the National Civil Rights Museum.</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams, aged 45, achieved her first women's doubles victory at the US Open since 2014, teaming up with 22-year-old Leylah Fernandez. The pair defeated the sixth-seeded duo of Lyudmyla Kichenok and Ellen Perez in straight sets, 7-6 (4), 6-3, to the delight of a supportive crowd at Louis Armstrong Stadium. This win marks a significant milestone for Williams, who has 14 major doubles championships with her sister Serena but had not won a women's doubles match at any Grand Slam since 2018. Williams praised her partner's determined mentality, comparing it favorably to playing alongside her sister.</p>

          <p>Beginning in January 2026, the National Health Service (NHS) will offer a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children in England and Wales. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months of age, combined with the existing MMR jab for measles, mumps, and rubella. This public health initiative aims to protect children from the rare but severe complications of chickenpox, such as encephalitis and stroke. Officials also hope the program will reduce the economic impact of the illness, which currently costs the UK an estimated £24 million annually in lost productivity from parents taking time off work.</p>

          <p>Mark Teixeira, a former Major League Baseball first baseman who played for teams including the New York Yankees and Texas Rangers, has announced his candidacy for Congress. The 45-year-old conservative is running as a Republican in Texas's 21st Congressional District, a heavily Republican area. Teixeira stated his campaign aims to defend President Trump's "America First" agenda and individual liberty. His entry into politics follows that of another former baseball star, Steve Garvey, who recently ran for a U.S. Senate seat in California, though Teixeira is running in a district with a much stronger Republican voting record.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged a former Department of Justice employee with misdemeanor assault after a grand jury declined to indict him on a more serious felony charge. The man, Sean Charles Dunn, is accused of throwing a "Subway" sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection officer in Washington, D.C., on August 10. The incident occurred while federal authorities were deployed in the city by President Trump to address what he described as a crime problem. This marks the second recent case where D.C. prosecutors have failed to secure a grand jury indictment for alleged assaults on federal officers.</p>

Zhao suggested that Hong Kong's government has shown a clear willingness to support the sector but must act quickly to realize its potential. One key recommendation he made was to expand the limited range of cryptocurrencies currently permitted for trading on licensed exchanges in the city. (not investment advice)</p>

After her match, Osaka also commented on the controversy involving Jelena Ostapenko's remarks to Taylor Townsend, calling the comments ill-timed and particularly offensive given the context of race in tennis.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Trump administration official Kari Lake cannot legally fire the director of Voice of America (VOA) on her own authority. U.S. Senior District Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth stated that by law, such a removal requires the backing of a congressionally established advisory panel, which currently lacks the members to form a quorum. The ruling is a significant check on the administration's efforts to reshape the federally funded international broadcaster, which has seen its operations dramatically curtailed under Lake. The judge found the attempt to remove Director Michael Abramowitz did not comply with statutory requirements designed to insulate the network from political pressure.</p>

A Chinese film depicting Japanese wartime atrocities, "Dead to Rights," has become a massive box office success, reigniting memories of historical trauma for millions of viewers. Simultaneously, Chinese tourism to Japan has surged, with nearly a million visitors in July alone, making China the top source of inbound tourists for Japan. This paradox illustrates the deep-seated nature of the relationship, which is shaped by a mixture of historical wounds, geopolitical tensions, economic interdependence, and a strong cultural affinity between the two nations.</p>
