          <h2>Understanding the 6-Month Rule for Reverse Mortgages and Its Impact on Heirs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 12:55:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a detailed explanation of the "6-month rule" associated with reverse mortgages, which dictates a critical timeline for heirs after a borrower dies or permanently moves out of their home. Following such an event, lenders issue a "Due and Payable" notice, granting the family six months to either repay the loan balance in full or sell the property to satisfy the debt. The rule emphasizes the necessity of proactive estate planning for homeowners with reverse mortgages, as their heirs must be prepared to act decisively within this window to avoid potential foreclosure on the family property.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has arrived in the United Kingdom for his second official state visit, an unprecedented honor for a U.S. president, hosted by King Charles III and Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The visit's agenda includes traditional royal ceremonies at Windsor Castle and key diplomatic meetings, where topics such as trade deals and sanctions against Russia are expected to be discussed. U.S. officials have announced that the visit will feature the signing of over $10 billion in new energy and technology agreements.

          <p>Shares of Webtoon Entertainment experienced a significant surge, climbing over 35% after the company announced a major new partnership with Disney. The deal involves creating a dedicated digital comics platform for Disney's highly popular Marvel and Star Wars franchises, consolidating over 35,000 comics under a single subscription service. As part of the agreement, Disney will also acquire a 2% equity stake in Webtoon. Analysts view this expanded partnership as a major validation of Webtoon's platform, suggesting it will provide a stable new revenue stream and attract other major intellectual property holders.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced the lifting of travel restrictions on Hungarian citizens that were imposed in 2021, signaling a warming of relations between Washington and Budapest. The previous restrictions, which limited the validity of travel authorizations under the Visa Waiver Program, were enacted due to security concerns over Hungary's policy of granting citizenship to individuals born abroad. Following steps taken by Hungary to address these vulnerabilities, the U.S. is restoring the standard two-year validity period for travel authorizations. President Trump has previously praised Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, contrasting with the colder relationship under the prior administration.</p>

          <p>Dallas Wings star Paige Bueckers has been named the WNBA Rookie of the Year, receiving 70 out of 72 possible votes from a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters. The former UConn standout and number one overall draft pick had one of the most impressive debut seasons in the league's history. Despite her team's poor record, Bueckers was a consistent bright spot, averaging 19.2 points, 5.4 assists, and 1.6 steals per game. Her performance established her as a dominant new force in the league and made the award decision a near-formality for voters.</p>

          <p>Recent Wall Street research has reaffirmed positive outlooks for several major companies, including Amazon, Goldman Sachs, and Microsoft. Analysts at Truist raised their price target for Amazon, citing credit card data that suggests North American revenue is tracking ahead of consensus estimates. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo increased its price target for Goldman Sachs, highlighting strength in the capital markets and M&A activity. Microsoft also received positive attention after announcing a 10% increase to its quarterly dividend, which analysts at Morgan Stanley believe contributes to a strong total return profile for investors.

          <p>For the first time since it sank in 1916, divers have successfully recovered artifacts from the wreckage of the HMHS Britannic, the sister ship of the Titanic. The vessel, which was serving as a hospital ship during World War I, struck a mine and sank in the Aegean Sea. An 11-member deep-sea diving team retrieved several items, including the ship's bell, a navigation light, and silver-plated first-class trays. The wreck lies at a depth of nearly 400 feet, making the operation technically challenging. The recovered artifacts will undergo conservation and become part of a new Museum of Underwater Antiquities in Greece.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, President Trump's credible threat to allow TikTok to be banned in the U.S. was the key factor that motivated China to agree to a deal framework. Bessent stated that the president made it clear he prioritized national security over ensuring a deal, which "turned the tide" in the negotiations with the app's parent company, ByteDance. While the commercial terms of a deal have reportedly been in place for months, the administration's hardline stance on a potential shutdown of the app's U.S. operations ultimately pushed the negotiations forward. A final agreement is still pending ahead of the September 17 deadline.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With average mortgage rates recently dropping to their lowest point since October 2024, many homeowners are considering whether now is the right time to refinance. Experts suggest homeowners should evaluate their current interest rate, with those above 7% potentially benefiting most from refinancing in the current climate. Another key consideration is the immediate financial need; refinancing can lower monthly payments or allow homeowners to consolidate high-interest debt using their home's equity. While rates may continue to fall, financial advisors warn against trying to perfectly time the market, as the cost of waiting could outweigh the potential for future savings.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sources familiar with the negotiations report that technology giant Oracle and private equity firm Silver Lake are central to the consortium that would take over TikTok's U.S. operations under a deal framework between the U.S. and China. The precise structure is still being finalized, but it involves a mix of new and existing investors to allow the social media app to continue operating in the country. This development follows years of national security concerns and a law requiring its China-based parent company, ByteDance, to divest. Oracle has previously partnered with TikTok to manage U.S. user data on its domestic servers.</p>
