          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a conservative candidate, has won Poland's presidential runoff election against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski in a close race. The outcome suggests Poland will likely take a more nationalist direction, with Nawrocki backed by former U.S. President Donald Trump. While most day-to-day power rests with the prime minister, the president influences foreign policy and can veto legislation. Nawrocki, a historian known for nationalist views and removing Soviet monuments, succeeds Andrzej Duda, potentially hindering Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda.</p>

          <p>Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson, also known as Soul Patts, and its affiliate Brickworks announced a merger valued at A$14 billion ($9 billion), causing their shares to surge. The merged entity will be listed in Sydney and will hold A$13.1 billion in assets across real estate, private equity, and credit. The merger unwinds a 56-year mutual ownership designed to fend off hostile takeovers, which critics argued suppressed shareholder value and corporate transparency. Brickworks shareholders are set to receive an implied value of A$30.28 per share, reflecting a 10.1% premium over the stock's closing price last Friday (not investment advice).</p>
