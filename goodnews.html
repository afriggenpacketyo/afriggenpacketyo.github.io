          <p>The U.S. Army's 250th birthday parade, while initially anticipated as a grand military spectacle, unfolded as a more subdued historical presentation.  The event, intended to showcase military might, instead presented a chronological overview of the Army's history.  Concerns about potential politicization of the military were largely absent, as the parade focused on themes of service and duty. The event contrasted sharply with the use of National Guard troops in Los Angeles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Given economic uncertainty, the traditional 4% rule for retirement withdrawals may be insufficient. Vanguard suggests two alternative strategies: the bucket strategy and the glide path strategy. The bucket strategy involves dividing assets into categories based on spending timelines (short-term, medium-term, long-term).  This allows for customized risk management and flexibility in meeting various spending needs. (not investment advice)</p>
