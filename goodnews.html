          <p>Texas Republican Representative Michael McCaul stated he will vote for the Senate's proposed spending bill, emphasizing its provisions for border security, defense, and tax cut extensions. In an interview, McCaul dismissed concerns about the bill increasing the national deficit, arguing that dynamic scoring, which predicts increased revenue from tax cuts, was not considered by the Congressional Budget Office. He also addressed national security, asserting that a recent military operation against Iran has made the Middle East safer and that recently arrested Iranian nationals in the U.S. highlight the need for vigilance. McCaul expressed confidence that fiscally conservative colleagues will ultimately support the legislation.</p>

Eubank Jr won the first fight by unanimous decision, extending his professional record in a match that drew significant attention due to the legacy of their fathers, Chris Eubank Sr and Nigel Benn, who fought 35 years prior. The initial fight took place at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, but the venue for the September rematch has not yet been confirmed. The event marks another chapter in the celebrated family rivalry.</p>

          <p>The racing film "F1 The Movie," starring Brad Pitt and directed by Joseph Kosinski, secured the top spot at the box office with a $55.6 million domestic debut, marking the biggest opening weekend for an Apple-produced film. The movie, which also earned $88 million internationally, exceeded expectations but still faces a long road to profitability given its budget of over $200 million. Its success was bolstered by strong promotion for Imax screenings and positive audience reception, earning an "A" grade from CinemaScore. This hit provides a significant theatrical victory for Apple, whose previous high-profile films have struggled to attract large audiences.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump celebrated the Senate's procedural advancement of his signature legislative package, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill," thanking key conservative senators who initially had reservations. After late-night negotiations, holdouts like Senator Ron Johnson flipped their votes, allowing the bill to move forward, though they have not committed to final passage. The legislation, which combines permanent tax cuts with increased defense and border security funding, now faces a lengthy amendment process. Democrats have forced a full reading of the nearly 1,000-page bill, a tactic that could take over 15 hours and delay further votes.</p>

          <p>A new biography by Sam Tanenhaus, "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America," examines the profound influence of William F. Buckley Jr. on the modern conservative movement. The book traces a direct line from Buckley's intellectual leadership to key political figures like Barry Goldwater, Ronald Reagan, and ultimately, Donald Trump. Tanenhaus argues that Buckley invented a form of cultural politics through his magazine, National Review, and TV show, "Firing Line," which reshaped the Republican Party. While Buckley was known for his intellectualism and civility, the biography concludes that he paved the way for the brasher, more populist conservatism embodied by Trump today.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government is now in a better position to pass its flagship welfare reform bill after making significant concessions to avert a large-scale backbench rebellion. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the initial rollout was mishandled but said the government strengthened the plans after listening to concerns about potential harm to disabled people. Key changes include limiting cuts to Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants only and ensuring Universal Credit's health-related component rises with inflation. Rebel MPs have indicated they are now likely to support the bill, though the episode has raised questions about the prime minister's ability to manage his party.</p>

Gunn, who is also the CEO of DC Studios, stated he wanted a Superman who was not indestructible and could be seen to bleed, making him more "down-to-Earth." Actor David Corenswet, who plays the titular role, emphasized that his character's central struggle is loneliness and a desire to be part of humanity despite his alien origins. The film, which features a budget of over $225 million, seeks to honor the legacy of Christopher Reeve's portrayal while offering a fresh, modern take on the Man of Steel.</p>

The potential move, which would have risked 1,300 jobs, was reportedly considered to avoid US tariffs on car imports. After an urgent meeting, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said he was reassured of Lotus's commitment to its UK operations. The company had previously paused production due to the 25% US tariffs, which are set to be reduced to 10% on Monday as part of a new UK-US trade agreement.</p>

While human research is still limited, animal and test-tube studies have shown promising effects, and diets high in antioxidants are generally linked to better cardiovascular health. Dietitians recommend incorporating fresh oregano into meals for the most flavor and potential benefits, suggesting it can be easily added to dishes like saut√©ed vegetables, eggs, soups, and homemade dressings.

          <p>Wimbledon will feature 23 British players in the men's and women's singles tournaments, the largest home contingent since 1984, reflecting a growing depth of talent in the nation's tennis ranks. Jack Draper, ranked fourth in the world, leads the British hopes in the men's draw, while Emma Raducanu returns as the British women's number one. The strong representation is attributed to a combination of factors, including the inspiration of Andy Murray, improved training facilities, and a healthy rivalry among a new generation of players. The home presence is further bolstered by numerous wildcards awarded to up-and-coming and veteran players.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Urges Supermarkets to Promote Healthier Food Choices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 09:42:04 EDT</div>

          <p>The UK government has announced new plans requiring supermarkets and food manufacturers to make it easier for customers to purchase healthy food. Under the strategy, retailers will partner with the government to encourage healthier shopping habits, with potential methods including promotions, loyalty point incentives, or altered store layouts. The policy, which will involve retailers reporting on healthy food sales, aims to tackle rising obesity rates and relieve pressure on the NHS. While the Health Secretary framed it as a collaborative approach, the opposition criticized the plan as a "nanny state" measure, arguing it is not the government's role to dictate consumer purchases.</p>

          <h2>Senate Advances Trump's Sweeping Tax and Spending Bill in Key Procedural Vote</h2>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly advanced President Trump's signature "big, beautiful bill" in a 51-49 procedural vote after hours of intense negotiations to secure support from conservative holdouts. The legislation, a top priority for the president, combines the extension of his 2017 tax cuts with increased spending on the military and border security. The bill now moves to a lengthy debate and amendment process, known as a vote-a-rama, with Democrats forcing a full reading of the 940-page text. Despite its advancement, the bill faces fierce opposition from Democrats and criticism from some, including Elon Musk, over its potential impact on the national debt and green energy.</p>
