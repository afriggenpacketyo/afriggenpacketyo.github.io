        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has approved amendments to remove the $25,000 minimum equity rule for pattern day traders, a change now pending SEC approval. This rule, established in 2001 during the dot-com bubble, required traders making four or more day trades in five days to maintain this balance. The new proposal replaces the fixed minimum with an intraday margin rule based on the positions taken, reflecting advancements in technology and market access. This regulatory shift could make active trading more accessible to smaller retail investors and potentially boost activity for brokerage firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the average 30-year mortgage rate has fallen to a three-year low of 6.13%. For a homeowner with a $250,000 mortgage, this translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $1,520. This is about $150 less per month compared to the rates seen at the beginning of the year, which were above 7%. Over the full 30-year term of the loan, this lower rate could save a borrower around $54,000 in total interest payments. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retired Philadelphia Eagles star Jason Kelce has voiced his strong dislike for the NFL's expanded jersey number rules, particularly for defensive players. Speaking on his "New Heights" podcast, Kelce expressed frustration that numbers no longer signify a player's position as they traditionally did. He stated a preference for the old system where he could identify a player's role simply by their jersey number. Kelce specifically lamented seeing defensive linemen and linebackers wearing single-digit numbers, arguing that players at the line of scrimmage should wear "big" numbers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are studying leucovorin, a generic drug derived from folic acid, as a potential treatment for some children with autism, particularly those with speech difficulties. The theory suggests some children have a blockage preventing folate from reaching the brain, which leucovorin can bypass. While several small, controlled studies have shown positive effects on speech, researchers emphasize that more funding and larger clinical trials are needed for FDA approval. The drug is currently available off-label, offering hope to families, but challenges remain regarding funding for research on this inexpensive, non-patentable medicine.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting at the UN General Assembly, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised U.S. President Donald Trump, who signaled a significant shift in his position on the war with Russia. Trump posted on social media that he now believes Ukraine, with European support, is in a position to "WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form." This marks a dramatic pivot from his previous suggestions that Ukraine would need to cede territory for peace. While Zelenskyy described the change as a "game changer," Ukrainian officials remain cautiously optimistic, emphasizing that concrete actions must follow the new rhetoric.</p>

          <h2>Three Key Questions for Homebuyers to Consider After Federal Reserve Rate Cut</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage rates near a three-year low following a Federal Reserve rate cut, prospective homebuyers are advised to consider several key questions before entering the market. Buyers should first determine the actual interest rate they are eligible for, as it can vary based on credit score and lender. Secondly, they should explore alternatives like mortgage points or adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) that could secure an even lower rate. Finally, they must weigh the risk of waiting for rates to fall further against the possibility of them rising again, as has happened in the recent past. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A number of retired professional athletes and coaches are entering the political arena by running for seats in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Among the hopefuls are former New York Yankees first baseman Mark Teixeira, who is running for a House seat in Texas, and former NFL kicker Jay Feely, seeking a House seat in Arizona. Additionally, former college football coach Derek Dooley is competing for a Senate seat in Georgia. While name recognition can be an advantage, a successful sports career does not guarantee victory, as demonstrated by several recent losses by athlete candidates.</p>

The decision was attributed to changing market conditions and a desire to align its product portfolio with customer needs and strategic goals. While production of the ZDX will end, another Honda EV built by GM, the Prologue, will continue to be assembled in Mexico. Honda plans to launch a new all-electric Acura RSX in 2026, which will be produced at its own EV facility in Ohio.</p>

          <p>As families gather for Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, traditional recipes are being reinterpreted by a new generation. Comedian Robin Weiss has published a cookbook dedicated to modern variations of kugel, a classic Jewish casserole, in honor of her late grandmother, a Holocaust survivor. Meanwhile, historic recipes like the matzo ball remain staples, connecting families to their heritage. Restaurateurs are also featuring family recipes, like "Savta's Schnitzel," on their menus, blending tradition with contemporary dining. This culinary evolution reflects a broader trend of rediscovering and celebrating Jewish cultural heritage through food.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the recent Federal Reserve interest rate cut, the monthly cost of an $80,000 home equity loan has slightly decreased. With current average rates, a 10-year loan at 8.43% would have a monthly payment of approximately $989, while a 15-year loan at 8.31% would cost about $779 per month. These costs are marginally lower than they were earlier in the year and in late 2024. While the savings are not dramatic, they still represent a more favorable borrowing environment for homeowners looking to leverage their home's equity. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the judge ruled that the consumers failed to show they suffered economic harm, as the candies were not rendered worthless by the lack of artistic detail.

While previous studies showed AI could pass the first two levels, it struggled with the essay-based questions of the Level III exam. Researchers from NYU and GoodFin tested 23 large language models and found that top-tier models could pass mock Level III exams in minutes, a task that typically takes humans over 1,000 hours of study. This development highlights the rapid advancement of AI's analytical reasoning capabilities in specialized professional fields. (not investment advice)</p>

Hastings was exonerated in 2022 after new DNA evidence identified another suspect, Kenneth Packnett, who had died in prison in 2020. A subsequent lawsuit revealed that an Inglewood detective had allegedly falsified evidence and ignored information pointing to Packnett at the time of the original investigation.

          <p>Sales of new single-family homes in the United States surged by 20.5% in August, reaching the fastest pace since early 2022. This significant and unexpected increase is attributed to builders offering price discounts and other incentives to attract buyers. Easing mortgage rates, in anticipation of the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, also likely contributed to the spike in activity. While this signals a potential burst of activity, analysts caution that new homes represent a small portion of the overall housing market, which remains constrained by broader affordability challenges.
