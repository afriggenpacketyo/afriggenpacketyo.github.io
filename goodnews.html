        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major League Baseball is reportedly nearing finalization on new three-year media rights agreements with major broadcasters ESPN, NBC Sports, and streaming giant Netflix, slated to commence in 2026. ESPN, having previously opted out of its $550 million-per-year Sunday Night Baseball deal, is set to receive a new package worth the same amount, encompassing in-market games for five local teams and a mid-week national game series. Under the proposed terms, NBC would secure the rights to all Sunday games and Wild Card playoff matches for an estimated $200 million annually, while Netflix is poised to acquire the exclusive rights for the popular Home Run Derby for about $50 million a year. These significant agreements, which are expected to reshape MLB's broadcast landscape, are scheduled to conclude after the 2028 season, though finalization is still pending.</p>

          <p>A U.S. court has ordered the release of Kilmar Ábrego García from criminal custody in Tennessee, marking a significant development after his wrongful deportation to El Salvador earlier this year. The Maryland father of two was initially deported in March based on unproven claims of MS-13 gang affiliation by the Trump administration, and subsequently reported physical and psychological torture during his detention in El Salvador. Despite being returned to the U.S. following a Supreme Court order, he was then charged with human smuggling, which his lawyers dismiss as "preposterous." Ábrego plans to return to Maryland, with his criminal trial scheduled for January.</p>

          <p>Intel shares surged approximately 6% following reports that the Trump administration is preparing to announce the U.S. government will take an equity stake in the struggling chipmaker. President Trump indicated the government should acquire about 10% of the company, though White House officials noted ongoing discussions and that Intel's CEO has not explicitly agreed to a deal. This move aligns with a shift in U.S. industrial policy, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick previously stating the government sought an equity stake in exchange for CHIPS Act funds, which would be nonvoting. Intel is investing billions in Ohio factories to produce advanced chips, but slowed construction in July. (not investment advice)</p>

Speaking at Jackson Hole, Powell noted rising downside dangers despite a resilient economy and strong labor market, while tariffs pose a risk of renewed inflation. With policy already in restrictive territory, he stated the Fed can "proceed carefully" in adjusting its stance. These remarks, which sent stocks soaring and Treasury yields falling, suggest a September rate cut is increasingly likely, though Powell emphasized the Fed's independence from political pressure.

          <p>Keegan Bradley is openly struggling with the "defining" decision of whether to serve as a playing captain for the United States Ryder Cup team. With the Ryder Cup approaching in late September, Bradley, who boosted his case with a strong second round at the Tour Championship, acknowledges the controversy his choice will inevitably generate. He emphasizes that the team's victory is his ultimate priority, regardless of his personal involvement. The 39-year-old, who will name his six wildcards soon, admits the dual role has created significant distraction and stress during his recent play, despite having capable vice-captains to support him.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada will remove billions of dollars in retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, effective September 1, aligning with U.S. tariff exemptions under the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement (USMCA). This decision aims to "re-establish free trade for the vast majority" of goods between the two nations, following a phone call with President Donald Trump. However, Canada will retain levies on steel, aluminum, and autos as negotiations continue for these significant sectors. Carney emphasized that Canada is matching U.S. actions, not appeasing Trump, ahead of the USMCA review next year.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack voiced hesitation about lowering interest rates, citing persistent inflation concerns, despite Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's recent dovish comments. Hammack, who will be a rate-setting voter in 2026, emphasized the need to maintain a "modestly restrictive stance" to bring inflation back to the 2% target, noting that the target has been exceeded for four years. She expressed worry that an accommodative policy could "reinvigorate the inflationary pressures." Her stance contrasts with market expectations, which surged after Powell's speech, pricing in a nearly 90% chance of a September rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

While the British High Commission called the fire "extremely regrettable," the Ministry of Defence previously attributed it to a knocked-over camp stove.

However, lower-income shoppers are more sensitive to price changes, and some categories struggle. Companies like Sharkninja have carefully adjusted prices and reduced discounting, while others, such as Home Depot, are increasing domestic sourcing.

Experts note that while investors remain "risk on," there's a growing appreciation for gold's role in portfolio diversification. Despite earlier concerns about potential tariffs on gold, the Trump administration dispelled these rumors, further bolstering bullish sentiment.

She describes achieving a feeling of "living outside time" and gaining epiphanies about Murasaki's writing and her own understanding of self through moments like a hot bath or a tea-and-meditation ceremony.

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) remain a secure option for savers, offering guaranteed returns and principal protection, especially with current rates around 4%. A $10,000 deposit can yield noticeable interest, with a 3-month CD earning about $107.50, a 6-month around $222.50, and a 1-year CD approximately $430. Longer terms, like a 5-year CD at 4.20%, could accrue roughly $2,100 in interest. CDs provide predictability and FDIC insurance, making them popular. Choosing the right term depends on liquidity needs, as locking in funds longer generally yields higher returns, and acting soon may secure rates that could decrease. (not investment advice)</p>
