          <h2>California Lawmakers Pass Bill to Ban PFAS "Forever Chemicals" in Cookware and Consumer Products</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 21:25:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California lawmakers have passed Senate Bill 682, which aims to phase out PFAS, commonly known as "forever chemicals," from cookware, cleaning products, dental floss, and other consumer items. This legislation, now awaiting Governor Newsom's signature, seeks to mitigate the significant environmental and public health threats posed by PFAS, linked to various negative health effects. The move has sparked debate, with environmental groups and actor Mark Ruffalo advocating for the ban, while celebrity chefs and the cookware industry argue that PTFE (Teflon), a type of PFAS, is safe when used correctly. The bill sets compliance deadlines between 2028 and 2031, promoting PFAS-free alternatives.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holding has introduced Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B, a new generation of foundation AI models that significantly enhances efficiency by matching the performance of larger predecessors while being considerably smaller. Developers report this model performs 10 times faster in some tasks and achieves a remarkable 90% reduction in training costs. Industry experts, like Stability AI's Emad Mostaque, have lauded its performance, noting it outperforms many models from the previous year despite an estimated training cost of less than US$500,000, a stark contrast to Google's Gemini Ultra, which cost an estimated US$191 million to train. This innovation positions Alibaba as a leader in cost-effective AI development.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed a package of energy bills that simultaneously permits the construction of up to 2,000 new oil wells annually in the San Joaquin Valley while tightening safety and regulatory requirements for offshore drilling. This deal, brokered by Governor Newsom, aims to stabilize the energy market and address gas prices amid planned refinery closures, despite environmentalist opposition who call it a "regulatory giveaway to Big Oil." The legislation also extends the state's cap-and-trade program through 2045 and creates a pathway for California to join a regional electricity market. The measures reflect a complex balancing act between energy affordability and ambitious climate goals.</p>

This three-year program, led by the FAA, will develop new regulatory frameworks and partner with private companies like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation for testing. It will include piloted and unmanned operations focusing on cargo delivery, supply transport, and emergency services, allowing testing before full FAA certification. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy emphasized that this initiative will create high-paying manufacturing jobs and cement America's status as a global leader in transportation innovation.</p>

          <p>The Panama Canal Authority is embarking on a mega-project to mitigate future severe droughts, which have previously paralyzed vessel transits, by investing in new infrastructure. Key initiatives include a land bridge with a flagship natural gas pipeline and port terminals to bypass the water-dependent canal for NGL transport, aiming to attract more LNG traffic. Additionally, the Rio Indo dam and tunnel project, costing $1.6 billion and displacing 2,500 residents, will supplement water for Lake Gatun, crucial for canal operations. While these projects won't be completed before the next El Niño in 2027, they represent a long-term engineering effort to secure this vital global trade gateway.</p>

          <h2>Academics Warn of Increased Spontaneous Spending with Unlimited Contactless Card Limits</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Academics warn that removing or significantly increasing contactless card limits could lead to a rise in spontaneous, "spending without thinking" behavior, potentially increasing debt. Currently, the £100 PIN limit serves as a crucial "friction point" that prompts consumers to consider their purchases. While the UK's financial regulator proposes allowing banks to set their own limits or remove them entirely, experts suggest different rules for credit and debit cards due to the risk of accumulating borrowed money. The debate also highlights concerns about security, vulnerability for victims of economic abuse, and the broader shift towards a cashless society, despite the convenience offered by digital wallets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The long throw, a tactical weapon famously used by Rory Delap, has made a significant comeback in Premier League football, with Brentford emerging as its leading exponents. The team scored a crucial late goal against Chelsea from a long throw, marking their seventh such goal since last season—five more than any other team. Brentford boss Keith Andrews, a former defensive midfielder who faced Delap's throws, suggests a "snobbery" in the game around this effective, albeit sometimes "unpretty," tactic. Pundits like Ashley Williams and Shay Given acknowledge its ability to create chaos and advocate for more teams to incorporate and practice defending against it.</p>

          <p>Earl Richardson, former president of Morgan State University, has died at 81, leaving a legacy as an educator who spearheaded a landmark 15-year lawsuit against Maryland for underfunding its Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The lawsuit, settled for $577 million, highlighted systemic disparities in higher education funding. Richardson, described as "armed with history," subtly guided student protests in 1990 that paved the way for this legal action, which led to Morgan State's "Renaissance." His work brought national attention to the financial challenges faced by HBCUs, advocating for equitable development to allow these institutions to fulfill their mission of educating diverse students.</p>

The investigation uncovered his use of "tokens" for money transfers and evidence of over £650,000 in payments to suppliers within two weeks.
