          <p>New York City is employing ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary, a system where voters rank multiple candidates in order of preference. This system aims to ensure that even if a voter's top choice lacks sufficient support, their subsequent rankings still influence the outcome. If no candidate secures a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed based on voters' second choices. The process continues until a candidate achieves a majority, and the results won't be official until mid-July due to the arrival of mail-in ballots.</p>

          <p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile has released its first images, showcasing its ability to observe the universe in unprecedented detail. The telescope features the world's most powerful digital camera and promises to revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos. Scientists anticipate that the observatory will discover a ninth planet in our solar system within its first year of operation. The telescope will repeatedly capture the night sky for ten years, every three days, for a Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</p>

          <p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory has released its first images, marking the beginning of its mission to create a comprehensive time-lapse video of the night sky over a decade. This observatory will collect data on approximately 40 billion stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects. The Rubin Observatory is described as a "discovery machine" that will enable astronomers to explore galaxies, stars, and the solar system in novel ways. Already, test observations have led to the discovery of over 2,000 previously unknown asteroids.</p>

          <p>China's defense ministry announced the establishment of three new military academies that will recruit high school graduates this summer, generating significant interest on social media. While the ministry has not expanded recruitment numbers, the new academies represent a restructuring of the military education system. The restructuring aims to create a more efficient system for nurturing talent and preparing for potential conflicts. Additionally, the ministry has removed the requirement for military academy students to have three years of work experience before becoming commanders.</p>
