          <p>The China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) has announced that its "National No 1 Uranium" project has produced its first barrel of uranium. Located in the Ordos basin of Inner Mongolia, this project is China's largest natural uranium initiative and was launched a year ago. State media highlighted the mining approach as "green, safe, intelligent and efficient," suggesting it could enhance China's competitiveness in the global natural uranium market. This development marks a shift from traditional mining in southern China to exploiting the large sandstone-type uranium deposits found in the country's northern regions.</p>

          <p>With the NFL committing its players to participate in flag football at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, pressure is mounting on Major League Baseball to do the same for baseball. While top players like Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge have expressed a desire to compete, MLB has not yet agreed, citing logistical challenges and potential disruption to the regular season. The article argues that MLB's participation would be a massive global marketing opportunity, showcasing the sport's international talent on the world's biggest stage. Failure to commit could result in baseball being overshadowed by other sports featuring top professional athletes.</p>

          <p>German authorities have announced one of the country's largest-ever seizures of the amphetamine Captagon, discovering approximately 300 kilograms of the drug at a grocery store in Landsberg. The 1.7 million pills, hidden among pallets of fruits and vegetables, have an estimated street value of over €20 million. Police and prosecutors in the state of Saxony-Anhalt have called it a significant blow to drug trafficking networks. The article also notes other German news, including an upcoming court ruling on the use of Ramstein Air Base for U.S. drone strikes and talks between UK and German leaders on migration.</p>

The event featured a Guatemalan Maya artist teaching students to paint murals reflecting their indigenous identity, and Bolivian rappers who incorporate Quechua and Aymara into their hip-hop to keep the languages alive. Other participants included fourth-generation Mexican-American luthiers who restore guitars for stars like Dolly Parton, and refugee weavers preserving their ancient craft. The festival highlighted the vital role of intergenerational connection in sustaining cultural traditions.</p>

          <p>This article identifies Micron Technology and Nvidia as two technology stocks that have recently experienced significant price increases and may have potential for further parabolic growth. Micron, a memory chip manufacturer, is benefiting from the AI-driven demand for high-bandwidth memory and is trading at an attractive valuation relative to its growth prospects. Nvidia is expected to continue its strong performance by capitalizing on the global demand for sovereign AI infrastructure, which could offset the loss of business from China due to export restrictions. Both companies are positioned to potentially outpace Wall Street's current growth expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A UK cabinet minister has stated that the government is considering additional measures to protect children online, building on the new age-verification rules that take effect this month. The new regulations, enforced by the media regulator Ofcom, will require internet companies to implement stricter age checks and alter algorithms to filter harmful content from children's feeds. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander emphasized that these rules are a foundation, not the final step, and that the Technology Secretary is exploring further action on issues like addictive online habits. Ofcom's chief executive affirmed the regulator's commitment to enforcement but noted that new legislation might be needed to address the rapid development of AI.</p>

          <p>In response to its severe housing and homelessness crisis, California is creating a dedicated state housing agency by splitting the existing Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency. The new Cabinet-level agency, set to launch in 2026, aims to elevate the issue and streamline the state's complex and fragmented affordable housing finance system. Supporters hope this reorganization will bring more focus and efficiency to housing policy, although some critics are skeptical that a bureaucratic shuffle alone will solve the problem. Key funding programs managed by the state treasurer will remain separate, requiring future coordination between the new agency and the treasurer's office.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Caltech's Dabiri Lab are transforming moon jellyfish into "biohybrid" cyborgs by embedding them with microelectric controllers. The goal is to create a swarm of remotely controlled jellyfish that can collect environmental data from the ocean's depths at a fraction of the cost of traditional underwater robots. The jellyfish are ideal candidates as they lack a central nervous system and pain receptors, and can heal quickly. While current versions are limited to vertical movement, the team is developing new iterations to allow for steering and to withstand the immense pressures of the deep sea, potentially revolutionizing ocean research accessibility.</p>

          <p>This commentary reflects on the Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano boxing trilogy as a pivotal moment for women's sports, exploring themes of choice, risk, and equality. The author notes that the final, more tactical fight demonstrated that women have earned the right to win strategically, not just to provide a spectacle. The piece contrasts the glory and empowerment of the athletes with the sport's persistent contradictions, such as the sexualization of ring girls and the financial precarity of many female fighters. It argues that in boxing, women reclaim their bodies for risk and glory, challenging traditional roles and asserting their right to choose their own path.</p>

          <p>The largest piece of Mars ever discovered on Earth, a 54-pound meteorite known as NWA 16788, is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's in New York with an estimated price of $2 million to $4 million. The rock is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before landing in the Sahara desert, where it was found in 2023. Scientific analysis confirmed its Martian origin, identifying it as a rare shergottite type of rock. This meteorite represents nearly 7% of all known Martian material on our planet, making it an exceptionally rare and valuable item for collectors and institutions.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has declared an end to its four-decade armed conflict with Turkey and has begun a disarmament process, creating a potential turning point for peace in the region. The move follows a call for peace from imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, though the group's full disarmament is contingent on concessions from Turkey, including his release and amnesty for fighters. A successful peace process could significantly improve Turkey's relations with Kurdish populations in Iraq and Syria and enhance its overall status in the Middle East. However, the process remains fragile, with deep-seated mistrust on both sides.</p>

While the 1985 concerts, organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, successfully raised millions for famine relief in Ethiopia and united a global audience, they have since been criticized for their lack of diversity and for reinforcing a "white savior" narrative of Africa. The article explores this dual legacy, acknowledging the event's powerful impact and its role in setting a template for benefit concerts, while also highlighting its shortcomings in representation and its patronizing approach to the continent it aimed to help.</p>
