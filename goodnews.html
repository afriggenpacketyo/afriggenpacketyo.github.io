          <p>The Senate is considering changes to the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," with senators discussing potential revisions to key provisions. These include modifications to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), state and local tax (SALT) deductions, border funding, Medicaid, and energy tax credits. Changes to SNAP could lessen the burden on states, while the Senate aims to lower the House-approved cap on SALT deductions. Senators are also debating the amount of money allocated for border security and seeking consensus on Medicaid cuts. (not investment advice)</p>
