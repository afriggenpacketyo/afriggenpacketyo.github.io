          <p>As the relationship between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk deteriorates, a debate has emerged regarding Musk's influence on Trump's 2024 election victory. Trump argued that he would have won the election even without Musk's help, while Musk claimed that Trump would have lost without his intervention. Musk spent nearly $300 million supporting Trump's campaign through America PAC, focusing on get-out-the-vote efforts and ads in key battleground states. Some analysts believe Musk's contributions were significant, while others maintain that Trump would have won regardless. The debate underscores the complex dynamics of political campaigns and the impact of influential donors. The score is 55.</p>
