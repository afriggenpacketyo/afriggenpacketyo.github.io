          <p>U.S. Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley has chosen Bryson DeChambeau and Justin Thomas to lead the American team in the opening foursomes against Europe, aiming to ignite "fire" from the start. Bradley emphasized DeChambeau's desire for such high-pressure moments and Thomas's role as the team's "heartbeat." This selection sets up an anticipated clash with Europe's Jon Rahm and Tyrrell Hatton. The article details other pairings, including Scottie Scheffler, and notes European captain Luke Donald's strategic choices, while also touching on Donald's earlier comments regarding player payments, which he clarified were not directed at the U.S. team.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is expected to announce plans for a compulsory, UK-wide digital ID scheme, aiming to combat illegal working and modernize state services. The scheme's practicalities, including accessibility for those without smartphones or passports, will undergo consultation. While a previous Labour government's attempt at ID cards was blocked, Starmer believes public perception has evolved with increased digital identification use. The article notes that the government has recently shown enthusiasm for the idea amid pressure to tackle illegal migration and improve access to government services, drawing inspiration from Estonia's digital identity system.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that critics are overlooking the foundational strengths of China's economic transition, focusing too much on short-term challenges like a cooling property market. It asserts that China's economy is diversifying beyond traditional growth sources, propelled by significant investments in green infrastructure, digital connectivity, and world-class scientific research. The article highlights China's leadership in 57 out of 64 key technologies, including AI and renewable energy, and its high output of cited scientific papers. This synergistic approach, from laboratory innovation to global industry scaling, is presented as a resilient basis for sustainable, high-quality development.</p>

The warehouse club saw its net income rise to $2.61 billion, with overall revenue reaching $275.24 billion for the full year. The article highlights Costco's success in attracting younger shoppers, with nearly half of new sign-ups coming from individuals under 40, thanks to expanded online shopping, diverse merchandise, and affordable meals. Despite a recent increase in membership fees, the company's focus on value continues to draw members, positioning it well to manage potential tariff impacts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order approving a deal for TikTok's U.S. operations to be controlled by American investors, aiming to address national security concerns. The agreement, valued at approximately $14 billion, involves ByteDance retaining less than 20% ownership and Oracle providing security by hosting U.S. user data and reviewing the app's algorithm. This move follows a congressional law requiring divestiture to avoid a ban, which Trump had previously paused. The administration asserts the deal ensures data security and prevents the app from being used as a foreign propaganda tool, despite some lingering questions about the algorithm's operational independence.</p>
