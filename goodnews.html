          <p>Golfer Rory McIlroy has advised his European Ryder Cup teammates to take inspiration from tennis star Novak Djokovic in managing the anticipated hostile American crowd at the upcoming event in New York. McIlroy, who recently watched Djokovic play at the US Open, noted the Serbian's exceptional ability to handle pro-American crowds throughout his career. He recalled that Djokovic had previously offered the team advice on channeling such energy, suggesting that a similar mindset will be crucial for achieving a victory on away soil this year.</p>

          <p>During a visit to officially open the Midland Metropolitan University Hospital in Birmingham, King Charles shared a lighthearted moment with patients about the realities of getting older. When an 85-year-old patient mentioned she was "wearing out," the King humorously replied that he is discovering that "bits don't work so well when you get past 70." He also spoke with a prostate cancer patient, empathizing with treatment delays and expressing his support for early detection, a cause he has championed since his own diagnosis last year.</p>

          <p>An international anti-piracy operation has successfully shut down Streameast, the world's largest illegal sports streaming site, which had amassed over 1.6 billion visits in the past year. The shutdown, conducted by Egyptian law enforcement and the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE), resulted in the arrest of two men suspected of running the service from outside Cairo. The operation, which also involved Europol and the U.S. Department of Justice, uncovered a sophisticated network used to launder millions in advertising revenue, dealing a significant blow to global digital piracy.</p>

          <p>Despite CEO Tim Cook's successful efforts to mitigate the worst impacts of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, analysts predict Apple may still raise the prices of its upcoming iPhone 17 models. The company has managed its supply chain to reduce tariff costs, but has still incurred hundreds of millions in expenses, which may now be passed on to consumers. While Apple has not confirmed any price hikes, potential increases could be framed around new features, such as larger screens and faster AI chips, rather than being explicitly blamed on tariffs.

          <p>A federal judge's ruling that allows Alphabet to continue paying Apple to feature Google Search on its devices is being hailed as a significant victory for both tech giants. The decision ensures Apple will continue to receive a highly profitable revenue stream, estimated at around $20 billion annually, for directing traffic to Google. Furthermore, the ruling sets a precedent that could allow Apple to forge similar lucrative partnerships with AI companies, potentially opening up new multi-billion dollar revenue sources for its crucial Services division.

          <p>The average monthly Social Security benefit for retired workers in 2025 is $1,976, but actual payments can vary widely based on an individual's earnings history and the age at which they claim benefits. While some high earners who delay claiming can receive over $5,000 per month, many find that their benefits alone are insufficient to cover living expenses. To supplement this income, retirees can explore options such as annuities, which provide a guaranteed income stream, or reverse mortgages for homeowners looking to access their home equity.

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has publicly supported initiating an interest rate cut at the central bank's next meeting in September, citing concerns about a rapidly deteriorating labor market. Waller, who is considered a potential candidate for Fed chair, argued that rates are currently restrictive and that multiple cuts could be necessary over the next several months to avoid economic damage. He emphasized the need for flexibility, stating that the Fed could adjust the pace of cuts based on incoming data, including the potential inflationary impact of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a landmark decision for New York state, a judge has ruled that advanced DNA testing evidence can be used in the trial of Rex Heuermann, the accused Gilgo Beach serial killer. The ruling allows prosecutors to present evidence from whole genome sequencing, a cutting-edge technique that linked hair strands from victims to Heuermann and his family. This sets a new legal precedent for the state, though the defense immediately challenged the decision, arguing the lab that conducted the testing is not licensed in New York.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers looking to deposit $50,000 into a certificate of deposit (CD), the "best" rate depends on their financial goals. While short-term CDs currently offer the highest interest rates, with 6-month terms yielding around 4.45%, longer-term CDs can provide a greater overall return due to the extended compounding period. For example, a 2-year CD at a slightly lower rate of 4.10% would earn significantly more interest over its term than a shorter-term, higher-rate option, forcing investors to choose between maximizing their rate and maximizing their total earnings.
