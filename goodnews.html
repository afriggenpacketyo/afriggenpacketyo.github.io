          <p>Former Manchester United star Wayne Rooney has responded to criticism from NFL legend Tom Brady regarding his work ethic during his brief tenure as manager of Birmingham City. In a recent documentary, Brady, a minority owner of the club, questioned Rooney's commitment, a claim Rooney refutes by stating Brady doesn't fully understand the demands of football compared to the NFL. Rooney defended his record, pointing out that other managers also struggled with the team and that he was working with a squad in disarray. He did, however, acknowledge Brady's status as a great athlete and credited Birmingham's current ownership for its recent success.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's economy expanded by 0.3% between April and June, a slowdown from the 0.7% growth seen in the first quarter but significantly better than the 0.1% that analysts had forecast. According to the Office for National Statistics, the services and construction sectors were the primary drivers of this unexpected resilience. However, the data also revealed a sharp 4% drop in business investment and a dip in household spending. The stronger-than-expected performance may influence the Bank of England to delay potential interest rate cuts as it continues to manage inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Aviva's chief executive, Amanda Blanc, has strongly reiterated the insurance giant's commitment to its net zero climate goals, despite increasing political pushback in the U.S. and UK. Blanc emphasized that addressing climate change is crucial for the company's core business of insuring properties, citing the rising frequency of extreme weather events like wildfires and floods. Her comments follow a trend of some major US and UK banks weakening their climate commitments. Aviva recently reported a 22% jump in operating profit, with its shares reaching their highest level since the 2008 financial crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Residents in Fort Collins, Colorado, have spotted cottontail rabbits with bizarre, horn-like growths, but scientists assure there is no cause for alarm. The rabbits are infected with Shope papillomavirus, a relatively common and mostly harmless virus that causes wart-like tumors on their faces and bodies. The virus, which cannot be transmitted to humans or other species, is believed to have inspired the folklore of the jackalope. While the growths can be fatal if they obstruct a rabbit's ability to eat, most animals' immune systems can fight off the virus, causing the growths to disappear over time.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that for the Democratic party to regain power, it must undergo a fundamental shift by embracing robust primary challenges against corporate-backed incumbents. The author contends that voters are disaffected because they see the party as beholden to wealthy donors and special interests, leading to a failure to deliver on bold, progressive policies. The path forward is not silence or capitulation to powerful lobbies, but courageous, people-powered campaigns that inspire the electorate with a new generation of unbought leaders. This process, starting in the 2026 midterms, is presented as essential for building a party that voters can believe in for 2028.</p>

          <p>After a wildfire destroyed the Altadena home and studio of the late, influential artist John Outterbridge, his daughter Tami has launched a project called 'Diggin' Bridge' to salvage his legacy from the ashes. With the help of a community of artists who were friends and colleagues of her father, she is excavating the site to recover fragments of his work, correspondence, and other artifacts. The project aims not just to physically recover items but to create a new, community-sourced archive and inspire new art.

          <p>A new documentary series, 'Rebel Architects,' reflects on a seminal 1980 photograph that captured a group of then-emerging Los Angeles architects, including Frank Gehry and Thom Mayne, on Venice Beach. The image symbolized a new, rebellious generation that was distancing itself from the architectural establishment. Four of the architects, now in their 70s and 80s, reunite for the series to discuss their early careers, the scrappy and creative Venice art scene of that era, and the evolution of their work and the city. The series explores their legacy, rivalries, and the bittersweet loss of the freedom that defined their beginnings.</p>

          <p>More than 160 workers at Blizzard Entertainment's Irvine campus, responsible for cinematics and other narrative content, have successfully voted to unionize with the Communications Workers of America. This move is part of a growing labor movement within the video game industry, driven by concerns over job insecurity, crunch-time hours, and workplace culture. The unionization was facilitated by a neutrality agreement with parent company Microsoft, which has allowed thousands of its gaming employees to organize without facing company opposition. This marks another significant step for labor organizing within a major U.S. gaming company.</p>

          <p>The FBI has returned a 500-year-old stolen manuscript page signed by Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés to the Mexican government. The document, penned in 1527, details payments for supplies for expeditions and is one of 15 pages believed to have been stolen from Mexico's national archives decades ago. The page was discovered in the United States after the Mexican government requested assistance from the FBI's art crime team in 2024. The agency stated that because the document had changed hands multiple times, no one will be prosecuted, but it remains committed to recovering the other missing pages.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin surged to a new record high of $124,529, driven by several key factors including steady inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs and a weakening U.S. dollar. A significant catalyst noted by analysts is a recent executive order from President Trump allowing cryptocurrencies to be included in 401(k) retirement plans, potentially opening a multi-trillion dollar market to digital assets. With growing anticipation of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut, market watchers at firms like Bernstein and Standard Chartered are predicting that Bitcoin's price could surge to $200,000 by the end of the year.
