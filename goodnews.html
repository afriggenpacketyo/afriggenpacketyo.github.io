          <p>Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley suggests the era of investing in cryptocurrencies based on market capitalization is ending. Horsley draws parallels to Wall Street, where investors make picks by building a thesis around the business, considering its place in the market and prospects. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan has advocated for cryptocurrency investors to look beyond Bitcoin and diversify their portfolio across several verticals. This shift towards narrative-driven investing is gaining momentum as new sectors emerge in the market, such as tokenization, games, middleware services, and AI projects. (not investment advice)</p>

Prominent party figures have warned that phrases like ‚ÄúLatinx‚Äù have alienated ordinary voters and contributed to recent election losses.
