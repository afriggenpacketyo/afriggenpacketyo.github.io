          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson affirmed that House Republicans are still committed to passing the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," encompassing President Donald Trump's agenda, despite failing to advance the measure initially due to opposition from some GOP members. The bill seeks to implement significant tax breaks through spending cuts, including substantial reductions in Medicaid. Johnson stated that compromises are being sought to address concerns regarding the implementation timeline for Medicaid work requirements, while also emphasizing close coordination with the Senate to ensure the bill's passage before the July 4th deadline to address the debt limit.</p>

His comments come amid tensions with South Africa, whose government denies claims of land confiscations and racially motivated discrimination, and as President Cyril Ramaphosa prepares to visit the White House.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies closer Jos√© Alvarado has been suspended for 80 games after testing positive for external testosterone under Major League Baseball‚Äôs drug-testing program. The positive test was attributed to a weight loss drug Alvarado took during the offseason, and he accepted the suspension without appeal. As a result, Alvarado will be ineligible for the postseason and will lose half of his $9 million salary. The Phillies will now rely on other options for closing games, including Jordan Romano and Orion Kerkering.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers released Chris Taylor, the team's longest-tenured position player, to make room for Tommy Edman's return from the injured list. Taylor, who was in the final season of a four-year contract, had seen his production decline, leading to the decision. The move signifies a shift towards younger, more productive players like Hyeseong Kim. The Dodgers have now parted ways with two familiar faces, with this being the second longtime team veteran, along with former backup catcher Austin Barnes, to be cut loose by the team in the last week.</p>

          <p>A Saturday Night Live sketch, featuring two couples at a bar, used a language barrier to explore the gap between perceived machismo and actual feelings. While non-Spanish speakers interpreted a loud argument as an archetypal Latino melodrama, the two men were actually commiserating about their difficult relationships. The sketch highlighted the misinterpretations and nuances that can be lost in translation, questioning how much truth can be discerned from a distance.</p>
