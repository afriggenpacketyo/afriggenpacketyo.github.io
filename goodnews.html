          <h2>Chinese Academics Advocate for Rethinking WWII History with Earlier Start Date</h2>

          <p>Some Chinese academics are proposing a revision of World War II history, suggesting the start date should be moved back to 1931 with Japan's invasion of Manchuria, rather than Germany's 1939 invasion of Poland. This perspective aims to highlight China's role in fighting fascism and challenge what they view as a Western-centric narrative. The call for a rewritten history comes as countries commemorate the 80th anniversary of the war's end. President Xi Jinping is scheduled to attend a Victory Day parade in Moscow.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with Britain, increasing market access for American farm exports. In return, Britain will be allowed to export 100,000 cars per year into the U.S. with a 10 percent tariff, and the U.S. will remove additional tariffs on steel and aluminum. The deal, hailed as "tremendous," is intended to set the tone for reciprocal trade with other partners, though many details remain to be worked out. This agreement may offer insights into the Trump administration's tariff approach with other major trading partners.</p>

          <p>Columbia University's response to pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupying the main library differed significantly from previous incidents, with campus security intervening aggressively and arresting protesters. The university's newly assertive stance has garnered praise from some quarters, including the Trump administration's antisemitism task force, but has also drawn criticism from those who believe unarmed demonstrators should not be met with force. Demonstrators vandalized the library with graffiti, leading to its temporary closure for repairs. The university is moving the judicial board that oversees protest discipline from the supervision of the university senate, a faculty-led body, to the provost‚Äôs office.</p>

          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis, up to a certain quantity. This proposal signals a shift from India's protectionist trade policies, potentially driven by Trump's tariffs on Indian exports. Experts suggest that while some sectors may be affected, others like steel and pharmaceuticals may not experience substantial impact. A trade deal could benefit logistics companies and certain financial sectors, while a failure to reach an agreement could negatively impact financials, materials, and healthcare.</p>
