          <p>Bill Gates announced that he will double his charitable giving to $200 billion over the next 20 years, motivated by global challenges such as children's health and climate change, and inspired by Andrew Carnegie's views on wealth distribution. Gates, currently the world's fifth-richest person, emphasized his determination not to die rich, stating that resources should be used to help people. While increasing his philanthropic efforts, Gates also criticized the multibillion-dollar foreign aid cuts by the U.S. and other wealthy countries, stating that philanthropy alone cannot compensate for governmental funding reductions. The Gates Foundation, which he founded with his ex-wife Melinda French Gates, will close at the end of 2045 after giving away virtually all of his wealth.</p>

          <p>The US and the UK have reached an agreement over tariffs on some goods traded between the countries, but this is not a comprehensive trade deal. The agreement reduces or removes tariffs on specific UK exports, including cars, steel, and aluminum, while Trump's blanket 10% tariffs on imports from other countries remain in place for most UK goods entering the US. Car tariffs have been cut to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars, and tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the US have been scrapped. Discussions on pharmaceuticals are ongoing, and there is no change to the UK's digital services tax on US firms.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price surged above $100,000 for the first time since February, fueled by positive market sentiment following President Trump's announcement of a trade agreement between the U.S. and the United Kingdom. The cryptocurrency's rise reflects its resilience and status as a safe-haven asset amid market uncertainty. Analysts suggest that the pro-crypto stance of the Trump administration and continued buying from spot-ETF investors are supporting Bitcoin's performance. However, the article indicates that Bitcoin's resilience may be tested further by global macro and geopolitical factors, such as rising tensions between India and Pakistan and the Federal Reserve's approach to interest rates.</p>
