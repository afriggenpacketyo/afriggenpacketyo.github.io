          <p>Novo Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceutical company, has revised its sales growth forecast for 2025 due to increased competition from copycat compounders affecting sales of its weight loss drug, Wegovy. Despite this, the company reported first-quarter net profits exceeding expectations, driven by strong sales of its diabetes treatment, Ozempic. While Wegovy sales rose significantly year-over-year, they fell slightly short of analyst predictions. Overall revenues increased, but the company has lowered its full-year sales growth projection from 16-24% to 13-21% and its operating profit growth forecast from 19-27% to 16-24%. </p>
