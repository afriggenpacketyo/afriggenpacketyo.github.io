          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is ending its nearly two-decade-old policy requiring all passengers in general security lines to remove their shoes. According to an internal memo, the change is being rolled out at major airports across the country, with the goal of expanding it nationwide. This move aims to expedite the security screening process for travelers. Passengers who are in the TSA PreCheck program were already exempt from this rule, and those who trigger alarms at security scanners will still be required to remove their footwear for additional checks.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 23:49:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new clinical trial has demonstrated that a single gene therapy injection can significantly reverse hearing loss in both children and adults with a specific genetic form of deafness. The therapy involves delivering a healthy copy of the OTOF gene to the inner ear, which is crucial for transmitting sound signals to the brain. All ten participants in the small-scale study showed considerable hearing improvement within a month, with one seven-year-old girl regaining almost full hearing. Researchers are hopeful this safe and well-tolerated method can be adapted for other common genetic causes of deafness.</p>

          <p>Singapore is becoming an increasingly attractive destination for Chinese students seeking overseas education, as the United States loses some of its traditional appeal. Factors such as cultural adjustment difficulties and safety concerns in the U.S. are prompting students to consider alternatives. Singapore offers a familiar cultural environment, with abundant Chinese cuisine and a perception of high economic and diplomatic openness. While the U.S. has long been the top choice, industry insiders predict Singapore's universities will see a rise in applications from Chinese students amid growing instability in America.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has advanced a measure to permanently prevent landlords from evicting tenants under the pretext of a substantial remodel, a practice known as "renoviction." The amendment to the city's "just cause" ordinance would only permit such evictions if a government agency issues an order to vacate the property to address housing code violations. This follows a temporary ordinance enacted earlier this year to curb the practice. The city is also developing rules to ensure landlords provide and pay for comparable temporary housing for tenants during legitimate, required renovations.</p>

          <h2>Judge Temporarily Blocks Provision Defunding Planned Parenthood in New Federal Law</h2>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has issued a temporary restraining order blocking a provision in a new federal law that would have denied Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood for one year. The reproductive health provider filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing the provision unconstitutionally targets the organization for providing legal abortion services, despite federal funds not being used for them. The judge's order ensures Medicaid funding continues for 14 days, with a hearing scheduled. Planned Parenthood stated the defunding would be devastating for its million-plus Medicaid patients and could force clinic closures.</p>

          <p>China has significantly expanded its visa-free entry policy, now allowing citizens from 74 countries to visit for up to 30 days without a visa in an effort to boost its post-pandemic tourism and economy. The move is a substantial increase from previous regulations and has already led to a rise in foreign visitors, with tour operators reporting a surge in demand. While visitor numbers have yet to return to pre-pandemic levels, travel companies are optimistic, noting a particular increase in travelers from newly eligible European countries. The policy aims to simplify travel and enhance China's global image.</p>

Trump also signaled a reversal on a recent policy decision, stating the U.S. would resume sending defensive weapons to Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Caltech has announced it will sever ties with online course provider Simplilearn following a class-action lawsuit that alleged the partners misrepresented a cybersecurity boot camp. The lawsuit claimed the program was marketed with the prestigious Caltech name despite having minimal connection to the university's faculty or oversight. As part of a settlement, Caltech and Simplilearn agreed to greater transparency and to refund tuition to hundreds of students, though they did not admit to any wrongdoing. The university will also establish a new faculty committee to oversee its other professional education programs.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has canceled its plan to lay off tens of thousands of employees in August, stating that a large-scale reduction-in-force is no longer necessary. The agency is on track to reduce its staff by approximately 30,000 by the end of the fiscal year through attrition, retirements, and a federal hiring freeze. The VA had previously considered cutting up to 15% of its workforce to return to 2019 staffing levels. Secretary Doug Collins stated that while a department-wide RIF is off the table, the agency will continue its efforts to improve efficiency and services for veterans.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been selected for his 11th career All-Star Game, this time as a special "Legend Pick" by Commissioner Rob Manfred. The selection, which recognizes his distinguished career accomplishments, came as a surprise to the 37-year-old pitcher, who has made only nine starts this season after returning from surgery. Kershaw expressed his gratitude for the "tremendous honor," acknowledging that his performance this year might not typically warrant a selection. This special designation has previously been used for other future Hall of Famers like Albert Pujols and Miguel Cabrera.</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have announced they will not pursue legal action against those who participated in the city's Pride parade in late June, despite the event being officially prohibited by the government. The decision alleviates fears that participants could face fines and organizers, including Budapest's mayor, could face prison time. Authorities cited public uncertainty over the event's legal status, as the mayor had declared it an official municipal event, which would exempt it from the ban. The march attracted a record crowd of over 200,000 in defiance of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's anti-LGBTQ+ policies.</p>
