          <p>The United States and Britain have announced a preliminary trade agreement aimed at reducing tariffs on certain imports and strengthening economic ties. The deal, hailed by both President Trump and Prime Minister Starmer, is the first since the recent increase in tariffs. While the agreement provides relief for Britain's auto industry and includes provisions for steel, aluminum, and beef exports, key details are still under negotiation. The agreement could be derailed before it takes effect. Despite the positive rhetoric, many British goods still face higher tariffs than before, and the deal's impact on the overall economy remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to unveil a "most favored nation" plan to cut Medicare drug prices, which he has teased as an "earth-shattering" announcement. The Trump administration previously sought to implement the "most favored nation" idea during Mr. Trump's first term, tying some high-cost Medicare drugs administered by health care providers to "the lowest price that drug manufacturers receive in other countries." Court orders previously blocked the implementation of this proposal, and the Biden administration abandoned it in 2022. The plan's potential reintroduction has sparked debate, with concerns raised about its impact on drug access and innovation.</p>
