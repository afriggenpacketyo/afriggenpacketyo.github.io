          <p>NATO is strengthening its ties with the commercial space industry as part of a new strategy that recognizes space as a critical operational domain. The alliance has also agreed to a new target for members to increase defense spending to 5% of their GDP by 2035, a significant jump from the previous 2% goal. This financial commitment is expected to drive investment in space-based capabilities for communication, navigation, and surveillance, benefiting both established defense contractors and newer satellite imagery providers. The move comes as European leaders seek alternatives to services like Starlink for strategic reliability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Anna Wintour, the influential editor-in-chief of US Vogue for nearly four decades, has announced she will no longer manage the magazine's day-to-day editing. The 75-year-old style icon will not be retiring, however, as she will retain senior roles at parent company Cond√© Nast, including her position as Vogue's global editorial director. Wintour's tenure has been credited with shaping global fashion and transforming the Met Gala into a major celebrity event.

          <p>International efforts to hold Russia's leadership accountable for the war in Ukraine are intensifying with the establishment of a new special tribunal. Created through an agreement between the Council of Europe and the Ukrainian government, this court will focus specifically on the "crime of aggression," aiming to prosecute high-ranking officials like Vladimir Putin for the decision to wage war. This initiative complements ongoing actions by the International Criminal Court (ICC), which has issued arrest warrants for Russian officials over alleged war crimes. These legal maneuvers aim to close a loophole, as the ICC cannot currently prosecute the crime of aggression against non-ratifying states like Russia.</p>

Investor sentiment was also bolstered by an apparent de-escalation of tensions in the Middle East. The positive market movement was widespread, with nonferrous metal, transportation equipment, and securities sectors leading the gains on the Prime Market. (not investment advice)</p>

These new venues, which include exhibition spaces, cafes, and private lounges, aim to entice customers with unique experiences rather than just transactions. This strategic shift comes as China's luxury market, a long-time engine of global growth, faces a downturn due to economic uncertainty and a property market slump. While overall spending on personal luxury goods has declined, spending on experiential luxury is rising, prompting brands to invest in these high-visibility flagships to build long-term customer relationships.</p>

North, now 33 and playing in France, recalls the incident as "a bit silly" but acknowledges that fans frequently bring it up as a defining memory of the victorious series. He considers the 2013 tour the peak of his career and a special time in his life.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Develop Digital Embryo Model to Study Early Organ Development</h2>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has created a high-resolution "digital embryo," providing a powerful new tool for understanding the earliest stages of life. This spatiotemporal atlas maps out early organogenesis, the critical period when an embryo's cells begin to form distinct organs. This stage is highly susceptible to developmental defects that can lead to disease later in life. According to researchers from institutions including Southeast University and BGI-Research, this detailed model will help decode the intricately orchestrated process of cell differentiation and could lead to new insights into preventing congenital abnormalities.</p>

          <p>A United Nations agency is advocating for global adoption of its ethics guidelines for artificial intelligence at a forum in Bangkok. Unesco Director-General Audrey Azoulay called for collaboration between governments, businesses, and civil society to ensure AI serves the common good. The event aims to build consensus around ethical standards as the technology rapidly evolves. However, the forum's dynamic was shaped by the notable absence of major AI companies from both the US and China, highlighting the deep divisions in the global tech landscape. Host country Thailand stated it would not take sides and would focus on developing its own AI ecosystem.</p>
