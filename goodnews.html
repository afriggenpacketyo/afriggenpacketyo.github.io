          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-25 17:09:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City mayoral primary is seen by some Democrats as a potential turning point for the party, offering a new, invigorated approach. Mamdani, a relatively unknown state assemblyman, ran a modern campaign embracing progressive ideas to upset former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Republicans are eager to use Mamdani as an example of Democrats moving too far to the left, while some Democrats worry about the implications of his socialist policies. Mamdani's focus on economic issues and ability to excite new voters is seen as a potential model for Democrats nationally.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Housing Finance Agency has directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to consider cryptocurrency as an asset in single-family mortgage loan risk assessments. This move signals a significant shift in the U.S. housing finance system, potentially integrating digital assets into traditional lending practices. The directive instructs both housing finance giants to develop proposals that include digital assets without requiring borrowers to liquidate them into U.S. dollars prior to loan closing. This decision aligns with President Donald Trump's vision of making the United States the crypto capital of the world.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to resume distributing money allocated for building EV chargers to 14 states, which had sued to challenge the freeze on those funds. The Department of Transportation had announced a temporary pause in February, pending new guidance, but no new guidance has been published. The judge's order is a preliminary injunction and includes a seven-day pause to allow the administration time to appeal. The states argued that the freeze disrupted ongoing projects and hampered their ability to meet carbon emission targets.</p>
