          <p>An American Airlines flight bound for Miami was evacuated on the runway at Denver International Airport following a landing gear incident during takeoff. Passengers used emergency slides to exit the Boeing 737 MAX 8 as smoke and fire emerged from a tire. All 173 passengers and six crew members were evacuated safely, with only one person transported for a minor injury. The incident caused a temporary ground stop at the airport, leading to dozens of flight delays. American Airlines confirmed the aircraft experienced a maintenance issue and has been taken out of service for inspection.</p>

          <p>A research team in China is working to recreate the Houfeng Didong Yi, a nearly 2,000-year-old seismoscope invented by the polymath Zhang Heng. Historical texts describe the ornate device as being able to detect distant earthquakes and indicate the direction of their epicenter, a feat considered legendary by some modern scholars. Despite its removal from the Chinese school curriculum in 2017 due to skepticism, scientists are now using modern technology and new clues to restore the ancient wonder. The project aims to validate the historical accounts and honor an early achievement in seismic detection, long before the advent of today's advanced technologies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service celebrated its 250th anniversary with an event at the Smithsonian's National Postal Museum and the release of new commemorative stamps. Founded in 1775 with Benjamin Franklin as its first postmaster general, the agency has been a crucial part of American history. The celebration occurs as the institution faces an uncertain future, with recent discussions under the Trump administration about potential privatization or restructuring. The newly appointed Postmaster General, David Steiner, has stated his opposition to privatization, emphasizing the agency's enduring role in connecting the nation.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees star Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, though an MRI revealed no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament, a relief for the team. Judge, who leads the major leagues in several offensive categories, received a PRP injection and is expected to be out for ten days to two weeks. He first felt the pain during a game against Toronto and hopes to return initially as a designated hitter. The news is considered a best-case scenario, as a more severe injury could have sidelined the MVP for an extended period.</p>

          <p>With England in the Euro 2025 final, this article explores the intense physical and emotional reactions fans experience during high-stakes football matches and offers expert advice on managing the stress. Psychologists explain that hormones like adrenaline and cortisol surge during tense moments, causing increased heart rates and a 'fight or flight' response. To cope, experts recommend getting adequate rest, having a clear match day plan, eating well, and avoiding alcohol. They also suggest physical movement to release energy and reframing the nervous feelings as part of an enjoyable, communal experience that allows for healthy emotional expression.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in several decades, with daytime high temperatures struggling to surpass the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chill to a misplaced high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface. In July, downtown San Francisco's average temperature was about one degree below normal, a pattern not seen since the late 1990s. While some residents are enjoying the temperate weather, the cool, gray conditions are a stark contrast to the oppressive heat seen in other parts of California, though experts warn that hotter weather could still arrive later in the season.</p>

          <p>This article presents Solana and XRP as two cryptocurrencies well-positioned to benefit from the growing trend of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Solana is noted for its high speed and low transaction fees, making it an attractive platform for tokenized stocks, which have seen significant growth on its blockchain. XRP, on the other hand, is carving a niche in regulated finance with features that appeal to institutional users, such as compliance tools for tokenized debt and payment instruments. The piece suggests that both coins offer distinct advantages in capturing capital flows as traditional financial assets increasingly move onto blockchains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to change licensing rules to protect pubs and music venues from noise complaints, a move aimed at revitalizing struggling town centers. Under the proposed reforms, developers building near existing venues would be required to soundproof the new properties. The changes also aim to fast-track permissions for new businesses and make it easier to open bars in disused shops. While the government hopes these measures will promote vibrancy and support the hospitality industry, the opposition has criticized the plan as hypocritical, blaming the government's tax policies for harming the sector.</p>

The incident occurred shortly after takeoff when the pilots received an onboard traffic alert.

During the visit, Modi unveiled a $565 million credit line and inaugurated several India-funded infrastructure projects, signaling a renewed partnership. The engagement is seen as a strategic move by India to counteract China's growing influence in the geopolitically important Indian Ocean region.</p>
