          <p>Chinese tech companies Huawei and ByteDance are planning significant investments in Brazil's cloud infrastructure and AI sectors, potentially heightening US concerns about China's expanding digital influence in Latin America. Huawei is reportedly finalizing a deal with Dataprev, a Brazilian state-run tech firm, to utilize its data centers and is also in discussions with Edge UOL, a cloud services provider. Executives from Huawei and Edge UOL met in China to discuss infrastructure, cybersecurity, and AI expansion across Brazil, aiming to create a bridge between China and Latin America. The United States has been increasingly wary of Chinese investments in Latin American tech infrastructure, citing potential risks of data theft and surveillance. The expansion reflects a strategic move by Chinese firms to deepen their presence in the region's growing digital economy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston extended legal relief to Harvard University in its challenge against the Trump administration's attempt to halt the entry of international students. Judge Allison Burroughs extended a temporary restraining order until June 23, while considering a longer-term injunction. The Trump administration's proclamation, citing Harvard's engagement with China and other national security concerns, sought to prevent the university's foreign students from entering the country. Harvard argued that the proclamation circumvented a previous court decision and violated the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.</p>

Hinton sees mass job displacement as the biggest immediate threat to human happiness, even with the implementation of a universal basic income. He notes that AI is already being used for jobs previously popular with recent college graduates, leading to potential mass firings in many industries, although some sectors, like healthcare, may be able to absorb the change.</p>
