        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the NBA Draft lottery, Cooper Flagg, a highly anticipated prospect, is expected to be drafted by the Dallas Mavericks, who secured the first overall pick. Flagg, who played for Duke, excelled in various statistical categories and earned the Naismith Player of the Year Award. The Mavericks' acquisition of the top pick marks a positive turn after trading Luka Donƒçiƒá to the Lakers, which led to fan unrest. The NBA Draft is scheduled for June 25, where Flagg's future team will be officially confirmed.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has endorsed Jack Ciattarelli in the New Jersey gubernatorial race, boosting Ciattarelli's chances in the Republican primary. Ciattarelli, who narrowly lost to the Democratic governor in 2021, has openly sought Trump's support after initially distancing himself. The endorsement could be a double-edged sword, as New Jersey leans Democratic and Trump remains a polarizing figure. The article also notes the competitive Democratic primary and the shifting voter registration landscape in New Jersey, which could impact the general election.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's attempt to remove three board members from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) sought to review CPB's operations. CPB leaders denied the request, citing federal law that protects the independent nonprofit from government control. The Trump administration argues the president has the power to remove personnel exercising executive authority, while CPB emphasizes its independence under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967. The conflict highlights the ongoing tension between the administration and public broadcasters.</p>

          <p>Republicans are advocating for policies that encourage one parent to stay at home with children, including increased child tax credits and removal of tax credits for day care. They argue that a stronger family unit results from having a stay-at-home parent. Studies are inconclusive about whether children fare better in day care or at home, while many American families require two incomes to survive. Conservatives claim they are providing parents with a choice, not pushing mothers out of the workforce.</p>

Alexander is believed to be the last living US citizen held by Hamas, and his release has been attributed to military and political pressure on Hamas.</p>

          <p>News of a U.S. agreement with China to temporarily reduce tariffs sent stocks soaring on Monday, with the Dow jumping over 1,000 points. Both countries will lower tariffs by 115% for 90 days, bringing the U.S. tariff on Chinese imports down to 30% and China's rate on American goods down to 10%. Investors are cautiously optimistic, but warn that the market rally could falter as the end of the tariff pause approaches.
