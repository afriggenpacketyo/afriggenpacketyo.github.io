          <p>Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz advanced to his third straight Wimbledon final after a hard-fought victory over American Taylor Fritz. Alcaraz overcame a strong challenge, winning the match 6-4, 5-7, 6-3, 7-6 (8-6) in demanding, hot conditions on Centre Court. The world number two showcased his versatile skills, including a powerful serve and remarkable net play, saving two set points in a tense fourth-set tie-break. This win extends Alcaraz's impressive winning streak to 24 matches, setting him up for a final showdown against either Novak Djokovic or Jannik Sinner on Sunday.</p>

          <p>Following their recent reunion, the band Oasis has experienced a massive resurgence in popularity, claiming the top two spots on the UK album chart. Their greatest hits compilation, 'Time Flies', returned to number one, while their iconic 1995 album '(What's the Story) Morning Glory?' secured the second position. This chart dominance comes as the band begins a series of sold-out homecoming shows in Manchester, part of a world tour that started after brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher reconciled. The renewed success has also propelled three of their classic songs back into the top 20 singles chart.</p>

          <h2>Goldman Sachs Begins Piloting Autonomous AI Software Engineer in Wall Street First</h2>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is testing 'Devin,' an autonomous AI software engineer developed by the startup Cognition, marking a significant step for artificial intelligence adoption on Wall Street. The bank's tech chief, Marco Argenti, stated that Devin will augment the firm's 12,000 human developers by handling routine tasks like code updates, with plans to deploy hundreds or even thousands of these AI agents. This move signals a shift towards 'agentic AI,' where programs can execute complex, multi-step jobs with minimal human supervision. The initiative is expected to substantially boost worker productivity but also raises questions about the future of tech jobs in the financial sector.</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, savers with $10,000 are weighing the benefits of short-term versus long-term certificates of deposit (CDs). While short-term CDs presently offer slightly higher annual percentage rates, long-term CDs ultimately generate significantly more interest due to the extended compounding period. For example, a 5-year CD at 4.20% could earn nearly $2,300, whereas a 1-year CD at a higher rate of 4.40% would only yield $440. The choice depends on an individual's financial goals and their willingness to lock up funds for a longer duration to maximize returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists report that a recently discovered interstellar comet, named 3I/ATLAS, could be one of the oldest objects ever observed by astronomers. Researchers at the University of Oxford estimate the comet may be over 7 billion years old, making it approximately 3 billion years older than our own 4.5-billion-year-old solar system. First spotted in July by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile, this is only the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system. The comet is believed to have originated from a region of the Milky Way known as the 'thick disk' and offers a unique opportunity to study material from a distant part of the galaxy.</p>
