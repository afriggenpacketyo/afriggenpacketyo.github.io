          <p>China has unveiled the preliminary design for its first commercial fourth-generation gigawatt-level fast neutron reactor, a significant step in its next-generation nuclear energy strategy. The reactor, named CFR-1000, is now awaiting final approval and is projected to become operational after 2030. This development places China among other major nuclear powers, like Russia and the United States, that are also developing advanced reactor technologies. The goal is to create a more fuel-efficient and sustainable source of power, marking a key milestone for China's national energy and atomic authorities.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has indicated that the United Kingdom will participate in efforts to airdrop humanitarian aid into Gaza, following Israel's approval for such operations. This development comes as the government faces increasing pressure, with over 200 MPs signing a letter urging the recognition of a Palestinian state. Starmer described the humanitarian situation in Gaza as a catastrophe that must end and stated the UK would use every available method to deliver food and medical supplies. Aid agencies have previously noted that airdrops are a less efficient method of delivery compared to ground transport.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese quantitative hedge funds are capitalizing on difficulties faced by international PhD students in the United States, such as funding cuts and stricter visa policies, to recruit top-tier talent. Firms like Shanghai-based Mingshi are offering competitive salaries, sometimes exceeding those of top US firms, to attract scientists and engineers essential for developing advanced AI-driven investment strategies. This talent acquisition is fueling the expansion of China's quant sector, which is now the world's second-largest yuan-denominated market. The trend highlights a strategic shift as China seeks to bolster its financial industry with global expertise.</p>

          <h2>Leicester Salon Owner Faces Crucial Hearing in Trademark Battle with L'Oréal</h2>

          <p>A small business owner is preparing for a pivotal hearing in her three-year trademark dispute with the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal. Rebecca Dowdeswell, owner of the Leicester-based salon 'nkd,' had her trademark renewal opposed by L'Oréal, which claims it would cause consumer confusion with its 'Naked' line of products. Dowdeswell, who has spent over £30,000 in legal fees, argues there has been no evidence of confusion in her 15 years of trading. The case, which was delayed due to a backlog at the UK's Intellectual Property Office, highlights the challenges small businesses face when confronting large corporations over branding rights.</p>

          <h2>Warm and Sunny Weather in UK Leads to Boom for Some Insect Species</h2>

          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has resulted in a significant increase in the populations of certain insects, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The warm conditions led to a boom in aphids, a primary food source for ladybirds, and created ideal conditions for butterflies to thrive, with many species being spotted weeks earlier than average. However, the associated lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year by drying out wetland breeding grounds. The short-term boom contrasts with long-term research indicating a general decline in the UK's flying insect population.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Illinois has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against Chicago and the state over their 'sanctuary' policies. The lawsuit, filed in February, alleged that local laws limiting cooperation with federal immigration agents unlawfully thwarted federal enforcement efforts. In her ruling, Judge Lindsay Jenkins found that the policies do not improperly regulate ICE operations and are protected by the Tenth Amendment. Chicago's mayor and Illinois' governor praised the decision, stating that it affirms the legality of their policies and enhances public safety by allowing local police to focus on community needs.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society explores the era of the Hollywood blacklist, which began in the late 1940s amid investigations by the House Un-American Activities Committee into alleged Communist influence in the film industry. The exhibit focuses on the 'Hollywood Ten,' a group of writers and directors who were jailed and blacklisted for refusing to answer the committee's questions. It showcases the immense pressure on creatives to 'name names' to save their careers and the devastating impact the blacklist had on individuals like screenwriter Dalton Trumbo and entertainer Hazel Scott, raising timeless questions about free speech and democracy.</p>

          <p>A feature article delves into President Donald Trump's multifaceted relationship with golf, portraying it as a business venture, a networking tool, and a fiercely competitive pursuit. Unlike past presidents who used the sport as a diversion, Trump leverages his golf courses to forge connections with political allies, business leaders, and foreign dignitaries. The article details his competitive nature on the course and his ownership of high-prestige properties like Turnberry in Scotland, which he uses to attract wealthy individuals. While his courses are not always profitable, they provide a private, influential setting for transactions and diplomacy away from public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are undertaking a critical mission to save the state's bighorn sheep, whose population has been halved in the last five years due to disease. The disease spread from non-native animals brought into the region. In a rescue effort, biologists captured dozens of healthy sheep from the state's last disease-free herd and airlifted them over 200 miles to an isolated, protected mountain range. A recent check-in revealed that the relocated herd is not only surviving but also growing, with newborn lambs spotted, offering a monumental success and a sign of hope for the species' recovery in Texas.</p>

          <p>A feature article explores the validity and flexibility of popular daily health benchmarks, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting eight hours of sleep, and walking 10,000 steps. Experts suggest that while these targets provide useful guidance, strict adherence isn't always necessary for a healthy life. For instance, thirst is generally a reliable indicator for hydration, and while seven to nine hours of sleep is crucial, consistency is key. The consensus among specialists is that individuals should use these recommendations as a guide rather than a rigid rule, adapting them to fit their personal lifestyle and focusing on overall consistency.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, focusing on how elite competition uniquely affects the female body, moving away from treating athletes as 'mini-men.' Researchers are studying breast biomechanics, showing how proper sports bras can improve performance by reducing inefficient movement and stride length. Other studies are investigating the nuanced impact of the menstrual cycle on performance, fatigue, and injury risk, particularly for ACL injuries, which are more common in women. This growing body of research aims to optimize training, improve performance, and enhance the health and safety of female athletes.</p>

          <p>The United States Treasury Department has modernized its public donation system, now allowing Americans to contribute to paying down the national debt via the mobile payment app Venmo. This adds a contemporary option to existing methods like PayPal and credit card payments on the 'Gifts to Reduce the Public Debt' page. The national debt currently stands at over $36 trillion, having grown consistently for over two decades. While public donations have amounted to over $67 million since 1996, this represents a tiny fraction of the government's annual spending, making the new payment method a symbolic gesture of civic participation.</p>
