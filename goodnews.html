          <p>Panelists at CNBC's East Tech West conference emphasized the need for emerging economies to develop "sovereign AI" to ensure strategic autonomy and cultural relevance. This involves creating AI systems tailored to local languages and contexts, rather than relying on English-based models from major tech companies. Experts highlighted open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing as key tools for democratizing AI and empowering nations to build their own technological infrastructure. The discussion pointed to the digitally savvy ASEAN region as particularly well-positioned to pioneer this movement, fostering inclusive growth and local innovation.</p>

          <p>China's factory activity among export-oriented manufacturers saw a surprising return to growth in June, according to the private Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI. The index registered 50.4, surpassing expectations and rebounding from a contraction in May, largely driven by a boost in production and new orders from promotional activities. This result contrasts with the official government PMI, which indicated a third consecutive month of contraction, a divergence attributed to differences in survey timing and company focus. Despite the production growth, new export orders declined and employment remained weak, signaling potential headwinds for the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law major housing legislation designed to accelerate construction by reforming the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The new laws, AB 130 and SB 131, exempt most urban housing projects from lengthy environmental reviews and also streamline the process for other developments like health clinics and child-care facilities. Newsom forced the legislation through by tying its passage to the state budget, overcoming opposition from some progressive lawmakers and labor groups. Experts believe these are the most significant reforms to CEQA in decades and could unlock numerous stalled housing projects across the state.</p>

The White House declared the move a victory, stating that Prime Minister Mark Carney "caved" to pressure. The 3% tax would have affected giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google, with Canada's finance minister stating the country's preference has always been a multilateral agreement on the issue.

          <p>Beachgoers along the coast of northern and central Portugal were treated to a rare and spectacular weather phenomenon on Sunday amidst a regional heatwave. Many observers captured images and videos of a massive, tube-shaped "roll cloud" stretching across the sky. This type of low-level, horizontal cloud is formally known as an arcus cloud and is relatively uncommon. It typically forms along the leading edge of a thunderstorm or cold front, creating a dramatic visual display for those fortunate enough to witness it. The event provided a surprising and amazing sight for people seeking relief from the high temperatures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, can help slow the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, reveals that betaine acts as a key messenger that prevents inflammation and organ aging by inhibiting a specific enzyme. This finding provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms that link physical exercise to longevity. The study suggests that it may be possible to develop anti-aging strategies that simulate the beneficial effects of exercise by targeting this pathway.</p>

Jassy suggested that AI will eliminate rote work, making employees' roles more interesting and enabling them to innovate more quickly.

In response, the Lakers secured forward Jake LaRavia with a two-year, $12-million agreement. LaRavia, a 6-foot-7 wing player, demonstrated strong three-point shooting ability last season with Memphis and Sacramento, a skill the Lakers will look to utilize.</p>
