          <p>An appreciation of the late Tex-Mex accordionist Flaco Jiménez, who passed away at 86, highlights his often-overlooked political commentary. The article focuses on his performance of "Un Mojado Sin Licencia," a song that uses humor and a rollicking rhythm to tell a story of an undocumented immigrant's struggles. Jiménez, famous for collaborations with artists like the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan, used his music to support causes, but his true defiance was in finding joy and resilience in the face of hardship. This approach is celebrated as a powerful form of resistance.</p>

          <p>The 12th annual KCON festival in Los Angeles drew a massive international crowd, celebrating all aspects of Korean culture from K-pop and K-dramas to beauty products. The three-day event allows fans unique opportunities to interact with their favorite idols, such as the "Dream Stage," where selected fans perform on stage with a K-pop group. The festival's success and global expansion signify the growing international appeal of the "hallyu wave," or Korean cultural wave. For many attendees, the event is as much about connecting with fellow fans and forming friendships as it is about seeing the artists perform.</p>

          <h2>An Explanation of Why US Jobs Report Figures Are Routinely Revised</h2>

          <p>Following President Trump's dismissal of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner over downward revisions to recent jobs numbers, this article explains the standard process. The BLS's initial monthly jobs report is a preliminary estimate based on surveys of households and employers. These figures are routinely updated in the following two months as more complete data becomes available, a normal practice under all presidential administrations. While the latest combined revision of 258,000 jobs for May and June was larger than average, significant adjustments are not unprecedented, especially during periods of economic change.</p>

          <p>Dame Stella Rimington, the first woman to serve as director general of the British security service MI5, has died at the age of 90. She led the agency from 1992 to 1996, an era that saw MI5 take on new counter-terrorism responsibilities and move toward greater public openness. Dame Stella was the first MI5 head to be publicly named upon appointment and was widely seen as the inspiration for Dame Judi Dench's portrayal of "M" in the James Bond films. After retiring, she became a successful author and was remembered by colleagues as a "true trailblazer."</p>

          <h2>High Nitrogen Levels in Neanderthal Remains May Be Explained by Maggot Consumption</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 16:11:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research proposes a novel explanation for the unusually high levels of nitrogen found in the remains of Neanderthals. Scientists suggest that this chemical signature may not be from a diet exclusively of large game, as previously thought, but could be the result of consuming maggots. The squirmy insects, which would have infested animal carcasses, are rich in nitrogen. This theory challenges long-held assumptions about the Neanderthal diet and offers a new perspective on how they utilized all available food resources in their environment.</p>

For ten summers, Breyfogle collected charms on a silver bracelet, with each one representing an achievement or a cherished memory from her time at the camp. Now a university student, she reflects on how the bracelet serves as a tangible link to the community and experiences that shaped her.

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma fell 27% on Monday, giving back a significant portion of the gains from its successful stock market debut last week. The company's stock had more than tripled on its first day of trading, reflecting strong investor appetite for high-growth tech IPOs. Despite the drop, Figma's valuation remains significantly higher than its initial offering price. The company has demonstrated consistent revenue growth and, unlike many recent tech IPOs, has a history of profitability, which contributed to the initial enthusiasm. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American Eagle Outfitters' stock surged over 23% after President Donald Trump posted a message on social media praising the retailer's new ad campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. Trump called the campaign the "'HOTTEST' ad out there" and noted that the "jeans are 'flying off the shelves.'" The campaign, which uses the slogan "Sydney Sweeney has great jeans," had previously faced some criticism. The presidential endorsement reversed a recent slump in the company's stock and highlights the unpredictable nature of marketing in a polarized cultural landscape. (not investment advice)</p>
