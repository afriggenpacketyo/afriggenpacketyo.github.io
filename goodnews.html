          <p>The Department of Justice has agreed to remove the newly appointed emergency police chief for Washington D.C. and revise a directive on immigration enforcement following a lawsuit from the city. The move came after a federal judge expressed skepticism about the legality of Attorney General Pam Bondi's order to place the DEA administrator in command of the Metropolitan Police Department. Under the agreement, Chief Pamela Smith will retain control of the force, with the DEA's Terry Cole serving as an intermediary during the 30-day federal takeover. This development marks a significant scale-back of the Trump administration's attempt to assert direct control over the city's law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The city of San José has announced the completion of California's first accessory dwelling unit (ADU) condominium, which can be legally sold as a separate property from the main house. This development follows a local law change and is seen as a potential model for creating more affordable homeownership opportunities across the state. Officials hope this innovation will help address California's housing crisis by providing a new type of starter home at a lower cost than a traditional single-family house. Amid a statewide boom, ADUs now account for approximately one-fifth of California's new housing growth.</p>

          <p>Arnald Gabriel, a 100-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran and former conductor, recently fulfilled a contract he signed over two decades ago to conduct the Wheaton Municipal Band on his 100th birthday. Due to his declining health, Gabriel could not travel to Illinois, but he honored his commitment by conducting the band remotely from his home in Virginia. The contract was originally proposed as a lighthearted gesture by the band's current conductor, Bruce Moss, in the early 2000s. Gabriel's dedication to keeping his word exemplifies his principle that "your word is your bond."</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests Salton Sea Shoreline is a Minor Contributor to Regional Air Pollution</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report finds that dust from the exposed shoreline of the Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in California's Coachella and Imperial valleys. This challenges the long-held assumption that the shrinking sea is the primary cause of the region's poor air quality and high asthma rates. Researchers suggest that pollution sources are diverse, including agricultural chemicals, diesel exhaust, and unpaved roads, and that funds might be better spent on exposure control measures like air filters in homes and schools. The findings prompt a re-evaluation of the multi-million dollar dust suppression projects focused solely on the lakebed.</p>

          <p>New research from two Indian clinical trials indicates that consuming mangoes in moderation may not be detrimental for individuals with type 2 diabetes and could even offer metabolic benefits. The studies found that popular Indian mango varieties produced a lower glycemic response compared to an equivalent amount of carbohydrates from white bread. In one trial, participants who replaced bread with 250g of mango for breakfast saw improvements in fasting glucose, insulin resistance, and other key health markers. Researchers emphasize that the key is moderation and that this finding is not a license for unlimited consumption of the fruit.</p>

          <p>A new mural in Redondo Beach, California, has altered an iconic image of the late Kobe Bryant, depicting him in a Dodgers jersey instead of his classic Lakers uniform. The artwork is part of a larger piece celebrating the Dodgers' 2024 World Series win and is located on the side of a future restaurant. The artist, Gustavo Zermeño Jr., explained that while other locations feature Kobe murals, he wanted this one to fit the Dodgers theme, creating a unique twist on a well-known pose. The change has generated mixed reactions and online discussion, which the artist and restaurant owner see as a positive way to spark conversation and keep Bryant's legacy alive.</p>

          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback, with plans to reopen standalone physical stores and host its first catwalk show in seven years. After its parent company, Arcadia, collapsed in 2020, the brand was bought by online retailer Asos and has since existed primarily online. The return is fueled by a wave of nostalgia among millennial and Gen-Z consumers who remember the brand's heyday as a cultural hub. Industry experts note that while nostalgia is powerful, Topshop will face challenges in attracting new, younger shoppers and competing in a market dominated by fast fashion and different consumer priorities.</p>

          <p>The global bubble tea market, driven by booming Chinese chains like Mixue Group, is projected to grow to nearly $4.8 billion by 2032, attracting significant investor interest. The industry's rapid expansion is largely fueled by a franchise model, which allows for quick growth but poses challenges in maintaining quality control and avoiding market saturation. While several chains have successfully launched IPOs in Hong Kong, the industry faces intense domestic price wars and the difficulties of adapting to international markets. This raises the question of whether the current boom is a sustainable business trend or a fad facing an eventual downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The market for tech initial public offerings (IPOs) is experiencing a significant resurgence after a multi-year slowdown caused by inflation and market volatility. Recent successful debuts from companies like Bullish, Figma, and Circle, which saw their stock prices soar on their first day of trading, have renewed investor confidence. Wall Street analysts and exchange CEOs are optimistic that this trend will continue, with a "healthy list" of companies preparing to go public in the latter half of the year. This renewed activity suggests the "IPO window is open" for well-positioned tech firms, though some experts caution against the kind of market overheating seen in past tech bubbles.
