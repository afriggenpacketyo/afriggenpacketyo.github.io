          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement to slash most of their recent tariffs on each other's imports and suspend part of the reciprocal duties for 90 days. This move, a significant shift from their ongoing trade war, was reached during high-level trade talks in Geneva and has already prompted a surge in stock prices. The United States will cut tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% from 145%, while China will lower tariffs on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%.</p>
