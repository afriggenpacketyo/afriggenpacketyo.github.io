          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered his best pitching performance of the season, setting the stage for the Los Angeles Dodgers to snap a seven-game losing streak with a 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants. Pitching three scoreless innings, Ohtani struck out four batters and allowed only one hit, showcasing his elite potential as he continues his recovery from Tommy John surgery. While bulk pitcher Emmet Sheehan was credited with the win, Ohtani's dominant start provided the momentum the team desperately needed. This outing highlights the significant impact his two-way talent has on the team's performance and morale.</p>

          <p>The rise of artificial intelligence in China is seen by some as a factor worsening the country's population decline by reducing the traditional incentives for marriage and childbearing. As AI technology advances to provide emotional companionship and elderly care, some younger Chinese citizens feel less pressure to start families to fulfill these roles. However, a leading demography expert suggests this technological shift might not be entirely negative, arguing that AI could redefine life and family structures. This perspective challenges conventional concerns about population decline by proposing that technology may offer alternative solutions for societal needs.</p>

          <p>A recent segment on "The Ramsey Show" is being highlighted as the host's shortest-ever call, featuring a 20-year listener named Chad with a straightforward financial question.

          <p>Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool became the first all-British pair to win the men's doubles title at Wimbledon in 89 years, defeating Rinky Hijikata and David Pel 6-2, 7-6.

The pair, who teamed up less than a year ago, had set goals to win a Grand Slam and qualify for the ATP Finals. Achieving one of those goals at their home tournament represents a career-defining moment for both players and a significant milestone for the sport in their country.</p>

The plan involves prioritizing covered venues in cities like Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Vancouver for games scheduled during the hottest parts of the day.
