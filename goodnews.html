          <p>Chime, a financial technology company, has officially filed to go public on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "CHYM," emphasizing that it is a technology company rather than a bank. The company generates revenue from interchange fees on purchases made with Chime debit and credit cards, and it reported $12.4 million in net income on $518.7 million in revenue for the March quarter. Chime offers a variety of services including high-yield savings accounts, free tax filing, and early access to earned pay, positioning itself as a primary financial relationship for many of its 8.6 million active members. The IPO plans were previously delayed due to market volatility.</p>

          <p>Deep within the American Museum of Natural History lies a locked room housing a colony of dermestid beetles, responsible for meticulously cleaning animal skeletons. These flesh-eating beetles consume the meat off specimens, leaving behind pristine bones too delicate for human hands to clean. The colony, descended from beetles brought from Africa in the 1930s, works around the clock in wooden boxes, creating a soft, crackling sound of gnawing. To ensure the beetles remain contained and well-fed, museum staff maintain a strict regimen of specimen provision and emergency food supplies, such as chicken or pigs' feet.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has announced a change in policy, reinstating Pete Rose, "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, and 15 other players, making them eligible for the Hall of Fame after their careers were marred by gambling scandals. This decision reverses the league's stance on permanent ineligibility, stating that bans expire upon death. Rose's ban was lifted posthumously, and Jackson's reinstatement opens the door for consideration despite his involvement in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. The Hall of Fame will now consider these players, although induction is not guaranteed, considering factors like integrity and character.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece examines how China and Russia are reinterpreting the narrative of World War II to bolster their contemporary legitimacy and challenge the post-World War II global order. By framing the war as a two-front struggle where China and the Soviet Union bore the primary burden of defeating fascism, they position themselves as inheritors of the true anti-fascist tradition. This narrative deliberately omits or downplays the role of the U.S., Britain, and other Allied nations, emphasizing the Asian and European fronts. The goal is to reshape the post-1989 world order and challenge U.S. hegemony.</p>

          <p>The FAA reported that as few as three radar controllers were monitoring Newark's airspace on a Monday night, despite a target of 14, leading to flight delays and cancellations. The agency cited a national shortage of air traffic controllers and ongoing challenges with technology and runway construction at Newark. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy emphasized that the measures are to guarantee safety. While the FAA said that the U.S. is facing a national shortage of air traffic controllers and staffing goals for Newark's airspace have not been met for years, experts say that the shortage alone would not likely pose a threat to passenger safety.</p>

          <p>Ross Douthat explores the question of what constitutes successful right-wing art, referencing Jonathan Keeperman's views and Christopher Scalia's book on novels conservatives will love. The article delves into the tension between art as truth-telling and art as propaganda, suggesting that successful ideological art captures aspects of reality recognizable even to those with differing worldviews. Examples like V.S. Naipaul's novels and the "Andor" Star Wars series are used to illustrate how art can convey conservative or leftist perspectives while still resonating with audiences across the political spectrum. The key is unsettlement rather than conversion, prompting viewers to consider truths outside their favored systems.</p>
