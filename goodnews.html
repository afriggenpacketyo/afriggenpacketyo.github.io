          <p>A new study suggests that the prehistoric Chav√≠n people in the Peruvian Andes used psychoactive drugs during exclusive rituals to establish social and political hierarchies. Archaeologists analyzed artifacts, including "snuff tubes," found at Chav√≠n de Hu√°ntar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and discovered traces of hallucinogenic substances like DMT and tobacco. These findings indicate that consuming psychoactive drugs was a tightly controlled ritual, likely reserved for a select few, reinforcing the social hierarchy.</p>

Kessler emphasizes the need for additional interventions like healthier eating, exercise, and behavioral therapies, and calls for more research on the long-term use and safety of these drugs.

          <p>This article discusses the potential of far-UVC light as a tool to combat respiratory diseases like Covid-19, tuberculosis, and flus. The technology, which involves using ultraviolet light at wavelengths of 200 to 235 nanometers, can kill the vast majority of airborne pathogens without harming human skin or eyes. A new development involves secondary harmonics using aluminum nitrate crystals to create cost-effective lamps. While challenges remain, new research is making the author tentatively more optimistic that the ozone effects of far-UVC are not concerningly large.</p>

          <p>Starting today, the federal government is enforcing Real ID requirements for domestic air travel. The Transportation Security Administration will no longer accept IDs that don't comply with Real ID standards, though passports and other forms of identification will still be accepted. Passengers without a Real ID may face additional screening and should arrive at the airport at least three hours early. The Department of Homeland Security says Real ID is a more secure form of identification, stemming from a 9/11 Commission recommendation.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer is defending the decision to axe winter fuel payments for millions of pensioners, as calls for a reversal of the policy continue. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch pressed Starmer to "listen to his own party and change course" during Prime Minister's Questions. The policy has partly been blamed for Labour's poor performance in last week's local elections in England, which saw the party lose two-thirds of the council seats it was defending.</p>
