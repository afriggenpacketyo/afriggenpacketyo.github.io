          <p>The airline industry is poised for a significant transformation in its booking systems, moving towards modern digital retail experiences akin to Amazon or Spotify. Companies like Flyr are developing "offer and order management" systems to replace legacy technology, enabling features like shopping carts for flexible bookings and personalized options. This shift aims to allow passengers to easily manage changes, refunds, and purchase additional services like hotels or car rentals directly from airline websites. Riyadh Air will be the first "digitally native" airline, launching without traditional Passenger Service System (PSS) technology, highlighting a broader industry push for New Distribution Capability to enhance customer experience and revenue.</p>
