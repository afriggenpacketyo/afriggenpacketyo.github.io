          <p>In an effort to boost consumer spending, the southern Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen has opened what is being touted as the world's largest indoor ski resort. Named Qianhai Huafa Snow World, the 10-hectare facility features five slopes and aims to attract winter sports enthusiasts during the hot and humid summer months and national holidays. This development reflects a growing trend in China to cultivate a domestic winter sports economy, making skiing accessible year-round even in subtropical climates. Enthusiasts from nearby cities are already planning trips, signaling strong initial interest in the novel attraction.</p>

          <p>The British government will underwrite a £1.5 billion loan to Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to support the automaker and its supply chain following a debilitating cyberattack. The attack, claimed by the group Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, has halted production for weeks, threatening the viability of smaller suppliers and risking thousands of jobs. This government intervention, facilitated through the Export Development Guarantee, is intended to provide financial stability and allow JLR to manage payments to its suppliers as it works to recover its systems. The move marks a significant government response to the economic fallout from a major cybersecurity incident.</p>

          <p>Citizens in Zurich, Switzerland, are participating in a referendum to decide on severely restricting the use of leaf blowers and leaf vacuums. If passed, the proposal would completely ban gas-powered models and limit the use of electric versions to the months of October through December to reduce noise and air pollution. Supporters argue the devices are harmful to the environment and microorganisms, recommending rakes as an alternative. Opponents of the measure contend that the ban would create unnecessary difficulties and represents an overreach of prohibitive regulations.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has announced a plan to commence construction on three new towns in England before the next general election, as part of its strategy to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. A taskforce has identified twelve potential locations, with sites in Bedfordshire, Leeds, and north London being the most promising. The initiative aims to address the national housing shortage and stimulate economic growth, drawing inspiration from the post-war government's new town developments. The plan includes provisions for at least 40% affordable housing and investment in local infrastructure like schools and transport.</p>

          <p>For the second time in recent years, Swiss citizens are voting on the introduction of a national electronic identity system. A similar proposal was rejected in 2021 due to concerns over data privacy and the involvement of private companies. The revised plan ensures the system will be optional and managed entirely by public entities, with data stored on users' smartphones rather than in a central database. Supporters claim it will streamline bureaucratic processes, while opponents remain wary of potential privacy infringements and data misuse, despite the new safeguards.</p>

          <p>Despite having a physically imposing team, Newcastle United has struggled to capitalize on set-piece opportunities this season, a point of focus for head coach Eddie Howe. The club recently hired set-piece specialist Martin Mark from Danish club Midtjylland to improve their performance in this area. While the team has shown a shift in approach, such as utilizing more long throws, they have only scored once from a corner or free-kick so far. The article contrasts Newcastle's struggles with their upcoming opponent, Arsenal, who have been highly effective, scoring half of their Premier League goals from set-piece situations.</p>

          <p>In response to recent claims from the Trump administration about autism, a commentary highlights positive traits often associated with autistic people, such as a capacity for deep focus, adherence to facts, and a strong sense of empathy and social justice. The author contrasts these qualities with Donald Trump's public persona, arguing that the autistic community has more to teach the former president than he is capable of learning. The piece challenges the framing of autism as a tragedy in need of a cure, instead celebrating the unique strengths and profound joy found within the autistic experience.</p>

          <p>As the regular season concludes, the Los Angeles Dodgers are grappling with several key roster decisions, primarily driven by player health. The availability of injured players like Max Muncy and Will Smith for the upcoming wild-card series remains uncertain. Beyond injuries, the team must finalize its pitching staff, balancing a potential surplus of left-handed relievers with a need for more right-handed options. The club is also deliberating its starting rotation and which position players will secure the final spots, with recent performances potentially influencing the final outcome.</p>

          <p>The town of Rock Springs, Wyoming, is taking steps to acknowledge a dark chapter in its history by erecting a new monument commemorating the 1885 massacre of Chinese immigrant miners. The event, one of the deadliest incidents of anti-Chinese violence in U.S. history, saw a mob kill 28 people and burn down the local Chinatown. This new memorial and an associated archaeological dig at the site represent a significant effort by the community to confront its violent past. The move comes as descendants of the victims are reconnecting with their history, many of whom were previously unaware of the tragedy.</p>

          <p>Singer Florence Welch has disclosed that she underwent life-saving emergency surgery in August 2023 for a ruptured fallopian tube caused by an ectopic pregnancy. The Florence and the Machine frontwoman revealed she had been experiencing serious internal bleeding while performing on stage, unaware of the severity of her condition. The diagnosis required immediate surgery, which prompted her to cancel several concerts at the time for reasons she did not feel ready to share. An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants outside the womb and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.</p>

To overcome this restriction, the museum intends to create digital exhibitions, alongside displays of replicas and high-quality photographs.

          <p>Syria's new government has issued an arrest warrant in absentia for former president Bashar Assad, who was overthrown in December 2024 and fled to Russia. The charges relate to the brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protests in the city of Daraa in 2011, which escalated into a devastating civil war. The warrant includes charges of premeditated murder, torture, and deprivation of liberty, and can be distributed through Interpol to pursue the case internationally. This action marks a significant step by the new leadership to seek accountability for the atrocities committed during the Assad family's decades-long rule.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a deadlock lasting more than two years, Iraq has resumed exporting crude oil to Turkey from its semi-autonomous Kurdistan region. The breakthrough came after an agreement was reached between Iraq's federal government, the Kurdistan regional government, and foreign oil producers. The pipeline's closure had been a major point of contention and a significant economic blow to the region. The resumption of oil flow, estimated at around 180,000-190,000 barrels per day, marks a positive step in resolving long-standing disputes over resource management between Baghdad and the Kurdish authorities.</p>
