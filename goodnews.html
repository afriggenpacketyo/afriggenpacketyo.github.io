          <p>The European Union has announced a six-month suspension of its retaliatory tariffs against the United States, which were scheduled to take effect this week. This move is intended to de-escalate trade tensions and provide time for further negotiations following a political agreement between EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump. The deal aims to restore stability for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, although the EU noted the agreement is not legally binding. The delay represents a significant concession and comes amid a critical period for the Trump administration's global trade agenda.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters experienced a significant surge of over 15% after President Donald Trump praised the company's new advertising campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. In a social media post, Trump called it the "'HOTTEST' ad out there," which immediately boosted the stock's performance. The campaign, which uses the slogan "Sydney Sweeney has great jeans," had previously faced some criticism for its perceived double entendre. This event highlights the volatile intersection of celebrity culture, political commentary, and market reactions, demonstrating how a high-profile endorsement can dramatically influence a company's stock value amid ongoing marketing challenges.</p>

          <p>An electrical engineer in Orange County, Vermont, is single-handedly restoring and installing pay phones to provide free public communication in an area known for unreliable cell coverage. Patrick Schlott modifies old pay phones to make free calls to anywhere in the U.S. or Canada using only an internet connection, personally covering the minimal operating costs. Since the first installation last year, the phones have been used hundreds of times for emergencies, such as car breakdowns, and for everyday needs like children calling for rides. The project is gaining importance as Vermont plans to ban cell phones in schools, creating a greater need for alternative communication methods for students.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a volatile economic environment, annuities are gaining attention as a tool for retirement planning, but they are not suitable for everyone. This article suggests that near-retirees wanting to lock in currently high interest rates, risk-averse seniors prioritizing guaranteed income, and individuals without pensions may benefit from purchasing an annuity now. Conversely, those who might need liquid funds soon, younger investors with long time horizons, and anyone carrying high-interest debt should likely avoid them. The decision depends heavily on individual financial circumstances, risk tolerance, and liquidity needs rather than market trends alone. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has advised investors to consider buying shares of Wells Fargo and Capital One, citing a market environment where a weaker economy could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. He suggested that while the firm recently trimmed its position in Wells Fargo for portfolio discipline, the long-term thesis remains positive for both banks. However, Cramer recommended holding off on buying Goldman Sachs for new investors, as the stock has already seen a significant run-up. He also remains bullish on Apple following its strong quarterly performance and sees potential in its AI investments and future credit card partnerships. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society indicates that a rise in colorectal cancer screenings among people aged 45-49 is leading to more diagnoses at an earlier, more treatable stage. Following recommendations to lower the screening age from 50 to 45, screening rates in this demographic increased by 62% from 2019 to 2023. This has corresponded with a significant jump in the detection of early-stage cancers. While researchers call the findings promising news, they also caution that screening rates among younger adults remain suboptimal and that disparities exist based on insurance status and education level.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board has approved a new compensation package for CEO Elon Musk valued at approximately $29 billion, consisting of 96 million shares of restricted stock. This grant arrives six months after a Delaware judge voided his previous $56 billion pay package from 2018, a ruling Musk is currently appealing. The new award is seen by analysts as a move to ensure Musk's continued leadership at Tesla until at least 2030 and motivate him as the company shifts its focus toward artificial intelligence. The company stated that if the original 2018 package is reinstated by the courts, this new grant will be immediately forfeited.</p>

          <p>As the Premier League season approaches, this article provides a cautionary analysis on the nature of pre-season friendly matches, arguing that they are often poor indicators of future performance. While fans and media are desperate for soccer content and tend to scrutinize these games for meaning, the reality is that teams are at different stages of fitness and preparation. Managers may be experimenting with tactics or simply giving players minutes, making results and performances misleading. Although rare exceptions exist where a pre-season game signals a deeper issue, obsessing over these phoney wars is largely a futile exercise until the competitive season begins.</p>

          <p>More than 10,000 European hotels have joined a class-action lawsuit against the online travel platform Booking.com, seeking damages for losses incurred from 2004 to 2024. The complaint, supported by European hospitality association HOTREC, alleges that the company's "best-price" clauses were illegal and anti-competitive. These clauses prevented hotels from offering lower prices on their own websites or other platforms, a practice the European Court of Justice has since ruled against. The lawsuit represents a major collective effort by the hospitality industry to challenge what they describe as abusive practices in the digital marketplace.</p>

          <p>Financial experts predict that interest rates for Certificates of Deposit (CDs) will likely hold steady through August, as the Federal Reserve maintains the current federal funds rate amid fluctuating inflation data. While rate cuts were anticipated for 2025, recent inflation upticks have created uncertainty, prompting many banks to keep CD rates stable for now. This article notes that some banks have already begun slightly lowering rates in anticipation of future cuts. For savers, short-term CDs currently offer the most competitive rates, but experts advise comparing options and considering personal liquidity needs before locking in funds.

          <p>After a decade of investigation, scientists have solved the mystery behind the sea star wasting disease that has killed over five billion sea stars along North America's Pacific coast since 2013. A new study identifies the culprit as the bacteria Vibrio pectenicida, which was found in the coelomic fluid of infected sea stars. The epidemic devastated over 20 species, with the sunflower sea star losing around 90% of its population, leading to an explosion of sea urchins and the destruction of kelp forests. This discovery provides a crucial breakthrough, allowing researchers to potentially develop interventions to help the sea star populations and their ecosystems recover.</p>
