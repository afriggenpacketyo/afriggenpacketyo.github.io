          <p>Jamie Borthwick, an EastEnders star, has been suspended by the BBC for using a slur against people with disabilities during the filming of Strictly Come Dancing. The offensive remark, reportedly made backstage at the Blackpool Tower Ballroom, was condemned by the BBC, which stated that the language was unacceptable and did not reflect the organization's values. Borthwick has apologized for the remark, stating that he did not fully understand the derogatory term and its meaning, and disability charity Scope has urged him to educate himself on the realities of disabled people's lives. The incident highlights the importance of respectful language and the need for individuals to be aware of the impact of their words. </p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' offensive struggles continued as they lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in a 2-1 walk-off defeat, marking their second loss in less than 24 hours. Despite a strong performance from starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who pitched six scoreless innings with nine strikeouts, the Dodgers left 12 runners on base and struggled with runners in scoring position. Nolan Gorman's ground-rule double in the ninth initiated the winning rally for the Cardinals, while the Dodgers' lone run came from Shohei Ohtani scoring on a passed ball. The team also placed starting pitcher Tony Gonsolin on the injured list due to elbow discomfort, further complicating their pitching situation. </p>

          <p>Cardiologists are warning that excessive scrolling on phones, often mistaken as a relaxing habit, can be detrimental to heart health. Doomscrolling, especially in the morning or before bed, can increase anxiety, blood pressure, and sedentary behavior. This can lead to cardiometabolic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, as well as disrupt sleep patterns. To mitigate these risks, cardiologists recommend setting time limits, avoiding scrolling in bed, replacing the habit with healthier alternatives like exercise, and eating undistracted. </p>
