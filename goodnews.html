          <p>China's central bank kept its benchmark one-year and five-year loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged for the fourth consecutive month, defying expectations for a cut after the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered its rates. The one-year LPR remains at 3.0% and the five-year at 3.5%. This article notes that the decision aligns with economists' views that Chinese authorities would hold off on major stimulus amid a recent stock market rally. Despite signs of economic fatigue, including slowing retail sales and industrial output, Beijing appears cautious about immediate large-scale monetary easing. (not investment advice)</p>
