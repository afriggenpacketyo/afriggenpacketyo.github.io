          <p>House Republicans have introduced a bill to increase the child tax credit, making the $2,000 credit permanent and raising the cap to $2,500 from 2025 through 2028, after which it would revert to $2,000 and be indexed for inflation. However, the proposal includes restrictions, such as requiring both parents to have a Social Security number, which would exclude an estimated 4.5 million children who are U.S. citizens or lawfully present. The refundable portion of the credit would be capped at $1,700 for 2025, with the credit phasing out for married couples with AGI exceeding $400,000 and $200,000 for other taxpayers, primarily benefiting middle-income families.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding the power of a single district court judge to block a policy across the country, specifically related to President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship. The justices did not focus on the legal merits of the order itself, which seeks to deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to undocumented migrants, but rather on the use of universal injunctions. Several justices expressed skepticism about the legality of Mr. Trump's proclamation. The arguments included discussions on the history of nationwide injunctions and the practical implications of limiting their use, with concerns raised about potential confusion and inconsistent application of laws across different states.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has withdrawn his request for a clemency investigation for the Menendez brothers, leading to their June hearing being converted into a parole hearing, increasing the possibility of an early release. This decision follows a Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge's reduction of their original life-without-parole terms to 50 years-to-life, making them eligible for parole after serving 35 years. The parole board will determine whether they pose an unreasonable risk to public safety, with Newsom's office emphasizing transparency and due diligence in the process. The Menendez brothers were convicted in 1996 for the 1989 shotgun murders of their parents, Jos√© and Mary "Kitty" Menendez.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers are seeking NFL approval to sell an 8% stake in the franchise to private investment firm Arctos during the upcoming NFL team owners meetings. If approved, Dean Spanos and his siblings would retain approximately 61% ownership of the team. This move follows Tom Gores' acquisition of a 27% stake in September, resolving a dispute within the Spanos family. The Chargers' ownership was recently ranked highly by players, attributed to the team's new facility and the hiring of coach Jim Harbaugh, despite a relatively quiet free agency period.</p>

Gold futures are speculative and risky, while gold ETFs provide exposure to gold mining companies or physical gold holdings.

          <p>President Trump has stated that his administration is nearing a nuclear deal with Iran, a key objective of his second term, though both sides are far from a consensus on key issues. The major sticking point is whether, under a new deal, Iran would be able to enrich uranium at a lower grade for civilian use or would have to dismantle its program completely. Iran maintains it will never give up its right to civilian nuclear energy, while the U.S. insists that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.

          <p>Seniors should consider Medicare supplemental, long-term care, and whole life insurance policies to enhance their financial protection. Medicare supplemental insurance can fill gaps in coverage, while long-term care insurance can cover nursing home and in-home care costs. Whole life insurance provides a cash value component and benefits beneficiaries after death. Prices for these policies generally increase with age, making it beneficial to research and compile quotes sooner rather than later. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled to broaden the standard for suing police over unreasonable force, permitting the mother of a Houston man killed in a traffic stop to continue an excessive force court claim. The court held that the totality of the circumstances, not just the "moment of threat doctrine," must be used to assess whether the use of police force was "objectively reasonable." The case involves a lawsuit against a Houston Police officer for shooting Ashtian Barnes to death during a traffic stop in 2016.</p>
