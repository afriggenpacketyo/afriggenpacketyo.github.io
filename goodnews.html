          <p>The UK government is proposing an extension to the ban on bottom trawling, a destructive fishing practice, across English waters. The proposal aims to expand the prohibition from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of the UK's offshore Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the urgency of action to prevent irreversible destruction of the oceans. The plan, which is subject to a 12-week industry consultation, follows warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the detrimental effects of bottom trawling on the seabed and marine life.</p>
