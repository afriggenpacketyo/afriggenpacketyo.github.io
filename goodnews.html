          <p>The article discusses the importance of saving money and using savings accounts, especially high-yield ones, to maximize interest earnings. As of May 14, 2025, the national average savings account interest rate is 0.41%, but high-yield savings accounts offer rates between 4.10% and 4.40%. Online banks often provide the best rates due to lower overhead costs, and the article advises comparing different accounts to find the most favorable terms and avoid fees.

          <p>The article, originally published in the New York Times, reports that overdose deaths in the United States fell by nearly 30,000 last year, signaling progress in combating the drug crisis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data showed declines in all major drug categories, with fatalities dropping in most states. Experts attribute this to changes in the illicit drug supply, increased access to treatment, and the use of naloxone. However, despite the progress, drug fatalities remain high, and proposed budget cuts to addiction programs raise concerns about sustaining the improvement.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher due to changes in the economy and policy. Speaking at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference, Powell noted that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon, and the Fed may face challenges from more frequent and persistent supply shocks. While he didn't directly mention President Trump's tariffs, he has previously indicated they could slow growth and increase inflation.</p>
