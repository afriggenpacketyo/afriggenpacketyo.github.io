          <p>British tennis player Cameron Norrie has reached the Wimbledon quarter-finals after a hard-fought victory over Chilean qualifier Nicolas Jarry. The match, which lasted over four hours, saw Norrie win in five sets after initially holding a two-set lead and a match point in the third. Norrie's endurance and determination were key to his success, keeping British hopes alive in the men's singles draw. He is now set to face two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the next round.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris celebrated an emotional first victory at his home British Grand Prix, in a race marked by changing weather and on-track incidents. The McLaren driver inherited the lead after his teammate, Oscar Piastri, received a controversial 10-second penalty for an alleged safety-car infringement while leading. Norris, who sustained a minor facial injury from his trophy during celebrations, expressed immense pride in winning at Silverstone. The event was challenging for all drivers, with Piastri left stewing over a penalty he felt was unjust.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has stated that a new oil pipeline to the British Columbia coast is "highly, highly likely" to be designated a project of national importance. In an interview, Carney indicated that while the government supports such a project, the proposal must come from the private sector. This announcement follows the recent passage of a bill designed to fast-track approvals for major natural resource and infrastructure projects. The move is part of Canada's broader strategy to diversify its energy exports and reduce economic dependence on the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new historical finding may rewrite the story of Vlad the Impaler, the 15th-century prince who inspired the Dracula legend. Researchers in Naples, Italy, claim that a deciphered inscription on a tomb in the Santa Maria la Nova monastic complex confirms it as Vlad's final resting place. This challenges the long-held belief that he was killed in battle in Romania. The theory suggests he was captured, freed by his daughter, and later buried in Naples in the tomb of her father-in-law, which features unusual carvings of a dragon.</p>

          <p>A White House economic adviser has indicated that the "rough outlines" of several international trade deals are becoming clear as a key tariff deadline approaches. With a 90-day pause on sweeping tariffs set to expire, the administration is finalizing some agreements while preparing to send letters to other nations where talks are less advanced. The strategy appears to be encouraging foreign countries to open their markets to US products or face tariffs. The administration believes this approach is also driving a record rate of onshoring production back to the United States. (not investment advice)</p>
