          <p>European stocks opened with mixed results as investors closely monitor the legal battle over President Trump's trade tariffs in the United States. The market's cautious sentiment follows a federal appeals court decision that found most of the tariffs illegal, a ruling the administration is now appealing to the Supreme Court. This uncertainty is creating a tense atmosphere for global trade, with traders awaiting further clarity on the future of the tariffs and upcoming U.S. labor market data, which will influence near-term economic outlooks.

          <p>The Nasdaq stock exchange is proposing a new rule that would require companies primarily operating in China to raise at least $25 million from their public offerings to list in the U.S. This change aims to address concerns over the high volume of small Chinese IPOs that have been associated with "pump and dump" schemes and compliance issues. The move is seen as a way to instill greater investor confidence and protect against manipulative trading activities, though it will make it significantly more difficult for smaller Chinese firms to access U.S. capital markets.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has reversed a lower court's decision, upholding an Illinois law that prohibits carrying firearms on public transit systems like buses and trains. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the decade-old restriction is consistent with the nation's historical tradition of regulating firearms in sensitive and crowded places. The court argued that the Second Amendment does not prevent lawmakers from ensuring public transportation remains free from accessible weapons. The decision is a significant ruling on gun control measures following the Supreme Court's 2022 Bruen decision and is expected to be appealed.</p>

          <p>During a meeting in Beijing, Chinese President Xi Jinping encouraged Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico to help promote positive relations between China and the European Union. Xi praised Slovakia for its friendship with China, particularly noting its opposition to recent EU tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles. The discussion highlights China's strategy of engaging with individual EU member states like Slovakia and Hungary to advocate for its interests within the bloc. Fico's visit underscores his government's populist-led effort to attract Chinese industrial investment and strengthen bilateral ties with Beijing.</p>

          <p>The UK's defense secretary has affirmed that allied nations are prepared to support Ukraine both before any peace negotiations and in securing a final peace deal. Speaking ahead of a high-level meeting in Paris, he stated that allies would help ensure the safety of Ukraine's land, sea, and airspace once an agreement is reached. The statement comes as Western leaders grapple with Russia's defiant stance on the ongoing conflict. The Paris meeting will convene the "Coalition of the Willing" to discuss long-term security guarantees for Ukraine, including the potential deployment of European troops to deter future aggression.</p>

          <p>Most stock markets in the Asia-Pacific region posted gains, taking cues from a technology-driven rally on Wall Street. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a significant increase, led by strong performance from tech stocks like SoftBank Group, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 also climbed following positive household spending data. The upward trend came despite underlying investor fears about the broader economy and continued pressure on global bond markets. In contrast, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index and mainland China's CSI 300 experienced declines in volatile trading sessions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A patient safety initiative known as "Martha's Rule" is being rolled out to all acute hospitals across England, allowing families to request an urgent second medical opinion if they are concerned about a patient's deteriorating condition. The program was established following the death of 13-year-old Martha Mills, whose family's concerns were not heeded by medical staff. A pilot of the program at 143 hospitals has already resulted in nearly 5,000 calls and 241 interventions described as potentially life-saving. The expansion aims to foster a more equal doctor-patient relationship and empower patients and their families to advocate for their care.</p>

The current jackpot run has now reached 41 consecutive drawings without a winner, tying a game record. The massive prize is expected to drive ticket sales even higher, creating a possibility that it could surpass the current second-largest jackpot on record.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts from Historic England have determined that the iconic Sycamore Gap tree was at least 100 to 120 years old when it was illegally cut down in September 2023. By counting the growth rings on a cross-section of the trunk, researchers established a minimum age range for the beloved landmark on Hadrian's Wall. The analysis confirmed that the tree was formed by two separate stems that fused together early in its life. The section of wood is now being preserved in a national collection for further, more detailed analysis to contribute to the tree's remarkable legacy.</p>

          <p>A survey conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Centre suggests that Chinese public opinion on global affairs is more nuanced than often portrayed in the West. While respondents expressed strong national pride and optimism, a plurality of 48% indicated that China is interested in a shared global leadership role rather than outright dominance over the United States. This suggests an acceptance of peaceful coexistence. The findings depict a public that is also skeptical of the U.S. but flexible in its worldview, providing potential avenues for reducing international tensions.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has overturned the Trump administration's decision to cut approximately $2 billion in research funding to Harvard University, ruling that the move violated the institution's First Amendment rights. The administration had frozen the grants in April, citing accusations of antisemitism and "radical left" ideologies at the university. Judge Allison Burroughs stated that the government used these claims as a "smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault" on premier universities. The White House has vowed to appeal the ruling, calling it an "egregious decision" by an activist judge.</p>
