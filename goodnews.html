          <p>Columbia student activist Mohsen Mahdawi, recently released from detention, asserted that President Trump's administration would not silence him. Mahdawi, a green card holder, was detained during his citizenship interview under a rarely used law, which allows the government to revoke visas if the Secretary of State believes someone could pose "adverse foreign policy consequences." Mahdawi, who led protests against the Israel-Hamas war, denies allegations of antisemitism and argues his detention violates his First Amendment rights. A judge ordered his release, citing substantial claims that his detention was retaliation for protected speech, and an appeals court will review his and fellow activist Rumeysa Ozturk's cases.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the North Carolina Board of Elections to certify the results of a State Supreme Court race, marking a significant legal victory for Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs. The ruling rejects Republican challenger Judge Jefferson Griffin's attempts to discard thousands of ballots, with the judge stating that changing election rules post-election would violate voters' due process rights. The case, which has ping-ponged through state and federal courts, has raised concerns about future efforts to overturn election results. Riggs declared victory, stating she is proud to continue upholding the Constitution as North Carolina's Supreme Court Justice.</p>

          <p>A newly declassified memo confirms that U.S. intelligence agencies rejected a key claim President Trump put forth to justify invoking the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans. The memo states that spy agencies do not believe Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro controls the Tren de Aragua gang, contradicting Trump's assertion. This release further undercuts the administration's rationale for using the wartime statute and calls into question its criticism of media coverage. The Justice Department had even opened a criminal investigation into leaks related to the story, but the declassification proves that the material should have been public from the start.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to restrict access to the abortion pill mifepristone, aligning with the Biden administration's stance. The Justice Department argues that the case, filed by conservative attorneys general, does not meet the legal standard to be heard in the Texas court. The filing avoids addressing the merits of the case, which challenges FDA decisions that expanded access to mifepristone. This move may reflect a cautious political approach on abortion, given recent election results and changing public sentiment.</p>
