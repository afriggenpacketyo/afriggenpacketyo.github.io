          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed to 5.1% in April, missing analyst expectations and indicating ongoing concerns about consumption in the world's second-largest economy. While industrial output exceeded forecasts, the property sector continues to struggle, with fixed-asset investment growth slightly below expectations. The urban unemployment rate saw a slight decrease, but the National Bureau of Statistics cautioned about unstable external factors and the need for further economic recovery consolidation. Despite trade war fears receding due to recent negotiations, the article suggests China's economic recovery remains fragile. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The South Solon Meeting House in Maine holds a unique secret: its interior is adorned with 70-year-old fresco murals, earning it the moniker "the Sistine Chapel of Maine." Painted by artists in the 1950s, these murals have recently gained renewed attention thanks to a website created by Colby College students. The meeting house, built in 1842, serves as a space for community gatherings and artistic events, inspiring a greater appreciation for public art. The murals depict biblical scenes, including references to Leonardo da Vinci's "The Last Supper" and Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones, according to a statement from his office.

While the cancer is Stage 4, doctors believe it is hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management. President Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris have issued supportive statements, wishing Mr. Biden a speedy recovery.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have discovered a perfectly spherical bubble in the Milky Way galaxy, baffling scientists as to its origin. Named Teleios, after the ancient Greek word for "perfection," the object appears to be a supernova remnant that glows faintly in radio wavelengths. The challenge lies in determining its distance, with estimates suggesting either 7,175 or 25,114 light-years away, which drastically alters the understanding of its size and age. The lack of X-ray emissions predicted by supernova models adds another layer of mystery to this unique celestial object.</p>

          <p>A senior Asian economist suggests that China's yuan has the potential to rival the US dollar as a global currency if Beijing liberalizes convertibility and access for foreigners. The yuan already works effectively in cross-border purchase settlements, but China needs to deepen its financial markets to allow greater foreign access to yuan-denominated assets. Convertibility remains a concern among investors outside the mainland, but increased accessibility could position the yuan as a viable alternative to the dollar.</p>
