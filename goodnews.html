          <h2>US Housing Market Slowdown Shifts Power to Buyers as Sellers Reduce Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 07:16:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US housing market is experiencing a significant slowdown, forcing many sellers to lower their asking prices and offer concessions to attract a smaller pool of buyers. High home values and mortgage rates have priced many shoppers out of the market, leading to an increase in housing inventory, particularly in Southern and Western states. While the national median home price saw a slight increase, metro areas like Austin and Miami experienced declines. This shift in market dynamics marks a change from the seller-dominated environment of recent years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's cricket coach, Brendon McCullum, has stated that the team for the first Ashes Test against Australia, beginning November 21st, has not yet been finalized. A key position in question is the number three batter, with a choice between vice-captain Ollie Pope and 21-year-old Jacob Bethell, who recently scored his first professional century. McCullum praised Bethell's potential and leadership qualities, noting he will captain an under-strength side against Ireland. The coach also emphasized the need for player rest, pulling key players from upcoming T20 matches.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals a growing divergence in US union membership based on state laws, with numbers increasing in states that protect collective bargaining and decreasing in "right-to-work" states. The 26 right-to-work states, concentrated in the South and central US, have a union density of just 5.1% compared to 14.2% elsewhere. The study highlights that states like Illinois and Michigan saw significant union growth after strengthening labor protections. The findings underscore a national debate, as lawmakers reintroduce legislation to invalidate right-to-work laws nationwide.</p>

          <p>China's top economic planning agency has unveiled an ambitious strategy to integrate artificial intelligence across its energy sector, aiming for global leadership by 2030. The National Development and Reform Commission plans to roll out at least five industry-specific AI models for power grids, coal, oil, and gas industries. By 2027, the goal is to establish a comprehensive framework, develop over 100 application scenarios, and create innovation platforms to train specialists. This initiative seeks to enhance efficiency and drive technological breakthroughs in what Beijing terms "smart energy."</p>

          <h2>Economists Suggest Economic Uncertainty, Not AI, is the Primary Cause of Recent Job Market Slowdown</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 07:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While artificial intelligence is causing some disruption, labor economists assert that its overall impact on the job market remains small, with broader economic uncertainty being the main driver of recent hiring slowdowns. Experts note that most AI-related layoffs have been confined to the tech industry, which represents a relatively small portion of the total workforce. A Stanford study found that AI's negative employment effects are concentrated among early-career workers in automatable roles. Meanwhile, demand for workers with AI skills is increasing, suggesting a trend towards augmentation rather than replacement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Goethe-Institut USA has launched a cultural campaign, "Among Friends," to encourage German-American dialogue during a period of strained relations. The initiative begins with a four-week reading tour by two young German authors, Sonali Beher and Iven Yorick Fenker, who will travel from New York to Texas. The authors aim to engage with Americans and share their perspectives as representatives of a youthful, diverse Germany under President Trump's second term.

          <p>A resurgence of interest in nuclear energy is being driven by the massive power demands of AI and data centers, but significant investment challenges remain. While tech giants are investing, the sector faces hurdles such as vast capital requirements, long construction times, and regulatory uncertainty, which deter many financial institutions. Small modular reactors (SMRs) offer a more scalable solution but are not yet commercially available. The article notes that government support, as seen with the Trump administration's push to fast-track reactor development, is still considered crucial for mitigating financial risks.
