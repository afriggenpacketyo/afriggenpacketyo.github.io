          <p>Non-profit organizations like Black People Will Swim are working to combat the historical legacy of segregation that has led to significant disparities in swimming ability among Black Americans. Due to decades of exclusion from public pools, Black children are nearly eight times more likely to drown in pools than their white counterparts. The initiative provides lessons and scholarships to make swimming more accessible, aiming to create a ripple effect of more Black swim instructors and lifeguards. By addressing this public health crisis, founders hope to ensure that no one faces barriers to safely connecting with water.</p>

          <p>Global pop star Dua Lipa has been granted Kosovo citizenship in a ceremony hosted by President Vjosa Osmani, who hailed her as an iconic cultural figure. Born in London to Kosovan-Albanian parents, Lipa has frequently expressed her connection to the country and co-founded the Sunny Hill Festival there to promote a positive image of Kosovo. The singer, who now holds British, Albanian, and Kosovan citizenship, stated the honor "completes the duality I have always had within." The move celebrates her efforts in representing the nation on the world stage.</p>

The micronation, which began as an experiment among friends, now claims nearly 400 citizens from over 15,000 applicants and has its own flag and government structure. Jackson's attempts to settle the land have been met with resistance from Croatian authorities, who deported him and issued a lifetime ban. Despite these setbacks, he continues to operate a "government in exile" and remains optimistic about establishing a permanent settlement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has surprisingly surpassed California in the addition of new utility-scale solar capacity, driven primarily by economic factors rather than climate policy. Utilities like Florida Power & Light are leading the charge, taking advantage of streamlined regulations for projects under 75 megawatts, which reduces costs and construction time. The state's growth is fueled by the fact that solar has become cheaper than natural gas, making it an attractive option for meeting rising industrial energy demand. However, future growth faces challenges from the rollback of federal tax credits and increasing strain on the existing power grid. (not investment advice)</p>

Leclerc, who expressed his own disbelief, delivered a stellar final lap in tricky, windy conditions to beat Piastri by just 0.026 seconds. The result was a surprise as McLaren had appeared dominant throughout the weekend, while other top contenders like Red Bull's Max Verstappen and Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton struggled, qualifying eighth and twelfth respectively. Aston Martin showed a significant resurgence, with Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll securing the third row.</p>

          <p>A new generation of women is seeking relief from menopause symptoms through holistic programs like the M/Power retreat at Canyon Ranch, which offers education, counseling, and activities such as yoga and weight training. These retreats aim to empower women by providing medical diagnostics, community support, and tools to manage symptoms like hot flashes, anxiety, and sleep disruption. Experts and authors are also working to destigmatize the experience, advocating for better medical training and open conversations. The trend reflects a growing movement to address menopause as a significant health chapter rather than an end to be suffered in silence.</p>

          <h2>Dermatologist Evaluates Using Hand Sanitizer as an Emergency Deodorant</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A popular online hack suggests using hand sanitizer on armpits as a makeshift deodorant in an emergency, a method some users have found effective. A board-certified dermatologist explains that the alcohol in hand sanitizer can temporarily kill odor-causing bacteria, which is the root cause of body odor. However, she warns against regular use, as the high alcohol content can cause significant irritation, dryness, and is particularly risky on sensitive or recently shaved skin. For a gentler alternative, the dermatologist recommends cleansing the area with antibacterial soap and water when in a bind.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in Frontiers in Psychology indicates that aligning fitness activities with personality traits may lead to greater enjoyment and consistency. Researchers found that extroverts often prefer high-intensity group workouts like HIIT or team sports, while conscientious individuals are drawn to goal-oriented activities like marathon training. Conversely, those with higher levels of anxiety may benefit more from private, one-on-one sessions, and introverts tend to favor solo exercises like running or at-home yoga. The findings suggest that people can find a more sustainable fitness routine by exploring different options that better match their disposition.</p>

          <p>A review of a new memoir by a rural mail carrier highlights the vital role postal workers play in providing order and predictability, especially in a country feeling the strain of crisis. The article reflects on the logistical feats required to deliver mail to even the most remote communities in America, such as the village of Supai at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. It frames the daily consistency of mail delivery as a form of quiet heroism. This service helps communities maintain a sense of normalcy and connection, demonstrating the reliance on a fundamental federal bureaucracy.</p>

          <p>Marc Maron's new HBO Max special, "Panicked," is reviewed as the culmination of a loose trilogy of work that blends his signature cantankerous humor with deep self-reflection. The special sees Maron grappling with personal anxieties, such as his father's dementia and childhood trauma, alongside broader societal ills like political polarization and climate change. The article notes that while Maron's temperament may have softened over the years, his core comedic style of excavating humor from emotional vulnerability remains constant. His work is framed not as simple entertainment, but as a consistent, truthful exploration of a psyche navigating a chaotic world.</p>

          <p>Major restaurant chains like Chipotle, Taco Bell, and Wendy's are increasingly adding spicy menu items as a low-cost strategy to attract Gen Z and Gen Alpha customers. These younger generations show a strong preference for bold and adventurous flavors, often driven by social media trends like taste tests and spicy food challenges on TikTok. For restaurants facing slower consumer spending, introducing a new spicy sauce or ingredient is an easier and more cost-effective way to create buzz than launching a new protein. This trend is also being fueled by the growing diversity of younger consumers and their interest in global flavors.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Unlike global trends of declining religious affiliation, many young people in India are embracing spirituality, but on their own terms. India's Gen Z is personalizing their faith, focusing less on rigid rituals and more on finding peace, community, and a coping mechanism for mental health challenges. This modern approach often involves engaging with spiritual content online, listening to podcasts, and visiting religious sites for the experience rather than out of obligation. This cultural shift is also influenced by a political climate promoting Hindu traditions and the accessibility of spiritual concepts through social media.</p>
