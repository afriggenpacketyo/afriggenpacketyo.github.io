          <p>Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk announced a 67% increase in second-quarter sales for its popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy, although this figure fell slightly short of analyst expectations. Despite the surge, the company's stock has been declining due to softer U.S. sales, increased competition, and pressure from the White House to lower prescription drug prices. In response, Novo Nordisk has pledged to implement cost-cutting measures and sharpen its commercial focus under a new CEO. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the untapped tactical potential of throw-ins in football, arguing they are an overlooked resource largely unchanged since the 19th century. Citing Rory Delap's famous long throws for Stoke City as a rare example of innovation, it suggests teams could train specialists and develop complex set-plays similar to corners. A key advantage is that the offside rule does not apply to throw-ins, opening up creative attacking possibilities that most teams currently fail to exploit, often resorting to predictable and ineffective plays.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has launched two new open-source AI models, GPT-OSS-120b and GPT-OSS-20b, marking a significant strategic shift for the company, which had not released an open model since 2019. The move is widely seen as a direct challenge to the growing influence of Chinese open-source models, such as Alibaba's Qwen family, in the global AI landscape. While analysts note that China still leads in the sheer number of available open models, OpenAI's new high-performance offerings aim to reclaim leadership in this critical area of AI development.</p>

The results set up a competitive race, with Wilson aiming to prevent Harrell from becoming the city's first mayor in two decades to win re-election.</p>

The region was one of 12 province-level areas flagged by Beijing for having risky debt levels, which had previously forced it to halt major infrastructure projects. This development signals progress in Beijing's efforts to restructure local finances and move away from a debt-fueled growth model that has become increasingly unsustainable.

          <p>The article analyzes the significant challenges athletes from other sports, like Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit, face when trying to transition to the NFL. Key obstacles include the immense complexity of learning an NFL playbook, which one former player described as more difficult than studying for the bar exam. Another major factor is the sheer depth of athletic talent in American football's "skill positions," where hundreds of players possess similar speed and athleticism, making it incredibly difficult for an outsider to stand out without years of ingrained "football IQ."</p>

          <h2>China Increases Coffee Bean Imports from Africa Amid Surging Domestic Demand</h2>

          <p>China is actively strengthening its coffee supply chains from top African producers like Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Uganda, driven by a significant surge in domestic coffee consumption. This strategic push aims to "lock in supply" and is being led by rapidly expanding Chinese coffee brands such as Cotti Coffee. The move leverages a zero-tariff policy for certain African nations and capitalizes on global trade uncertainties, reflecting China's broader strategy of securing essential commodity imports to meet the demands of its growing middle class.</p>

          <p>Max Muncy made a powerful return to the Dodgers' lineup, hitting two home runs and driving in four runs to lead his team to a 12-6 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals.

His comeback, along with strong hitting from teammates Teoscar Hernández and Mookie Betts, suggests a potential turnaround for the team's recently slumping lineup as it pushes through the latter part of the season.</p>

          <p>A shortage of available rockets in China is creating a divide between national space projects and commercial ambitions, potentially forcing Beijing to prioritize one candidate to compete with SpaceX's Starlink. The state-backed Guo Wang network has recently seen a sharp increase in launches using Long March rockets, indicating it is receiving preferential access to launch capacity. This has left other aspiring satellite internet companies, like Shanghai's Qianfan, to seek launches from private rocket firms to deploy their own constellations, highlighting the resource constraints in China's space industry.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of a medium-security state prison in Norco by fall 2026, citing a declining statewide inmate population and significant cost savings. The facility, which houses nearly 3,000 inmates, will be shuttered as part of a broader trend of deactivating correctional facilities in the state. The move is attributed to criminal justice reforms and falling crime rates, with the state expected to save $150 million annually and support the local community through an economic resiliency plan.</p>
