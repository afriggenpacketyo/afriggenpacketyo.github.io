          <p>Dr. Sunita Puri, a palliative care physician, reflects on the importance of living with an awareness of mortality. Drawing from patient experiences and cultural examples, she emphasizes that confronting death can clarify how we truly wish to live. Puri suggests that reflection on mortality often leads to a desire for a more complicated version of the ordinary rather than extreme or novel pursuits, such as wanting to take a long-postponed trip or reconcile with estranged family members.</p>

Imprisonment is no longer categorized by labor, and prison work is no longer mandatory, allowing more time for rehabilitative guidance and education. The revised law introduces 24 tailored programs based on an inmate's age, characteristics, and other factors, including programs for the elderly and those with addiction issues. Inmates will be sent to prisons offering appropriate programs, with their situation reviewed every six months.</p>
