          <p>Minnesota Vikings head coach Kevin O’Connell inadvertently used an expletive during a live television interview on the team's broadcast. The incident occurred in the third quarter of a preseason game against the New England Patriots while O'Connell was providing commentary on a play. He expressed frustration when he noticed an illegal motion penalty on his team, which nullified a first down, leading to the on-air profanity. The moment highlighted why NFL coaches are typically not mic'd up for live interviews during games, as broadcasts usually edit such language out.</p>

The Spanish golfer secured the title despite losing in a playoff to Sebastian Munoz at the event in Indiana. Rahm's overall performance throughout the season was strong enough to place him ahead of his closest competitor, Joaquin Niemann. The result also had positive implications for European golfers Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter, who avoided relegation from the league for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Fiona Begg, a 28-year-old woman in Ontario, rescued a stray cat after she saw it get struck by a truck during her morning walk. She immediately stopped traffic, picked up the injured animal, and rushed it to a nearby veterinary clinic, where staff initially believed it was unlikely to survive. Days later, the clinic called to inform her the cat, now named Lucky Chance, had pulled through but had no owner, prompting Begg to adopt him. A TikTok video she made about the rescue went viral, and she is now focused on helping the cat recover from his injuries, including a broken tooth that will require surgery.</p>

          <p>An early mistake by Manchester United's goalkeeper Altay Bayindir led to a 1-0 defeat against Arsenal at Old Trafford. United's coach Ruben Amorim had chosen Bayindir over the recently fit Andre Onana, a decision that came under scrutiny after the error. Bayindir failed to handle a corner kick, allowing Riccardo Calafiori to score the only goal of the match in the 13th minute. Despite an improved attacking performance from United, they were unable to equalize, placing the team's goalkeeping situation back in the spotlight after the opening day loss.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns over inflation, slowing growth, and trade policy, the stock market's resilience can be attributed to the strong outlook for corporate earnings. The "bottom line" in both a literal accounting sense and a figurative sense points to earnings as the primary driver of stock prices. While risks like new tariffs could pressure profit margins, Corporate America has historically shown an ability to adapt and maintain profitability. Analysts' forecasts for the next one to three years remain optimistic, suggesting that as long as companies are expected to deliver on earnings, the market is likely to remain supported.

This development came after the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska and ahead of a meeting in Washington with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders. Zelenskyy called the potential U.S. participation in such guarantees a "historic decision" that must be practical and developed with European involvement.</p>

Lynch also shared his strategy of looking for excellent companies within struggling or overlooked industries, as fast-growing sectors often attract too much competition.

During a preseason game, Gabriel distinguished between "entertainers" and "competitors," leading to social media speculation that he was referencing the highly publicized Sanders. Gabriel later clarified his remarks, stating he was referring to the media as entertainers and himself and his teammates as competitors. The two rookie quarterbacks are currently competing for position on the team's depth chart behind the expected starter, Joe Flacco.</p>

          <p>Despite fielding an attack built with £250 million in new signings, Chelsea was held to a 0-0 draw by Crystal Palace in their Premier League season opener. New players like Joao Pedro, Jamie Gittens, and Estevao Willian were unable to find the back of the net, with the team managing only three shots on target. While the result was disappointing, underlying statistics like expected goals (xG) suggest Chelsea created enough chances to score, pointing to a combination of poor finishing and bad luck. Manager Enzo Maresca expressed confidence that the team will improve as the new players acclimate and build chemistry.</p>
