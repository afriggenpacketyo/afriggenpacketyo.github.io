          <p>Australians are heading to the polls to elect their next government amidst economic challenges and geopolitical tensions. Voters are primarily concerned with the rising cost of living and housing affordability, overshadowing global issues stemming from Washington. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of the Labor Party is seeking a second term, while Peter Dutton leads the opposition coalition, with both offering modest economic solutions. The New York Times article notes that voters are increasingly shifting away from major parties, favoring independent candidates and minor parties, indicating a desire for deeper solutions to the country's problems.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to curb the rise of the Hong Kong dollar due to increased capital inflow. This action, the first in two years, involved the purchase of US dollars and the sale of Hong Kong dollars to maintain the currency's trading band. The intervention precedes a US Federal Reserve meeting where interest rate cuts are expected, which could further stimulate capital inflow into Hong Kong. The HKMA stated it will continue to monitor the market to ensure orderly operations in Hong Kong's money and foreign exchange markets.</p>

          <p>The elimination of the tariff exemption for inexpensive goods entering the U.S. is affecting online retailers like Temu and Shein, as well as tech giants like Meta and Alphabet. These retailers, known for low-cost items from Chinese factories, relied heavily on digital advertising to attract American shoppers. The new tariffs are expected to significantly impact these companies, leading to reduced advertising spending and potentially affecting Meta and Alphabet's revenue. Temu has already stopped direct shipping from China, transitioning to a local fulfillment model, according to the New York Times article.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has struck down President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie, deeming it unconstitutional and an attack on the American legal system. The NPR article highlights that the ruling is the first to permanently block an executive order punishing a law firm for representing clients Trump dislikes. Judge Howell framed the targeting of Perkins as an attack on the independence of the legal profession and the judicial system.</p>
