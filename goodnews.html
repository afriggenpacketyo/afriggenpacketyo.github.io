          <p>Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, stated that while he is a strong ally of President Trump, he does not want to be held responsible for every policy decision made by the administration. Musk's comments came after his tenure leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which faced criticism for job cuts and spending policies. He expressed disappointment with the GOP's multitrillion-dollar tax and spending package, suggesting it undermines DOGE's efforts. Musk's remarks highlight a potential rift between him and the administration regarding fiscal responsibility and government spending. Optimism surrounding the administration's goals is somewhat tempered by internal disagreements and criticisms.</p>
