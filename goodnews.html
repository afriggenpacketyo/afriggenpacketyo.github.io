          <p>German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil is scheduled to present the initial draft of the 2025 budget, which has been delayed due to national elections in February. This budget follows Germany's parliament approval in March of a significant fiscal package that includes modifications to debt policies, facilitating increased spending on defense and a ‚Ç¨500 billion infrastructure fund. The announcement will come after a press conference, scheduled for 10:45 a.m. (0845 GMT/UTC), where further details are expected to be revealed. The budget's focus on defense and infrastructure reflects Germany's strategic priorities for the coming year. The budget update is highly anticipated given the economic challenges facing the country. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire, following a week of aerial attacks that began after Israel's strike on Iran's nuclear program. Iran reportedly launched a missile attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar in response to the U.S. sending B-2 bombers to drop 14 Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs on Iranian nuclear sites. Trump stated that "Monumental Damage was done to all Nuclear sites in Iran," though a full battle damage assessment is pending. The ceasefire announcement comes after escalating tensions and military actions between the two countries, with the U.S. playing a significant role in mediating the agreement.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a "Complete and Total" ceasefire, aiming to end the weeklong conflict, although Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi's remarks suggested less certainty about the agreement. According to Trump's timeline, Iran would cease striking Israel within six hours, followed by Israel ceasing strikes on Iran 12 hours later, with the war considered over after another 12 hours. Araghchi indicated Iran had already stopped its strikes but stated there was no formal agreement on a ceasefire, and the final decision on ceasing military operations would be made later. The conflict began with Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets, prompting Iranian counterattacks on Israel, and the U.S. took military action against Iran over the weekend.</p>

          <p>President Trump took a gamble by involving the U.S. in the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, which may have resulted in a potential ceasefire. Trump announced that the two countries agreed to a ceasefire that could lead to lasting peace, although neither Israel nor Iran has definitively confirmed the development. White House officials are privately promoting this as a diplomatic breakthrough after U.S. airstrikes hit Iranian nuclear facilities. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi indicated that Iran would halt its attacks if Israel stopped its aggression, leading to a de-escalation after a day of Iranian missile strikes on a U.S. base in Qatar.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel after U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Republican lawmakers have widely congratulated the president. Democrats, however, appear to be withholding their congratulations, with no immediate congratulatory messages from Democrat congressional leadership. Republicans praised Trump's negotiating skills, while Democrats, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, expressed concern over the president's unilateral military actions without congressional approval. Rep. Thomas Massie, who had been pushing for congressional approval before attacking Iran, stated he would not advance the measure due to the ceasefire.</p>
