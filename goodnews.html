          <p>Nvidia's shares rose to a record high, buoyed by investor confidence in the company's leadership in artificial intelligence, despite export controls affecting its access to the Chinese market. The stock increased nearly 3%, reaching $153.55, surpassing its previous intraday record and making Nvidia the world's largest company by market capitalization at $3.7 trillion, slightly ahead of Microsoft. Nvidia remains the dominant player in graphics processing units (GPUs) used for large language models and AI workloads. The rally is surprising given the company's limitations in accessing the world's second-largest economy. The stock market's movement is a positive sign for the economy. </p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers is pushing to ban Chinese artificial intelligence systems from federal agencies, aiming to ensure the U.S. maintains its lead in the global AI race. The hearing on Capitol Hill follows concerns that China is catching up to the U.S. in AI development, despite restrictions on chips and key technologies. Witnesses emphasized the importance of winning the AI competition, highlighting the built-in values in AI systems and the need to control the flow of powerful chips to China. The proposed No Adversarial AI Act seeks to identify and ban AI systems developed by foreign adversaries within the U.S. government, with exceptions for research and counter-terrorism purposes. The U.S. government is taking steps to protect itself. </p>

          <p>BlackRock's Rick Rieder expressed confidence in the stock market's potential for further gains in the second half of 2025, citing the deflationary impact of artificial intelligence. Rieder believes that productivity gains from AI will offset any inflationary pressures from tariffs, which he views as a one-time adjustment for the U.S. economy. He also anticipates that the U.S. economy will avoid a recession due to its reliance on services rather than cyclical goods. Rieder's comments come as the S&P 500 approaches its record high, indicating optimism despite macroeconomic challenges. The economy has potential for growth. </p>

          <p>NATO leaders have agreed to increase defense spending to 5% of their countries' economic output by 2035, following pressure from President Trump. The decision was made at a summit in The Hague, with members stating their unity against security challenges, including the threat posed by Russia and terrorism. They reaffirmed their commitment to the principle that an attack on one NATO member would trigger a response from the entire alliance. The commitment involves at least 3.5% of each member state's GDP on core defense expenditure by 2035, plus up to 1.5% on security infrastructure. The alliance is taking steps to increase its strength. </p>

          <p>NASA's Curiosity rover has captured the first close-up images of ridges on Mars, providing evidence of how water once flowed on the planet. The images show ancient groundwater in crisscrossing low ridges, arranged in a "boxwork pattern," across miles of a mountain. Scientists believe the bedrock below these ridges formed when groundwater trickled through the rock, leaving behind minerals that hardened and became cement-like. The ridges also contain small fractures filled with calcium sulfate, which had not been found before in this part of Mount Sharp. This discovery provides new insights into Mars's history and potential for past life. The possibility of past life is exciting. </p>

          <p>A Los Angeles judge ruled that the California FAIR Plan's smoke-damage policy violates state law by providing less coverage than required, a decision that could impact many homeowners. The ruling stated that the FAIR Plan's requirement for "permanent physical changes" to a property to qualify for fire claims violates the insurance code. The FAIR Plan's handling of smoke-damage claims has been criticized by homeowners, who claim they received low-ball offers and were told to clean up their properties themselves. This decision could have broad implications for the FAIR Plan, which has seen significant growth as insurers pull out of California's home insurance market. The decision may lead to changes in insurance policy. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A credit card grace period is the time between the end of your billing cycle and your payment due date when you won't be charged interest on new purchases, but only if you pay your full statement balance by the due date. It's a temporary, interest-free loan typically lasting 21 to 25 days, allowing users to earn rewards without incurring interest charges if balances are paid in full each month. Carrying a balance from month to month typically results in losing the grace period, causing new purchases to accrue interest immediately. Cash advances rarely have a grace period, and balance transfers may or may not, depending on the card's terms. The proper use of credit cards can help people. (not investment advice)</p>

Gavin Newsom and state legislative leaders have agreed to increase the annual allocation to $750 million, more than doubling the current cap of $330 million. An Assembly bill would further expand the incentive program, increasing the tax credit up to 35% for productions in the greater Los Angeles area and up to 40% outside the region. The proposal aims to help Hollywood compete with other states and countries offering generous tax incentives. The film industry in California may be saved. </p>
