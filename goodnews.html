        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency in Germany reported a record number of complaints in 2024, indicating a growing problem with discrimination. Racism remains the most common form, with over 3,800 reports, while sexism is also on the rise, particularly in the workplace, where women face sexual harassment and career disadvantages. The Commissioner for Anti-Discrimination emphasizes the need for legal reform to protect individuals from discrimination by state institutions, as current laws offer better protection in supermarkets than in schools or government offices. The commissioner argues that discrimination harms the economy, democracy, and the constitutional state as a whole, and decisive action is needed. Optimism is seen in the increased awareness of rights and willingness to stand up against discrimination.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meta has entered into a 20-year agreement with Constellation Energy to purchase 1.1 gigawatts of nuclear power from the Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois, starting in 2027. This deal will support the plant's continued operation and relicensing, preventing its potential closure due to the expiration of zero-emission credits. The agreement expands Clinton's output by 30 megawatts and contributes to Meta's goal of 100% clean electricity. This move aligns Meta with other tech giants investing in nuclear energy to meet the increasing power demands of data centers, as the industry is hoping that SMRs can be a more cost-effective way to scale up nuclear power.</p>

          <h2>Manufacturing's Potential Role in Bridging the Prosperity Gap Between Heartland and Superstar Cities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-03 06:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores whether revitalizing manufacturing can help the American heartland catch up with prosperous "superstar cities." Manufacturing is considered special due to the good-paying jobs it provides, particularly for those without a college education, and its potential to foster economic growth in struggling regions. Manufacturing is a "tradable sector" that brings new wealth into a community, creating additional jobs and supporting local businesses. While manufacturing, especially advanced manufacturing, can be a seed for greater economic prosperity for local communities, there is a debate over whether politicians can effectively revitalize this sector and whether its regional effects will unfold as desired.

The club is reportedly pleased with the news, as they were never presented with a formal bid to reject. Fernandes has made 290 appearances and scored 98 goals for Manchester United since joining in January 2020.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues in favor of adding work requirements to Medicaid, drawing on the author's 46 years of experience in America‚Äôs job training system. The author contends that work rules provide a push for individuals on welfare and other benefit programs to enter the job world, offering support networks for job placement and retention. The author emphasizes that previous implementations of work requirements have resulted in increased employment and other life benefits for participants, their families, and local communities. The proposed Medicaid work rules exclude certain recipients, and the author believes America has a vast workforce network ready to provide job placement services. (not investment advice)</p>

Ueda also noted that market participants generally see continued reductions in government bond purchases as appropriate for normalizing policy.
