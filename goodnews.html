          <p>Dogs are increasingly becoming integral to wedding ceremonies in the UK, with many couples featuring their pets as ring bearers, flower girls, or greeters. Services specializing in dog chaperoning for weddings are expanding rapidly due to high demand, reflecting a growing trend of treating dogs as cherished family members who provide emotional support. These professional services handle everything from temperament checks to mini-grooms, ensuring the dogs are well-cared for and prepared for their roles, often "stealing the show" and adding unique joy. The article also highlights the essential role of guide dogs in owners' lives, though finding suitable venues that accommodate both pets and accessibility needs can be a challenge.</p>

          <p>Europe is enduring a prolonged and severe heatwave, with temperatures reaching record highs across the continent from Paris to Madrid, underscoring its unpreparedness for extreme climate conditions. This intense heat has led to a nearly 60% jump in Chinese air conditioner exports to Europe by volume in July, compared to the previous year. Chinese brands, which dominate about 80% of the global AC market, are significantly benefiting from this increased demand. The situation highlights both the escalating impact of global warming and the resulting economic opportunities for cooling unit manufacturers.</p>

          <p>The owner of OnlyFans, Leonid Radvinsky, received a substantial $701 million in dividends last year, as the subscription-based content platform, known for adult content, prepares for a potential multibillion-dollar sale. The UK-based company reported a 9% revenue increase to $1.4 billion in its 2024 financial year, with pre-tax profits rising to $683.6 million. This growth was fueled by a 13% increase in creator accounts and a 24% rise in fan accounts, demonstrating the platform's expanding user base and profitability. Radvinsky has now received over $1 billion in dividends from the business, with reports suggesting a sale for $8 billion is being considered. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European stocks, including the Stoxx 600 and FTSE 100, saw further declines as traders reacted to the detailed announcement of the EU-U.S. trade deal. The agreement confirms the EU will invest at least $600 billion in the U.S. and spend $750 billion on U.S. energy, with tariffs on most EU goods set at 15%. A key detail revealed that pharmaceuticals exported from the EU to the U.S. would also face a 15% tariff cap, alleviating earlier concerns about much higher rates. However, automotive stocks fell due to the conditional nature of lower tariffs, dependent on Brussels reducing its own industrial duties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has backed down from imposing tariffs as high as 250% on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors imported from the European Union, a significant development in the ongoing trade negotiations. New details of the US-EU agreement confirm that these sectors will now face a 15% tariff, aligning with most other goods covered by the deal, providing relief for major European exporters like Ireland. However, the reduction of tariffs on European car exports to 15% from 27.5% is conditional on the EU first passing legislation to reduce its own tariffs on US industrial goods to zero. This agreement aims to provide predictability for businesses and stability in the world's largest trading partnership. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate cooled to 3.1% in July, a slight decrease from 3.3% the previous month, though still exceeding economists' expectations of 3%. This marks the lowest headline inflation since November 2024, partly due to easing rice prices after a period of significant shortages and skyrocketing costs. Despite the moderation, the 3.1% figure represents the 40th consecutive month that inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target. Analysts suggest that easing food inflation could support a potential rate hike by the BOJ in the coming months, contrasting with past "too little too late" policies. (not investment advice)</p>

This development is drawing significant attention from the global Sikh community, who see it as a breakthrough for representation in British football, a sport where they have been historically underrepresented. The new owners emphasize bringing Sikh principles like discipline, trustfulness, and compassion to the club, aiming to change the narrative of football ownership. This clear representation is expected to inspire more Sikhs and other underrepresented groups to pursue their dreams within the sport.</p>

          <p>Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been acquitted by a Bangkok court of charges of insulting the monarchy, a ruling that brings relief to his family's political movement. The charges stemmed from a 2015 interview where he suggested "people in the palace" instigated a 2014 coup, which prosecutors argued violated Thailand's strict lese majeste law. The court's decision, interpreting the law literally and finding insufficient evidence, is considered unusual as acquittals in such cases are rare. This verdict comes as Thaksin's daughter, suspended PM Paetongtarn, faces a separate Constitutional Court decision, highlighting ongoing political challenges for the Shinawatra clan.</p>

Under the new rules, claimants outside the UK for more than eight weeks will generally become ineligible for the benefit, unless under exceptional circumstances. A new specialist team, expanded to over 200 investigators, will utilize travel data to identify ineligible claimants. This initiative follows a pilot program that saved £17 million by stopping incorrect payments to 2,600 people, addressing a broader increase in benefit overpayments, estimated at £6.5 billion in 2024/25, since the pandemic.</p>

This newly identified mechanism offers crucial insights into how corn has evolved to sense and respond to its environment. Researchers observed through field surveys that densely planted corn in inner rows suffered less herbivore damage compared to those at the edges, though they also exhibited reduced growth. Optimizing the release of this gas could potentially combat pests and increase crop yield, opening new avenues for agricultural strategies to enhance plant defense and productivity.</p>
