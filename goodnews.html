          <p>The World Athletics Championships in Tokyo have begun under grueling weather conditions, with temperatures reaching 30°C and humidity exceeding 90%. Athletes in the opening 35km race walk described the conditions as "absolutely brutal," with one Japanese competitor collapsing after finishing. Organizers have moved start times for some events earlier to mitigate health risks, as a heatwave is expected to intensify. Despite the challenging weather, the event marks a celebratory return of major sports with spectators to Tokyo, four years after the city hosted a spectator-free Olympic Games.</p>

Although Mater Dei mounted a dramatic comeback to take the lead in the third quarter, Centennial rallied in the fourth to secure the victory. The win is a significant upset in Southern California high school football, marking Mater Dei's first loss to a regional team other than St. John Bosco in a decade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Line dancing is undergoing a significant resurgence in popularity, shedding its old-fashioned image and attracting a younger, more diverse audience. The revival is largely attributed to the mainstream success of country-pop artists and viral trends on platforms like TikTok, where choreographed dances have gained massive traction. Instructors and participants note that classes are now filled with teenagers and young adults, a stark contrast to the previously older demographic. This modern iteration of line dancing incorporates a wide range of music genres, further broadening its appeal and breaking down old stereotypes.</p>

In the first minute of availability, sales surpassed the entire first-day volume of last year's iPhone 16 series, with the standard 256GB model proving most popular. The high demand caused accessibility issues on Apple's official website, and in-store pickup slots in major cities like Shanghai were fully booked within minutes.

Commemorating a 50-year history of diplomatic engagement that began with a visit from a Bavarian politician to Beijing, the minister emphasized that protectionism is not the solution to achieving economic resilience. The statement signals Bavaria's continued desire to maintain strong economic ties with major partners like China, the USA, and Japan, highlighting the region's pragmatic approach to international commerce.

          <p>Michele Kang, the American owner of London City Lionesses, Washington Spirit, and Lyon, is transforming women's football with her hands-on, multi-club ownership model. She has invested heavily in infrastructure, staff, and female-specific research, propelling the Lionesses into the Women's Super League. Kang argues that this model is a necessity for growth in the women's game, as it allows for pooled resources and shared expertise in areas like global scouting and research. Her approach focuses on building a compelling on-field product to attract fans and sponsors, rather than relying on affiliations with men's teams.</p>
