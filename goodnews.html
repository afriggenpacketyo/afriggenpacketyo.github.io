          <p>Kroger's shares increased by approximately 9% following the announcement of an improved full-year sales outlook, driven by consumers seeking lower-priced store brands and alternatives to dining out. The company now anticipates identical sales, excluding fuel, to increase between 2.25% and 3.25% year-over-year. Interim CEO Ron Sargent stated that Kroger is catering to value-conscious shoppers by simplifying promotions, reducing prices on over 2,000 products, and highlighting private brands. Despite facing increased competition from Walmart and Costco, Kroger is also focusing on modernizing its business and improving the profitability of its e-commerce operations, while planning to close approximately 60 underperforming stores over the next 18 months.

The project, valued at 4 billion yuan ($556 million), involves collaboration between Tesla, the Shanghai local government, and financing firm China Kangfu International Leasing. Utility-scale battery energy storage systems are crucial for balancing electricity supply and demand, particularly with the growth of intermittent renewable energy sources like solar and wind.

          <p>In an excerpt from her new memoir, "Far From Home: An Alaskan Senator Faces the Extreme Climate of Washington, D.C.," Senator Lisa Murkowski discusses her unique path in American politics. After losing a Republican primary in 2010, she successfully ran for re-election as a write-in candidate, which she credits to a diverse coalition of Alaskans. This victory shaped her approach as a senator, emphasizing the importance of consensus-building and prioritizing the needs of her constituents over party lines. Murkowski highlights instances where she defied party leadership, such as her opposition to Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation, driven by her belief in upholding the system's intended function.</p>

          <p>The draft law legalizing assisted dying in certain circumstances in England and Wales has passed its initial stages in the House of Commons. After being passed by a majority of 23, the bill now proceeds to the House of Lords, where it will undergo a similar review process. Supporters of the bill are optimistic about its passage in the Lords, though experts and activists are expected to voice their opinions. One of the main concerns for supporters is the potential for the bill to run out of time, as private members' bills must complete all stages within a single parliamentary session.</p>

          <p>MPs have voted to approve Kim Leadbeater's bill on assisted dying, a significant decision regarding bodily autonomy since the legalization of abortion in Great Britain in 1967.

The government estimates it could take up to four years to establish an assisted dying service, potentially delaying its implementation until 2029 or 2030. The proposed law would allow mentally competent, terminally ill adults with a life expectancy of less than six months to request an assisted death, subject to multiple assessments and approvals.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party intends to redistribute council funding in England, allocating a greater share to more deprived areas through an overhaul of funding rules. These changes, the first in over a decade, aim to address the higher demand for council services in poorer areas. While ministers argue the current system fails to reflect these needs, rural councils have raised concerns about potential financial losses. The Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests the changes will likely result in a significant redistribution of government funding towards deprived areas, particularly in urban regions of the North and Midlands.</p>
