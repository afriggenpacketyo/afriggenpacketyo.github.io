        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Pittsburgh Steelers secured a 24-21 victory against the Minnesota Vikings in Dublin, but head coach Mike Tomlin's late-game strategy drew criticism from fans. With just over a minute remaining, Tomlin opted to take a delay-of-game penalty on fourth down and punt the ball rather than attempt to secure a first down on the Vikings' 40-yard line. While the Steelers' defense ultimately prevented a game-tying drive, the conservative decision was heavily scrutinized on social media. The win improves the Steelers' record to 3-1 for the season.</p>

          <p>European golfer Viktor Hovland has been ruled out of his Sunday singles match at the Ryder Cup because of a neck injury. His scheduled match against Harris English of the United States has been declared a half, with each team receiving half a point. This development moves Europe's lead to 12-5 over the US team. As a result, Europe now needs only two more points from the remaining eleven singles matches to retain the Ryder Cup trophy.</p>

          <p>In a close referendum, Swiss citizens have voted by a slim margin of 50.4% to 49.6% in favor of creating a voluntary electronic identity system. This revised proposal, which keeps the system state-run and stores data only on users' smartphones, addresses privacy concerns that led to the rejection of a similar plan in 2021. Supporters argue the digital ID will streamline online bureaucratic processes, such as verifying age or signing contracts. Opponents, however, remain concerned about potential data misuse and the erosion of privacy, a long-held value in Swiss culture.</p>

          <h2>Zurich Voters Approve Strict Restrictions on Leaf Blower Use to Reduce Pollution</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Residents in Zurich, Switzerland, have voted in favor of a measure to significantly restrict the use of leaf blowers and leaf vacuums, citing concerns over noise and air pollution. The new rules, supported by over 61% of voters, will completely ban gas-powered devices. Electric models will only be permitted for use during a three-month period from October to December, with special permission required at other times. Proponents of the ban argued the devices are harmful to microorganisms and spread fine dust, while opponents criticized it as an example of an "anti-social culture of prohibition."</p>

          <h2>China Develops 'Pull System' to Revolutionize Rocket and Satellite Manufacturing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 10:00:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is implementing a new industrial "pull system" for manufacturing space systems, aiming to mass-produce rockets and satellites with the efficiency and consistency of the automotive industry. This model contrasts with the traditional "push" system, where components are made based on forecasts, often leading to delays and waste. In the new system, final assembly "pulls" components from suppliers only when they are needed, which is designed to lower costs, improve quality, and increase flexibility. Researchers believe mastering this scalable production method will be key to dominating the rapidly growing global space economy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As national chain stores continue to close, rising vacancy rates in shopping centers are creating rare real estate opportunities for small businesses. Landlords are becoming more willing to negotiate flexible lease terms and lower rents to keep their properties occupied, allowing independent retailers and service-based businesses to move into prime locations they were previously priced out of. While the trend varies by region, the overall softening of demand for commercial space is leading to a recalibration of the market. This shift is enabling local entrepreneurs to reimagine these spaces and bring unique, community-focused experiences to former chain-store locations.</p>

          <p>Rudy Giuliani has settled a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems for his role in spreading false claims about the company's machines following the 2020 presidential election. The terms of the settlement are confidential. As Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Giuliani was a key figure in promoting the conspiracy theory that the election was rigged, making dozens of false statements on various media platforms. This marks the third major settlement for Dominion, which previously secured payouts of $787.5 million from Fox and $67 million from Newsmax over similar election-related defamation claims.</p>
