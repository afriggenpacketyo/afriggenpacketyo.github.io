          <p>Kenton Cool, a 51-year-old British mountain guide, has successfully scaled Mount Everest for the 19th time, setting a new record for the most ascents by a non-Sherpa guide. Cool reached the 8,849-meter peak on Sunday, accompanied by other climbers, and is currently descending safely. He first climbed Everest in 2004 and has made it an almost annual endeavor, save for cancellations due to the 2014 avalanche tragedy, the 2015 earthquake, and the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. Numerous climbers are currently attempting to summit Everest during the spring climbing season, which is expected to conclude by the end of May. </p>

          <p>Small religious colleges in rural areas are increasingly facing closures and mergers due to declining enrollment and financial challenges, impacting access to higher education for rural students. St. Ambrose University and Mount Mercy University are attempting to unite to avoid this fate, as over half of nonprofit colleges that have closed or merged since 2020 were religiously affiliated. These institutions often serve low-income, first-generation students and provide a supportive environment, but face challenges in balancing their mission with financial realities. Efforts are underway to foster collaboration among religious colleges and universities to address these threats and ensure their continued survival.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that changing the way bricks are stacked in kilns in Bangladesh could significantly reduce air pollution. The study, which examined over 275 kilns, found that using a zig-zag pattern to improve airflow and ensuring consistent coal delivery can reduce fuel use by 23% and lower carbon dioxide and particulate matter emissions by approximately 20%. This low-cost intervention also improves worker conditions and increases profits for kiln owners through reduced fuel consumption and improved brick quality. Researchers are now collaborating with the Bangladeshi government to expand this training, offering a promising solution for reducing air pollution in the region.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece discusses concerns about Hong Kong's legal system after 2047, when the "one country, two systems" agreement with China expires. The author urges calm and suggests that Hong Kong should not repeat the alarmism experienced before 1997. While acknowledging past anxieties about the expiration of land leases and the applicability of mainland law, the author suggests that Hong Kong should focus on the present and avoid unnecessary speculation about the future, in order to maintain stability and confidence in the region.</p>

          <p>Poland is holding a pivotal presidential election amid heightened security concerns due to the ongoing war in Ukraine and worries about U.S. commitment to European security. The front-runners are Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski, a pro-EU Warsaw mayor, and Karol Nawrocki, a nationalist historian supported by the Law and Justice party. Trzaskowski supports abortion rights and LGBTQ protections, while Nawrocki champions conservative values and national sovereignty.

          <p>A new internal study by the Bundeswehr indicates that the German military does not have "systemic" extremism, with only a small percentage of soldiers exhibiting right-wing extremist views. However, the study also revealed that some soldiers hold chauvinistic and xenophobic attitudes. While the findings offer some relief, concerns remain about the effectiveness of safeguards against extremism, particularly in the context of broader societal normalization of right-wing views. Experts suggest that the military needs to enhance its awareness of modern right-wing mindsets and continue to prioritize extremism prevention.</p>
