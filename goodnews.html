        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford announced that its vehicle sales surged by 14.2% in the second quarter compared to the previous year, significantly outperforming the estimated 1.4% industry-wide increase. The growth was driven by strong sales of its F-Series trucks and a notable rise in hybrid vehicle purchases, although its pure electric vehicle sales saw a decline. The automaker sold over 612,000 new vehicles during the quarter, with its electrified vehicle segment setting a record for the first half of the year. This strong performance comes amid new tariffs on imported vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent study published in Frontiers in Psychology explored the connection between food, sleep, and dreams, finding that some people report certain foods affect their sleep quality. Based on surveys of over 1,000 participants, the research noted that dairy products and sweets were most frequently blamed for causing nightmares and worse sleep. The study's authors theorize that the link between dairy and bad dreams might be due to gastrointestinal distress from lactose intolerance during sleep. However, they caution that more substantive evidence is needed to confirm these self-reported observations.</p>

          <p>For savers looking to protect their money from inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) currently offer competitive returns, with many top accounts exceeding the inflation rate. While national average yields for one-to-five-year CDs range from 1.70% to 2.01% APY, online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some one-year CDs reaching 4.40% APY. Experts note that due to an inverted yield curve, short-term CDs often provide better returns than long-term ones at present. To secure the best rates, savers are advised to compare offers, particularly from online financial institutions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With over 100 million Americans burdened by a collective $220 billion in medical debt, various relief options are available for those struggling to pay their bills. Nonprofit hospitals are required by law to offer charity care, providing free or discounted services to patients who meet certain income criteria. For others, debt settlement companies can negotiate to reduce balances, though this can impact credit scores. As a final resort, bankruptcy can eliminate or reorganize debt, but it has severe long-term financial consequences, making it crucial to explore all other avenues first.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a bill to significantly reform the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a landmark 1970s environmental law. The governor argued that the overhaul is crucial for tackling the state's severe housing shortage and homelessness crisis by streamlining the approval process for new construction. Newsom had made the reform a condition for signing the state budget, contending that CEQA had become a bureaucratic obstacle to development. The move, passed despite opposition from some environmental groups, aims to reduce building costs and accelerate housing projects.</p>

Welch argues this question cuts through corporate platitudes and elicits more honest, unrehearsed answers about the actual work culture. Responses like "someone who doesn't want to text on weekends" or "a person who's too social" provide genuine insight, helping applicants determine if the company is a true fit for their own values.</p>
