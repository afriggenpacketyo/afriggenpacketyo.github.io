Concurrently, the company announced its acquisition of Foundation Building Materials for approximately $8.8 billion to strengthen its business with home professionals. Despite the positive results, executives noted that demand for larger home projects remains soft due to high mortgage rates and anticipate a market pickup when rates fall.

          <p>OpenAI's finance chief, Sarah Friar, announced that the company achieved its first $1 billion revenue month in July, with annual recurring revenue now at $10 billion. Despite this rapid growth, Friar stated the company is "constantly under compute," facing voracious demand for GPUs and processing power for its AI models. To address this, OpenAI is pursuing major infrastructure projects like Stargate and diversifying its partnerships beyond Microsoft to include Oracle and Coreweave. The company's growth is fueled by high demand from its 700 million weekly active users and enterprise customers.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the University of Oxford have created a nutritional supplement, described as a "superfood," that could help save honeybees from threats like climate change and habitat loss. The breakthrough involves a genetically engineered yeast that produces six essential sterols that bees need but are often missing from commercial supplements. In trials, bee colonies fed the new food had up to 15 times more young bees survive to adulthood. This development is crucial, as honeybees are vital for pollinating approximately 70% of the world's leading crops.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, who were convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, are scheduled for long-awaited parole hearings this week. Their original sentences of life without parole were recently changed to 50 years to life, making them immediately eligible for release consideration. The brothers have maintained that they acted in self-defense after years of abuse, a claim they are also using in a separate legal bid for a new trial based on new evidence. Their family has expressed cautious optimism, stating the brothers have taken full accountability and shown sincere remorse.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Significance of Growing International Recognition for a Palestinian State</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several Western nations, including France, Britain, and Canada, are preparing to formally recognize a state of Palestine, a move that this article argues is a major diplomatic step despite not immediately changing conditions on the ground. This recognition is seen as a way to bolster the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and its commitment to a negotiated two-state solution over the armed struggle of its rival, Hamas. The article suggests that international recognition could also serve as a crucial countermeasure to Israeli annexation efforts in the West Bank, thereby preserving the possibility of a future Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has addressed public curiosity about his habit of exercising in jeans. During a television appearance, Kennedy explained that he started doing it long ago for convenience, as he would often go directly from a morning hike to the gym. He said he has since become accustomed to it. The question arose after he participated in a fitness challenge alongside the Defense Secretary, where his denim workout attire stood in contrast to traditional gym wear, prompting widespread online discussion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll indicates that only 54% of U.S. adults say they consume alcoholic beverages, the lowest figure recorded in nearly 90 years of the survey. This decline corresponds with a significant shift in public perception, as a record-high 53% of adults now believe that even moderate drinking is detrimental to their health. The change in attitude is most pronounced among young adults, but older Americans are also increasingly viewing alcohol as a health risk. This trend reflects a growing awareness of the links between alcohol consumption and negative health outcomes like cancer.</p>

          <h2>Explainer Details How Potential Interest Rate Cuts Could Affect HELOC Payments</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the potential impact of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts on homeowners with Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs). Because HELOCs typically have variable rates tied to the prime rate, a Fed rate cut usually leads to lower monthly payments. However, the timing of this relief can vary based on the lender's adjustment schedule, the loan's billing cycle, and specific features like introductory rates or interest rate floors. Experts advise borrowers to review their loan terms and budget for potential rate fluctuations in either direction. (not investment advice)</p>
