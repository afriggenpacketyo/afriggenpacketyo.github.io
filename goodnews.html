          <p>Two men have been sentenced to prison for the 2019 theft of a ¬£4.8 million gold toilet from Blenheim Palace. James Sheen, who pleaded guilty to burglary and related charges, received a four-year sentence, while Michael Jones, convicted of burglary, was sentenced to two years and three months. The heist, described as "bold and brazen," took only five-and-a-half minutes to complete, with Sheen identified as a key player who sold part of the gold. The investigation involved deciphering coded messages and tracking down forensic evidence, revealing Sheen's extensive criminal history and Jones's reconnaissance visits to Blenheim Palace.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty to human smuggling charges after being brought back to the U.S. from detention in El Salvador. The case follows a prolonged legal battle after his deportation in March, despite a 2019 court order barring deportation due to fear of persecution. Federal prosecutors allege that Garcia participated in a years-long conspiracy to transport undocumented migrants from Texas to the interior of the country. The prosecution has requested a pre-trial detention hearing, arguing Garcia's alleged MS-13 ties pose a risk of obstruction or witness intimidation, while his attorneys contend the arguments for detention are meritless.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian authorities have announced the return of 1,200 Ukrainian soldiers' bodies from Russia. The bodies were repatriated as part of a deal made this month in Istanbul, which also included a large prisoner of war (POW) exchange. The Istanbul talks involved the return of remains of over 6,000 fallen soldiers from each side, with dozens of POWs exchanged since. Law enforcement investigators and experts will conduct tests to identify the returned bodies, with Ukraine having also repatriated 1,212 soldiers' bodies who died fighting since the start of the war in February 2022.</p>

          <h2>Strategies to Lower Credit Card Interest Rates Without Switching Cards</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 12:20:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers can lower their credit card interest rates without opening new accounts by employing several strategies. Calling the card issuer directly to request a lower rate is often effective, especially with a good payment history. Enrolling in a debt management plan through a credit counseling agency can lead to negotiated lower rates, though it typically requires closing the cards. Temporary hardship programs offered by card companies can provide reduced APRs or deferred payments during financial difficulties, and leveraging an improved credit score can also justify a rate reduction. Mentioning competitive offers from other companies can strengthen negotiating power. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of RH, formerly Restoration Hardware, experienced a significant jump after the company maintained its sales forecast and outlined strategies to mitigate the impact of higher tariffs. The luxury furniture retailer expects full-year revenue to grow by 10% to 13%, despite challenges from a sluggish real estate market and increased tariffs. To counter tariffs, RH is shifting more production out of China, projecting a drop in receipts from 16% to 2% by the fourth quarter. The company also plans to open stores internationally, including a location on Paris' Champs √âlys√©es, though the launch of a new concept will be delayed until spring 2026.</p>

          <p>Pollen levels are high in many parts of the UK, causing significant discomfort for those allergic to pollen, with symptoms like itchy eyes, sneezing, and headaches. The warm weather has created ideal conditions for birch tree pollen, a major hay fever trigger, leading to a 'pollen bomb'. Allergy experts recommend a 'cocktail approach' of antihistamine tablets, steroid nasal sprays, and eye drops for relief. Additionally, avoiding hay fever triggers, practicing good hygiene, and regularly cleaning the home can help reduce symptoms, and immunotherapy treatment may be available for those severely affected.</p>

          <p>As President Donald Trump prepares for a military parade in Washington, D.C., "No Kings" protests are planned across the US to oppose his administration's policies. The protests, organized by a grassroots organization called 50501, aim to challenge Trump's actions, which opponents view as a threat to democratic pillars. Trump's decision to deploy the military against demonstrators in LA has drawn attention to the protests, and the organizers want the focus to be on the rest of the US and their protests rather than Trump's birthday and his military parade.</p>

Biles initially called Gaines "truly sick" and a "sore loser" after Gaines misgendered a transgender softball player, but later said her frustration was directed at the system. The apology came after Gaines criticized Biles for her comments, leading to a clash over the issue of men in women's sports. Biles has stood by the broader point that sports organizations have a responsibility to create rules supporting inclusion while maintaining fair competition.</p>
