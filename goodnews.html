          <p>A father is being praised as a hero after he saved his four-year-old child from a mountain lion attack in Olympic National Park, Washington. The child was bitten by the cougar while on a popular trail with family and was subsequently airlifted to a trauma center, where they were treated and have since been released. Park rangers located and killed the animal, which was fitted with a tracking collar, following the incident. Eyewitnesses who arrived at the scene shortly after the attack heard screaming and said the father's quick actions were crucial in saving the child's life from the rare and dangerous encounter.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has revealed plans to invest $50 billion in its U.S. manufacturing and research operations by 2030. This commitment includes a new multi-billion dollar facility in Virginia dedicated to producing its weight management and metabolic drugs, which will become its largest single manufacturing investment globally. The move follows similar announcements by other major pharma companies and comes as the industry faces potential trade tariffs from the Trump administration. The investment is expected to create tens of thousands of jobs and support the company's goal of reaching $80 billion in annual revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The small Norwegian village of Ulefoss sits atop what is believed to be Europe's largest deposit of rare earth elements, critical metals for modern technology. A mining company, Rare Earths Norway (REN), plans to develop an "invisible mine" by tunneling diagonally from outside the town to extract the minerals without displacing the community. This project could be a game-changer for the EU, which currently relies almost entirely on China for its rare earth supply. While some residents have expressed environmental concerns, the project has largely avoided major local opposition, partly due to the town's long history with the mining industry.</p>

          <p>The new Kimi K2 artificial intelligence model, developed by the Alibaba-backed startup Moonshot AI, has seen a surge in popularity since its launch in China. The large language model (LLM) utilizes a mixture-of-experts (MOE) architecture, which divides tasks among specialized sub-networks, significantly reducing computational costs for training and inference. Industry experts have praised this cost-efficient approach as a potential turning point in AI development strategy, contrasting with the massive resource investments of competitors like OpenAI. Kimi K2, which is available for free, demonstrates a powerful yet more accessible pathway for advancing AI technology.</p>

          <p>Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the owner of the Los Angeles Times, announced his intention to take the newspaper public within the next year. In a television interview, Soon-Shiong stated the move would democratize ownership of the historic paper, allowing the public to invest in its future. He did not provide specific details on whether this would involve a traditional initial public offering (IPO) or another investment structure. This decision comes as The Times, like many news organizations, navigates significant financial challenges. Soon-Shiong, a biotech billionaire, acquired the newspaper in 2018, returning it to local ownership after years under a Chicago-based firm.</p>

          <p>China has announced the commencement of a massive hydropower project on the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet, which will be the world's largest such facility. The project, with an estimated investment of $167 billion, will feature five cascade stations and is expected to have three times the capacity of the Three Gorges Dam. The announcement triggered a significant surge in the stock prices of Chinese infrastructure, construction, and hydropower companies when markets reopened. The river, known as the Brahmaputra in India, is a shared resource, and large-scale dam projects have previously raised concerns in downstream countries.</p>

          <p>The competition to develop and commercialize solid-state batteries for electric vehicles is gaining momentum, with major automakers like Volkswagen, Nissan, and Toyota doubling down on production timelines. These batteries promise higher energy density, improved safety, and faster charging compared to current lithium-ion technology, and are often called the "holy grail" for EVs. Many companies are targeting 2027-2028 for mass production, often starting with semi-solid-state versions as a practical bridge technology. However, challenges such as high production costs and technological hurdles persist, even as advancements in existing battery types continue to close the performance gap.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this opinion piece, Slovenian writer Ana Schnabl critiques the tendency of U.S. and British publishers to favor stories from the Balkans that focus on war, tragedy, and political trauma. She recounts being advised by a publisher to write about themes specific to her culture's problematic history, revealing an expectation that Balkan literature should serve an explanatory or didactic purpose for Western readers. Schnabl argues this preference for self-exoticizing narratives limits the diversity of voices from the region, overlooking universal stories that don't fit into a preconceived mold of a perpetually troubled place. She calls for publishers to engage with a broader range of stories beyond those that reinforce stereotypes.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced substantial changes to the compensation scheme for victims of the infected blood scandal, which infected 30,000 people with HIV and hepatitis in the 1970s-90s. The changes come after a critical report from the public inquiry chair, who described the scheme's slow progress as "profoundly unsatisfactory." Key changes include allowing compensation to be passed to a family member's estate if they die before their claim is settled. While victims' groups cautiously welcomed the announcement, they expressed disappointment that some issues, like compensation levels for hepatitis victims, remain subject to further consultation.</p>
