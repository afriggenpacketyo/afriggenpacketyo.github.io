          <p>SoftBank Group experienced a significant 13% surge in its share price, reaching a new record high following a better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings report. The Japanese investment conglomerate reported a profit of 421.8 billion yen, far exceeding analysts' predictions and marking a strong recovery from a loss in the same period last year. The positive results were largely driven by a $4.8 billion gain in its Vision Funds, buoyed by the performance of portfolio companies like Grab and Swiggy. Several other portfolio companies are also expected to go public soon. (not investment advice)</p>

Shelton's impressive run to the final included victories over several higher-seeded players. With this victory, he becomes the youngest American man to win an ATP Masters 1000 tournament since Andy Roddick in 2004.

The terms of the settlement have not been disclosed. Carano's lawsuit, which alleged wrongful termination and was financially supported by Elon Musk, sought $75,000 in damages and reinstatement to the show.

Ward was recently convicted of sexually assaulting two men between 2013 and 2015 and is currently in custody awaiting sentencing. He had launched an unsuccessful legal challenge to prevent his expulsion, arguing it was an affront to democracy. His resignation triggers a by-election for his seat and ends his parliamentary salary. NSW Premier Chris Minns stated that the resignation should have happened sooner.</p>

          <p>For the first time on record, the Southern Small White butterfly, a species native to Southern Europe, has been sighted in the United Kingdom. A volunteer at the Landguard Bird Observatory in Suffolk photographed the female butterfly, confirming its identity. Scientists have tracked this species as it rapidly expanded its range northward through Europe over the past two decades, a movement believed to be partly driven by a warming climate. While its arrival marks a significant "ecological leap," it is not yet known if the species will establish a permanent breeding population in the UK.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people, particularly millennials and Gen Z, are moving away from dating apps and embracing old-fashioned, in-person singles events to find partners. Event organizers like Date Cincy are seeing a surge in attendance as people seek genuine, face-to-face connections, a trend supported by data from Eventbrite showing a 42% rise in attendance at singles events. Many users have grown tired of the frustrations of online dating, such as misleading profiles and a lack of real chemistry. The shift is also reflected in the market, with dating app Bumble's value having dropped significantly since it went public.</p>

          <p>Tonia Haddix, an exotic animal broker featured in the HBO docuseries 'Chimp Crazy,' has been sentenced to 46 months in federal prison. Haddix pleaded guilty to perjury and obstruction of justice for lying to a judge about the death of a chimpanzee named Tonka, whom she was hiding in her basement. After a court ordered her to relinquish several chimpanzees, Haddix claimed Tonka had died, but the animal was later discovered confined in a small cage in her home. Animal rights group PETA, which was instrumental in the case, expressed relief at the sentencing.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has announced that its experimental oral weight-loss drug, orforglipron, demonstrated significant efficacy in a late-stage clinical trial. Adults with obesity who took the pill lost an average of 27.3 pounds over 72 weeks. The company stated the pill's safety and tolerability profile is consistent with existing injectable GLP-1 therapies, with common side effects including nausea and diarrhea. Eli Lilly plans to submit the drug for FDA approval later this year, potentially making it available to consumers by 2026.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning legislation that would confine serious violent and sexual offenders to specific geographical zones upon their release from prison. Unlike current exclusion zones that bar offenders from certain areas, this new system would define the area where they are permitted to be, policed by enhanced electronic tagging. Ministers argue this will provide victims with greater peace of mind, allowing them to travel without fear of encountering their attacker. However, some probation officers have raised concerns that the plan will add more pressure to an already strained service.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Restaurant chain Texas Roadhouse announced mixed financial results for its second quarter, with revenues slightly exceeding expectations but earnings per share falling short due to high beef prices. The company reported a 12.8% year-over-year revenue increase to $1.51 billion, driven by strong customer traffic and comparable sales growth of 5.8%. Despite the positive sales trends, profitability was impacted by commodity inflation, a headwind expected to worsen in the next quarter. The company plans a modest menu price increase to help offset some of the rising costs. (not investment advice)</p>
