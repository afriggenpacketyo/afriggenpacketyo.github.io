          <p>France and Indonesia have jointly called for the "mutual recognition" of Israel and Palestine, emphasizing the need for a political resolution to achieve lasting peace in the Middle East. During French President Emmanuel Macron's visit to Jakarta, he and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto condemned Israeli plans to control Gaza and any actions that forcibly displace the Palestinian population. Macron also mentioned plans to co-organize a conference on Gaza in New York with Saudi Arabia, aimed at reinvigorating efforts to recognize a Palestinian state and Israel's right to exist peacefully. Prabowo echoed support for a two-state solution, underscoring the unified stance of both nations on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The focus is on achieving a long-term political solution for the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Defense Department has rescinded its requirement for civilian employees to submit weekly bulleted lists of their accomplishments, which was initially mandated by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Jay Hurst, performing the duties of undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, announced that the "five bullet exercise" is no longer necessary. Instead, employees are encouraged to submit ideas to improve efficiency and reduce waste within the department. This decision aligns with similar actions taken by other agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health, which have also discontinued the weekly reports. The reports were part of an effort led by Elon Musk and DOGE to eliminate waste in the federal government.</p>

          <p>Sir Mark Rowley, head of the Metropolitan Police, has cautioned that increased funding is essential to fulfill the government's promises to reduce crime. He lauded the government's ambitious goals, such as halving knife crime and violence against women and girls, but stressed that these objectives require financial backing. Rowley highlighted the lasting impact of previous austerity cuts on police forces and advocated for radical policing reform, including fewer policing organizations and a national police agency for better coordination. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to outline public service funding in the upcoming spending review, where the allocation for policing will be determined.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The word "pride" has transformed from a term denoting excessive self-esteem to a symbol of LGBTQ empowerment. Originating before the 12th century, it initially carried negative connotations, linked to the Christian concept of the seven deadly sins. Over time, its meaning shifted towards self-respect, culminating in its adoption by the LGBTQ community in the late 1960s. The Stonewall Uprising and subsequent marches embraced "pride" to counter negative stereotypes and affirm self-worth, and while debates around its usage persist, the term remains a powerful symbol of resilience and progress for the LGBTQ community.</p>

The price differences between overseas and domestic markets, driven by currency fluctuations and local discounts, incentivize travelers to buy toys abroad for resale in China.
