          <p>Billy Joel has disclosed that he attempted suicide twice in his early 20s, following an affair with his bandmate's wife and the subsequent breakup of his band, Attila. Overwhelmed by guilt and depression, Joel turned to alcohol and attempted to end his life with sleeping pills and furniture polish. After these experiences, Joel checked himself into an observation ward and realized he could channel his emotions into music. This realization marked a turning point, leading him to write about his experiences and eventually marry the woman involved, Elizabeth Weber. Joel's life experiences are detailed in the documentary ‚ÄúBilly Joel: And So It Goes,‚Äù which premiered last week. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large international study of nearly 300,000 children has found a two-way link between screen time and emotional and social well-being, revealing that children who spend more time on devices are at a higher risk of developing aggression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Conversely, children already struggling with social or emotional challenges tend to spend more time on screens. Time spent on gaming consoles was particularly linked to a greater chance of developing issues, regardless of the specific type of game. Experts recommend limiting recreational screen time for children between 2 and 5 years old. It is important to ensure screen time does not interfere with sleep and physical activity. </p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates that 60% of single American adults believe in love at first sight, a significant increase from 2014, with almost half reporting they have experienced it themselves. Researchers attribute this rise to the prevalence of swipe-based dating apps, which encourage quick judgments about potential partners. While passionate love may not last, those who feel romantic interest at the start of a relationship tend to maintain it longer and are less likely to initiate breakups. Despite the potential for unrealistic expectations, the survey reveals that most singles still believe in lasting love. The idea is that people are more likely to try to make the relationship work. </p>
