          <p>Ticket resale marketplace StubHub is aiming for a valuation of up to $9.2 billion in its much-anticipated initial public offering. The company plans to sell over 34 million shares at a price range of $22 to $25 each, seeking to raise as much as $851 million. This move comes after previous IPO plans were paused due to market volatility, including concerns over President Trump's tariffs. StubHub, which will trade on the NYSE under the symbol "STUB," reported a 10% revenue increase in the first quarter, signaling a potential rebound in the IPO market.</p>

          <p>A new mural attributed to the anonymous street artist Banksy has surfaced on an external wall of the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The artwork portrays a judge in traditional attire striking a protester who is lying on the ground. The piece appeared shortly after nearly 900 people were arrested during a protest, though it does not reference a specific cause. Officials from HM Courts and Tribunals have already covered the mural and stated it will be removed to maintain the character of the listed building, while police are investigating it as criminal damage.</p>

          <p>Organizers of the Great North Run have issued a humorous apology after finisher medals and T-shirts mistakenly featured a map of Sunderland and the River Wear instead of Newcastle and the River Tyne. Approximately 60,000 participants in the iconic half marathon received the incorrect memorabilia. In a statement, the Great Run Company admitted the error, quipping "Wear [sic] sorry!" and suggesting the items are now unique keepsakes. The mix-up was particularly notable given the historic football rivalry between Newcastle and Sunderland, leading to lighthearted jokes on social media about the design.</p>

          <p>Tennis icon Serena Williams has invested in Unrivaled, a women's 3-on-3 basketball league, through her venture capital firm, Serena Ventures. This latest funding round, which also included participation from soccer star Alex Morgan and tennis pioneer Billie Jean King, has raised the league's valuation to $340 million. Unrivaled was created to provide WNBA players with a high-paying domestic option during their offseason, and it claims to offer the highest average salary in women's professional sports. Williams, who retired from professional tennis in 2022, continues to expand her portfolio as an influential early-stage investor.</p>

          <p>Radio host Howard Stern has confirmed he is in ongoing talks with SiriusXM for a new contract, dispelling rumors of his departure. The clarification came after an on-air prank where fellow host Andy Cohen pretended to take over Stern's time slot, leading some listeners to believe the show was ending. Stern, whose current multi-million dollar contract expires at the end of the year, reassured his audience that discussions with the company are proceeding as usual. The 71-year-old "king of all-media" has been a cornerstone of the satellite radio platform for nearly two decades.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European stocks closed higher on Monday, with major indices like France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX seeing gains despite political turmoil in Paris. Market focus was on France, where Prime Minister Francois Bayrou was expected to lose a confidence vote, a development that could force President Macron to appoint a new prime minister. Investors seemed to shrug off the political uncertainty, with retail stocks leading the gains across the continent. The positive market performance also came as traders anticipated key U.S. inflation reports later in the week, which could influence the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions.

          <p>The BBC has announced that food critic Grace Dent and chef Anna Haugh will take over as the new hosts of the popular cooking competition show, MasterChef. They are replacing long-time hosts Gregg Wallace and John Torode, who were dismissed in July following a report that upheld claims made against them. Dent has been a regular guest critic on the show, while Haugh has served as a judge on the spin-off series, MasterChef: The Professionals. The BBC confirmed it will still air the already-filmed amateur series featuring Wallace and Torode out of fairness to the contestants who participated.</p>

          <p>Roger Blevins Jr., frontman for the band Mingo Fishtrap, is back on stage after a 2022 tongue cancer diagnosis forced him to halt his career. Following surgery that removed most of his tongue and reconstructed it with tissue from his thigh, Blevins had to relearn how to speak and sing. Now celebrating a year with no evidence of disease, he has returned to performing and credits his medical team with saving not only his life but also his passion for music. Inspired by their journey, Blevins and his wife have launched a nonprofit called "The Tough Crowd Project" to help other families facing cancer.</p>

          <p>Shares of the online brokerage Robinhood soared more than 14% on Monday after S&P Global announced the company will be added to the prestigious S&P 500 index. The long-speculated inclusion, which will officially occur before trading on September 22, is a significant milestone for the company. Being added to the benchmark index often acts as a major catalyst for a stock, as passive index funds are required to purchase its shares. The news marks a high point for Robinhood, whose stock has risen over 210% year-to-date after a volatile period following its 2021 IPO. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Amber Alert for a one-year-old boy has been canceled after he was safely rescued in Arizona. The infant, Enzo Antonescu, was allegedly kidnapped at a Target store in Southern California by his father, Dragan Antonesco, who reportedly held the child's mother at knifepoint. The father's parents are also accused of assaulting the mother and participating in the kidnapping. Authorities say an Arizona state trooper recognized the family's vehicle from the alert and conducted a traffic stop, leading to the child's recovery and the arrest of the three suspects who were allegedly en route to Chicago.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has announced a landmark $17 billion deal to purchase wireless spectrum from satellite TV provider EchoStar. The acquisition of valuable AWS-4 and H-block licenses will significantly boost the capabilities of SpaceX's Starlink satellite network to provide direct-to-cell service for standard mobile phones globally. This move positions Elon Musk's company to potentially launch its own mobile services, building on its existing partnership with T-Mobile. The cash-and-stock deal also provides financial and regulatory relief for EchoStar, which owns the struggling Dish Network and has been under pressure to utilize its spectrum assets.</p>

          <p>Amid a weakening U.S. job market, financial experts are offering guidance for the more than 40 million Americans with student loans who may be facing unemployment. For federal loan borrowers, options like income-driven repayment (IDR) plans can lower monthly payments, potentially to zero, based on current income including unemployment benefits. Deferment and forbearance options can also temporarily pause payments, although interest may still accrue on some loans. Those with private student loans have fewer standard options but are encouraged to contact their lenders directly to inquire about available hardship assistance programs.</p>

          <p>Following his dominant sixth Grand Slam victory at the US Open, 22-year-old Carlos Alcaraz is already being compared to the greatest players in tennis history. The Spaniard is the youngest player since Bjorn Borg to win six major titles and is one of only four men ever to have won at least two Grand Slams on all three surfaces: clay, grass, and hard court. His performance in New York was particularly remarkable for its serving prowess, as he hit the fastest serve of the final and faced the fewest break points of any Grand Slam winner since 1991. This article analyzes how his early-career achievements stack up against legends like Nadal, Federer, and Djokovic.</p>
