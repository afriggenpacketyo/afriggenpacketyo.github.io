          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding President Trump's executive order aiming to limit birthright citizenship, focusing primarily on the legality of nationwide injunctions issued by lower courts. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that these injunctions unfairly hinder the government, while justices like Sonia Sotomayor questioned the order's constitutionality, citing previous Supreme Court precedents. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson raised concerns about the potential for a "Catch Me If You Can" system of justice if nationwide injunctions are limited. The court's decision could significantly impact the balance of power between the executive and judicial branches. </p>

While some question his qualifications, Smith's foray into politics reflects the blurring lines between news and entertainment, with Democrats seeking to connect with sports-minded voters through his platform.

          <p>Investing in gold should not be based on a specific cadence, but rather viewed as a small yet critical component of an overall portfolio. Gold should ideally make up no more than 10% of a portfolio and investors should get invested fairly quickly and frequently until they have the recommended threshold. Waiting to invest in gold is generally not advisable, as over time, the price only increases, accounting for minor drops. The timeline for investing in gold depends on specific needs and goals, both immediately and long-term. (not investment advice) </p>
