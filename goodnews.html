          <p>Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, downplayed recent stock market volatility during the company's annual meeting, calling it "really nothing" and a normal part of investing. He cited three instances in the past six decades where Berkshire Hathaway stock declined by 50%, noting that the company's fundamentals remained strong during those periods. Buffett stated that he would view a 50% drop in Berkshire's stock as a "fantastic opportunity" and emphasized his lack of fear regarding financial market fluctuations. He reassured investors that the recent market activity should not be considered a dramatic bear market.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has secured a second consecutive three-year term, marking the first time in 21 years that an Australian prime minister has achieved this feat. Opposition leader Peter Dutton conceded defeat, acknowledging his party's underperformance during the campaign. Energy policy and inflation were central issues, with both sides acknowledging a cost-of-living crisis. Albanese's Labor Party accused Dutton's party of emulating U.S. President Trump's divisive politics, while Albanese highlighted improved relations with China. The U.S. congratulated Albanese on his re-election, underscoring Australia's role as a valued ally.</p>

          <p>Singapore's ruling People's Action Party (PAP) is projected to secure another sweeping victory in the general elections, bolstering the mandate of Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who is in his first year in office. The PAP has governed the city-state since before its independence in 1965. Official sample vote counts indicate the PAP is set to win 87 seats in Parliament, while the opposition Workers Party is expected to retain its 10 seats. The election outcome is seen as a referendum on Wong's leadership and the PAP's ability to address concerns over living costs and housing availability in one of the world's most expensive cities.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has won a second term, a significant victory for his center-left Labor Party, which had trailed in polls due to cost-of-living concerns. The opposition, led by Peter Dutton, suffered a resounding defeat, losing his parliamentary seat. Voters cited financial struggles, with some opting for the Australian Greens. Dutton's campaign echoed some of President Trump's messaging, but Albanese emphasized facing global challenges "the Australian way." The victory marks a recovery from the failed 2023 referendum on Indigenous rights, a key issue during Albanese's first term.</p>

          <p>Slow TV, featuring long, unnarrated coverage of events in real time, is gaining popularity, offering viewers a calming contrast to fast-paced media. Examples include the "Great Elk Trek" in Sweden, which attracts millions of viewers to observe wildlife, and webcams on stork nests and zoo animals. Educators use these streams as tools to discuss nature and social interaction with children. Researchers suggest that these livestreams can foster a deeper connection with nature and inspire climate-conscious behavior, offering a restorative experience for those unable to engage physically with the outdoors.</p>

Key issues included cost-of-living concerns, healthcare affordability, and international relations, particularly dealing with the Trump administration. Albanese emphasized fairness, opportunity, and kindness, while Dutton's campaign was marred by policy backflips and comparisons to Trump.

CEO Richard Fairbank emphasized that global expansion would enable Capital One to shift more of its branded credit cards away from Visa and Mastercard, exceeding initial synergy estimates. Capital One expects $2.7 billion in annual synergies by 2027 through expense savings and network benefits. The debit-card business will also receive a regulatory benefit by running on the Discover network, exempting it from swipe fee caps.

          <p>A new feasibility report suggests that grizzly bears could return to California, where they were extinct by the mid-1920s. The study identifies three regions suitable for reintroduction and highlights the ecological benefits of having grizzlies, including controlling herbivore populations and cycling nutrients. While a poll showed public support, concerns remain about potential conflicts with humans. Any reintroduction effort would be slow and deliberate, focusing on remote areas and working with local communities. Proponents emphasize the symbolic impact of bringing back a keystone species and a cultural icon for Indigenous groups.</p>

The former chief economist of the Bank of England argues that this excess sensitivity of financial markets acts as a real-time disciplining device on politicians.

          <p>Warren Buffett stated that the U.S. shouldn't use "trade as a weapon" like President Trump has done with tariffs. Buffett expressed concern about angering the rest of the world and emphasized the importance of balanced trade. He believes the world will be safer if more countries are prosperous. Buffett addressed the topic at Berkshire Hathaway's shareholders meeting. Hillary Rodham Clinton was in attendance. He also discussed Berkshire's $347.7 billion cash hoard, saying he is waiting for attractively priced investments.</p>

          <p>Activist investor Fivespan Partners has taken a stake in Qiagen NV, a life sciences tools firm, and is engaging with management to unlock shareholder value. Fivespan believes Qiagen is a high-quality business in a growing industry but has underperformed its peers. Fivespan has identified three key levers: investing in its core business, improving margins through tighter management, and optimizing the balance sheet by increasing leverage. They feel that the company could benefit from additional investments in its core business and buy back some of its own stock at attractive prices ahead of growth and margin improvements. Fivespan appreciates businesses with several paths to shareholder value, one of them being strategic transactions.</p>
