          <p>Author Max Lucado recounts a frustrating flight cancellation, where observing a calm, nursing baby in a chaotic airport terminal served as a powerful metaphor for God's peace. The article contrasts the world's conditional peace, dependent on circumstances, with the unwavering tranquility offered through faith in a higher power. Lucado encourages readers to exchange their anxieties for this divine assurance, drawing a parallel between a mother's comforting presence for her child and God's constant support for believers during life's storms.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm after briefly reaching Category 5 intensity as it moves north of the Caribbean. While it is not currently projected to directly impact the United States, tropical storm warnings are in effect for the Turks and Caicos Islands, with heavy rain expected across the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Meteorologists explain that the storm underwent an "eyewall replacement cycle," a natural process in powerful hurricanes that can cause temporary weakening before a potential re-intensification, and continue to monitor its path closely.</p>

          <p>A 19th-century Napoleonic fort on Thorne Island in Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been transformed into a unique £3 million property after an extensive and challenging five-year renovation. The new owner, Mike Conner, purchased the derelict, listed building in 2017 and overcame significant logistical hurdles, including having no running water or electricity, to make it habitable. Now equipped with 40 beds and its own nightclub, the historic fortress, originally built for coastal defense, is back on the market as a potential luxury private retreat or exclusive tourist attraction.</p>

          <p>Germany's coalition government is deeply divided over how to increase the size of its armed forces, the Bundeswehr, in order to meet its NATO commitments. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius of the SPD has proposed a model to make voluntary service more attractive, while Chancellor Friedrich Merz's CDU/CSU party is strongly advocating for the reintroduction of compulsory military service, which was suspended in 2011. The current draft law includes mandatory online questionnaires and medical examinations for all 18-year-old men but stops short of full conscription, a point of major contention within the ruling coalition.</p>

Ryan Wardwell was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the river's strong hydraulics pushed him off his lines and stranded him. After an extensive search involving aircraft and drones failed to locate him, rescuers found him the next day and a California Highway Patrol helicopter crew successfully hoisted him to safety.</p>

          <p>As the total cost of higher education approaches $100,000 per year at several elite American institutions, a small number of U.S. colleges offer a completely tuition-free education for all admitted students. This article highlights nine such schools, including Berea College, College of the Ozarks, and the five U.S. military service academies. While these institutions eliminate the financial burden of tuition, they often feature highly selective admissions processes and may require students to participate in mandatory work programs or commit to several years of military service after graduation in return.</p>

          <p>A novel program organized by officials in the Mexican state of Zacatecas is enabling a small number of elderly parents to obtain temporary U.S. visas to reunite with their undocumented children after decades of separation. The article highlights the deeply emotional reunion in East Los Angeles of José Antonio Rodríguez, who had not seen his parents in nearly 25 years since he left his hometown to find work in California. This initiative provides a rare and precious opportunity for families long divided by the border to reconnect, though many visa applications are rejected amid current U.S. immigration policies.</p>

          <p>A wildlife photographer in Lithuania was stunned to capture footage of a brown bear on his trail camera, a species that was once considered to be extinct in the country. This rare sighting, along with another recent report of a bear cub, strongly suggests the species is making a natural return to the local ecosystem, which is a very positive sign of environmental health. Brown bears play a crucial role in their habitats, and their reappearance could lead to their inclusion in Lithuania's Red Book of protected species, marking a significant moment for national conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>A rare and exciting sighting of a humpback whale off the coast of Kent, England, has thrilled local conservationists and volunteers with the Kent Dolphin Project. Humpback whale populations have been rebounding globally due to significant conservation efforts, and their presence is a positive indicator of oceanic ecosystem health, as they play key roles in the food chain and in carbon sequestration. The sighting is also being used by wildlife advocates to raise concerns about the potential negative impact of a proposed undersea cabling project on marine life in the area.</p>

          <p>The Australian government has officially granted political asylum to Ted Hui, a prominent pro-democracy activist from Hong Kong who fled the city in 2020 after facing multiple criminal charges related to the 2019 protests.

The bonus-point victory, combined with previous number one South Africa's loss to Australia, allowed the All Blacks to reclaim the top spot in the world for the first time in four years.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 recently completed a 68-day streak of closing above its 20-day moving average, a technical market event that has occurred only eight other times since 1957. A historical data analysis of these previous occurrences shows that in seven of the eight instances, the index was significantly higher one year later, posting an average gain of 11%. While past performance does not guarantee future results, and economic risks from tariffs and inflation remain, this strong historical pattern suggests a high probability of continued market gains over the next 12 months.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this personal essay, the author reflects on how her appreciation for Renaissance art evolved from youthful indifference to a deep emotional connection that was forged by significant life experiences. Initially dismissing the genre as unrelatable, she found new and profound meaning in the works of artists like Caravaggio and Piero della Francesca after surviving personal trauma and later during her own pregnancy. The article compellingly argues that lived experiences, such as motherhood or confronting mortality, can unlock the emotional complexity and resonance of historical art, transforming it from an academic subject into something deeply personal.</p>

          <p>A cold case detective successfully captured a notorious Phoenix serial killer, known as the "canal killer," through an ingenious undercover sting operation at a local Chili's restaurant in 2015. The detective, Clark Schwartzkopf, arranged to meet with suspect Bryan Patrick Miller under the pretense of a casual interview, with the sole purpose of covertly obtaining his DNA from a used water glass. This DNA sample provided a direct match to forensic evidence found at the crime scenes of two brutal murders from the early 1990s, leading to Miller's immediate arrest, and his eventual conviction and death sentence in 2023.</p>
