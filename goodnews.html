          <p>Following their $8-billion takeover, new Paramount chief David Ellison and his leadership team have detailed their strategy to revitalize the media company. The plan involves nearly doubling the studio's annual film output to 15-20 movies, with a strong focus on major franchises like “Top Gun,” “Star Trek,” and “Transformers.” Ellison emphasized that his team will be based in Hollywood and aims to restore Paramount as a top destination for talent, moving away from political divisions to create content for broad audiences. The new leadership has also committed to finding $2 billion in cost savings while investing heavily in theatrical releases.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A potential disaster was avoided in Juneau, Alaska, after newly installed temporary barriers successfully held back record floodwaters from the Mendenhall River. The flooding was caused by a glacial lake outburst from the nearby Mendenhall Glacier, which released a massive surge of water that pushed the river to an unprecedented 16.65 feet. While some areas experienced minor flooding, officials reported that the Hesco barriers protected hundreds of homes from what could have been a catastrophic event. This annual phenomenon has worsened in recent years, prompting the installation of the protective levee system.</p>

          <p>A Texas state judge has ordered the assets of Alex Jones's Infowars to be turned over to a court-appointed receiver, who will liquidate the company to help pay the $1.3 billion defamation judgment owed to Sandy Hook families. This ruling paves the way for the seizure of all Infowars property, including its brand name, studio equipment, and cash. The decision moves the process out of federal bankruptcy court, where it had been stalled for years, and into state court. Attorneys for the families are pleased with the development, seeing it as a final step toward accountability for Jones's false and cruel conspiracies.</p>

          <p>A large-scale study suggests that medication for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can provide significant life benefits beyond managing core symptoms. The research, which followed over 148,000 people in Sweden, found that taking ADHD drugs was associated with notable reductions in the risk of substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminal activity. Researchers believe that by improving focus and reducing impulsivity, the medication helps mitigate behaviors that can lead to these negative outcomes. These findings offer important context for patients and doctors weighing the benefits of drug treatment against potential side effects.</p>

          <p>In response to U.S. tariffs targeting China's shipbuilding industry, South Korean firms are increasing their investments in Southeast Asian nations like the Philippines. Analysts suggest this strategic shift allows Korean shipbuilders to overcome domestic constraints such as labor shortages and high costs, thereby strengthening their competitive edge against China. As an example, HD Hyundai is investing $550 million to revive a defunct shipyard in the Philippines, with plans to build up to 10 vessels annually and create 7,000 jobs. This move highlights how global trade policies are reshaping manufacturing and investment flows across Asia (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>In new manager Thomas Frank's debut, Tottenham Hotspur suffered a heartbreaking loss to Paris St-Germain in the Super Cup, surrendering a 2-0 lead in the final minutes before losing in a penalty shootout. Despite the late collapse, the team's performance for the first 85 minutes showed promising signs of Frank's tactical influence. The team demonstrated a pragmatic and efficient approach, with both of their goals coming from well-executed set-pieces, a hallmark of Frank's previous coaching success. While the loss was a blow, the game indicated a clear strategic shift from the previous season under a new system.</p>

          <p>As trust in traditional media declines, millions of Americans are turning to online creators and influencers for news, creating a new and challenging information ecosystem. This article argues that amidst the misinformation, a class of "evidence-based creators"—journalists and experts using social platforms—is emerging to provide factual, nuanced content. These independent voices build trust through direct engagement but struggle to compete with viral falsehoods. The author proposes creating new infrastructure, such as certification systems and collaborative frameworks, to support these creators and help audiences distinguish credible sources from disinformation in this evolving media landscape.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams are now valued at $10.43 billion, making them the second most valuable franchise in the NFL, behind only the Dallas Cowboys, according to a new Sportico ranking. This represents a dramatic turnaround from a decade ago when the team, then in St. Louis, was ranked last with a valuation under $1 billion. The surge is largely attributed to owner Stan Kroenke's vision, the move back to Los Angeles, and the development of the state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium. This valuation highlights the franchise's immense success in re-establishing itself as a premier team in a major market (not investment advice).</p>
