          <p>During a Lakers NBA Summer League game, Bronny James showcased a solid performance under the watchful eye and direct instruction of his father, LeBron James. The younger James scored 14 points and demonstrated strong defensive skills, contributing to the Lakers' 94-81 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans. Throughout the game, LeBron was seen actively coaching his son from his baseline seat, offering advice that Bronny appeared to immediately implement on the court. Lakers assistant coach Lindsey Harding praised Bronny's decision-making and emphasized the importance of live game experience for his development.</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests China's Dams on Tibetan Plateau May Increase Dry-Season Water Flow to India</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 00:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that China's massive dam projects on the Tibetan plateau, contrary to fears in India, may actually alleviate water scarcity during dry seasons. By analyzing data from two existing upstream dams, Zangmu and Jiacha, researchers found that downstream water flows to India increased significantly, with a rise of over 50 percent in February. This suggests that the dams regulate water release, boosting supply during drier periods rather than causing droughts as previously feared. The findings provide a new perspective on the potential downstream impacts of China's controversial dam-building activities in the region.</p>

          <p>Iga Swiatek secured her sixth Grand Slam title with a decisive victory over American Amanda Anisimova in the Wimbledon women's final. The match, which lasted just 57 minutes, ended in a 6-0, 6-0 shutout, the first time a player failed to win a single game in the women's final in 114 years. For Swiatek, this victory marks her first championship on Wimbledon's grass courts, adding to her previous titles on clay and hard courts. The final was a significant milestone for Anisimova, who was competing in her first Grand Slam title match after taking a career break in 2023 for mental health.</p>

Their efforts are supported by the non-profit organization 300 Justice Road, which is providing meals to first responders and volunteers. The volunteers described the destruction as unprecedented, highlighting the violence of the flood that flattened forests and swept away belongings.</p>

          <p>China's space economy is experiencing a significant boom, driven by a surge in private investment and strong government support. This growth is part of a global trend that is projected to see the space economy reach $1.8 trillion by 2035, with new interest in areas like satellite constellations, space manufacturing, and resource mining. In China, private investment in the aerospace industry is expected to constitute 45% of total investment by 2025, a dramatic increase from 12% in 2020. Companies like i-Space and LandSpace are leading the charge, achieving major milestones such as launching the first private rocket into orbit. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite recent speculation about resuming production, Boeing's iconic C-17 Globemaster III cargo jet was originally discontinued in 2015 primarily due to a lack of demand. The U.S. Air Force, its main customer, had completed its purchase order, and international sales were insufficient to keep the Long Beach, California production line open. Furthermore, defense budget cuts under the 2011 Budget Control Act made the expensive aircraft a less viable option for continued procurement. The C-17 was renowned for its massive cargo capacity and ability to land on short, undeveloped runways, making it a versatile asset for both military and humanitarian missions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several companies, including London-based Better Dairy, are pioneering the production of lab-grown cheese using precision fermentation to create casein, the key protein in milk. This technology aims to produce cheese that tastes like the real thing without involving animals, but it faces significant hurdles. The market for plant-based cheese has recently declined, and consumer concerns about price and ultra-processed foods present challenges. Proponents argue that lab-grown versions can be healthier and more sustainable, and they hope to overcome taste and texture issues that have plagued earlier vegan cheese alternatives, eventually launching their products in the coming years.</p>

          <p>A woman from Norfolk, England, successfully located her long-lost older brother in Australia after learning of his existence only after their mother's death. Jess Basey-Fisher was told by her father that her mother had given a baby boy up for adoption in 1962 before they had met. Using the few details she had, Jess tracked down her brother, Alistair Dalgliesh, and the two connected via FaceTime, discovering remarkable similarities. Shortly after they first spoke, Alistair was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer, prompting Jess to travel to Australia to support him and make memories with the family she never knew she had.</p>

          <p>The reality TV show "Love Island" is experiencing a revival in viewership, with its social media growth, particularly on TikTok, significantly outpacing its television audience. While TV ratings are returning to 2022 levels, the show's official accounts have gained over a million new followers on TikTok alone in 2025. Content creators and fans note that short-form clips, recaps, and online discourse make the show more accessible to busy viewers who may not commit to watching the hour-long nightly episodes. This shift in consumption habits is changing how audiences engage with the contestants, relying on condensed clips rather than the full narrative of the show.</p>

          <p>With the cost of package holidays rising, families are using various "hacks" to reduce their vacation expenses significantly. Strategies include booking last-minute deals, traveling off-peak, and finding "kids go free" offers, which one family estimated saved them over £3,000. Other creative methods involve using home-swapping websites to trade a city flat for a Spanish villa, thereby eliminating accommodation costs. Some travelers also utilize credit card loyalty points for flights or engage in house-sitting to get free lodging, allowing them to travel affordably both in the UK and abroad, such as in the United States.</p>
