          <p>Deutsche Bank has named DuPont a short-term "buy" catalyst, anticipating that its upcoming Qnity Electronics spinoff on November 1 will unlock significant shareholder value. Analysts estimate DuPont currently trades at a 38% discount compared to its sum-of-parts valuation. The CNBC Investing Club plans to hold both DuPont and the new Qnity shares, viewing Qnity as a potentially stronger long-term investment due to its growth prospects in the semiconductor industry. Separately, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk experienced stock declines after President Trump's remarks about potentially lowering Ozempic's out-of-pocket costs to $150 a month, impacting the GLP-1 drug market.

          <p>A federal judge has lifted travel restrictions for Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, allowing him to speak at rallies and events across the U.S. as he fights his deportation case brought by the Trump administration. Khalil, a green card holder, was previously confined to a few states but the judge deemed him not a flight risk. He was arrested by ICE agents in March, becoming a prominent figure in the Trump administration's crackdown on pro-Palestinian campus activism, which it alleges is antisemitic. Khalil denies the government's accusations of misrepresenting past associations on his green card application and emphasizes the importance of his First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk ally Jared Isaacman is reportedly back in consideration for the role of NASA Administrator, following the withdrawal of his previous nomination in May. The White House had pulled Isaacman's nomination earlier this year amidst growing tensions between President Donald Trump and Musk, with Trump citing "a thorough review of prior associations." Isaacman, a billionaire private astronaut and SpaceX investor who led two private spaceflight missions, suspected his ties to Musk were a factor in the initial decision. Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy has confirmed meeting with several candidates for the permanent role at President Trump's direction.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee is initiating the crucial process for deciding which states will hold the earliest presidential nominating contests for the 2028 election. The party's influential rules and bylaws panel will focus on the application process, aiming to select four or five states across the East, Midwest, South, and West regions to ensure a comprehensive test of candidates. This development follows the DNC's overhaul of the early voting calendar during President Biden's term, which saw South Carolina take the top spot. States like New Hampshire and Nevada are already actively making their case to secure these influential early voting positions, highlighting their unique demographics and political relevance.</p>

          <p>Gold's recent record-breaking run, exceeding $4,300 and up over 60% this year, is prompting a significant shift away from the traditional 60/40 stock-bond investment portfolio. Many strategists and investors are now advocating for a 60/20/20 model, allocating 20% to alternatives like gold and Bitcoin, citing increased correlation between stocks and bonds. Central bank demand, de-dollarization, and geopolitical tensions are driving gold's appeal as a hedge against inflation and risk, with gold ETFs seeing record inflows. While gold is considered "risk off," Bitcoin, also reaching record highs, represents a more "risk on" alternative in this evolving portfolio strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. electricity companies are struggling to accurately forecast the true power demand from the artificial intelligence boom, as tech firms are reportedly shopping large data center projects to multiple utilities simultaneously. This practice creates significant uncertainty, making it difficult for utilities to plan sufficient power generation and ensure grid reliability, which could ultimately impact consumer electricity prices. Regulators and industry leaders express concern that over-inflated projections could lead to billions in unnecessary infrastructure investments. While experts generally agree on a historic increase in electricity consumption, utilities need firm financial commitments from data centers to avoid overbuilding amidst existing supply chain issues and rising costs for electrical equipment.</p>

          <p>The 2025 holiday season is projected to set new travel records, with Americans expected to spend an unprecedented $311 billion on flights and hotels, averaging $2,586 per person. NerdWallet's annual report advises booking Thanksgiving travel immediately and Christmas travel by the first week of November, specifically 51 days out for Christmas, to mitigate rising costs. Airlines are proactively adding approximately 250,000 more seats for Thanksgiving in an effort to keep pace with the surging demand. Despite the potential for record-breaking travel numbers, gas prices are falling nationally and approaching $3 per gallon, which could offer some relief for those driving to their destinations.</p>

          <p>Four years after their last official match and the Taliban's return to power, Afghanistan's women's refugee football team is preparing for its international comeback in the "FIFA Unites: Women's Series." The newly formed team will play against Chad, Libya, and the UAE, aiming to send a powerful message to the oppressive rulers in their homeland who have stripped women's rights, including education and sport. For players like Najma Arefi, who fled Afghanistan, this tournament represents not just wearing a jersey but also giving a voice to countless silenced women. FIFA's comprehensive strategy to support Afghan women in football has made this significant step towards readmission into the global fold possible.</p>

This collaboration, guided by Afrobeat collective BANTU, aimed to bridge disparate musical traditions and foster profound cultural exchange. The musicians first met in Lagos, Nigeria, where they explored the legacy of Afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti, before reconvening in Germany for their final performance. The project showcased works that placed classical music in dialogue with contemporary Afrobeat, celebrating artistic freedom and significantly expanding the participants' worldviews through shared musical experiences.</p>

          <p>Undisputed heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk has announced plans to continue fighting for two more years, targeting a return to the ring in 2026, despite previously hinting at retirement after just one more bout. The 38-year-old Ukrainian, a two-time undisputed champion across cruiserweight and heavyweight divisions, explicitly ruled out a fight with British heavyweight Moses Itauma, playfully noting Itauma's comment about not hitting "grandpas." Usyk is currently recovering from a back injury that postponed a fight with WBO mandatory challenger Joseph Parker. Negotiations for his next opponent are ongoing, as he aims to defend his legacy and continue his impressive winning score.</p>

With Forest 17th in the Premier League, Postecoglou vowed to win silverware if given time, asserting he is a winner despite current perceptions. He cited his Europa League victory with Tottenham, which ended a 17-year trophy drought for the club, as evidence of his capabilities. Postecoglou argued that critics overlook his past successes and the context of team performance, insisting his story "always ends the same - with me and a trophy" when given sufficient time to build.</p>

Trump, while acknowledging such heavy tariffs might be "unsustainable," expressed optimism about future relations and plans to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea within a couple of weeks.
