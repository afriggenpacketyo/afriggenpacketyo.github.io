          <h2>Dollar's Rise Following US Strikes on Iran Expected to Be Temporary</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 04:55:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. dollar experienced an initial surge due to its safe-haven appeal after the U.S. military strikes on Iran. However, analysts suggest this strength is unlikely to last, citing underlying concerns about U.S. fiscal policy, trade wars, and decreasing international demand for U.S. assets. The immediate boost to the dollar stems from fears of Iranian retaliation, potentially disrupting oil transit through the Strait of Hormuz. RBC Capital Markets analysts caution that Iran may employ asymmetric capabilities to raise the economic cost of the combined US/Israeli operations, adding complexity to the situation. The dollar's long-term concerns outweigh its temporary gains. The optimism score is based on the fact that Iran has not officially retaliated and that the situation is currently stable.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump detailed the U.S. strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities on his social media platform, Truth Social, claiming "monumental damage" to all nuclear sites, supported by satellite images. He highlighted the obliteration of facilities, including the Fordo enrichment facility, with damage occurring far below ground level. Several B-2 bombers participated in the strikes on Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with over 125 aircraft involved in the mission. Trump emphasized the depth and shielding of the targeted structures, indicating a successful operation. The article details Trump's claims regarding the success of the strikes and the extent of the damage inflicted on Iranian nuclear facilities. The optimism score is based on the fact that there were no reports of civilian casualties and that Trump's tone was confident and assured.</p>

          <p>Mounjaro, a weight loss injection, will be available through GPs in England for individuals meeting strict criteria, as part of a phased rollout managed by NHS England. Initially licensed for type 2 diabetes, Mounjaro can now be prescribed to help people with obesity lose weight, making individuals feel full and reducing food intake. Eligibility requires a BMI of 40 or over (or 37.5 for minority ethnic backgrounds) and the presence of four out of five specific conditions, including type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. Patients will receive comprehensive care, including regular check-ups and exercise support; however, access may vary by location, and GPs are urging people to check eligibility before seeking the prescription. The optimism score is based on the fact that the rollout is gradual and measured, prioritizing those most in need.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police chief expressed shock and frustration over a planned protest in support of Palestine Action, an activist group that recently broke into RAF Brize Norton. The home secretary is reportedly preparing to proscribe the group, effectively branding it a terrorist organization. Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley emphasized the importance of the right to protest but condemned actions supporting what he described as an "organised extremist criminal group." While the Met lacks legal power to prevent the protest before proscription, conditions have been imposed, limiting the protest to a specific time and excluding it from much of Westminster. The optimism score is based on the fact that authorities are taking measures to manage the protest and prevent disruption.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iran's parliament approved the closure of the Strait of Hormuz after U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, a move that could alienate neighbors and trade partners. Experts warn that blocking the strait would harm Iran more than others, risking hostilities and damaging its relationship with key Asian markets like China. The decision now rests with Iran's national security council, and the closure could lead to higher energy prices and increased geopolitical tensions. While the possibility of closure remains minimal, Iran risks turning oil-producing neighbors into enemies and provoking a strong response from the U.S. and Israel. The optimism score is based on the assessment that closure is unlikely and that Iran has much to lose.</p>

          <p>A National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin warns of a "heightened threat environment in the United States" following U.S. military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites. While there are no specific, credible threats, the bulletin notes the likelihood of low-level cyber attacks by pro-Iranian hacktivists and potential attacks by Iranian government-affiliated cyber actors. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem stated that the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict increases the risk of cyberattacks, violence, and antisemitic hate crimes. The bulletin also cautions that violent extremists in the U.S. could independently mobilize in response to the conflict, particularly if Iranian leadership calls for retaliatory violence. The optimism score is based on the fact that there are no known threats and that law enforcement is taking precautions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have found evidence that subatomic particles from cosmic rays may affect the efficiency of error correction techniques in quantum computing. Researchers monitored superconducting quantum chips alongside muons produced by cosmic rays, as well as gamma ray-induced particle disturbances. They observed quasiparticle bursts leading to correlated errors induced solely by muons, separating their contributions from gamma rays. These findings could be significant for the scaling of quantum processors and the design of fault-tolerant quantum computing systems. The proposed detection method could also be applied in cosmic ray and dark matter particle detection. The optimism score is based on the potential for improved quantum computing and the advancement of scientific knowledge.</p>

The plan, which may slash energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 UK businesses, aims to boost growth by supporting key industries. The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to ¬£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027 for eligible manufacturing firms. The strategy also includes measures to speed up the connection of new factories to the energy grid and support the creation of new jobs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite facing extensive sanctions following its invasion of Ukraine, Russia's economy has shown remarkable resilience. In 2024, the Russian economy outgrew all G7 nations, driven by record military spending and stable oil exports redirected to China and India. However, persistent inflation, high interest rates, and worker shortages are creating challenges. Russia's economy minister warned of a potential recession, but economists predict a mild downturn rather than a collapse. The optimism score is based on the resilience of the Russian economy, but also considers the challenges it faces. (not investment advice)</p>
