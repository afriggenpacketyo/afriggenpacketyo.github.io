          <p>HP's second-quarter earnings fell short of analysts' predictions, primarily due to increased costs from President Trump's tariffs.  Revenue slightly exceeded expectations, but the company's guidance for the third quarter also missed projections.  HP CEO Enrique Lores stated that the company is mitigating the tariff impact by expanding its manufacturing footprint outside of China.  The company expects to fully offset increased costs by the fourth quarter.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported strong first-quarter results, exceeding expectations for both earnings and revenue, driven by robust growth in its data center business.  Despite a 73% year-over-year increase in data center sales, the company's guidance was lower than anticipated due to U.S. government restrictions on its H20 chips for China.  Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the significant impact of the export ban on its China business. The company's overall performance reflects strong global demand for its AI chips.</p>
