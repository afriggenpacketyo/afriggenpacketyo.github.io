          <p>In Wilmington, Los Angeles, 31 construction workers were successfully rescued after being trapped in a tunnel collapse. The incident occurred at the Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel, part of the Clearwater Project, a major wastewater management initiative. All workers were brought to safety approximately an hour after the collapse and were found to have no visible injuries, having climbed over a large pile of dirt to escape. The Los Angeles Fire Department deployed extensive resources, including all its Urban Search and Rescue teams, to manage the emergency.</p>

          <p>The UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has authorized Royal Mail to cease second-class letter deliveries on Saturdays as a cost-saving measure. This reform to the Universal Service Obligation (USO) comes as the volume of letters sent annually declines, increasing delivery costs and stamp prices. Under the new rules, first-class letters will continue to be delivered six days a week, but second-class mail will be limited to every other weekday. Ofcom stated the change is necessary for the postal service's survival but emphasized that Royal Mail must implement it effectively.</p>

          <p>A former official from China's central bank has argued that the yuan possesses the potential to become a safe-haven currency, citing its institutional credibility and strong macroeconomic fundamentals. In a recent article, Sheng Songcheng noted China's low inflation, current account surplus, and large foreign reserves as significant advantages. He contended that the yuan has already demonstrated stability and reduced sensitivity to global risk indicators, such as the war in Ukraine and US tariffs. The discussion highlights an ongoing debate about the internationalization of the yuan amid wavering confidence in the US dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article highlights Vienna's housing system as a successful model, often described as a "renters' utopia," in contrast to housing crises elsewhere. The city's stability is attributed to its large social housing stock, which comprises 43% of its housing units and serves a wide range of income levels, not just the poor. This system, originating from the "Red Vienna" era of the 1920s, helps keep rents low in both the social and private sectors. While acknowledging challenges like complex allocation systems, the article suggests that Vienna's long-term political commitment to treating housing as a basic need offers valuable lessons for other cities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the Beijing Institute of Technology have successfully created a cyborg bee by developing the world's lightest insect brain controller. Weighing just 74 milligrams, the device is strapped to a bee's back and uses three needles to send electronic pulses into its brain. These pulses create illusions that effectively command the bee's flight, directing it to turn, advance, or retreat. In tests, the cyborg bee followed the given commands with a 90% success rate, marking a significant step in micro-robotics and bio-integrated technology.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government is implementing new measures to address persistent youth unemployment amid a sluggish economy. Authorities will offer a one-time subsidy of up to 1,500 yuan (US$209) to companies that hire unemployed individuals aged 16 to 24. To qualify, employers must sign formal contracts and make full social insurance contributions for at least three months. This initiative, funded by unemployment insurance reserves, is part of a broader effort to stabilize the labor market, which also includes expanding the "work-for-relief" public works program to generate more jobs for vulnerable groups.</p>

Infantino has cultivated a close relationship with President Trump, making several appearances alongside him and attending his inauguration. The decision to locate an office in the Trump-owned property further solidifies this relationship as FIFA expands its presence in the United States.</p>

          <p>Shares of WK Kellogg, the North American cereal maker, surged over 56% following reports that it is in advanced talks to be acquired by Italian confectionery giant Ferrero. The deal, potentially valued around $3 billion, could be announced as soon as this week. This acquisition would give Ferrero, owner of brands like Nutella and Kinder, a dominant position in the US breakfast cereal market. The move comes as WK Kellogg has faced financial struggles, while Ferrero has been actively expanding its portfolio by acquiring other major food businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to maintain its policy interest rate at 2.5%, opting to hold steady while it evaluates the effectiveness of recent measures designed to cool Seoul's overheating housing market. Housing prices in the capital surged over 19% in June, prompting authorities to address the rapid expansion of household debt. While the broader economy showed signs of contraction, the central bank prioritized financial stability over stimulating growth. Analysts expect the bank may consider rate cuts later in the year once new mortgage lending restrictions take effect. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has appointed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to serve as the temporary head of NASA. The decision comes weeks after the president withdrew the nomination of billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, who had been recommended by Elon Musk. Trump cited Isaacman's past political donations to Democrats and the potential conflict of interest due to his professional ties to Musk, whose company SpaceX is a major NASA contractor. Duffy, a member of the president's cabinet, will now lead the space agency in a dual-hatted role during a critical period of lunar and Martian exploration planning.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced it will send more defensive weapons to Ukraine, reversing a brief pause in some shipments that occurred last week. President Trump stated that Ukraine must be able to defend itself from being "hit very hard" by Russia. The initial halt was part of a broader review of weapons transfers, with some officials concerned about dwindling US stockpiles. The reversal comes after the president expressed his disappointment with Russian President Vladimir Putin and had a "fruitful" call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about strengthening Ukraine's air defenses.</p>
