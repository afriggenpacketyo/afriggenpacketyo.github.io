          <p>A man previously issued a restraining order for stalking British tennis player Emma Raducanu was stopped from applying for tickets to the Wimbledon Championships. The All England Club's security system identified and blocked his attempt to enter the public ballot. Earlier in the year, Raducanu was visibly distressed after spotting the same man, who had followed her to four consecutive tournaments, in the stands during a match in Dubai. The man had previously given Raducanu a letter and requested a photo in a coffee shop. Authorities circulated his name among tennis organizations following the issuance of the restraining order.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. men's national soccer team is under immense pressure as the 2026 FIFA World Cup approaches, with the majority of the games to be hosted on U.S. soil. Recent disappointing losses and a conflict between star player Christian Pulisic and coach Mauricio Pochettino have dampened excitement. The team suffered an embarrassing group stage elimination in the Copa America tournament last year, leading to the firing of the coach. Despite the challenges, the upcoming Gold Cup presents an opportunity for younger players to prove themselves and potentially shift the narrative surrounding the team. The U.S. won their opening game of the Gold Cup against Trinidad and Tobago.</p>

          <p>Greta Thunberg, previously criticized on Chinese social media, is experiencing a surge in support, particularly after her attempt to sail to Gaza was halted by Israeli forces. The 22-year-old activist aimed to break Israel's siege of Gaza in a show of solidarity, but her boat was intercepted, and she was deported. This action has resonated with many Chinese social media users, who now view her as consistently supporting Palestine and opposing Israel. Commenters on Weibo, China's version of Twitter, express respect for her dedication and willingness to risk her life for her beliefs, marking a shift in sentiment towards the environmental activist.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The annual financial disclosures for Supreme Court justices reveal details of their income, gifts, and positions held outside the court in 2024. Three justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Neil Gorsuch, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, reported income from book royalties. Clarence Thomas reported no gifts or outside income, despite scrutiny over past travels with Harlan Crow. Several justices disclosed teaching positions at various law schools, while Kavanaugh continues to coach girls' basketball. These disclosures have received increased attention following reports of luxury trips accepted by Justice Thomas from a GOP donor, leading to calls for a code of conduct for the Supreme Court. The high court adopted formal ethics rules in November 2023, though they lack an enforcement mechanism.</p>

          <p>An advice columnist responds to a reader who was diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder, assuring them they don't need to explain their past neurotic behaviors to everyone. The columnist shares personal anecdotes of similar experiences and emphasizes that the strengthening and change within the reader will be self-evident to those who accompanied them through it. The advice focuses on using the new understanding to help others facing similar difficulties. In another letter, the columnist dismisses the pressure to fill retirement with service and social activities, encouraging the reader to relish their solitary days and cultivate their own consciousness.</p>

          <p>Yellow heat health alerts have been issued for most of England, with temperatures expected to climb as high as 33C by the weekend, signaling a likely heatwave. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) warns of potential impacts on health and social services, particularly for vulnerable populations. The Met Office notes that heatwaves are becoming increasingly common due to rising greenhouse gas concentrations. UKHSA advises people to check on vulnerable family, friends, and neighbors and to take precautions against the heat. While high temperatures are expected, the UK's June temperature record is unlikely to be broken.</p>

          <p>Researchers have confirmed that Captain James Cook's lost ship, HMS Endeavour, is located in Newport Harbor, Rhode Island, resolving a long-standing mystery. The Australian National Maritime Museum's report details a 26-year research program that pinpointed the ship's location. The Endeavour, used by Cook in his voyages across the Pacific in the 1700s, was later used to transport British troops and prisoners during the American Revolutionary War. It was deliberately sunk in Newport Harbor in 1778. The wreck site is now being protected to preserve its historical and cultural significance.</p>

Chestnut has since resolved the conflict, stating that his relationships with other companies, including those in the plant-based space, do not conflict with his love for hot dogs. Last year, Chestnut staged his own competition at Fort Bliss Army base, while Patrick Bertoletti won the Nathan's contest.

The production team uses the castle estate for elaborate missions designed to test contestants and provide opportunities to win money and immunity. Cumming's wardrobe has evolved from "nice little tartan suits" to "insane capes and weird dresses," with stylist Sam Spector creating intricate, "creepy glam" looks inspired by each episode's mission.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer has defended his decision to hold a national inquiry into grooming gangs, despite previously accusing those calling for one of jumping on a far-right bandwagon. Starmer said he had commissioned Dame Louise Casey to write a report to "double check" the issue and agreed with her conclusion. Baroness Casey said she changed her mind on the need for a national inquiry after being "unimpressed" that more local councils did not volunteer to set up their own inquiries and some organizations were reluctant to talk to her investigators. The report recommends a national police operation to review cases of child exploitation and a national inquiry overseen by an Independent Commission.</p>
