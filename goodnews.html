        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nottingham Forest is reportedly set to appoint Ange Postecoglou as their new head coach following the sudden dismissal of Nuno Espirito Santo. Postecoglou, who was sacked by Tottenham at the end of last season despite winning the Europa League, is considered a strong candidate to take over at the City Ground. Nuno's departure after 21 months surprised many players, especially after he guided the club to European qualification for the first time in decades. The potential appointment of Postecoglou has received mixed reactions from fans, with some wary of his high-risk tactical approach.</p>

          <p>A long-standing succession dispute within the Murdoch media empire has been resolved, cementing Lachlan Murdoch's future control over Fox News and News Corp. A new agreement establishes a trust controlled by Lachlan, while his more politically moderate siblings—Prudence, Elisabeth, and James—will cease to be beneficiaries of trusts holding company shares. Instead, they are expected to sell their holdings and will each receive approximately $1.1 billion, effectively ending their influence over the media conglomerate's conservative direction. The deal concludes years of family turmoil that famously inspired the television series "Succession."</p>

          <p>Eighteen-year-old soccer prodigy Lily Yohannes is making waves after a standout debut season with European powerhouse OL Lyon, where she scored and was named player of the match. Having moved from Virginia to Amsterdam at age 10, she developed at the famed Ajax academy before signing professionally at 15. Yohannes chose to represent the U.S. national team, scoring just minutes into her debut and becoming the third-youngest goalscorer in USWNT history. Now playing for one of the world's top clubs, she is regarded as a composed and creative midfielder poised for a significant future in the sport.</p>

          <p>The city of Shenzhen, China, has launched a new service allowing international tourists to receive tax refunds instantly through overseas e-wallets like AlipayHK. This initiative, a partnership between Ant International's Alipay+ and local authorities, aims to streamline the refund process from days to seconds. The move is part of a broader Chinese strategy to attract more foreign visitors and stimulate consumer spending. To further encourage tourism, China recently lowered the minimum purchase amount for tax refunds and increased the cash refund limit, expanding the program to more stores and locations.</p>

          <p>In the current political era, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) are experiencing a significant increase in student applications. According to former Spelman College president Beverly Daniel Tatum, Black students are actively seeking educational environments where they feel affirmed and where their history is not being erased, in contrast to broader societal trends. This surge is occurring as the Trump administration increases pressure on elite universities over issues like diversity initiatives. While the growing interest is a positive sign for HBCUs, it also presents financial challenges, as many of these institutions lack the resources to provide sufficient financial aid for all applicants.</p>

          <p>The contest to replace Angela Rayner as the deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party is underway, with several prominent figures entering the race. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, a cabinet minister, has announced her candidacy, positioning herself as a unifier who can challenge the Reform UK party. Other declared candidates include left-wing MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy and Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Emily Thornberry, who promises to be a critical voice for the party membership. Candidates have a short window to secure the necessary nominations from fellow MPs before the decision goes to a vote by party members.</p>

          <p>One year after Brian Niccol took the helm as CEO of Starbucks, his efforts to revitalize the coffee giant have yielded mixed results. Hired to reverse declining sales, Niccol has focused on improving the customer experience by bringing back personal touches and making stores more welcoming, a strategy he calls returning "back to Starbucks." While the company recently posted a record sales week, overall traffic remains down and the stock has fallen. Some changes have been unpopular with baristas, and the company has yet to resume negotiations with the Starbucks Workers United union, indicating a challenging road ahead.</p>

          <p>In a landmark antitrust ruling, a U.S. judge decided against breaking up Google, citing the rapid emergence of generative AI as a significant factor that could disrupt the search market. The Department of Justice had sought to force Google to sell its Chrome browser after a court found it had illegally monopolized search. However, Judge Amit Mehta's final decision acknowledged that AI-powered chatbots from companies like OpenAI and others represent a new form of competition that could change the industry. Instead of a breakup, Google will be required to share some information with rivals and establish an oversight committee.</p>
