          <p>This article provides an overview of current savings account interest rates, noting a national average of 0.38% while high-yield savings accounts offer significantly more, between 4.11% and 4.30%. It advises consumers to consider high-yield accounts, particularly from online banks which tend to have lower overhead costs and thus offer better rates and fewer fees. To secure the best returns, the article recommends comparing various account options, paying attention not only to the interest rate but also to potential fees that could diminish earnings over time.

          <p>The article reports the price of gold at $3,337.20 per ounce as of mid-July 2025, while explaining its traditional role as a safe-haven asset and inflation hedge for investors. It details the various factors that cause gold's price to fluctuate, including fundamental supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability. The analysis also touches on the inverse relationship between gold prices and interest rates, as well as the influence of currency movements and central bank policies on the precious metal's market value.

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have announced they will take no further action against the Irish language rap group Kneecap following a criminal investigation into their performance at the Glastonbury festival. The probe was initiated after the group displayed pro-Palestinian messages, which had previously drawn controversy. After consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service, authorities concluded there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction, though a separate investigation into the English punk-rap duo Bob Vylan's set remains active.</p>

          <p>With U.S. inflation rising to 2.7% in June, the likelihood of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates soon has diminished, creating an extended opportunity for savers. The article suggests that a short-term Certificate of Deposit (CD) is a smart financial move, as it allows individuals to lock in currently high interest rates while maintaining flexibility. Because rate cuts are not imminent, savers have more time to shop for the best CD terms, adapt to changing economic conditions, and still earn hundreds of dollars in interest on a substantial deposit.

          <p>In the competitive streaming market, major platforms like Netflix and Disney+ are strategically leveraging children's programming as a crucial tool to retain subscribers and drive profits. Industry experts note that kids' content is highly effective because it is generally less expensive to produce and has immense re-watch value, which significantly reduces customer churn—a key metric for streaming service stability. This focus is shifting content strategy, with shows like "CoComelon" and "Bluey" becoming powerful assets in the battle for long-term viewership and profitability.</p>

          <p>Chevron has finalized its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, overcoming a significant challenge from rival Exxon Mobil.

          <p>A new analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center reveals the financial impact of the tax law recently signed by President Trump, showing that while most households will see savings, the benefits are skewed towards the wealthy. On average, households will save about $2,900 in 2026, but approximately 60% of the total tax breaks will go to the top 20% of earners. For instance, the lowest-income households will save about $150 on average, while the highest-income households will save over $12,500. (not investment advice)</p>

The investment bank anticipates that this will lead to a significant surge in AMD's data center revenue, projecting it to reach $15 billion by 2026, far exceeding current Wall Street consensus estimates.
