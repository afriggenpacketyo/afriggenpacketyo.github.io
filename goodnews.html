          <p>Liverpool has turned down a formal approach from German club Bayern Munich for their Colombian forward, Luis Diaz. The Premier League club has made it clear that the 28-year-old player is not for sale at any price this summer and they will not engage in transfer discussions. This follows a similar rejection of an approach from Barcelona earlier in the summer. Diaz is considered a key player for Liverpool, having scored 22 goals for his club and country last season and playing an integral role in the team's success.</p>

          <p>The Dalai Lama has announced that the Tibetan Buddhist institution will continue after his death, ending years of speculation about his succession.

The decision is politically significant for Tibetans who oppose Chinese control and view the Dalai Lama as their spiritual leader. China's foreign ministry reiterated its stance that it must approve the next leader, setting the stage for potential conflict over who is recognized as the legitimate successor.</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened the Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Area, a massive new resort on its eastern coast, to domestic tourists. State media reported that the resort can accommodate nearly 20,000 people and showcased images of visitors enjoying the beach facilities. The project is seen as a key initiative for leader Kim Jong Un, who is keen on developing the country's tourism industry as a source of foreign currency. Russian tourists are also expected to begin visiting the resort soon, as North Korea slowly reopens its borders following the pandemic, though tourism remains highly restricted.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese luxury jeweller Laopu Gold surged 15% to a record high as a large block of shares became available for trading after a one-year lock-up period expired. Despite concerns that the newly available 69 million shares could cause a price drop, investors rushed to buy into the company, which has seen its stock increase over 1,300% since its 2024 debut. Analysts attribute the strong investor confidence to the company's powerful branding, strong pricing power, and potential for overseas growth.

          <p>In a surprising start to NBA free agency, the Milwaukee Bucks are set to sign center Myles Turner to a four-year, $107 million contract, a move facilitated by the team waiving star guard Damian Lillard. Turner has spent his entire 10-year career with the Indiana Pacers, who recently reached the NBA finals. Lillard, who suffered a ruptured Achilles tendon in the playoffs, is now a free agent and will likely miss most or all of the upcoming season while he rehabilitates.

This move aims to make it cheaper for companies like Intel and TSMC to expand advanced manufacturing in the U.S. The bill reflects the administration's focus on using tariffs and tax incentives to onshore critical industries and limit China's capabilities.
