        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government is considering plans to have convicted criminals perform unpaid work such as filling potholes and cleaning bins. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood aims to expand unpaid work opportunities, partnering probation teams with local councils and private companies to assign jobs to offenders. Offenders would not receive wages, but the money earned would be directed to a fund for victim's groups. This initiative aims to provide a more meaningful punishment and address the prison overcrowding crisis, while also completing tasks the public wants done. </p>

          <p>Edan Alexander, a 21-year-old American-Israeli soldier recently freed from Hamas captivity, thanked President Trump in an emotional phone call, crediting him for saving his life. Alexander was held hostage for over 580 days after being abducted by Hamas on October 7, 2023. Trump expressed American solidarity and his administration‚Äôs commitment to bringing all hostages home, and the Alexander family thanked Trump, the negotiation team, and the Israeli Defense Forces for the outcome. The release has reignited calls to bring home the remaining hostages in Gaza, with former hostages urging Netanyahu and Trump to intensify efforts for a comprehensive agreement. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article humorously outlines the challenges of taking a break from social media, from announcing the break to inevitably finding substitutes like LinkedIn, WhatsApp groups, and Goodreads. The author explores the difficulty of defining what counts as social media and the constant urge to check in on others' lives, eventually leading to a relapse and the creation of an article about the experience. It's a satirical take on the pervasive nature of social media and the struggle to disconnect. </p>

          <p>Journalism, ridden by Umberto Rispoli, won the 150th running of the Preakness Stakes, edging out Gosger in a come-from-behind victory. Trained by Michael McCarthy, Journalism overcame a bump near the quarter pole to secure the win, marking Rispoli's first victory in a Triple Crown race and McCarthy's second. The race was held at Pimlico Race Course for the last time before its planned reconstruction, and Sovereignty, the Kentucky Derby winner, did not participate. The win was especially meaningful for co-owner Aaron Wellman, and the next Preakness is set to be held at nearby Laurel Park before returning to the new Pimlico in 2027. </p>

          <p>Taiwan's last operating nuclear power reactor was shut down, marking the end of four decades of operation and aligning with the government's policy to phase out atomic energy. The No. 2 reactor at the Maanshan power plant in southern Pingtung County ceased operations, and the shutdown comes as Taiwan aims to transition away from nuclear power following Japan's 2011 Fukushima disaster. The shutdown raises uncertainty about Taiwan's ability to achieve its goal of phasing out atomic energy. </p>

          <p>The UK and EU are negotiating key points before their first bilateral summit since Brexit, focusing on a joint declaration, a security and defense pact, and measures to reduce trade barriers. The UK is taking a sector-by-sector approach, with a plant and animal health deal being a key area of discussion, while France is pushing for long-term EU fishing rights in UK waters. Discussions also include a "mobility" section, with the EU seeking a youth mobility scheme and the UK prioritizing reduced visa restrictions for musicians and recognition of professional qualifications. The negotiations are influenced by the geopolitical situation, including concerns about Russia and China, and the potential impact of the US under Donald Trump. </p>
