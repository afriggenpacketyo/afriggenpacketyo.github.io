          <p>Justin Fulcher, a senior advisor to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has resigned from his position at the Pentagon after a planned six-month term of service. Fulcher described his departure as amicable and highlighted the "great work" being done by Hegseth to restore a "warrior ethos" in the military. During his tenure, he contributed to major acquisition program reviews, streamlined IT procurement, and supported efforts to redirect funds toward military readiness. The Department of Defense confirmed the resignation and expressed gratitude for his service, though his departure is part of a broader personnel shuffle within Hegseth's office.</p>

          <h2>Number of Individuals Missing in Texas Floods Drastically Reduced in Kerr County</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly lowered the number of people reported missing following devastating floods earlier in the month, from nearly 100 down to just three. This reduction is attributed to extensive follow-up work by state and local agencies, which successfully verified that most of the initially unaccounted-for individuals were safe. At its peak, over 160 people were listed as missing in the county. The update brings a measure of relief to the community, although the overall death toll from the statewide flooding remains at 134, with 107 of those fatalities occurring in Kerr County.</p>

          <p>England's rugby team achieved a decisive win against the US Eagles in a match marked by extreme humidity and two lengthy lightning delays in Washington D.C. Despite the challenging conditions, the English side, composed largely of young professionals, scored six tries to secure the victory. The US team struggled to keep pace, with their only points coming from a late consolation try. The event, part of a doubleheader, also set a new attendance record for a US women's rugby match, reflecting growing interest in the sport ahead of upcoming World Cups on American soil.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin recently surged to a new all-time high of $117,500, a milestone that has rendered approximately 99.85% of all Bitcoin addresses profitable. This indicates one of the most widespread periods of gains in the cryptocurrency's history, largely driven by continued institutional adoption and inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. While this high profitability demonstrates Bitcoin's wealth-generating potential, historical market data suggests such extreme levels can also be cautionary. These moments often serve as inflection points, potentially signaling either a major breakout or a forthcoming period of market consolidation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a powerful new law aimed at stopping individuals who are preparing for mass casualty attacks but are not motivated by a specific ideology. This move comes in the wake of the Southport attack and is designed to close a legal gap, allowing police to intervene and charge suspects for preparatory actions, similar to existing anti-terrorism legislation. Currently, such charges require evidence of an ideological motive. The new offense would apply to a wider range of scenarios, including lone individuals fixated on violence, enabling law enforcement to act before plans can be carried out.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is growing in the UK over whether the traditional six-week school summer holiday should be shortened and redistributed throughout the year. Proponents argue that a shorter break could help prevent learning loss, ease the burden of childcare and food costs for working parents, and potentially lower holiday prices. However, many teachers oppose the idea, valuing the long break for rest and preparation, while some pupils express mixed feelings. Several school districts are already experimenting with a five-week summer and a two-week October half-term, reflecting a potential shift in the academic calendar.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is advocating for a cultural shift to encourage more people, particularly women, to move savings from low-interest cash accounts into stocks and shares investments. The government plans an ad campaign and will have banks send targeted messages to savers, highlighting the potential benefits of investing to boost both individual wealth and the UK economy. While the chancellor has backed away from immediately cutting the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs to force this change, the idea remains under consideration. Experts caution that the push must be handled carefully to avoid putting off new investors, especially in volatile markets.</p>

While still exclusive, their membership criteria focus more on personal accomplishment rather than family pedigree. This trend reflects the significant economic and social shifts occurring in India, creating new enclaves for the nation's nouveau riche.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Clippers are strongly considering signing veteran point guard Chris Paul, according to the team's president of basketball operations. Paul, a former Clippers star who ushered in the "Lob City" era, would provide additional playmaking and veteran leadership to the roster. At 40, Paul played all 82 games for the San Antonio Spurs last season and would likely take on a reserve role behind James Harden and Bradley Beal. The potential signing aligns with the Clippers' stated goal of adding more ball-handling and playmaking depth as they build their roster.</p>
