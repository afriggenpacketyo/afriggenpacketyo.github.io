          <p>After a decade of negotiations, South America's Mercosur trade bloc and the four-nation European Free Trade Association (EFTA) have signed a significant free trade agreement. The deal creates a free trade area for nearly 300 million people, covering goods, services, investment, and intellectual property rights. It aims to boost bilateral trade by eliminating customs duties on over 97% of exports. The agreement, announced at a Mercosur summit in Buenos Aires, still requires ratification by the parliaments of all member countries, which include nations like Brazil, Argentina, Switzerland, and Norway.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new trade agreement with Vietnam, which will set tariffs on Vietnamese imports to the U.S. at 20%. This new rate is lower than the 46% levy that was scheduled to take effect, but it replaces a period of lower tariffs. As part of the deal, Vietnam will reportedly eliminate tariffs on U.S. products, granting American goods full market access. The agreement also includes a steeper 40% tariff on goods that are trans-shipped through Vietnam from other countries, a measure aimed at preventing Chinese products from circumventing U.S. tariffs.

He pointed to the new U.S. trade deal with Vietnam, which has positively impacted stocks of companies with manufacturing in the country, such as Nike and Williams-Sonoma. Simultaneously, Cramer noted that the U.S. dollar has reached a four-year low, a trend he views as beneficial for American consumer packaged goods companies like Procter & Gamble, as it makes their exports more competitive on the global stage.

          <p>An essay adapted from a new book reflects on the short but powerful legacy of Ritchie Valens, a founding father of rock 'n' roll and a Chicano icon. The piece explores how Valens, in his brief career, transformed traditional sounds into something new, from his electrifying version of "Malague√±a" to the heartfelt ballad "Donna." Most notably, his re-imagining of the Mexican folk song "La Bamba" created a timeless classic that bridged cultures. The essay also discusses the making of the 1987 biopic "La Bamba" and how the band Los Lobos was instrumental in re-recording his music for a new generation.</p>
