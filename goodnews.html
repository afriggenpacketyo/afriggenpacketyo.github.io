          <h2>China Unveils 'Meteor-1,' a Parallel Optical Computing Chip Amid US Sanctions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-24 00:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have developed 'Meteor-1,' the first highly parallel optical computing integrated chip, potentially offering hardware acceleration for AI and data centers. The chip achieves a theoretical peak computing power of 2,560 TOPS at 50GHz optical frequency, comparable to advanced Nvidia GPUs. This development comes as traditional electronic chips face physical limitations, and US export controls restrict the sale of advanced semiconductors and AI chips to China. Optical computing's advantages, including ultra-high speed, broad bandwidth, and low power consumption, make it a critical future direction, especially as expanding computational parallelism becomes necessary.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oil prices fell nearly 3% following Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar, as there were no reported casualties, raising hopes for de-escalation in the Middle East. U.S. crude oil prices decreased by 2.85% to $66.57 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent fell 2.77% to $69.50, returning to levels before Israel's attack on Iran. The market sell-off indicates investor confidence that the conflict will de-escalate after President Donald Trump's actions against Iran. Some analysts suggest Trump has successfully escalated to de-escalate, potentially leading to a win if Iran takes no further action. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's decision to involve the U.S. in the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran may have yielded a positive outcome, with the announcement of a ceasefire agreement. If the ceasefire holds, it would represent a significant step back from a conflict that threatened to engulf the region and further involve the U.S. The agreement follows a day of heightened tensions, including Iranian missile strikes on a U.S. base in Qatar, and Trump's warning of an overwhelming response to any attacks on U.S. interests.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing its plan to bar foreign nationals from entering the United States to study at Harvard University, citing concerns about free speech rights. The judge issued an injunction preventing the administration from enforcing a proclamation that cited national security concerns, and the university alleges that Trump is retaliating against it for refusing to accede to demands to control its governance, curriculum, and ideology. The decision comes amid ongoing tensions between the administration and Harvard, including frozen funding, threats to its tax-exempt status, and accusations of fostering violence and antisemitism.</p>
