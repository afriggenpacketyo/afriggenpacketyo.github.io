        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have developed "Meteor-1", the first highly parallel optical computing integrated chip, which could be a milestone for using light to perform simultaneous operations. The chip achieves a theoretical peak computing power of 2,560 TOPS at 50GHz optical frequency, comparable to Nvidia's advanced GPUs. The development comes as traditional electronic chips face physical limitations, and US export controls restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors. Expanding computational parallelism is seen as a necessary path forward for optical computing, as it allows chips to multitask more effectively.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell nearly 3% after Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties, easing fears of escalating conflict in the Middle East. Prices had initially jumped following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites but retreated as investors anticipated de-escalation. President Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice of the strike, enabling preventative measures. Analysts suggest the market believes the conflict will de-escalate following the initial U.S. response. Trump called on the Islamic Republic to move toward peace and said he would encourage Israel to do the same.</p>
