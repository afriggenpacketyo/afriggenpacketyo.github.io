          <h2>German Local Elections Seen as Litmus Test for Federal Government</h2>

          <p>Local elections in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Germany, are being viewed as a significant test for Chancellor Merz's federal government, the first since it took office. Political scientist Oliver Lembcke notes the elections serve as a litmus test, especially for the Social Democrats (SPD) in their former stronghold, the Ruhr Valley. Dissatisfaction with local infrastructure and federal issues like immigration are key concerns for voters. The far-right AfD is gaining ground, connecting issues like housing shortages with immigration, potentially impacting the SPD. Despite this, the CDU is predicted to remain the strongest local party, and other parties are expected to unite to prevent the AfD from gaining mayoral positions. Optimism is needed in local election campaigns to highlight federal investments that should improve local communities. </p>

          <p>Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe discussed the changed dynamic with Alexander Isak after the striker's move to Liverpool, revealing that Isak went on "strike" to force the transfer. Howe acknowledged that communication became difficult after that point, though he initially enjoyed a good relationship with Isak. Newcastle accepted an improved offer from Liverpool after securing replacements, including Nick Woltemade. Howe emphasized the importance of recruiting players who are eager to join the club, referencing successful signings like Bruno Guimaraes. He also noted the challenges of navigating the season with limited striker options due to injuries and suspensions, but is looking forward to Woltemade's debut. </p>

          <p>Following a Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace, German politicians are advocating for stronger air defenses and increased drone production for the Bundeswehr. Siemtje Möller of the SPD emphasized the urgent need to expand air defense capabilities, particularly with short-range Skyranger systems. Boris Rhein, the CDU state premier for Hesse, called for a German defense guarantee, including investment in combat drones and infrastructure protection. In other news, a 12-year-old boy died after being hit by a car following an argument in Baden-Württemberg, and Bayer Leverkusen is looking to restart their season under new coach Kasper Hjulmand after a rocky start. </p>

          <p>Professional athletes are exploring ibogaine, a psychedelic substance derived from the iboga plant, as a potential treatment for traumatic brain injury (TBI) and related conditions. Despite its Schedule 1 status in the U.S., some athletes report significant benefits, including reduced anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation. A Stanford University study on special forces veterans showed dramatic reductions in PTSD, depression, and anxiety symptoms after ibogaine treatment. While researchers emphasize the need for further clinical trials and strict medical supervision due to potential heart problems, there is growing political and scientific momentum for ibogaine research, with Texas and Arizona investing in clinical studies. Some athletes have co-founded organizations to advocate for research into psychedelic-assisted therapies for TBI. </p>

          <p>Despite nationwide declines, monarch butterflies are thriving in New York City due to pockets of habitat created with native plants. Cities like New York are not typically known for their wildlife, but these urban ecosystems provide essential resources like milkweed for caterpillars and pesticide-free wildflowers for adults. The article highlights how even small spaces, such as community gardens and parks, can support monarch populations. The shift towards native plants in city spaces, combined with efforts from organizations and individuals, is contributing to the conservation of monarchs and other native insects. These green spaces also offer benefits to humans, such as stress reduction and mental health improvements. </p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the U.S. will share profits equally with Japan from projects funded by Japan's $550 billion investment until the initial amount is recouped. After Japan earns back its investment, the profit breakdown will shift to 90/10 in favor of the U.S. An investment committee will propose projects for funding, requiring President Trump's approval. Lutnick said the deal benefits both countries, providing the U.S. with funds for domestic manufacturing and Japan with lower tariff rates. The Supreme Court is set to hear an appeal regarding the legality of some of Trump's tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
