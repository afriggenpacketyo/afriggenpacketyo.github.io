          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the United States and China have made 'substantial progress' in trade talks held in Geneva, with further details expected to be released on Monday. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer indicated that a 'deal' addressing national security concerns regarding China's trade practices had been reached, though it remains unclear whether tariffs would be reduced. The talks, aimed at easing tensions from the ongoing trade war, have significant implications for the global economy, which has been disrupted by tariffs imposed by both countries. Economists have warned that the trade dispute could slow global growth and fuel inflation, potentially leading to a recession.</p>
