          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 05:48:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom has initiated a new sanctions regime targeting people-smugglers, freezing the UK assets of 25 individuals and one company and banning them from traveling to the country. The targets include suspected gang leaders and suppliers of small boats used for crossing the English Channel, such as a Chinese manufacturer of inflatable boats. Foreign Secretary David Lammy called the move a 'landmark moment' in the fight against irregular migration. However, some experts, like those at Oxford University's Migration Observatory, believe the impact may be limited due to the vast scale of smuggling networks.</p>

          <p>Two former traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for rigging Libor interest rates quashed by the Supreme Court after a decade-long legal fight. They were among 19 traders jailed in the UK and US for manipulating the key inter-bank lending rate, but have always maintained they were wrongly prosecuted for what was then normal commercial practice. The ruling represents a significant vindication for the traders and a setback for the Serious Fraud Office, which will not seek a retrial. This decision follows US courts overturning all American convictions in 2022 for the same scandal.</p>

          <p>In a significant diplomatic development, India has announced it will resume issuing tourist visas to Chinese citizens for the first time in five years. The Indian embassy in Beijing stated that applications would reopen, requiring an online form and an in-person appointment at visa centers in major Chinese cities. China's foreign ministry welcomed the decision, describing it as a 'positive move' that serves the common interests of both nations. This step signals a potential thaw in relations and a move towards facilitating greater people-to-people exchanges between the two neighboring countries after a long pause.</p>

          <p>As heat waves intensify, the strategy of 'precooling' a home by significantly lowering the thermostat during off-peak hours is gaining attention, but its effectiveness is debated. Some experts and utility companies endorse the idea, suggesting it can save money if the home is well-insulated. However, others, like power company Exelon, warn it could lead to excessive energy use and higher costs. A professor of architecture notes that while it can work with caveats, a more reliable method is to maintain a consistent temperature, as air conditioners use significant energy to cool a room that is already hot.</p>

          <h2>German Automakers' Stocks Rise on Hopes for EU Tariff Relief After US-Japan Deal</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European automotive stocks, particularly those of German giants like Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz, surged following the announcement of a U.S.-Japan trade deal. The agreement, which lowers U.S. tariffs on Japanese auto imports to 15%, has sparked investor optimism that a similar breakthrough could be reached for the European Union. The EU has long sought to negotiate lower auto tariffs with the U.S. but faces a looming deadline. Analysts note that while a deal is not guaranteed, the terms agreed upon with Japan suggest that a U.S. tariff rate below 20% for the EU is now a viable possibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has announced that its southern island province of Hainan will operate under an independent customs regime by the end of the year, transforming it into a major free-trade port. This move will allow thousands of types of goods to enter the island with zero tariffs, a key component of Beijing's 'dual circulation' strategy to boost domestic consumption. The new regulations are more relaxed than on the mainland, and goods processed on the island with over 30% added value can be sold to the rest of China tariff-free. This policy aims to attract tourists and businesses to a new hub for offshore finance and duty-free shopping.</p>

          <p>German software company SAP, Europe's most valuable firm, reported that ongoing U.S. tariff tensions are causing its customers to delay large transactions and purchasing decisions. The company's CFO noted that uncertainty in global supply chains has led to a slowdown, particularly in the U.S. public sector and large-scale manufacturing. Despite missing revenue forecasts and noting a challenging environment, SAP expressed cautious optimism following the new U.S.-Japan trade agreement. The company hopes this development might signal an easing of global trade uncertainties, which could help business momentum recover in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

He dismisses criticism about his age and lack of experience as 'ageist,' arguing that his appointment shows anyone can succeed in his party based on merit.

          <p>A new genetic study of 9,000-year-old skeletons from the Neolithic settlement of Catalhoyuk in Turkey has provided strong evidence of a society centered around women. Researchers analyzing DNA from remains buried under the same houses found that individuals were often related through their mother's side. This suggests a matrilocal system, where men moved in with their female partner's family, a contrast to the more common patrilocal systems of later history. The findings confirm long-held archaeological suspicions based on female figurines found at the site and offer a rare glimpse into the social structures of one of the world's oldest settlements.</p>

The program questions whether movements like the Women's March and the 2020 racial uprisings have translated into lasting social and political change. Featuring Gloria J. Browne-Marshall, author of 'A Protest History of the United States,' the discussion examines historical precedents to understand what forms of resistance have succeeded in the past.

          <p>Singapore's headline inflation rate remained steady at a four-year low of 0.8% in June, with core inflation also unchanged at 0.6%. These soft figures came in below economists' expectations and provide the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) with room to potentially ease its monetary policy. The central bank has noted that inflation has eased significantly this year and expects domestic growth to be 'subdued' due to a softening global economic outlook. An easing of policy could help support the country's export-dependent economy in the face of growing global trade uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>
