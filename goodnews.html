          <h2>Iron Dome's Success Sparks Interest in US Missile Defense System</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 01:10:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent exchanges between Israel and Iran have highlighted the effectiveness of Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system, prompting renewed interest in the United States' proposed Golden Dome project. The Golden Dome, a multi-layered missile defense system, aims to protect the U.S. from ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles through a network of satellites and interceptors. Despite concerns about its cost and potential to escalate arms races, defense and space companies are vying for a role in the project, especially after budget cuts at NASA. The House Appropriations Committee has proposed allocating billions for missile defense and space programs in support of the Golden Dome effort, while Canada has been offered a deal to skip fees by joining the U.S. This situation has led to increased interest in integrated missile defense systems in Europe as well. The overall stability of the situation earns a reasonable score.</p>

          <h2>Experts Advocate for School Screenings to Detect Lazy Eyes Early</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 01:02:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are raising concerns that children with lazy eyes are being missed for treatment due to the lack of early screenings in schools, with some councils facing capacity and budget constraints. The British and Irish Orthoptic Society (BIOS) advocates for universal screening for amblyopia in schools across England, similar to practices in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Early detection and treatment, ideally before the age of seven, are crucial for effective correction using patching. A BIOS survey indicates that approximately 75,000 children reside in areas without school screening, leading to delayed diagnoses and diminished treatment outcomes. Early detection in schools helps children get the help they need, leading to a high score.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have engineered a low-cost, edible, and washable protein-based coating capable of extending the shelf life of fruits by 2.5 times. Tested on 17 different fruits, including strawberries, tomatoes, kiwis, and mangoes, the coating reduces moisture loss and microbial growth, effectively delaying spoilage by a week or more. The coating costs approximately 9 US cents per kilogram of fruit and is as effective as existing preservation methods while reducing carbon dioxide emissions and toxicity. The research team, from Shaanxi Normal University, developed the coating using computer-aided molecular simulation, marking a promising solution to global food waste. The scientific advance earns a high score.</p>

          <p>Rice prices in Japan have more than doubled in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, following similar spikes in April and March. This surge has prompted the government to release emergency stockpiles in an attempt to moderate prices. Concurrently, Japan's core inflation rate has climbed to 3.7% in May, the highest since January 2023, surpassing economists' expectations. According to JP Morgan Asset Management, rice accounts for approximately 50% of Japan's core inflation, emphasizing the significant impact of food prices on the country's economic trends. The situation earns a score that reflects the government's response.</p>

          <p>As the 50th anniversary of "Jaws" is marked, recent shark attacks are grabbing headlines, though experts say this doesn't indicate an increase in sharks in the oceans. The rise in sightings is attributed to more people in the water, better technology, and shifting ocean conditions. Activist Julie Andersen of Shark Angels emphasizes that shark populations are rebounding in some areas due to protection efforts, signaling healthier oceans. Shark Angels promotes education to dispel myths about sharks and offers tips for safely encountering them in the water, while endurance athlete Lewis Pugh is swimming around Martha‚Äôs Vineyard to raise awareness for shark conservation.

          <p>China maintained its benchmark lending rates unchanged following monetary easing measures last month, as a trade deal with the U.S. eases some growth concerns. The People's Bank of China held the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%, aligning with Reuters poll estimates. Trade war fears have receded after U.S. and Chinese trade representatives agreed to honor the consensus reached in Geneva in May, allowing for rare earth and tech trade and suspending tariffs. Analysts suggest that with reduced foreign exchange pressure, the PBOC has greater latitude for future policy maneuvering, but may increase policy support in the second half of the year. This situation earns a score that reflects the overall stability.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump Administration cannot withhold billions of dollars in transportation grant funding from Democrat-led states refusing to cooperate with immigration enforcement. Judge John McConnell granted a preliminary injunction, stating that "large-scale irreparable harm would occur without the preliminary injunction." The ruling comes ahead of a grant application deadline for states, with the Department of Transportation imposing conditions requiring adherence to an Immigration Enforcement Condition upon submission. The judge agreed with the states' argument that the conditions lacked a plausible connection to the purposes of the transportation funding. The legal win earns a relatively high score.</p>
