          <p>OnlyFans, the subscription-based content platform, reported a robust financial year in 2024, with revenues reaching $1.4 billion, a 9% increase, and pre-tax profits rising to $683.6 million. The platform's owner, Ukrainian-American entrepreneur Leonid Radvinsky, received a substantial $701 million in dividends, adding to over $1 billion he has accumulated from the business. This financial success comes as the company, known for its adult content, is reportedly preparing for a potential sale that could value it at $8 billion. The growth is attributed to a significant increase in both creator and fan accounts, highlighting the platform's expanding user base and profitability.</p>

The region's movements reflect global economic uncertainty and the significant influence of U.S. monetary policy decisions on international markets.

          <p>US President Donald Trump has significantly lowered the tariffs threatened on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors from the European Union, capping them at 15% instead of the previously indicated 250% and 100% respectively. This reduction is part of a broader US-EU trade agreement, though the 15% tariff on European car exports remains conditional on the EU reducing its own industrial duties to zero. The deal, which offers predictability for businesses, has been welcomed by countries like Ireland, a major pharmaceutical exporter. Despite progress, some sectors like wine and spirits remain subject to tariffs, indicating ongoing negotiation challenges in the complex trade relationship.</p>

          <h2>India's Supreme Court Modifies Stray Dog Order, Halting Removals but Banning Public Feeding</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 02:51:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's Supreme Court has revised its earlier directive on stray dogs in New Delhi, now ordering their capture for sterilization and immunization before release, unless they exhibit rabies or aggressive behavior. While halting mass removals, the court has prohibited public feeding of strays, mandating designated feeding zones and threatening legal action against violators. This decision follows a previous order for dog removal due to a surge in bite incidents, which sparked widespread protests from animal rights activists. The court aims to frame a nationwide policy, acknowledging the "extremely grim" daily dog bite statistics while seeking a more humane approach.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate in July cooled to 3.1%, down from 3.3% in June, marking its lowest since March, yet still higher than economists' 3% forecast. This moderation is partly due to easing rice inflation, which had previously surged past 100% but now stands at 90.7%. Despite the slight decline, the 3.1% headline inflation remains above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for the 40th consecutive month, prompting some analysts to suggest the BOJ is "behind the curve" in raising interest rates. The central bank recently upgraded its inflation forecasts for the 2025 fiscal year. (not investment advice)</p>
