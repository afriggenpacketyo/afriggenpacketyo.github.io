          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority by imposing reciprocal tariffs, a setback for his economic agenda. The court determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to unilaterally implement sweeping duties. The ruling applies to trafficking tariffs and reciprocal tariffs imposed to correct trade imbalances, but it does not affect existing tariffs on specific products like aluminum and steel. The Trump administration has appealed the ruling, while plaintiffs have celebrated it as a victory for American families and businesses.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced his departure from the Trump administration after leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

While in office, DOGE oversaw significant job cuts within the federal civilian workforce, though some terminations were blocked by federal judges.</p>

          <p>The government is fast-tracking two new reservoir projects to shore up England's water supplies, declaring them "nationally significant." These projects aim to increase resilience to future droughts amid rising temperatures and population growth. The reservoirs are slated for completion in 2036 and 2040, but experts warn that household consumption of water may need to fall to secure supplies. Some also argue for managing water usage and retrofitting older homes to cut waste, instead of relying solely on reservoirs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court has ruled President Trump's sweeping tariffs illegal, citing limits on Congress's power to empower the president to impose tariffs. The decision argues that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) does not grant unlimited tariff authority. The court concludes that Trump may only rely on his authority under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 if he wants to impose tariffs to respond to trade deficits. This statute only permits the president to impose tariff rates of 15 percent or lower, and those tariffs may only remain in effect for 150 days.</p>
