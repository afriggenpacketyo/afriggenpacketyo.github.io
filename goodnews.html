          <h2>Japanese Gen Z Prioritizes Work-Life Balance, Embracing 'Quiet Quitting'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 08:12:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young Japanese workers are adopting the concept of "quiet quitting," prioritizing personal time and interests over career advancement and higher pay. Unlike previous generations who dedicated their lives to their employers, these individuals clock in and out on time, showing indifference to promotions or performance-related bonuses. This shift is motivated by a desire for better work-life balance and a rejection of the sacrifices made by their parents' generation. The coronavirus pandemic has further solidified this attitude, with young adults finding it difficult to accept lifetime commitments to one company. The article suggests this change could lead to a healthier and more balanced society, reducing the risk of 'karoshi,' or death by overwork. </p>

          <p>Actor Jussie Smollett has agreed to pay $50,000 to a Chicago charity to settle a lawsuit filed by the city over accusations of lying about a hate crime.

Smollett had claimed to be the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in 2019, but was later charged with lying to police, though the charges were dropped. </p>

          <p>A protracted slump in crude prices has increased the pressure on Big Oil companies to allocate cash to shareholders. Western energy supermajors have sought to return cash to investors through buyback programs and dividends to keep their shareholders happy. Some analysts, however, are less convinced about Big Oil's pledge to return ever-higher shareholder returns, citing already stretched balance sheets and a sharp drop in crude prices. The article suggests that weaker crude prices mean energy majors will have less cash to return to shareholders.</p>
