        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has unequivocally debunked widespread rumors circulating on social media and certain websites regarding the distribution of new $1,390 or $1,400 stimulus checks in August 2025. Officials have confirmed that there is no official backing from Congress or the IRS for these claims, advising the public to exercise extreme caution against potential misinformation and fraud. Although a legislative effort, the American Worker Rebate Act of 2025, proposes sending checks ranging from $600 to $2,400 to American taxpayer families, it has not yet advanced through Congress. The article reiterates that the deadlines for claiming the three previous COVID-era stimulus payments have already passed, with the final opportunity for the third stimulus check expiring on April 15, 2025.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new NATO report reveals that all member states are anticipated to achieve the alliance's long-standing defense spending target of 2% of GDP this year, a significant increase driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and demands from former US President Donald Trump. Previously lagging nations like Spain, Italy, and Belgium have now reached this threshold. However, only three members—Poland (4.48%), Lithuania (4%), and Latvia (3.73%)—is currently meeting the new, higher goal of 3.5% of GDP agreed upon in The Hague. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte welcomed the increased spending but stressed the need to convert this investment into tangible military capabilities for effective deterrence, highlighting that cash alone does not provide security.

          <h2>Nvidia Reports Strong Earnings and Revenue, Yet Stock Dips Amid Data Center Miss</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 20:27:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia reported robust financial results, exceeding expectations for both earnings and revenue, and projected continued sales growth above 50% for the current quarter, indicating sustained strong demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. However, the company's stock experienced a slight dip in extended trading, primarily due to data center revenue falling short of analyst estimates for the second consecutive period. Nvidia's finance chief anticipates a massive $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade, underscoring the long-term market potential. The company's impressive overall growth, with revenue up 56% year-over-year, remains heavily concentrated in its data center division, despite a slight decline in compute sales attributed to restricted H20 chip shipments to China. Additionally, Nvidia's board approved an extra $60 billion in share repurchases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has finally appointed Steve Kang, the current president of the Board of Public Works, as the city's new film liaison, fulfilling a key campaign promise after an extended delay of over two and a half years. Kang will be assisted by Dan Halden and producer Amy Goldberg in this crucial role. The appointment aims to improve the interface between the city's bureaucracy and the film industry, a vital component of Los Angeles's economy that has been struggling with production job losses to regions offering more attractive tax incentives. Industry advocates had voiced considerable frustration over the prolonged vacancy, hoping the new leadership will effectively work to retain and expand local film and television production within the city.</p>

          <p>The UK government is expanding its funded childcare program, offering working parents of children aged nine months to three years old 30 hours a week of free childcare during term time starting September. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged eligible parents to apply, emphasizing the imminent availability of the offer. To qualify, most parents must earn between £9,518 and £100,000 annually. Despite the expansion, concerns persist regarding the number of available staff and places, and some providers charge "top-up fees" for extras like meals, which a charity found nearly a quarter of parents couldn't afford. The number of funded places has risen, but uneven distribution creates "childcare deserts."</p>

          <h2>Value of Small Chinese Parcels to UK Soars, Prompting Review of Import Tax Exemption</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 19:18:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The value of small parcels sent from China to the UK, benefiting from an import tax exemption, has more than doubled last year, reaching £3 billion, as revealed by exclusive HM Revenue & Customs data. This significant increase is largely driven by the rising popularity of Chinese e-commerce platforms such as Shein and Temu among UK consumers. The UK government is currently reviewing the existing rules that allow imports of small packages valued at £135 or less to bypass customs duties, facing considerable pressure from domestic business owners and industry groups. These groups argue that the exemption creates unfair competition for High Street retailers and potentially exposes consumers to unregulated products, urging swifter action to align with changes seen in the US and EU.

          <p>The charity Greater Change is demonstrating a promising approach to combating homelessness by providing direct cash payments to individuals at risk of losing their homes, claiming significant success. Laura Burns, a mother-of-one, exemplifies this, having received £600 almost instantly to cover energy debts and removal costs, enabling her to secure a new flat and avoid eviction. The charity, which has distributed £699,000 to 403 people this year, advocates that this method offers "dignity of choice" and can save substantial taxpayer money by preventing individuals from becoming chronically homeless. Both international and smaller UK studies support the effectiveness of direct cash aid, indicating that recipients generally make sound choices and do not increase spending on addictions, with 86% of those supported transitioning into stable housing.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed author Jacqueline Wilson characterizes her new adult novel, 'Picture Imperfect'—a sequel to her beloved 'The Illustrated Mum'—as simultaneously "the easiest and the hardest thing" she has ever written. The book revisits the character of Dolphin, now 33, as she continues to care for her unstable, bipolar mother, Marigold, a narrative choice Wilson made to depict the complexities of real life rather than idealized happy endings. Wilson, renowned for tackling challenging themes like mental illness and poverty in her children's literature, staunchly defends her commitment to honesty while clearly defining boundaries for younger readers. She shares personal reflections on love and life's imperfections, expressing her enjoyment of the creative freedom offered by adult fiction and hinting at another sequel already in progress.</p>

          <p>China's electric vehicle (EV) industry is rapidly and profoundly reshaping the global car market, with domestic giants like BYD notably surpassing Tesla to become the world's largest EV manufacturer by revenue in 2024. Analysts highlight that China's remarkable ascent, significantly bolstered by government subsidies, tax incentives, and an estimated $230 billion in EV development costs, has not only transformed its internal market but is now driving massive exports. In 2023, China emerged as the world's largest vehicle exporter, with EVs constituting roughly 41% of its total domestic vehicle production. This burgeoning dominance has triggered regulatory scrutiny and the imposition of duties from Western markets, yet experts forecast China will continue to solidify its leadership in auto manufacturing, potentially producing four out of every ten global cars by 2030.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following Nvidia's better-than-expected earnings report, CNBC's Jim Cramer dismissed fears of an artificial intelligence (AI) bubble, asserting that the substantial AI investments by major tech companies are justified. He emphasized that he no longer questions the spending decisions of industry giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, recognizing their deep understanding of the AI landscape. While Nvidia's stock dipped slightly due to data center revenue falling short of high expectations, Cramer attributed this to the stock's pre-earnings run-up rather than fundamental weakness. He drew parallels to the dot-com bubble, noting that despite widespread failures, a few key players like Amazon emerged stronger, suggesting current hyperscalers are similarly well-positioned.
