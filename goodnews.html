          <p>The People's Bank of China has kept its key lending rates unchanged for the fourth consecutive month, despite a recent interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The one-year loan prime rate (LPR) remains at 3.0%, and the five-year LPR, which influences mortgage pricing, stays at 3.5%. This decision was widely expected by economists, who believe Chinese authorities are holding off on major stimulus measures for now, even as economic data indicates signs of slowing. Policymakers are still anticipated to introduce some marginal monetary easing later this year to help meet the government's annual growth target.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people with terminal illnesses are creating personal music playlists to provide comfort and connection during their final days. This practice leverages the therapeutic benefits of music, which neurologically and emotionally can reduce anxiety and evoke powerful memories for both the patient and their loved ones. Palliative care experts note that hearing is often the last sense to go, allowing music to reach even unconscious individuals and provide a sense of peace. For grieving families, these curated playlists can also serve as an enduring source of comfort and a way to stay connected to the person who has passed away.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 19:16:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that children with exceptional social skills are often raised by parents who model specific behaviors from an early age. These practices include talking openly about emotions, demonstrating empathy in daily life, and allowing children to attempt tasks and even fail, which builds authentic confidence. Instead of rushing to solve every conflict, these parents provide a safe environment for children to practice problem-solving and learn how to repair relationships after disagreements. By validating feelings and listening more than lecturing, parents teach crucial lessons in emotional intelligence and respectful communication.</p>

          <p>Pat McFadden, the UK's Work and Pensions Secretary, has affirmed the government's commitment to reforming the welfare system to address rising costs and provide better support for recipients. The plan aims to offer skills and employment assistance to tens of thousands of people currently on sickness benefits who have no requirement to seek work. This commitment follows the government's recent U-turn on a flagship policy to cut disability benefits, which has increased pressure on the chancellor's budget. McFadden stated that the current system is "unhealthy" and creates a "binary divide" between those deemed fit for work and those who are not.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On the island of Nantucket, a team of scientists is developing a novel approach to reduce the transmission of Lyme disease by genetically engineering the local white-footed mouse population. Led by MIT's Kevin Esvelt, the "Mice Against Ticks" project aims to introduce a gene that would make the mice, the primary carriers of the Lyme bacteria, immune to the disease. This heritable immunity would be passed down through generations, breaking the cycle of infection where ticks feed on infected mice and then transmit the illness to humans. The project is being developed in close consultation with the local community to address ecological and ethical concerns before any potential release.</p>

          <p>The University of Austin (UATX) has opened its doors, positioning itself as an alternative to mainstream higher education by championing the "fearless pursuit of truth" and ideological diversity. Founded by figures like historian Niall Ferguson and journalist Bari Weiss, the university aims to combat the self-censorship and lack of viewpoint diversity they see on other campuses. With an inaugural class of 92 students, UATX offers a curriculum based in Western civilization, small seminar-style classes, and for now, free tuition funded by private donors. The institution is a direct response to what its founders call a crisis in academia, where free expression has been stifled.</p>

          <p>The monarch butterfly population that migrates from the U.S. and Canada to a specific forest in Mexico represents a unique "super generation." These butterflies live up to nine times longer than typical monarchs, suppressing their reproductive hormones to conserve energy for the 3,000-mile journey. Scientists are still studying the mysteries of their navigation and why they return to the same remote mountains each year. However, the monarch population has declined by 70% in the last 30 years due to habitat loss, particularly the eradication of milkweed plants in the U.S. Conservation efforts are underway to support this remarkable natural phenomenon.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost their final regular-season home game 3-1 to the San Francisco Giants, following a late-inning bullpen collapse. Despite a strong performance from pitcher Emmet Sheehan, who threw seven innings of one-hit baseball, the Dodgers' bullpen gave up three runs in the eighth inning. The loss slightly delays their clinching of the NL West division title, with their magic number now at three. The game also marked a franchise attendance record, with the team drawing over four million fans for the first time, reflecting high expectations as they head into their final road trip before the postseason begins.</p>

According to Dong, who is now with Tsinghua University, every chapter of the five-year plans ultimately boils down to improving income and ensuring sustainable progress for the population. As China prepares its 15th five-year plan, this focus on economic well-being and strategic project development remains the central pillar of its long-term strategy.</p>

          <p>An analysis highlights three growth stocks—Palantir Technologies, AppLovin, and Carvana—that have delivered extraordinary returns since the beginning of 2023. These companies transitioned from unprofitability to significant financial success, driven by factors like the AI boom, effective restructuring, and improved economic conditions. For instance, an initial investment of $7,000 in each of the three companies would have grown to a combined total of over $1.1 million. The article notes that while their turnarounds have been remarkable, their current valuations are high, reflecting both their recent success and inherent risks. (not investment advice)</p>

In a Fox News interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as likely participants in the deal, describing them as "American patriots." The sale is mandated by a 2024 law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. arm over national security concerns regarding user data. The White House has signaled that a deal is imminent, which would place control of the popular social media app in the hands of prominent U.S. investors.</p>

This marks a pragmatic shift in policy, acknowledging that complete denuclearization is not currently achievable.

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a £2.2 billion, privately-financed plan to bring London Gatwick Airport's northern runway into regular use, effectively creating a second runway. The project is intended to boost economic growth, increase the airport's flight capacity from 280,000 to nearly 389,000 per year, and raise passenger numbers to 80 million annually. The approval comes after the airport agreed to stricter noise controls and traffic mitigation measures to address concerns from planning inspectors. However, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental groups worried about the impact of increased air traffic and climate emissions.</p>
