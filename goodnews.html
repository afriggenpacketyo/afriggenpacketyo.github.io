          <p>The article examines IonQ and IBM as notable stocks in the emerging quantum computing sector. IonQ is highlighted for its unique trapped-ion technology, which achieves low error rates and has secured contracts with the U.S. military. In contrast, IBM is presented as a long-standing pioneer with significant financial backing and an ambitious roadmap, including a planned $30 billion investment in the technology. The article suggests that while the quantum computing market is still speculative, these two companies represent different but compelling approaches for investors interested in the field.

          <h2>A Poem by Jodie Hollander Titled 'Your Horses'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 12:00:00 EDT</div>

          <p>This article presents a poem by Jodie Hollander titled "Your Horses," written in tribute to the style of poet Ted Hughes. The poem evokes a powerful image of ten silent, statue-like horses on the moors in the early morning light, described as "megaliths with draped manes." The narrator reflects on whether the subject of the poem, presumably Hughes, ever found such a peaceful place again amidst the fame and scandals of life in London. The piece concludes with the haunting question of whether the subject is still searching the barren moors for that sense of tranquility.</p>

          <h2>Coldplay's Chris Martin Issues Jumbotron Warning After Viral Incident</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 11:57:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a concert in Wisconsin, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin humorously warned the audience to prepare themselves before the band's "Jumbotron Song," where cameras feature crowd members on large screens. This warning follows a recent viral incident where a man and woman, later identified as tech CEO Andy Byron and his chief people officer, were shown cuddling and quickly separated in embarrassment. The public exposure led to an internal investigation at their company, Astronomer, and resulted in Byron's resignation. Martin's lighthearted comment appears to be a direct acknowledgment of the fallout from the previous show's unexpected moment.</p>

          <p>Belgian champion Tim Wellens achieved his first career stage victory in the Tour de France, winning stage 15 with a solo breakaway. The UAE Team Emirates-XRG rider attacked on the final climb of the hilly route to Carcassonne and finished one minute and 28 seconds ahead of the nearest chaser. Wellens, who typically serves as a support rider for race leader Tadej Pogacar, was given the freedom to pursue a personal win on the transitional stage. Pogacar retained his overall lead in the general classification, crossing the finish line in the main peloton several minutes later.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Pledges to Halve Sewage Discharges by 2030</h2>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary, Steve Reed, has committed to a new target of halving the number of sewage discharges from water companies by 2030. This pledge comes amid public outrage over the state of the nation's waterways and follows new data showing serious pollution incidents rose by 60% in 2024 to a record high. Reed acknowledged that the water sector is "broken" and stated that the industry's regulator, Ofwat, is "clearly failing." While ruling out nationalization, he emphasized that regulation must change and that he expects to be held accountable for delivering improvements by the next election.</p>

          <p>Anna Rutherford, a 43-year-old lawyer from Scotland, dominated the inaugural 100-mile Rat Race ultra-marathon, finishing more than two hours ahead of the closest male competitor. She completed the course from Bamburgh Castle to Edinburgh Castle in 17 hours and 23 minutes, running the final 50 miles of the race entirely on her own. Rutherford, a mother-of-three, told reporters she sang Dolly Parton songs to keep her spirits up and even briefly stopped to check on a man she saw lying on a golf course. Her performance was so dominant that she was already home before the rest of the field finished.</p>

          <h2>Former Obama Speechwriter Advocates for Finding 'Neutral Ground' in a Divided Nation</h2>

          <p>David Litt, a former speechwriter for President Barack Obama, suggests that in an era of deep political division, finding "neutral ground" is more crucial than searching for elusive "common ground." Drawing from his experience learning to surf with his brother-in-law, who holds vastly different political views, Litt argues for the importance of shared activities that allow people to connect beyond their disagreements. He believes these neutral spaces can foster friendships and lead to more genuine discussions on contentious issues. This approach, he contends, is essential for navigating a world where nearly everything has become politicized.</p>

          <p>An infectious disease physician and researcher has systematically refuted several claims about vaccine safety made by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The article corrects Kennedy's assertions, stating that the childhood vaccine schedule involves around 50 injections, not 92, and that the biological load (antigens) is 95% lower than in 1986. Contrary to Kennedy's claims, numerous routine childhood vaccines were tested against inert placebos, and extensive post-market surveillance systems continuously monitor safety. The author also debunks the claim of widespread financial conflicts of interest among federal vaccine advisors, citing it as a misrepresentation of a government audit.</p>

          <p>Sources suggest that the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea is the most likely venue for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping this year. A meeting could occur either on the sidelines of the summit or during a potential visit by Trump to China beforehand. While Xi is expected to attend, Trump's participation has not been confirmed. This speculation follows recent diplomatic engagements between the two nations, including a meeting between their top diplomats and a phone call where the leaders extended mutual invitations for state visits.</p>

          <p>This article profiles actress and cabaret star Bridget Everett, focusing on her journey from her small-town Kansas roots to starring in the HBO series "Somebody Somewhere." The semi-autobiographical show, set in her hometown of Manhattan, Kansas, explores themes of friendship, grief, and self-discovery. Everett discusses how her famously risqué live performances are a way for her to connect with people and process her own life experiences, including family loss. The show, which recently concluded, was praised for its authentic portrayal of finding hope amid hopelessness and earned both a Peabody Award and an Emmy nomination.</p>

          <p>This excerpt from Olga Khazan's book, "Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change," chronicles her attempt to become more extroverted by enrolling in an improv comedy class. As a self-described introvert with "high loneliness," Khazan forces herself out of her comfort zone to tackle her social anxiety head-on, despite her dislike for improv as an art form. She describes the initial awkwardness of warm-up games like "Zip Zap Zop" and the surreal experience of pretending to juggle invisible objects with strangers. The experience is framed as a form of "rehab for perfectionists," where making mistakes is encouraged.</p>

          <p>The small desert town of Newberry Springs, California, located on the historic Route 66, is hoping for a resurgence as the famous highway approaches its 100th anniversary in 2026. Once a bustling stop, the town declined after being bypassed by Interstate 40 in the 1970s, a fate shared by many communities along the route. Now, local residents and business owners are banding together to prepare for an anticipated influx of tourists, planning new events, tours, and attractions. They aim to capitalize on the centennial celebration to revitalize their community while preserving its unique, "frozen in time" rural character.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that traditional metrics for the U.S. labor market, such as the unemployment rate and jobs reports, are becoming obsolete in the modern economy. The author contends that with the rise of the "over-employed," remote work, side gigs, and the gig economy, simply counting "jobs" is no longer a relevant measure of economic health. Instead, the focus should shift to measuring income from all sources, adjusted for inflation, to get a more accurate picture of Americans' financial well-being. The article calls for a new system that uses real-time data from tax returns and private sources rather than relying on outdated government surveys.</p>
