          <p>Sergei Tikhanovsky, the husband of Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, was unexpectedly released from prison along with 13 other political prisoners after five years of incarceration. Tikhanovsky, an opposition activist himself, has been reunited with his wife in Lithuania, where she lives in exile. His release coincided with a visit to Minsk by US special envoy Keith Kellogg, who met with Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, suggesting a possible diplomatic breakthrough. Tikhanovsky's release is seen as a potential win for Lukashenko, helping him to alleviate international isolation, but hundreds of other political prisoners remain in Belarusian jails.</p>

          <p>UBS maintained a 'Hold' rating on Conagra Brands, Inc., citing growth pressures and a projected decrease in earnings per share by fiscal 2026.

Conagra has streamlined its portfolio by selling Chef Boyardee and Van de Kam‚Äôs brands and recently launched 50 new frozen food items to align with consumer preferences.

His release followed a judge's determination that he was not a flight risk or threat, but the Trump administration has vowed to appeal. Khalil was joined by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who said his release showed the administration was losing its legal battle to deport pro-Palestinian migrants.</p>

          <p>Torsten Sl√∏k, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, suggests a scenario where President Trump‚Äôs tariffs are extended long enough to ease economic uncertainty and provide a significant bump to federal revenue. Sl√∏k speculates that maintaining 30% tariffs on China and 10% tariffs on all other countries for 12 months, while countries lower non-tariff barriers, could be a "victory for the world." This strategy could produce $400 billion in annual revenue for U.S. taxpayers and reduce uncertainty for businesses. (not investment advice)</p>
