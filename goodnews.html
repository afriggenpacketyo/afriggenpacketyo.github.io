        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After 23 years and ¬£2 billion, the A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened, aiming to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce travel times between west Wales and the Midlands. Initially conceived in 1990 and started in 2002, the project faced overspends, delays, and a pandemic. The upgrade involved building almost 70 structures and planting 285,000 trees to mitigate environmental impact. While some residents appreciate the reduced travel times, others criticize the cost and disruptions during construction; the project is funded through a 30-year payment plan. The road's completion predates a Welsh government decision to scrap new major road projects on environmental grounds in 2023, though future schemes may be considered if they align with climate emergency goals.</p>

          <p>Democratic Governors Tim Walz of Minnesota and Wes Moore of Maryland urged their party to adopt a more forceful approach to politics, emphasizing the importance of building coalitions and engaging with diverse constituencies. Speaking at Jim Clyburn's Fish Fry in South Carolina, both governors stressed the need to compete in every district and deliver tangible alternatives to the opposition. While denying any presidential aspirations for 2028, Walz and Moore highlighted the urgency of the 2025 political battles. Moore emphasized the importance of delivering alternatives to Trump's policies, while Walz encouraged Democrats to compete in every district and not wait until the midterms to engage with voters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that the world's population may be hundreds of millions or even billions higher than the UN estimates due to undercounting in rural areas. Researchers at Aalto University discovered that UN estimates undercount the number of people living in rural areas by more than 50% because census data in the global south is often incomplete. This challenges long-standing anxieties about overpopulation, which often reflect power struggles over resources and whose lives matter. While population growth presents challenges, particularly in resource management and consumption, experts suggest that sustainable technologies and responsible consumption can mitigate potential crises.</p>

          <p>Memory cafes are offering people with dementia and their caregivers a supportive environment for socialization and recreation, providing an affordable way to address the growing problem of memory loss. These cafes offer a space for individuals to connect, participate in activities, and find a sense of community, which helps combat social isolation and stress associated with dementia diagnoses. With the number of dementia cases expected to rise significantly in the coming years, memory cafes are poised to play an increasingly important role in long-term care. The inclusion of caregivers distinguishes memory cafes from other programs, providing support for both the patient and their caregiver.</p>

          <p>Defence Secretary John Healey anticipates that the UK will allocate 3% of its GDP to defence by 2034, according to the government's upcoming strategic defence review. This target is a key assumption underlying the review, with some planned measures potentially becoming unaffordable if the spending level is not achieved. The review is expected to highlight new threats, such as drones and artificial intelligence, necessitating the deployment of digital experts alongside troops. The government's budget watchdog estimates that meeting the 3% target would require an additional ¬£17.3 billion in 2029-30, and the review will also allocate over ¬£1.5 billion to improve military housing.</p>
