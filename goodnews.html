          <p>A bronze statue of Melania Trump in Slovenia was sawed off at the ankles and stolen, replacing a wooden statue that was previously erected in 2020 and later destroyed in an arson attack. The statue was a collaboration between an artist from Kentucky and a local craftsman. The Slovenian police are investigating the vandalism and theft. A local worker mentioned the statue was not well-liked, even by the First Lady, suggesting its removal might be acceptable to some.</p>

          <p>New CDC modeling suggests that hundreds of drowning deaths could be prevented each year with better pool fencing and consistent use of life jackets during boating activities. Researchers estimated that 51 deaths could have been prevented by adequate pool fencing and 297 by wearing life jackets during boating accidents in 2022. The study highlights the economic cost of these preventable deaths, estimating it at $4.5 billion annually. The study was one of the last produced by the agency's injury prevention experts before layoffs eliminated the CDC's drowning prevention research teams.</p>

          <p>An Alabama man, Eric Council Jr., was sentenced to 14 months in prison for his role in the January 2024 hack of the Securities and Exchange Commission's X account. The hack resulted in a false tweet claiming the SEC had approved bitcoin exchange-traded funds, briefly spiking the cryptocurrency's price. Council pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft and access device fraud, having executed a SIM swap attack to gain control of the SEC's account. Prosecutors sought a longer sentence, citing a video statement where Council blamed the SEC's cybersecurity practices.</p>

          <p>Crime rates in the United States are showing a decline after a significant increase in 2020. Murder rates are expected to have had the steepest fall in recorded history for 2024, and 2025 is off to a promising start with decreases in murder, violent crime, and property crime. The challenge in reporting on crime involves the lateness of official statistics, but available data indicates positive trends. Some experts believe the pandemic was the primary driver of the 2020 rise, citing unemployment and school closures in low-income areas as key factors.</p>

          <p>The World Bank announced that Saudi Arabia and Qatar have paid off Syria's $15.5 million debt, paving the way for Damascus to take out new loans. The bank halted operations in Syria in 2011 when the civil war broke out, preventing the country from accessing development loans and technical expertise. The World Bank plans to reengage with Syria, focusing initially on access to electricity. Severe electricity shortages continue to plague Syria, with state-supplied electricity amounting to as little as two hours per day.</p>

          <p>The UK's longest direct train service, linking Aberdeen and Penzance, made its final run after operating for over 100 years. The connection, established in 1921, spans 775 miles. Operator CrossCountry cited a ‚Äúmore efficient timetable‚Äù as the reason for ending the service. Passengers on the last train expressed their sadness and excitement about being part of rail history. The removal of this service means the connection between Aberdeen and Plymouth is now the longest direct route, at 695 miles.</p>
