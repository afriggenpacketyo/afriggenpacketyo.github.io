          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish citizen and Tufts University student, was released from federal custody after a federal judge ordered her immediate release, marking the end of a six-week ordeal that sparked outrage over immigration policies. Ozturk, whose student visa was canceled amid the Trump administration's crackdown on higher education, was arrested in March and accused of supporting Hamas due to an opinion piece she co-authored criticizing the university's response to pro-Palestinian demands. Judge William K. Sessions III stated that her detention could chill free speech and that the government lacked sufficient evidence against her. Despite her release, deportation proceedings are expected to continue in immigration court.</p>

          <p>Margot Friedl√§nder, a Holocaust survivor who spent over six decades in exile in New York City, passed away in Berlin at the age of 103. After her husband's death, she returned to Berlin and became a vocal advocate for Holocaust remembrance and tolerance, particularly among young Germans, and even appeared on the cover of German Vogue. Friedl√§nder survived the Holocaust by hiding in Nazi Berlin for 15 months after her mother and brother were arrested, eventually being captured and sent to Theresienstadt, where she met her husband. Her memoir, published in both German and English, details her experiences and emphasizes the importance of sharing her story to promote understanding and prevent future atrocities.</p>

          <p>Nearly 50 years after the strangulation of Jeannette Ralston in San Jose, California, authorities have charged Willie Eugene Sims, 69, with her murder, solving a cold case that had remained dormant for decades. The breakthrough came after the F.B.I. upgraded its fingerprint search algorithm in 2018, allowing investigators to match Sims' thumbprint found on a cigarette carton at the crime scene. Sims, who was a 21-year-old Army private at the time of the murder, had a prior conviction for assault to commit murder and robbery in 1978. The victim's son expressed gratitude for the renewed investigation, calling it a meaningful Mother's Day gift.</p>
