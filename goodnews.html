          <p>Wise, a British money transfer firm, has announced its intention to move its primary listing to the U.S., a move that will deal a blow to the London Stock Exchange. The company's full-year earnings statement revealed plans for a dual listing, with the main hub shifting to the U.S. while maintaining a secondary listing in London. This decision aims to allow Wise's shares to be traded on both a U.S. stock exchange and the LSE, potentially increasing its access to capital and broadening its investor base. The move reflects a growing trend of companies seeking U.S. listings for their greater liquidity and higher valuations.</p>

Merz's spokesman indicated that the chancellor approaches the meeting with "great calmness and joy," emphasizing the importance of a constructive relationship between Germany and the U.S. for economic and security reasons. Other potential discussion points include Trump's circle's support for the far-right German party Alternative for Germany (AfD), a topic that has previously caused friction between the two nations.

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is planning to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing this summer for trade discussions, making him the latest world leader to engage with China amidst global economic turbulence caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies. The meeting, expected to occur in July or August, aims to further thaw economic tensions between Australia and China, which have eased import curbs on Australian goods like coal, wine, and lobster. Engagement with China remains a priority for Albanese following his Labor Party's recent election victory, with the goal of stabilizing the Australia-China relationship and benefiting from trade opportunities.</p>

The Mail focuses on the "battle lines" drawn over immigration, contrasting the policies of Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch. The Financial Times reports that Trump's policies will increase US debt.

          <p>The charity Thin Blue Paw is advocating for pensions to support retired police dogs, whose lives are often put at risk in the line of duty. These dogs, after years of service, often face complicated medical needs and injuries, leading to high veterinary costs for their adopters. Laura Meller, who has adopted three former service animals, has spent an estimated ¬£12,000 caring for them. Rising vet costs and the absence of financial support could deter potential adopters, especially for older dogs, raising concerns about their welfare.</p>

The report emphasizes the need for indigenous manufacturing, given rising global trade tensions and China's export restrictions on critical minerals.
