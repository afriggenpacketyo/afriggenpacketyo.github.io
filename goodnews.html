          <p>Haley Amaya, a 27-year-old model and dancer born in Los Angeles to a Honduran immigrant mother, is preserving her cultural heritage by teaching traditional Honduran folk dance. She founded the "Cinco Estrellas" ballet group, offering free classes to children in the MacArthur Park area, a community deeply affected by recent immigration raids. Growing up in a challenging environment, Amaya found salvation and identity in art, which propelled her into a successful modeling career with major agencies. Despite her professional success, she remains dedicated to her community, using dance as a tool to empower younger generations and provide a positive outlet.</p>

Later, President Reagan chose him to lead the CIA in 1987 to bring stability following the Iran-Contra affair.

          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who developed the well-known "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals in the 1990s, has updated his guidance for today's retirees. In his new book, he argues that with a properly diversified portfolio, including small-company and international stocks, a safe withdrawal rate is now closer to 4.7%. Bengen notes that inflation is the greatest threat to retirees and that his original rule was based on a worst-case scenario. He now suggests that many retirees are too conservative and could safely withdraw more, potentially around 5.25% to 5.5%, to better enjoy their accumulated wealth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition is shedding light on the career of Rachel Ruysch, a 17th-century Dutch painter who was one of the most celebrated still-life artists of her time, even more famous than Vermeer or Rembrandt. Growing up as the daughter of a renowned anatomist and embalmer, Ruysch developed a unique perspective on life and decay, which she channeled into perfecting the art of flower painting. The article explores how her work transcended mere decoration, combining scientific accuracy, aesthetic beauty, and moral messaging. Her paintings often depicted exotic blooms from around the globe, reflecting the Dutch Republic's colonial reach, while also subtly capturing the predatory aspects of the natural world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a sign of potentially easing tensions, South Korea's military has observed North Korean troops dismantling propaganda loudspeakers along the demilitarized zone. This action follows South Korea's own move to halt its broadcasts after the election of President Lee Jae Myung, who has advocated for improved inter-Korean relations. For years, both nations have used massive speakers to blast propaganda, news, and K-pop music across the border, a practice that was a major source of aggravation for residents. The move is seen as a positive reciprocal gesture, though Seoul's military remains watchful to see if the removal is comprehensive.</p>

          <h2>American Malls Find New Life by Replacing Anchor Stores with Churches and Entertainment Venues</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-09 08:30:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Struggling American shopping malls are experiencing a revival by replacing vacant anchor stores like Sears with unconventional tenants such as churches, entertainment venues, and residential units. This strategy aims to transform malls into community hubs that attract visitors for reasons beyond traditional retail. For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio sold its former Sears space to a large church, which now draws thousands of people weekly, boosting traffic for remaining stores. Industry data suggests this mixed-use approach is working, with mall traffic increasing as consumers embrace these re-imagined spaces for experiences, dining, and community events.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a high school football player, Logan Coleridge, experienced debilitating and persistent concussion symptoms for months, doctors discovered a more serious underlying condition. An MRI, ordered by a specialist, revealed an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an abnormal tangle of blood vessels in his brain that was likely the true cause of his severe headaches. The concussion he sustained led to the imaging that uncovered the potentially life-threatening AVM. Following successful neurosurgery to remove the malformation, Logan has made a full recovery and is preparing to return to the football field, with his family advocating for earlier, more thorough testing.</p>

          <p>Sandra Grimes, a pivotal CIA analyst who helped unmask one of the most damaging spies in U.S. history, has died at the age of 79. In the early 1990s, Grimes was part of a small team tasked with discovering why the agency's Soviet informants were being compromised and executed. Her meticulous investigation into financial records and activity logs was instrumental in identifying fellow CIA officer Aldrich Ames as the mole. Ames was arrested in 1994 after receiving millions from the Soviet Union for his espionage. Grimes's determined work was crucial in stopping a spy who caused immense damage to U.S. national security.</p>

          <p>A San Francisco-based startup, Marathon Fusion, has proposed a modern form of alchemy: manufacturing gold as a byproduct of nuclear fusion. The theory suggests that neutrons produced during the fusion process could be used to transmute more common elements, like mercury, into gold. This would not be the primary goal, but rather a way to generate revenue to offset the immense cost of developing commercial fusion energy, a clean power source. While scientifically plausible and intriguing to physicists, the idea remains entirely speculative, as commercial-scale fusion reactors do not yet exist. The concept echoes centuries of alchemical pursuits, but with a foundation in modern physics.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Carronade Capital Management is urging satellite communications company Viasat to unlock shareholder value by spinning off its Defense and Advanced Technologies (DAT) division. In a letter to the company, Carronade argues that Viasat is "materially misunderstood" and undervalued by the market, which wrongly views it as a legacy satellite firm threatened by competitors like Starlink. The firm contends that the fast-growing and highly profitable DAT business is a "hidden gem" that would be valued much higher as a standalone entity, potentially leading to a significant increase in Viasat's overall share price.

          <p>Stargazers may have a disappointing view of this year's Perseids meteor shower, as its peak on August 12-13 will coincide with a full moon. The bright moonlight is expected to wash out all but the brightest meteors, making viewing conditions less than ideal, according to NASA. The Perseids, which originate from debris left by the Swift-Tuttle comet, are known for producing bright fireballs and are one of the most popular annual showers. For those still hoping to catch a glimpse, astronomers recommend finding a dark location away from city lights and looking towards the north in the predawn hours.</p>
