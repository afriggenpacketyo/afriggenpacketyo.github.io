          <p>A recent study across 30 European countries reveals that parents find more meaning in life compared to childfree individuals, but report lower life satisfaction. The study highlights that mothers often experience lower satisfaction levels than fathers, influenced by factors like living situation and family policy. Scandinavian countries show smaller differences in satisfaction between parents and non-parents, attributed to robust childcare, financial support, and a societal view of children as a community responsibility. Gender equality and business cultures that accommodate family life also contribute to greater parental satisfaction.</p>

          <p>South Korea's upcoming election is expected to significantly impact its relationship with China, with both main candidates supporting the alliance with the United States. However, the front-runner favors diplomacy with North Korea and China to improve strained relations, suggesting a potential shift in foreign policy. The election's outcome could lead to a recalibration of South Korea's approach to regional powers, balancing its alliance with the U.S. with the need for diplomatic engagement with its neighbors.</p>
