          <p>President Trump announced plans to double tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum to 50% at a U.S. Steel factory in Pittsburgh. This move is intended to boost the local steel industry and decrease reliance on China.

Trump emphasized the importance of steel for national security, stating that a country without steel cannot maintain a military.</p>
