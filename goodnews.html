          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that Alabama prosecutors violated the constitutional rights of Michael Sockwell, a Black man sentenced to death in 1990, by systematically excluding Black individuals from his jury. The 2-1 decision noted a clear pattern of discriminatory intent, as prosecutors rejected 80% of eligible Black jurors. This ruling makes Sockwell, convicted of a 1988 murder, eligible for a retrial. The original trial was controversial, as the judge overrode the jury's 7-5 recommendation for a life sentence, a practice now banned in the state.</p>

Other competitors like Nio and Li Auto showed mixed results, with Li Auto experiencing a monthly drop but still exceeding its quarterly guidance.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The administration had planned to revoke their legal status and work permits in September, well before the previously established February 2026 deadline. The judge determined that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation in this manner. The ruling provides immediate relief for Haitians who have built lives in the U.S., though the White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision.</p>

The law will phase out the sale and manufacture of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032.
