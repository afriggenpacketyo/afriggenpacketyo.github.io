          <p>Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to ceasefire negotiations in Malaysia after four days of deadly border clashes that have killed at least 33 people. The agreement for talks followed a call from U.S. President Donald Trump to both nations' leaders, urging an immediate end to the fighting. While Cambodia readily accepted the ceasefire proposal, Thailand maintained that dialogue must precede a formal truce. The conflict, rooted in a century-old border dispute, escalated recently, and Trump has linked a peaceful resolution to future trade agreement discussions with both countries.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have initiated a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in military operations in parts of Gaza to allow for the entry of humanitarian aid. The pause, scheduled from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. in Al Mawasi, Deir al Balah, and Gaza City, is intended to create secure corridors for aid convoys from the UN and other international groups. This move comes amid severe international pressure and warnings of a worsening malnutrition crisis in the enclave. Hamas-run health officials stated the pause must be used to evacuate the wounded and deliver critical supplies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kent Rollins, a chuckwagon cook and YouTube personality known as the "Cast Iron Cowboy," champions the use of traditional cast iron skillets as the ultimate cooking tool. In a recent interview, Rollins highlighted cast iron's durability, superior heat retention, and versatility, noting its seamless transition from stovetop to open flame. He argues that, unlike modern non-stick pans, cast iron can last for generations and even provides an unexpected health benefit by enriching food with iron. Rollins also demystifies the cleaning process, stating it is simple with hot water right after cooking, making it an accessible and enduring kitchen essential.</p>

          <p>After a prolonged period of crises, aerospace manufacturer Boeing is beginning to stabilize under the leadership of CEO Kelly Ortberg, who came out of retirement to lead the company. Investor confidence is growing, with the company's stock up over 30% this year as production increases and aircraft deliveries hit an 18-month high. Major airline customers have expressed renewed confidence in Boeing's improved quality control and delivery consistency. Despite the positive momentum, the company still faces significant hurdles, including an FAA-imposed production cap and ongoing challenges within its defense division.</p>

          <p>This article provides financial guidance for a renter, Beth, whose landlord has offered to sell her the house. While the monthly mortgage payment might seem comparable to her current rent, the analysis emphasizes the need to consider numerous additional costs of homeownership. These include property taxes, homeowners insurance, maintenance, and potential repairs, which can significantly increase the total monthly outlay. The piece also discusses the opportunity cost of tying up capital in real estate versus investing in the stock market, which has historically offered higher returns, and the loss of flexibility associated with owning a home.

          <p>In the jungles of northern Guatemala, conservation groups have set up artificial watering holes to help wildlife cope with increasingly common and severe heat waves. Motion-activated cameras placed near these water sources have captured incredible footage of a diverse range of animals, including elusive jaguars and tapirs, drinking and cooling off. The project highlights a simple yet effective way humans can help mitigate the impacts of climate change on ecosystems. Researchers note that while not a permanent solution, these water stations serve as a vital tool for helping wildlife adapt to unpredictable environmental conditions and water scarcity.</p>

          <p>In this cultural review, an assistant editor at The Atlantic shares his recent entertainment and literary recommendations. He praises Mario Vargas Llosa's historical novel "The Feast of the Goat" for its gripping exploration of a dictatorship's lasting impact, and Alasdair MacIntyre's philosophical work "Dependent Rational Animals" for its case against radical individualism. His musical tastes range from Courtney Barnett to Chappell Roan, and he highlights the latest season of the TV show "The Bear." The editor also reflects on the comedic genius of Conan O'Brien and the moving power of a jazz mass in New York City.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides an overview of how sunscreens work and why their use is crucial for preventing skin cancer and damage from the sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation. It explains the two main types of sunscreens: organic (often called chemical) sunscreens that absorb UV rays, and inorganic (or physical) ones that use minerals like zinc oxide to block them. While there are some concerns about certain chemicals being absorbed into the bloodstream, experts emphasize that the risk is low and the benefits of using sunscreen far outweigh potential harms. The piece also warns against ineffective do-it-yourself sunscreens and notes that future products may utilize protective compounds found in plants.</p>

          <p>China has discovered a super-large zirconium deposit, a critical mineral for advanced aerospace and defense applications, potentially quintupling its national reserve. The deposit, estimated to contain two million tonnes of zirconium dioxide, was found in a non-marine basin, a first for the country. Zirconium alloys are essential for manufacturing components that can withstand extreme conditions, such as the combustion chambers and nose cones of hypersonic weapons. This discovery could be a significant strategic advantage for China, addressing a potential bottleneck in its race to develop next-generation military technology.</p>

          <p>This article explores the reasons behind the underrepresentation of Eastern European teams in top-tier women's football, with Poland being the sole qualifier from the region for Euro 2025. Experts suggest a combination of historical, cultural, and economic factors are at play. The legacy of post-communist economic struggles limited investment, while persistent paternalistic cultural norms have discouraged female participation in the sport. Although UEFA initiatives and increased funding are beginning to show positive results, the region still lags behind Western Europe in infrastructure, professionalization, and societal acceptance of women's football.</p>
