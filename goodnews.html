          <p>Daichi Kamada played a key role in Crystal Palace's 1-0 victory over Manchester City in the FA Cup final, securing the club's first major trophy since 1861. Kamada, who previously won the Europa League under Palace manager Oliver Glasner, contributed to Eberechi Eze's winning goal. Dean Henderson saved a penalty, helping Palace maintain their lead. Kamada expressed his joy at making history as the first Japanese player in an FA Cup final, and Manchester City ended the season without a trophy for the first time since 2016-17.</p>

          <p>Several UK newspaper headlines center on Prime Minister Keir Starmer's upcoming summit with the EU, with some framing it as a "surrender summit" and warning against compromising Brexit. Other front pages highlight the establishment of a new Home Guard to protect against terror attacks on key infrastructure. Additionally, there are reports of MPs urging the proscription of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and concerns about social media influencers promoting tanning products. The papers also cover personal stories, including Scott Mitchell's ongoing grief after his wife's death and a choir of Post Office scandal victims seeking justice.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Rwandan refugees, who had been living in eastern Congo since the 1994 genocide, were repatriated on Saturday. The refugees, mostly women and children, crossed the border in buses provided by Rwandan authorities, escorted by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and Save the Children. The repatriation aims to bring 2,000 people back to Rwanda, with authorities emphasizing their value to the country's development. The returnees, some of whom were born in Congo and had never seen Rwanda, expressed happiness at returning to their ancestral homeland.</p>

          <p>Lieutenant Kateryna is Ukraine's only female combat pilot, flying helicopter missions against Russian troops. Despite an increase in women serving in the Ukrainian military, sexism and stereotypes persist. Kateryna faces doubt and marginalization, but she has become an inspiration to other women aspiring to be pilots. The military has started recruitment campaigns and gender equality training, but deeply rooted biases remain a challenge. Kateryna, who flies a Mi-8 helicopter, says she focuses on the beauty of her country during missions, tuning out the negative comments and hoping she has ruined the stereotype.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have created a "groundbreaking" fibre-optic gyroscope that is stable across a large temperature range and suitable for navigation. The device, developed by the Tianjin Navigation Instruments Research Institute and Jinan University, offers a more stable method for measuring navigation in aircraft, ships, and oil rigs. Fibre-optic gyroscopes, unlike traditional ones, use the changing movement of light in optical fibres, making them immune to interference and vital for military and security applications.</p>

          <p>High demand for concerts and music festivals in mainland China is driving a tourism spending spree as fans travel across the country for live shows. Local governments are capitalizing on this trend by bundling concert tickets with discounted hotel, dining, and tourist bookings to encourage greater spending. Shily Zhou, a 26-year-old from Shanghai, traveled twice in five months to see her idol, benefiting from discounts to local attractions granted with her concert ticket. This strategy aligns with Beijing's focus on boosting domestic consumption amidst trade tensions.</p>

          <p>The government is exploring plans to have convicted criminals perform unpaid work such as filling potholes and cleaning bins. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood believes this approach is more impactful than lenient sentences. The proposal involves probation teams collaborating with local councils and private companies to assign jobs to offenders. The money earned would be allocated to a fund for victims' groups. This initiative aims to address prison overcrowding while ensuring that punishment is more than just a "soft option" and that the offenders are helping the public.</p>

His defiant stance comes after Trump threatened him on social media, advising the musician to keep his mouth shut.
