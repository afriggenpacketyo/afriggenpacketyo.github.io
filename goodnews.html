          <p>UK-made car sales to the US saw a 6.8% rise in July, reversing a three-month decline, following the implementation of a revised UK-US tariff deal. Initially, President Trump had hiked import taxes on UK cars to 27.5%, causing industry shockwaves, before it was lowered to 10% for the first 100,000 vehicles. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) highlighted the deal's impact, noting the US remains the largest single market for British-built cars, especially premium brands. Despite this positive shift in exports, overall UK car manufacturing continues to struggle due to higher labor costs, increased competition, and Brexit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams linebacker Nate Landman, born in Harare, Zimbabwe, often surprises people with his African roots, a heritage he proudly displays through tattoos and a flag on his helmet. Despite moving to California at age three, his family maintained strong cultural ties. Landman, the only active NFL player with Zimbabwean roots, was undrafted in 2022 but persevered to become a starting linebacker, showcasing a relentless energy inherited from his athletic parents. His journey highlights the challenges of an undrafted player and the growing international presence in the NFL, demonstrating that identity grounds his hard-earned career.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Stanford study indicates that generative AI tools like ChatGPT are primarily displacing entry-level workers in AI-exposed fields such as software engineering and customer service, showing a 13% employment drop since 2022 for early-career employees. More experienced workers in these sectors, and those in less AI-exposed fields, have seen employment growth. Economists suggest older workers possess valuable tacit knowledge and soft skills less susceptible to AI replacement. While AI will eliminate some jobs, it also creates others and can augment human work, emphasizing the importance for young professionals to learn effective AI utilization to remain competitive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In drought-stricken Las Vegas, a team of two dozen water waste investigators actively patrols neighborhoods to enforce conservation, targeting issues like misaligned sprinklers and over-irrigation. Part of the Southern Nevada Water Authority, these patrols educate residents and issue fines for repeat violations, though the primary goal is behavioral change. Despite significant population growth and tourism since 2002, Las Vegas has reduced Colorado River water consumption by over 30% due to these efforts, along with measures like banning decorative grass and recycling water. These initiatives are crucial as the region faces "exceptional" drought conditions and declining reservoir levels.</p>

          <p>Amtrak's first NextGen Acela trains are launching on the Northeast Corridor, promising top speeds of 160 mph and 27% more seats, marking the biggest investment in the railroad's rolling stock in 25 years. Despite technical delays during development, the new fleet aims to enhance the passenger experience, though speeds remain limited by aging infrastructure. The unveiling comes amidst a complex political landscape for high-speed rail, with the Trump administration expressing support for the concept while also revoking grants from California's troubled project. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy highlighted the administration's commitment to tackling difficult projects and improving transit hubs.</p>

          <p>Wales captain Aaron Ramsey has been notably excluded from the national squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifier away to Kazakhstan on September 4. The 34-year-old midfielder recently made his return to club football with Pumas UNAM, playing his first minutes since a hamstring injury in March, suggesting he may not be deemed fully match-fit for international duty. Leeds United skipper Ethan Ampadu is also absent due to a knee injury, further impacting the team's experienced core. Manager Craig Bellamy's 25-man squad, however, includes three uncapped players, indicating a focus on new talent and strategic adjustments for the crucial qualifier and subsequent friendly against Canada.</p>

          <p>A unique and widely praised photograph of seventh-seed Jasmine Paolini at the US Open has been hailed as potentially one of the best tennis photos ever. Photographer Ray Giubilo captured the "half terrifying and half sublime" image by fluke, attributing its perfection to Paolini being off-balance during a forehand stroke. Giubilo, who spends seven months a year covering tennis, recognized the shot's greatness instantly, and Paolini herself expressed admiration. This rare, humorous image stands out in a sport known for intense but rarely comedic photography, showcasing the blend of patience, creative flair, and impeccable technical ability required in sports photography.</p>

          <p>Chinese leader Xi Jinping is leveraging upcoming meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin to project China's diplomatic power and influence, particularly ahead of a potential summit with Donald Trump. Kim and Putin's attendance at a military parade in Beijing on September 3, a surprise announcement for Kim, signals a show of solidarity and potentially crucial leverage for Xi in future talks with Trump regarding trade, TikTok, and a Ukraine ceasefire. This strategic timing positions Xi as a key geopolitical player, potentially possessing unique insights from both leaders that could influence Trump's foreign policy decisions.</p>

          <p>Computer-chip designer Nvidia reported a 56% surge in revenue to $46.7bn for the second quarter, driven by strong demand from tech giants like Meta and OpenAI expanding their AI capabilities. CEO Jensen Huang noted the "AI race is now on," with spending from major firms doubling to $600bn annually, positioning Nvidia at the heart of this growth. Despite this success, the company continues to navigate US-China trade tensions, including a recent US government review of licenses for its H20 chips designed for China. Analysts warn that US export restrictions are fueling domestic chipmaking in China, potentially fostering future competition for Nvidia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The widespread emotional reaction to Taylor Swift's engagement, with fans expressing immense joy and tears online, highlights the phenomenon of "parasocial relationships"—one-sided friendships with celebrities. Psychologists note that constant exposure to celebrities' private lives through reality shows and social media creates a powerful illusion of intimacy, fulfilling a fundamental human need for connection. While these relationships can foster a sense of community among fans and offer a welcome distraction from negative news, experts like Arthur C. Brooks caution they lack "nutritional content" and cannot genuinely replace reciprocal, real-life friendships. The article suggests that while being happy for a star is harmless, genuine emotional support and connection require mutual interaction.</p>

          <p>Argentine authorities are searching for an 18th-century Italian portrait, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Vittore Ghislandi, believed to have been looted by a fugitive Nazi officer 80 years ago. The painting, from Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker's extensive collection, recently resurfaced in a real estate advertisement for a villa in Argentina, a country known for sheltering Nazis after WWII. Police raided the property, finding German documents but not the artwork. Researchers believe it is "reasonably likely" to be the original, renewing efforts to recover plundered Jewish property and highlighting ongoing efforts to address historical injustices.</p>

          <p>Darren Aronofsky's new film, "Caught Stealing," adapted from Charlie Huston's novel, follows Hank Thompson (Austin Butler), a former promising baseball player whose life spirals after an accident and a blundered cat-sitting gig. Set in a gritty 1998 Lower East Side, Hank finds himself entangled in a violent crime caper involving Russian thugs, Hassidic hitmen, and a Puerto Rican club owner. The movie, a "bruising bacchanal," is a love letter to a sleazy, energetic New York, showcasing Aronofsky's fascination with characters squandering their potential. Hank's struggle with his past athletic glory and present alcoholic self forms the core of his problem.</p>
