        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Catholic Church prepares to select Pope Francis‚Äô successor, several key questions arise regarding the process. The conclave's duration is uncertain, depending on how long it takes the eligible cardinals to agree on a pick, requiring two-thirds of the votes. Cardinals are sequestered without access to communication with the outside world and spend time between votes in prayer and discussion. Potential frontrunners include Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Pierbattista Pizzaballa, Luis Antonio Tagle, and Cardinal Peter Erdo. The election is also a referendum on Pope Francis‚Äô papacy, with different factions seeking a leader who either prioritizes tradition or continues Francis' progressive approach.</p>

          <p>The UK government is defending a newly-agreed trade deal with India, specifically an exemption on National Insurance contributions (Nics) extended from one to three years for short-term visa holders. Opposition parties claim this could disadvantage British workers, as Indian workers may be cheaper to employ. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds argues that the deal will not impact British workers, as the UK has 16 agreements preventing double taxation of work. The deal aims to boost trade between the two countries by ¬£25.5bn a year by 2040, benefiting UK firms exporting goods like whisky and cars to India.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Indian markets have remained largely stable despite recent military strikes against Pakistan, with investors focusing on India's growth prospects and structural reforms. Analysts believe that strong domestic demand and macro fundamentals are overshadowing geopolitical fears. Progress on trade talks with major partners, including a free trade agreement with the UK, is also providing support. Historical precedents, such as the market reaction after the 2019 Pulwama attack, suggest that Indian assets will remain fairly contained. Investors are hopeful for a swift de-escalation to limit the fallout.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk shares rose after the company anticipated sales of its Wegovy weight loss drug would improve in the second half of the year due to the phasing out of copycat compounded drugs. The Danish pharmaceutical giant reported better-than-expected first-quarter net profit. CEO Lars Fruergaard J√∏rgensen said the end of a drug shortage ruling by the FDA would allow sales to pick up again. The company expects sales of compounded alternatives to ease soon, and reiterated that it would pursue companies that continue to unlawfully distribute such copycat drugs.</p>
