          <h2>Scientists to Analyze 1.5-Million-Year-Old Ice Core to Uncover Climate History</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:18:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An ice core, potentially over 1.5 million years old, has been transported from Antarctica to the UK for analysis. Scientists at the British Antarctic Survey will melt the ancient ice to study trapped materials like dust, ash, and algae. This research aims to unlock secrets about Earth's climate from a previously unknown period, specifically the Mid-Pleistocene Transition. The findings could revolutionize our understanding of climate change and help predict how the planet might respond to current high levels of greenhouse gases. The multinational effort to extract the 2.8km core was a complex and costly scientific endeavor.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Core Inflation Eases in June Amid Declining Rice Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:16:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, aligning with economists' expectations. The easing was partly driven by a slowdown in the rapid increase of rice prices, which had surged due to poor harvests. Despite this, the headline inflation rate has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months, maintaining pressure on the central bank to consider raising interest rates. However, concerns about economic growth, impacted by potential U.S. tariffs, complicate the policy outlook for the nation's economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK to Impose Stricter Affordability Checks on 'Buy Now, Pay Later' Services</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:14:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New regulations in the UK, set to take effect next July, will require "Buy Now, Pay Later" (BNPL) providers like Klarna and Clearpay to conduct stricter affordability checks on shoppers. The move, orchestrated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), aims to protect consumers from accumulating excessive debt and facing unexpected late fees. As BNPL services have grown in popularity, particularly among younger adults, debt charities have raised concerns about the lack of regulation. The new rules will bring the sector more in line with other forms of credit, ensuring consumers have rights to complain and receive clearer information.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, which his physician described as a "benign and common" condition. The diagnosis came after the 79-year-old president experienced mild swelling in his legs, prompting a comprehensive examination that ruled out more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis. Chronic venous insufficiency occurs when leg veins struggle to pump blood back to the heart. The physician's memo also attributed recent bruising on the president's hand to frequent handshaking combined with aspirin use, and affirmed that Mr. Trump remains in "excellent" overall health.</p>

          <p>A settlement has been reached in a class-action lawsuit brought by investors against Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other company leaders. The lawsuit stemmed from the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal, alleging that officials failed to disclose the risks of user data being misused and violated a 2012 FTC consent order. Shareholders were seeking to have the executives reimburse Meta for an estimated $8 billion in fines and legal costs the company incurred. Details of the settlement, announced in a Delaware court, were not immediately made public. Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg had been expected to testify in the trial.</p>

          <p>Congress has passed the Genius Act, a landmark bipartisan bill that establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation, which now heads to the President's desk, aims to provide consumer protection and clear rules for the $250 billion market, defining which digital assets can be called stablecoins. Proponents argue that by creating clear guardrails, the act will foster innovation in digital payments, allowing for faster and lower-cost transactions. The bill's passage could open the door for banks and other financial institutions to begin issuing their own regulated stablecoins.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Jordan Addison has avoided jail time after pleading no contest to a lesser charge of "wet reckless driving" related to a DUI citation from July 2024. The former USC star was arrested after a highway patrol officer found him asleep at the wheel of a Rolls-Royce blocking traffic near LAX. As part of the plea deal, the original misdemeanor drunk-driving charges were dismissed. Addison was sentenced to 12 months' probation and must pay a fine and complete two online courses, allowing him to put the incident behind him and focus on his NFL career.</p>

Slovakia had been holding up the measures over concerns about a separate EU plan to halt Russian gas imports by 2028. Fico stated that Slovakia received guarantees from the EU regarding its future gas supply and prices, making it "counterproductive" to continue the blockade. The new sanctions, which require unanimous approval, target Russia's energy and banking sectors, including prohibiting the use of Nord Stream pipelines and cutting more Russian banks from the SWIFT payment system.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's diagnosis, medical experts have provided details on chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a common circulatory condition affecting up to 40% of the U.S. population. CVI occurs when valves in leg veins are damaged, making it difficult for blood to return to the heart and causing it to pool, which can lead to swelling and varicose veins. While it can be painful, it is not considered a serious health threat. Treatment is typically non-surgical and focuses on managing symptoms through methods like compression stockings, leg elevation, and exercise to strengthen the calf muscles, which help pump blood.</p>

Lillard is said to be finalizing a three-year, $42 million contract that includes a no-trade clause. The move comes after he was waived by the Milwaukee Bucks earlier in the month. Lillard, who is recovering from a torn Achilles tendon and is expected to miss the upcoming season, chose to return to Portland, where his family resides, despite interest from other playoff contenders.

As a leading cause of death for young Americans, the issue has gained significant political salience in Washington, potentially making it a point of leverage in broader bilateral talks. While not a traditional trade matter, addressing the flow of fentanyl precursors from China could serve as a new stage in negotiations.
