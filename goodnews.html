          <p>Cleveland Browns' third-string quarterback, Shedeur Sanders, has publicly asserted his confidence, claiming he is capable of outperforming some current NFL starters after observing their performance through the first three weeks of the season. Despite his position behind veteran Joe Flacco and fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel on the depth chart, Sanders is diligently preparing as if he could be called upon at any moment, emphasizing his readiness to play and his consistent focus. His father, Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, also recently predicted his son would start for the Browns at some point this season, further fueling speculation. The team's coaching staff is currently focused on developing both rookies for the future, with Gabriel presently perceived as slightly ahead in their progression.</p>

          <p>Costco exceeded Wall Street's expectations for its fiscal fourth quarter, reporting strong earnings and revenue, largely attributed to robust growth in membership and e-commerce. The warehouse club saw double-digit gains in both membership income and its online business, signaling continued consumer appeal for value. CFO Gary Millerchip detailed strategies to mitigate rising tariff costs, including introducing Kirkland Signature alternatives and diversifying merchandise. Notably, the average age of Costco's members has decreased, with nearly half of new sign-ups being under 40, contributing to a significant 14% increase in membership fee income. The company plans to open 35 new warehouses in the upcoming fiscal year, reflecting confidence in its growth trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Raynae Madison and her family, visiting Arkansas's Crater of Diamonds State Park to celebrate her nephew's birthday, made a remarkable discovery, unearthing a nearly 3-carat brown diamond. Madison initially doubted it was a diamond due to its impressive size but had it identified by park staff as a 2.79-carat chocolate brown diamond, notable for its unique inclusions. The stone, named the "William Diamond" in tribute to her nephew, is the third-largest registered at the park this year, following a 3.81-carat "Duke Diamond" found earlier. This discovery underscores the park's continued allure, attracting over 100,000 visitors annually in search of gemstones.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British energy major BP has seen its shares climb over 32% since early April, significantly outperforming rivals and moving the company out of the intense takeover speculation that previously surrounded it. This improved sentiment is attributed to BP's fundamental strategic reset, a recent leadership shake-up, ongoing progress in its cost-cutting program, and a string of new oil discoveries, including a promising find in Brazil's Santos Basin. CEO Murray Auchincloss has consistently emphasized the company's focus on organic growth to enhance shareholder value, while Shell explicitly denied earlier reports of acquisition talks. Analysts like Morningstar's Allen Good note that the selection of a new chair with experience in meaningful turnarounds has further bolstered investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

Appeal hearings commenced in August and are expected to continue through the end of October, with Barr noting positive anecdotal feedback on the process, though not all appeals result in reductions. Residents who remain unsatisfied with their final value after these hearings have a 30-day window to appeal to the Court of Common Pleas, with final decision orders expected by November 15.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa's England striker Ollie Watkins is currently experiencing a challenging 10-game goal drought for both his club and national team, including a recent weak penalty saved in a Europa League match against Bologna. Despite this extended period without scoring, manager Unai Emery has publicly expressed strong support for Watkins, asserting with confidence that goals will inevitably come through the striker's dedicated work and effort. Emery highlighted Watkins' valuable contributions beyond scoring, such as his pressing, duels, and creation of chances. The manager believes that while a lack of goals can affect a player's morale, Watkins' commitment to his team tasks remains the most crucial aspect of his performance.</p>

          <p>911 emergency systems across Mississippi were fully restored Thursday evening, as announced by the governor, following a widespread outage earlier in the afternoon caused by damage to AT&T fiber optic lines. However, parts of Louisiana continued to experience disruptions to their emergency lines, including in major cities like Baton Rouge and New Orleans, though some parishes reported restoration by late afternoon. Officials confirmed the outage was due to an "accidental fiber cut" and not a malicious cyberattack, with a full resolution anticipated within hours for all remaining affected areas. Law enforcement agencies in both states had urged residents to use alternative local phone numbers for emergencies during the disruption, while discouraging non-emergency calls to keep lines clear for critical situations.</p>

          <p>An article suggests that Dodgers fans should consciously appreciate the team's remarkable, consistent success before the inevitable anxiety of the postseason fully returns. The Dodgers are portrayed as an anomaly in baseball, having clinched their 12th National League West title in 13 seasons and making their 13th consecutive postseason appearance, a feat almost unparalleled in the sport. Former Dodger Kenley Jansen underscored the immense difficulty of consistently reaching the playoffs and the organizational depth required, highlighting the team's exceptional era. Despite their regular-season dominance, the pressure for a World Series championship remains immense, with the article noting that nothing less will satisfy fans, leading to a quick return of criticism and bullpen concerns once the playoffs commence.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers officially clinched their 12th National League West division title in 13 seasons with a decisive 8-0 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. This significant win guarantees them a home start for the upcoming best-of-three wild-card round of the playoffs, despite a regular season that, by their high standards, was considered disappointing and fell short of early 100-win predictions. Manager Dave Roberts highlighted the team's resilience and unity through various struggles and injuries, expressing confidence that they are currently playing their "best baseball of the season." The victory, marked by superb pitching and explosive offense, provides crucial momentum as they enter October aiming to defend their World Series championship.</p>

          <p>As China drafts its 15th five-year plan, this article examines the nation's unparalleled manufacturing ecosystem and robust supply chain resilience, which has become a significant source of national pride. Despite its global dominance, exemplified by providing core components for products like "made-in-India" iPhones, China acknowledges existing weak links within its extensive supply networks. Analysts anticipate that the forthcoming plan will strategically focus on further solidifying these achievements, propelling the country higher up the industrial value chain, and specifically addressing critical chokepoints in high-tech sectors. This forward-looking strategy aims to bolster China's domestic economic transformation and enhance its capacity to navigate an increasingly uncertain global environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a finalized deal for TikTok's U.S. operations, asserting it has Chinese President Xi Jinping's blessing and satisfies the legal requirements for divestiture. The agreement involves a consortium of U.S. investors, notably including Oracle, Rupert Murdoch, and Michael Dell, who will acquire TikTok's U.S. assets to establish a new company valued at $14 billion. Under this structure, American investors will control a new algorithm, retrained exclusively on U.S. user data, and Americans will hold six of seven board seats, with ByteDance retaining less than 20% ownership. This complex arrangement aims to definitively address long-standing national security concerns regarding potential Chinese government access to American user data and influence operations through the popular app.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is expected to announce plans for a compulsory nationwide digital ID scheme, aiming to combat illegal working and modernize state services. The practicalities of the scheme, including how to ensure accessibility for individuals without smartphones or passports, will be subject to a comprehensive consultation process. While a previous Labour government's attempt to introduce ID cards was ultimately blocked, Starmer believes public attitudes have shifted, making the concept more acceptable now. The government has increasingly advocated for the idea amidst mounting pressure to address illegal migration and enhance access to government services, drawing inspiration from successful implementations in countries like Estonia. However, the proposal faces strong criticism from opposition parties, including Conservatives, Reform UK, and Liberal Democrats, who raise concerns over civil liberties and the scheme's actual effectiveness.</p>

It posits that China's economy is actively cultivating a robust and resilient foundation through a powerful synergy of green infrastructure, advanced digital connectivity, and world-class scientific research. The article emphasizes China's emergence as a global leader in scientific research, noting its production of 33.8% of the world’s highly cited papers and its lead in 57 out of 64 key technologies.
