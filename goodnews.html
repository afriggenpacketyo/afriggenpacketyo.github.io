        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has cautioned that stablecoins may only have a minor role in the future monetary system due to lacking key characteristics of traditional currencies. The BIS suggests that stablecoins, cryptocurrencies backed by fiat currencies, could become the preferred choice for illicit activities due to their pseudonymity and lack of issuer oversight. Instead, the BIS proposes a unified platform that tokenizes central bank reserves, commercial bank deposits, and government bonds as the foundation for the next-generation monetary and financial system. The BIS emphasized that stablecoins circulate without issuer oversight, making them susceptible to misuse and bypassing integrity safeguards. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has pledged to allocate 5% of its GDP to national security by 2035, surpassing the current NATO target. The commitment aims to divide spending between core defense (3.5%) and defense-related areas like resilience and security (1.5%). This initiative seeks to appease US President Donald Trump's calls for increased defense spending while offering EU countries flexibility in meeting the target. Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel criticized the announcement, arguing that the government should increase funding sooner due to the current geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>Americans consume plenty of text, but deep reading, or sustained engagement with longform text, is in decline. Deep reading activates a wide array of the brain‚Äôs linguistic and cognitive capacities, according to neuroscientist Maryanne Wolf. Some analysts suggest that digital media‚Äôs displacement of books is propelling humanity back to an ancient mode of cognition and communication. These theorists argue that print media laid the foundations for liberal democracy, and as deep reading declines, the electorate‚Äôs commitment to pluralism, objectivity, universalism, individual rights, and the rule of law is swiftly receding.</p>

The time for the single-team sports channel has largely come and gone, and the economics are poor, and the enthusiasm for 24-7, all-access coverage of one team has dissipated into the reality that most fans just want to watch the game.

The new system, which they hope to roll out by spring semester 2026, will have integrated fraud detection tools. The Education Department announced earlier this month it‚Äôs implementing a new rule that would require financial aid applicants to present, either in person or in a live video conference, an unexpired, valid, government-issued photo identification to their school, and the school must preserve a copy.</p>
