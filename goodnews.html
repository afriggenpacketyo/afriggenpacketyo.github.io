          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the United States and China have made substantial progress in trade talks held in Geneva, signaling a potential trade truce that could positively impact financial markets. While specific details remain undisclosed, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer suggested a deal addressing national security concerns related to China's trade practices. The talks, led by Bessent and China‚Äôs Vice Premier He Lifeng, aim to alleviate tensions stemming from tariffs imposed by both nations, which have disrupted global supply chains. Economists have cautioned that the trade dispute could hinder global growth and contribute to inflation, potentially leading to a recession.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Democrats are aiming to tap into parents' anxieties by linking rising prices of baby gear, driven by Trump's tariff policies, and the spread of vaccine misinformation, promoted by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to the Trump administration. The article explores whether Democrats can persuade voters that the current White House is making their lives harder, particularly regarding routine aspects of parenting. While Republicans have successfully tapped into parental concerns in recent years, Democrats see an opportunity to channel parents' fury and fears by addressing issues such as measles outbreaks and the safety of consumer products. The article emphasizes the need for Democrats to elevate individual stories and make these issues real for people.</p>
