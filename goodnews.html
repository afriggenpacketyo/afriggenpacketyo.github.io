          <p>Australian leg-spinner Alana King achieved the best bowling figures in Women's World Cup history, taking seven wickets for just 18 runs in a decisive victory over South Africa.

This victory secures Australia's top spot in the group stage, setting up a semi-final clash with India. King's historic spell, which surpassed a 41-year-old record, underscores Australia's formidable and unbeaten run as they head into the tournament's knockout stages as clear favorites.</p>

          <p>Billionaire Jimmy John Liautaud, founder of the Jimmy John's sandwich chain, has stated that the concept of work-life balance for entrepreneurs is "the biggest line of bulls--- that’s ever been created." He argues that building a business from nothing requires an all-consuming level of hard work and dedication, leaving no room for such a balance. Liautaud, who grew his company from a single shop with a $25,000 loan into a brand with over 2,600 locations, emphasizes that success demands a relentless, 24/7 commitment. His perspective aligns with the work ethics of other notable entrepreneurs like Bill Gates and Elon Musk during their companies' early days.</p>

          <p>A vibrant Pablo Picasso portrait of his muse and partner, Dora Maar, sold for approximately $37 million at a Paris auction, exceeding expectations. The 1943 painting, titled "Bust of a Woman with a Flowered Hat," had been in a private family collection since 1944 and was hidden from public view for over eight decades. The artwork captures Maar at a painful closing stage of her relationship with Picasso, with experts noting the vividness of the colors and the raw emotion conveyed. The sale price represents the highest paid for any artwork at a French auction this year, highlighting the enduring global interest in Picasso's work.</p>

          <h2>Olympian Abby Wambach Advises Parents to Skip Kids' Sports Practices for Better Development</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-25 09:05:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two-time Olympic gold medalist Abby Wambach advises parents against attending their children's sports practices, arguing it fosters greater resilience and internal motivation. The former soccer star suggests that a parent's presence on the sidelines can cause children to become nervous or overly driven to impress, outsourcing their motivation rather than developing it themselves. By allowing kids to practice without supervision, they are free to take risks, make mistakes, and learn from their coaches and teammates independently. This approach, Wambach believes, helps cultivate self-starting traits that are crucial for becoming successful and well-adjusted adults both on and off the field.</p>

          <p>A West Virginia family experienced a medical ordeal when four of their six children were diagnosed with Chiari malformation, a rare condition where brain tissue extends into the spinal canal. The journey began when their youngest daughter, Austyn, underwent successful brain surgery that dramatically improved her constant pain and developmental delays. Subsequently, three of her older sisters—Amelia, Aubrey, and Adalee—were also diagnosed after exhibiting various symptoms, each requiring surgical intervention. A pediatric neurosurgeon noted that while a genetic link exists in about 10% of cases, seeing it in four siblings is highly unusual, bringing both disbelief and eventual relief to the family.</p>

          <p>Authorities in the UK have discovered and dismantled the country's first known illegal factory producing weight-loss medications. The raid in Northampton resulted in the largest-ever single seizure of trafficked weight-loss drugs globally, including thousands of unlicensed Retatrutide and Tirzepatide pens. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) warned that these unauthorized products are untested and potentially deadly. The operation successfully disrupted an organized criminal network, preventing a significant quantity of dangerous substances from reaching the public and highlighting the risks of purchasing medicines from unregulated online sources.</p>

          <p>In her first UK interview, former Vice President Kamala Harris indicated she is considering another presidential run in 2028, stating it's "possibly" her in the future. Speaking to the BBC, Harris dismissed polls that position her as an underdog for the Democratic nomination, asserting that she has defied polls throughout her career. Reflecting on her 2024 loss to Donald Trump, she branded him a "tyrant" and claimed her campaign warnings about his authoritarian tendencies have been validated by his actions in office. Harris affirmed her commitment to public service, stating, "I am not done," signaling a clear intention to remain a prominent figure in national politics.</p>

          <p>Dr. Roy Meals, an 80-year-old hand surgeon, undertook a remarkable journey to walk the entire 342-mile border of Los Angeles, a city he has lived in for half his life. Motivated by curiosity and a desire to truly know the city beyond a car windshield, he divided the trek into 34 segments. His adventure, detailed in his new book "Walking the Line," led him to historical landmarks, diverse neighborhoods, and unexpected cultural gems. Dr. Meals' prescription for others is to venture out on foot, stay curious and fit, and make the kind of life-enriching discoveries that can only be found by slowing down and observing one's surroundings.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has acquired a nearly 5% stake in the engineering and construction giant Fluor, with the goal of unlocking shareholder value. Starboard is focused on Fluor's approximately 39% ownership in NuScale Power, a company specializing in small modular nuclear reactors, which represents a significant portion of Fluor's market capitalization. The activist investor is urging Fluor's management to consider separating or monetizing this stake, arguing that the core business is currently trading at a steep discount. A potential spinoff or sale could re-rate Fluor's valuation and provide a substantial return for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Charles Schwab survey reveals that 45% of investors are interested in alternative investments like private equity and real estate, moving beyond traditional stocks and bonds. Financial advisors suggest that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer a practical and accessible way to gain exposure to these assets without the typical drawbacks of direct investment, such as illiquidity and long lockup periods. This trend is particularly strong among younger investors, some of whom are expressing disillusionment with conventional markets. While alternatives can offer diversification, experts still recommend they constitute a smaller portion of a portfolio, emphasizing that traditional, long-term investing remains a proven strategy.
