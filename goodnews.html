          <h2>Federal Reserve Enacts First Interest Rate Cut of the Year to Address Economic Slowdown</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 14:42:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has reduced its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, marking the first such cut since December of the previous year. This decision lowers the federal funds rate to a range of 4% to 4.25% in response to a slowing labor market and moderating economic growth. Officials anticipate two additional cuts within the year but have signaled a more cautious approach for 2026, which may temper market expectations. The move highlights the central bank's focus on bolstering employment amid persistent, though slightly elevated, inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage interest rates have fallen to their lowest point in three years, with the average 30-year fixed rate dropping to 6.13%, prompting a surge in loan and refinancing applications. This significant decrease is largely driven by market anticipation of the Federal Reserve's expected interest rate cut, as yields on 10-year Treasury notes have already declined. The article advises potential homebuyers and existing homeowners to take advantage of this potential window of opportunity by comparing lenders and getting preapproved. It highlights that this market shift offers a chance for those previously sidelined by high borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Following Fed Rate Cut, Experts Suggest Locking in Long-Term CD Rates Now</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 14:07:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve enacting its first interest rate cut of the year, financial experts are advising savers to consider opening long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) to lock in currently available high rates. As interest rates on savings accounts are expected to decline further, securing a multi-year CD can guarantee a fixed return, protecting savings from subsequent rate cuts anticipated later this year. The article notes that even with the recent downturn, long-term CDs can still yield significant interest over their term. This strategy offers a stable investment option in an otherwise unpredictable economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Rate Cut to Affect Consumer Mortgages, Credit Cards, and Savings Accounts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 14:01:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut is expected to have a mixed but noticeable impact on household finances across the United States. Consumers with variable-rate products like credit cards will likely see borrowing costs decrease, offering some relief from historically high rates. However, the effect on fixed-rate loans such as mortgages may be more gradual, as much of the cut was already priced in by markets. Conversely, savers should anticipate lower yields on high-interest savings accounts and CDs, prompting some to lock in current rates before they fall further.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has officially formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, marking the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Currently, the storm is projected to remain over open water and poses no immediate threat to land, though it is expected to strengthen. Forecasters predict Gabrielle could intensify into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend as it tracks north of the Caribbean. While its path remains uncertain, Bermuda may be affected next week, and officials continue to monitor its development closely during a season that has been quieter than initially predicted.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume a daily amount of alcohol equivalent to nearly two human cocktails by eating naturally fermented fruits. Scientists measured the ethanol content in figs and plums favored by the primates, finding it to be low but significant when consumed in large quantities. This finding lends support to the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in our fruit-eating ancestors. The study provides the first direct chemical evidence of the alcohol content in fruits that wild chimps routinely eat.</p>

          <p>Despite their regular-season success, including a recent 3-1 victory over the Seattle Sounders, the primary objective for Lionel Messi and Inter Miami is to win the MLS Cup.

With Messi now 38, the urgency to secure the title is mounting, especially as the team prepares to move into its new stadium next year.

          <p>A significant drop in mortgage rates to a multi-year low of 6.13% has triggered a 59.8% surge in refinancing applications from homeowners. This trend is particularly beneficial for those who purchased homes in 2023 and 2024 at rates often exceeding 7%, as they stand to gain substantial monthly savings. Homeowners with large outstanding loan balances, strong credit scores, and at least 20% equity are best positioned to take advantage of the current environment. The article also notes that those with adjustable-rate mortgages can lock in more stable, long-term fixed rates before potential future market shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a late-stage clinical trial, Eli Lilly's experimental oral diabetes pill, orforglipron, demonstrated superior performance in lowering blood sugar and promoting weight loss compared to Novo Nordisk's approved oral drug, Rybelsus. The study showed that the highest dose of Eli Lilly's pill reduced hemoglobin A1c levels by 2.2% and led to an average weight loss of 9.2%, outperforming the results from Novo Nordisk's medication. This positions orforglipron as a potentially strong competitor in the lucrative market for GLP-1 drugs, offering a needle-free alternative without dietary restrictions. Eli Lilly plans to seek regulatory approval in 2026.</p>

          <p>The European Union has unveiled a new strategic agenda aimed at elevating its partnership with India, positioning the country as a key reliable partner. This move comes as the EU seeks to lure India away from Russia's influence, opting for enhanced trade and strategic cooperation rather than punitive tariffs, despite U.S. pressure. The strategy emphasizes collaboration in the Indo-Pacific, diversifying supply chains away from China, and fostering defense industrial cooperation. EU officials believe a stronger relationship with India can serve as a moderating voice in global forums and advance shared interests in a rules-based international order.</p>

          <p>England secured a four-wicket victory over Ireland in the first match of their three-game T20 series, largely thanks to a powerful performance by opener Phil Salt. Salt scored 89 runs off just 46 balls, setting a strong foundation for England to successfully chase Ireland's competitive total of 196-3 with more than two overs to spare. The match, held in Dublin, was England's first T20 win against Ireland. Despite half-centuries from Ireland's Harry Tector and Lorcan Tucker, their efforts were not enough to overcome England's aggressive batting display at the start of their reply.</p>
