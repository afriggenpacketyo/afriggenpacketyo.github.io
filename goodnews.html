          <p>The White House and Qatar are in talks regarding the transfer of a luxury Boeing 747-8Z5 jet for potential use as Air Force One, sparking legal and ethical debates. Qatar's Media Attach√© confirmed ongoing negotiations between Qatar's Ministry of Defense and the U.S. Department of Defense, emphasizing that no final decision has been made, but that the matter remains under review. While Qatar denies that the plane would be a gift, it acknowledges that the transfer of an aircraft for temporary use is under discussion between the two countries. Trump defended the negotiations, referring to the plane as a gift offered for his use at no cost.</p>

          <p>Fresh & Ready Foods, an L.A.-based company, has voluntarily recalled several of its premade food offerings from businesses across California, Nevada, Arizona, and Washington due to a listeria outbreak first identified last year. The recall was prompted by a routine inspection where investigators found a strain of listeria monocytogenes on a piece of equipment. While no illnesses have been linked to the recalled food, the company is taking precautionary measures to ensure consumer safety. The outbreak was originally identified in 2024, sickening at least eight people in California and two in Nevada.</p>

          <p>President Trump plans to sign an executive order directing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to tie Medicare payments for certain medications to the lowest price paid by other countries. This "most favored nation" policy aims to lower U.S. drug costs, a revival of a program he previously failed to implement. The proposal, likely to face opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, would impact drugs covered by Medicare and administered in a doctor's office. Trump argues this will save the government trillions of dollars, though the actual figure is unclear.</p>

          <h2>Insurance Limits Force Patients to Switch Obesity Drugs</h2>

          <p>CVS Caremark has decided to stop offering Zepbound in favor of Wegovy for weight loss, forcing thousands of Americans to switch to a drug that may be less effective for them. This decision highlights the consequences of secret deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), where employers pay lower drug prices but their workers are blocked from getting competing treatments. Caremark's decision was made despite research showing that Zepbound resulted in more weight loss than Wegovy. Doctors say that both drugs are good, but they prefer Zepbound for most patients.</p>

          <h2>Are Protein Snacks Useful and Worth It?</h2>

          <p>High-protein versions of snacks and food staples are increasingly common in supermarkets, with celebrities promoting them. Sales of these products are rising, with 8.3% of food product launches making protein claims in the first three months of 2025. While high-protein diets are necessary for building muscle, some experts believe whole foods are better than processed snacks. Many supermarket products advertising their protein content are "gimmicky" and might not be as good for you as advertised. Excess protein is stored in the body as fat, so it is important to be mindful of calories.</p>

          <h2>Rival Weight Loss Drugs Go Head-to-Head with Clear Winner</h2>

          <p>The first head-to-head trial of two blockbuster weight-loss drugs has shown Mounjaro is more effective than rival Wegovy. Both drugs led to substantial weight loss, but Mounjaro's 20% weight reduction, after 72 weeks of treatment, exceeded the 14% from Wegovy, according to the trial's findings. Researchers who led the trial said both drugs had a role, but Mounjaro may help those with the most weight to lose. Both drugs trick the brain into making you feel full so you eat less and instead burn fat stored in the body.</p>

          <p>Former President Rodrigo Duterte, who faces international court charges of crimes against humanity, remains very popular in the Philippines. Mr. Duterte, who ordered a brutal antidrug campaign in which tens of thousands of people died during his presidency, remains very popular in the Philippines. He is expected to win another term as mayor of Davao City, his eighth, by a landslide. His sudden arrest and extradition to The Hague has sharply divided the Philippines, with some polls showing that a majority of Filipinos back the international investigation.</p>
