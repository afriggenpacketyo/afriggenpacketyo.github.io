          <p>Several UK newspapers are covering the historic Commons vote on the assisted dying bill, which narrowly passed and now faces a challenging path in the House of Lords, with potential opposition from peers. The Daily Express celebrates the vote as a victory for campaigners and choice, while The Guardian highlights the societal shift towards transforming end-of-life care. Other news includes a government plan to ban the Palestine Action group after a break-in at an RAF base, and the FT Weekend reports on a US private capital group's support for the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. The Daily Star claims Pope Leo XIV warns that AI is doing the devil's work and could be bad for kids, branding his remarks "Pope versus bot."</p>

          <p>Tesla is set to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, with a pilot program offering rides to a select group of people in Model Y vehicles within a geofenced area. The service will be accessible via the Robotaxi App, with a "Tesla Safety Monitor" present in the front passenger seat and remote monitors overseeing the rides. This launch comes amid scrutiny from government officials and safety advocacy groups regarding autonomous vehicle safety, with concerns raised about Tesla's self-driving technology. If successful, the robotaxi service could significantly boost Tesla's market capitalization, potentially reaching $2 trillion by the end of 2026.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rithy Panh's "Meeting With Pol Pot" fictionalizes the true story of Western journalists invited to interview the Khmer Rouge leader in 1978, revealing the cruel reality behind their proclaimed utopia. The film stars Ir√®ne Jacob as a reporter modeled after Elizabeth Becker, who is joined by a Maoist professor and a photojournalist, all growing increasingly horrified by what they witness. Panh masterfully depicts the tense atmosphere and the facade of hospitality, exposing the dangers of propaganda and the importance of confronting it. The director's use of clay figurines and archival footage adds a soulful sensibility to the mass tragedy.</p>

          <p>A federal appellate court has ruled that a Louisiana law requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms is unconstitutional, siding with civil liberties groups who argued it violates the separation of church and state. The court's decision backs a previous order by a U.S. District Judge, who declared the mandate unconstitutional. Louisiana's Attorney General disagrees with the ruling's scope and intends to appeal, while legal experts anticipate the case will eventually reach the Supreme Court.
