        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are actively considering a strategic shift for Shohei Ohtani in the playoffs, potentially deploying him as a relief pitcher alongside his starting role. This complex decision requires careful navigation of MLB rules, which could impact his designated hitter eligibility if he enters a game from the bullpen. Ohtani's previous success in a relief capacity during the 2023 World Baseball Classic highlights his versatility and potential value in high-leverage situations. The team's management is meticulously evaluating the logistical challenges and rule implications to leverage Ohtani's unique talents effectively in their postseason campaign.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the U.S. and China have established a "framework" agreement for social media platform TikTok, with commercial terms already settled between private parties. Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping are scheduled to discuss and finalize the terms on Friday, potentially leading to U.S.-controlled ownership of the platform. This development comes as TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, faces a September 17 deadline to divest its U.S. business or risk a ban. The agreement aims to resolve ongoing tensions and national security concerns surrounding the popular app.</p>

          <p>Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index achieved a historic milestone, climbing above the 45,000 mark for the first time, leading a positive trend in Asia-Pacific markets.

Other regional indices like South Korea's Kospi also saw gains, reflecting broader market confidence. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite in the U.S. similarly closed higher, indicating a generally favorable global market sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California is poised to designate Diwali, the Hindu "Festival of Lights," as an official statewide holiday, following the passage of Assembly Bill 268 by the Legislature. If signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, the bill would allow public schools and community colleges to close for the five-day celebration, which marks the Hindu new year and honors the goddess Lakshmi. This initiative, championed by Assemblymember Ash Kalra, aims to recognize the religious and historical significance of Diwali and provide greater inclusivity for the state's large South Asian population, fostering a sense of belonging for immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, ruling that her removal would likely violate the Federal Reserve Act's provisions designed to ensure the central bank's independence. This decision allows Cook to participate in the upcoming key vote on interest rates. Trump had sought to dismiss Cook based on unproven allegations of mortgage fraud, aiming to appoint a fourth member to the seven-member board and gain a majority influence over monetary policy. Cook's attorneys argued that unproven allegations pre-dating her appointment do not meet the "for cause" removal standard. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration is evaluating the removal of "black box" warnings from certain menopause hormone therapies, which treat symptoms like hot flashes. This reevaluation stems from recent studies that challenge the overstated risks of breast cancer from flawed 2002 research, now suggesting that treatment timing and delivery methods significantly mitigate risks. While some experts advocate for further scientific assessment before changes, medical professionals view this as a positive step towards better understanding and accessibility of effective treatments. This development could reshape how menopause hormone therapy is perceived and prescribed.</p>
