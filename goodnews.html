          <p>President Trump, during a state visit to Saudi Arabia, announced the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria, a move intended to provide economic relief to the war-torn country and support its new government led by Ahmed al-Shara. Trump stated the decision followed discussions with Turkey's president and Saudi Arabia's crown prince, aiming to encourage stability and peace in Syria. The announcement was met with celebration across Syria, as citizens hoped for an alleviation of poverty and a chance to rebuild. Critics suggest this move could facilitate international aid and investment, crucial for Syria's recovery from years of conflict and economic collapse.
