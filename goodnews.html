          <p>A small meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been identified as being 4.56 billion years old, making it about 20 million years older than our planet. A University of Georgia geologist examined fragments of the space rock, which exploded in the atmosphere in June, creating a sonic boom heard across the region. The analysis suggests the meteorite originated from the breakup of a larger asteroid in the belt between Mars and Jupiter approximately 470 million years ago. This is the 27th meteorite ever recovered in Georgia.</p>

          <p>Four astronauts from NASA's Crew-10 mission have safely returned to Earth, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the California coast after nearly five months aboard the International Space Station. The crew, consisting of two American astronauts, one Japanese astronaut, and a Russian cosmonaut, completed a 17.5-hour journey in a SpaceX Dragon capsule. During their 148-day mission, they conducted over 200 scientific experiments, including studies on plant growth and cell behavior in microgravity. Their return marks the conclusion of NASA's 10th commercial crew rotation, successfully replacing a new crew that recently arrived at the station.</p>

          <p>Former Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea made an emotional return to Old Trafford, playing for Fiorentina in a pre-season friendly. De Gea, who left United two years ago after 545 appearances, received a standing ovation from the crowd, providing a farewell he was not previously afforded. The match ended in a 1-1 draw, with United winning the subsequent penalty shootout. The article reflects on the ongoing debate about the wisdom of his departure and his replacement, Andre Onana, as United continues to navigate a period of inconsistent performance since his exit.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korea removing some of its propaganda loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border, a potential sign of de-escalation. This action follows South Korea's own dismantling of its speakers, which broadcast anti-Pyongyang messages and K-pop music, as a goodwill gesture by the new liberal government. The two Koreas had been engaged in a Cold War-style psychological warfare campaign, with the North blasting irritating sounds in response. The move comes amid high tensions over North Korea's nuclear program and upcoming U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises, which Pyongyang views as a threat.</p>

          <p>Developers have spent $104 million to convert the abandoned 19th-century St. John's College campus in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood into a luxury apartment building named The Hartby. The project involved renovating the historic structure, which had been deteriorating for decades, into 205 apartments while preserving original details like exposed brick. Of the units, 62 are designated for affordable housing, with market-rate rents ranging from $3,130 to $6,950 per month. The developers secured a 99-year ground lease from the adjacent church, which will receive income from the property and regain ownership at the end of the lease.</p>

          <p>According to nutrition experts, certain foods can provide essential nutrients to support skin health and promote a youthful appearance. Foods rich in isoflavones, like edamame and tofu, may help reduce wrinkles and dryness. Sweet potatoes and tomatoes are packed with carotenoids and vitamin C, which protect against sun damage and promote collagen production. Other recommended foods include kefir for its probiotic benefits that improve skin hydration, pumpkin seeds for their zinc content that aids in wound healing, and salmon for its inflammation-reducing omega-3 fatty acids. Orange juice is also highlighted for its high vitamin C and hydration properties.</p>

          <p>William P. Bengen, the financial planner who created the well-known "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals, has updated his guidance based on more sophisticated research. His new analysis suggests that a more diversified portfolio, including small-company and international stocks, can support a higher initial withdrawal rate, now closer to 4.7%. Bengen notes that inflation is the greatest threat to retirees and suggests strategies like annual rebalancing and a rising equity glide path to enhance portfolio longevity. He now recommends a starting withdrawal rate of around 5.25% to 5.5% for today's retirees. (not investment advice)</p>
