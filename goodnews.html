        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the profound grief and complex emotions experienced by individuals who have lost loved ones to suicide, following the stories of two women who found solace and purpose through a support group in Berlin. It highlights the importance of shared experience in navigating feelings of guilt, pain, and isolation that often accompany such a loss. The piece also touches on global suicide statistics, noting that men are disproportionately affected, and discusses the "Papageno effect," where positive media portrayals of overcoming suicidal crises can have a protective influence. The narrative emphasizes that finding community is a crucial step toward healing.</p>

          <p>Emily Thornberry has pulled out of the race to become the deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party, narrowing the field of candidates to four. Having failed to secure the necessary 80 nominations from fellow Members of Parliament, Thornberry announced her withdrawal, leaving Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson as the clear frontrunner. The contest was triggered by the resignation of Angela Rayner over a tax issue. The outcome will be decided by party members in October, with the race highlighting different factions within the party as it navigates its first year in government.</p>

          <p>Cathie Wood, founder of Ark Invest, recently increased her firm's holdings in two biotechnology companies, CRISPR Therapeutics and Intellia Therapeutics, following dips in their stock prices. Both companies specialize in CRISPR gene-editing technology, a field with high growth potential for developing treatments for genetic diseases. CRISPR Therapeutics already has an approved treatment, Casgevy, while Intellia is advancing its late-stage candidate for a rare genetic disorder. The article notes that Wall Street analysts have optimistic forecasts for both stocks, aligning with Wood's strategy of investing in innovative but volatile technology for the long term.

          <p>Germany has experienced a notable drop in the number of asylum-seekers receiving welfare benefits, with figures falling by about 10% from late 2023 to late 2024. This decline coincides with a decrease in overall asylum applications, placing Germany third in the EU for new applications, behind France and Spain, for the first time in over a decade. The data indicates a shift in migration patterns within Europe.

          <p>A Morgan Stanley report indicates that interest from U.S. investors in the Chinese stock market has reached its highest level in five years, with over 90% of surveyed investors expressing a willingness to increase their exposure. This renewed interest is attributed to China's leadership in sectors like robotics and biotech, efforts to stabilize its economy, and a desire for diversification away from U.S. assets. According to the bank, the return of U.S. capital to China is just beginning, with potential for more significant inflows as investors re-engage with the market after a multi-year retreat.

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) Rocket Force has banned 74 bid evaluation experts and 116 suppliers as part of a significant anti-corruption investigation. The bans, announced on the military's procurement network, strip some entities of their qualifications to bid on projects across the entire PLA. This crackdown affects a critical branch of the military responsible for China's strategic nuclear missiles. The move is part of President Xi Jinping's broader campaign to enforce discipline and root out corruption within the armed forces, targeting violations dating back as far as 2016.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers completed a series sweep against the Colorado Rockies with a 9-0 victory, extending their lead in the National League West to three games. Mookie Betts led the offense with a four-hit, five-RBI performance, including a grand slam, while pitcher Blake Snell delivered six scoreless innings with 11 strikeouts. However, the win was tempered by a late setback, as starting catcher Will Smith was scratched from the lineup just before the game due to swelling in his injured right hand. The team also welcomed utilityman Tommy Edman back from the injured list.</p>

          <p>In response to an industry-wide slowdown, high-end luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton and Prada are diversifying their product lines with more accessible items like cosmetics and accessories. By launching products like $160 lipsticks and expensive bag charms, these companies aim to engage a broader range of aspirational consumers without devaluing their core high-ticket offerings. This strategy, known as "treatonomics," allows brands to attract younger customers who may develop brand loyalty over time. The move reflects a careful balancing act between broadening appeal and maintaining the exclusivity that defines the luxury market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stock markets around the world, including the S&P 500 in the U.S. and Japan's Nikkei 225, have been reaching new record highs. This global rally is fueled by growing investor confidence due to easing inflation pressures, resilient corporate earnings, and widespread expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon begin cutting interest rates. A surprisingly soft U.S. producer price index report further bolstered this sentiment. Analysts note that "animal spirits are soaring" as the economic outlook appears more favorable, though some caution that the impact of U.S. tariffs could temper performance in the coming months.

          <p>China has invested nearly 450 billion yuan (US$63.2 billion) in a five-year mineral exploration program, resulting in significant discoveries of oil, gas, and critical minerals like lithium and copper. Officials reported the discovery of over 500 large and medium-sized deposits since 2021, including 10 large oilfields. This initiative is part of China's broader strategy to enhance its energy security, dominate critical resource supply chains, and reduce its dependence on foreign imports. The breakthroughs are crucial for supporting the country's economic development and its booming high-tech industries amid global geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry met with his father, King Charles, for a private tea at Clarence House in London, their first face-to-face meeting in over a year and a half. The 50-minute reunion is being viewed as a small but potentially significant step toward healing the public rift within the royal family. In recent months, Prince Harry has expressed a desire for reconciliation, and the quiet coordination of this meeting suggests a mutual willingness to communicate. While a full family reconciliation, particularly with his brother Prince William, appears distant, this meeting is seen as a positive development.</p>

          <h2>Report Suggests San Francisco Housing Costs Have Returned to a 'Normal' Ratio with Incomes</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis by real estate company Redfin claims that housing costs in San Francisco have returned to "normal" levels relative to local incomes, reaching an equilibrium last seen in July 2018. This is attributed to slowing home-price growth combined with rapidly rising wages in the tech sector. However, the report clarifies that "normal" for San Francisco does not mean affordable, as the mortgage-to-income ratio remains significantly higher than the national average. The analysis focuses on homebuyers and does not reflect the reality for renters, who are facing spiking costs driven by the local AI boom. (not investment advice)</p>
