          <p>Cincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval is facing two Republican challengers, Cory Bowman (half-brother of Vice President JD Vance) and Brian Frank, in the city's nonpartisan primary. The top two vote-getters will advance to the November general election. Bowman, an evangelical pastor and coffee shop owner, says he wants to improve Cincinnati and was inspired by his brother's inauguration, while Pureval, a former special assistant U.S. attorney, is seeking reelection after winning in 2021 with nearly 66% of the vote. Voters will also decide on State Issue 2, which seeks to reauthorize $2.5 billion for infrastructure projects.</p>

          <p>Despite the closure of a trade loophole and new tariffs on Chinese goods, e-commerce experts believe Temu and Shein will remain competitive in the U.S. market. The de minimis rule, which exempted imports under $800 from tariffs, has closed for shipments from China, exposing Temu and Shein to duties as high as 120%. The companies are expected to onboard more American sellers and utilize local warehouses to mitigate the impact of tariffs, maintaining competitive pricing. While prices may increase, experts suggest Temu and Shein's agile supply chains and existing price advantages will allow them to compete effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An ongoing purge of top military officials in China, including leaders of the Rocket Force and Gen. He Weidong, is raising questions about President Xi Jinping's plan to prepare for a potential invasion of Taiwan by 2027. This internal turmoil, potentially stemming from corruption or ideological differences, may weaken China's military readiness and Xi's appetite for war. The instability within the People's Liberation Army could offer Taiwan and the United States more time to strengthen their defenses, despite China's continued military exercises near Taiwan. Ultimately, Xi may be reluctant to risk a military failure with a scandal-plagued army.</p>

          <p>The European Union plans to present a roadmap for phasing out all Russian gas deliveries by 2027, aiming to end its reliance on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. While there is broad consensus on ending deliveries, some member states like Hungary and Slovakia have refused to sanction imports, hindering a unanimous decision. The European Commission is exploring ways for companies to withdraw from existing contracts, but legal experts warn of potential penalties. Currently, the EU imports approximately 19% of its gas from Russia, a significant decrease from 40% in 2022.</p>
