          <p>Intel's stock saw its best day since October 1987, surging nearly 23% after Nvidia announced a $5 billion investment into the company. The strategic partnership aims to co-develop data center and PC chips, combining Nvidia's AI computing stack with Intel's x86 CPUs. This collaboration follows recent major investments from both SoftBank and the U.S. government, providing a significant boost to Intel's ongoing turnaround efforts. The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, will see Intel build central processing units for Nvidia's advanced AI platforms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's state visit to the UK was marked by elaborate ceremony, which the U.S. President appeared to genuinely enjoy, particularly the royal reception at Windsor Castle. While the trip successfully demonstrated a warm personal relationship between Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, it seems to have had little impact on U.S. policy regarding trade or international affairs. According to a BBC analysis, Starmer has managed to navigate disagreements on issues like Palestinian statehood without causing a diplomatic rift. The visit appears to have earned the UK the ability to disagree with Trump respectfully without facing punitive measures.</p>

          <p>Meta's Chief Product Officer, Chris Cox, declared that smart glasses represent the future of computing, envisioning devices that respond to voice, gestures, and sight. The statement came as the company unveiled its new $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which feature an in-lens display controlled by a neural wristband. These new glasses allow users to record video, send messages, and watch content, an upgrade from previous audio-only models. The move comes as Meta faces growing competition in the smart glasses market from companies like Google, Snap, and reportedly Apple.</p>

The company projects its annual recurring revenue (ARR) will reach $10 billion by fiscal year 2031 and double to $20 billion by 2036. Executives also forecasted significant expansion in operating and free cash flow margins over the next decade. This growth is partly driven by the increasing need for security in the age of AI, with CrowdStrike recently acquiring AI security platform Pangea to capitalize on this trend.

          <p>Paul Thomas Anderson's new film, "One Battle After Another," is described as an electrifying and thoughtful blockbuster that directly engages with contemporary American political anxieties. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a former paramilitary revolutionary forced out of hiding, the movie is a departure from Anderson's typically historical settings. The review praises the film for its urgent tone, thrilling action sequences, and powerful performances from DiCaprio, Sean Penn, and newcomer Chase Infiniti. It successfully blends high-stakes genre storytelling with commentary on political violence and government overreach, creating a visceral and emotionally investing experience.</p>

          <p>Transportation ministers from Germany's 16 federal states have unanimously agreed to raise the price of the popular "Deutschlandticket" to €63 per month, starting in January 2026.

While some officials welcomed the compromise that ensures the program's continuation, mobility associations criticized the move.

Witness footage of the incident showed an agent forcefully shoving the defendant but did not capture the alleged assault. The verdict represents a significant setback for federal prosecutors who have been aggressively pursuing cases against individuals involved in protests against immigration enforcement actions in the region.</p>

          <p>Following the recent Federal Reserve interest rate cut, the monthly cost for a new $50,000 home equity loan has seen a modest decrease. Currently, a 10-year loan at an average rate of 8.43% would cost approximately $618 per month, while a 15-year loan at 8.31% would be around $487 per month. These costs are slightly lower than they were earlier in the year and in late 2024, offering potential savings for homeowners tapping into record-high equity levels.

Tactics range from outspoken comments to projecting quiet confidence in the tense call room environment before a race. While some athletes use these methods to address their own insecurities, others see it as a way to gain a crucial mental edge when physical differences are minimal.</p>

          <p>Southern California is experiencing its first significant rainfall in months as moisture from a former tropical storm moves through the region, prompting flood watches in several areas. While the rain provides a temporary reprieve from dry conditions, meteorologists say it is unlikely to be enough to pull the region out of severe drought or substantially reduce the risk of a dangerous wildfire season. Fire officials typically require two to four inches of rain to consider the fire threat diminished, a total this storm is not expected to deliver. The rain may, however, slightly slow the start of the most dangerous part of fire season.</p>

The administration had attempted to expel the children over Labor Day weekend, claiming it was reuniting them with their families at the families' request. However, Judge Timothy Kelly found no evidence that any parents had sought their children's return, citing a Guatemalan government report that contradicted the administration's claims. The ruling protects minors who have pending immigration cases and are entitled to due process under U.S. law.</p>
