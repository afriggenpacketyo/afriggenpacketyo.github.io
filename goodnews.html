          <p>New figures from the UK's Department for Education reveal a strong correlation between student absences in the first week of school and persistent absenteeism throughout the academic year. Over half of the pupils who missed some school in the first week of September 2024 went on to be "persistently absent," compared to only 14% of those with perfect attendance initially. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging schools and parents to prioritize attendance from day one to combat what she calls a "critically high" absence level that jeopardizes children's futures. The data highlights ongoing challenges in post-pandemic school attendance.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa will not run for reelection in 2026, according to a senior GOP official familiar with her decision. First elected in 2014, Ernst was the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate and has held several leadership positions within her party. Her departure will create an open seat, with Representative Ashley Hinson reportedly planning to run for the Republican nomination. Democrats, who have not won a Senate race in Iowa since 2008, are also lining up several candidates for what is expected to be a competitive race.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that Indonesian President-elect Prabowo Subianto is positioned to introduce a new, pragmatic approach to international relations. As a major economic power not aligned with a single ideological bloc, Indonesia can act as a bridge between competing global powers. This unique position allows it to champion a "constructive pragmatism" that prioritizes cooperation and practical solutions over confrontation. The article argues this philosophy could serve as a valuable road map for a currently dysfunctional international system that is often paralyzed by competing national interests.</p>

          <p>Director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of "Frankenstein" has debuted at the Venice Film Festival, starring Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as his creation. Del Toro described the project as a "religion" for him, fulfilling a lifelong dream to bring his vision of the classic story to the screen on an epic scale. The film, which runs for 149 minutes, is split into three parts and explores the narrative from the perspectives of both the creator and the creature. Early reviews are mixed, with some praising its artistry and scope while others find it lacks emotional voltage.</p>

          <p>As the 80th anniversary of the end of the Sino-Japanese war approaches, some are looking to the shared history of US-China cooperation during World War II as a potential model for improving current bilateral ties. The article highlights forgotten stories of collaboration, such as American airmen who were protected by Chinese villagers after being shot down. This historical alliance is being presented as a foundation for building better relations from the ground up. The piece is part of a series examining how the post-war period continues to shape China's role in the world today.</p>

          <p>Tennis player Jelena Ostapenko has issued a public apology for comments made to her opponent, Taylor Townsend, following their second-round match at the US Open. After the match, Townsend revealed that Ostapenko had accused her of having "no education" and "no class" during their handshake. In an Instagram post, Ostapenko explained that English is not her first language and she was referring to what she perceived as poor tennis etiquette, not making a broader statement. The apology came after the incident drew criticism from other players and sparked a wider discussion about sportsmanship.</p>

          <p>The town council of Machynlleth, Powys, has denied a proposal to silence its 150-year-old town clock between midnight and 7 a.m. The request came from the owner of the Wynnstay Hotel, who cited regular complaints from guests about the clock chiming every fifteen minutes throughout the night. However, councillors rejected the plan, arguing that the chimes are an integral part of the town's character. The decision highlights a local conflict between preserving historical tradition and accommodating modern business and tourism needs in the Welsh town.</p>

          <p>A stoppage-time penalty converted by Bruno Fernandes gave Manchester United a dramatic 3-2 victory over Burnley, but the performance highlighted persistent issues for the team. The article notes that manager Ruben Amorim faces significant challenges, particularly with his goalkeepers, as Altay Bayindir made a critical error leading to Burnley's second goal. This follows similar mistakes in previous matches, raising questions about the team's stability in a key position. While the win provided a moment of celebration, it failed to mask the underlying defensive frailties and the pressure on the club.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority by imposing widespread "reciprocal tariffs" on numerous countries, deeming most of them illegal. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not grant the president the power to implement such broad levies, stating that authority rests with Congress. This decision jeopardizes tariffs affecting a significant portion of U.S. goods imports, though sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum remain unaffected. The Trump administration has announced its intention to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article synthesizes expert advice on appropriate screen time for children, emphasizing that guidelines are linked to developmental stages. For toddlers, the consensus is "screen-free until age three," as this period is critical for exploring the physical world and developing self-controlled attention. For kindergarten-aged children, limited and supervised screen time is recommended to avoid stunting imagination and social skills learned through play. As children get older, the focus shifts from time limits to the quality of content and maintaining open communication, with experts warning that excessive screen use can negatively impact language skills, motor development, and social behavior.</p>

          <p>A group of residents in Newtown, Powys, took matters into their own hands to save thousands of fish stranded in a drying brook. After a summer of prolonged dry weather caused water levels in Aberhafesp Brook to disappear, local man Dave Lister discovered the fish "gasping for air" in a shrinking puddle. After reporting the issue to Natural Resources Wales (NRW) and receiving no immediate response, he and his friends organized a rescue effort, moving the fish to a nearby river. NRW later stated that moving fish during such conditions can be stressful for them, but the residents felt they had no other choice.</p>
