        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO allies have agreed to more than double their defense spending target, moving from 2% to 5% of gross domestic product by 2035, marking a significant shift in the alliance's approach to security. This decision comes amid rising tensions in the Middle East and the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, highlighting the need for increased investment in defense capabilities. The agreement includes a requirement for member states to allocate at least 3.5% of GDP to core defense spending, with the remainder directed toward security and defense-related critical infrastructure. This move reflects a unified stance against security threats and reinforces NATO's commitment to collective defense, as enshrined in Article 5. The United States has been pushing for increased burden sharing across the alliance for years, and this marks a critical point in the alliance's future stability and readiness.</p>

          <p>Two young bears named Mish and Lucy escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon in the U.K. and indulged in a week's worth of honey before falling asleep. The bears, both four years old, were continuously monitored by park staff who followed safety protocols to encourage them back into their enclosure without intervention. The park confirmed that the bears posed no threat to the public, though visitors were escorted to a secure building as a precaution. An investigation is underway to determine how the bears escaped, with the park citing an "operational error." The bears were rescued in 2021 after being abandoned as cubs and deemed unable to survive in the wild.</p>

Louisiana secured the deal by offering a 20-year sales tax exemption for data centers built before 2029, a key requirement for Meta.

          <p>A fragile ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding, bringing cautious optimism but also uncertainty as Iran threatens to accelerate its nuclear program. The 12-day conflict resulted in casualties on both sides, and the ceasefire was brokered by the Trump administration. Despite claims of significant damage to Iran's nuclear capabilities, initial intelligence assessments suggest the program was only set back by months. Iran's parliament voted to fast-track a proposal to halt cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), raising concerns about future monitoring of its nuclear activities. The ceasefire has allowed for the lifting of restrictions in Israel, but the situation remains tense.</p>

          <p>Wraps, once a popular food trend in the 1990s, are making a comeback as diet culture shifts and the focus on low-calorie, high-protein options returns. McDonald's is reintroducing its chicken Snack Wrap, and other fast-food chains are launching new wrap options. The trend aligns with a renewed emphasis on thinness and wellness, echoing the body anxieties of the past. The return of wraps reflects broader changes in how society views food and body image, highlighting a cyclical nature of dietary trends.</p>

          <p>An independent commission has been launched in the UK to tackle community divisions following last summer's riots, which were triggered by false information spread on social media after the Southport stabbings. The commission, led by Sir Sajid Javid and Jon Cruddas, aims to develop evidence-based recommendations for a stronger and more connected sense of community across the UK. Members include Caroline Lucas, Sir Andy Street, and Dame Sara Khan. The taskforce will examine the underlying issues that contributed to the unrest, which targeted mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers.</p>

          <h2>British Pound Hits Multi-Year High Amid Dollar Weakness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-25 07:46:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British pound is currently trading at its highest level in more than three years, but analysts have differing views on whether it will continue to rise. The pound's recent strength is largely attributed to underlying dollar weakness rather than faith in sterling itself. The pound has surged 8.7% against the dollar this year, but it has depreciated against the euro. Some analysts predict further dollar weakening and a rise in the pound, while others believe the macroeconomic backdrop does not justify its recent performance.</p>

          <p>German police conducted searches of over 65 properties and questioned numerous suspects in an operation targeting online hate speech. The Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) supervised the operation, which is connected to more than 140 investigations. Approximately two-thirds of the online statements under investigation originated from radical right-wing sources. The individuals being investigated are accused of inciting hatred, insulting politicians, and using symbols of terrorist groups or organizations considered unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>Drones are being used to address the trash crisis on Mount Everest, where an estimated 50 metric tons of waste remain. Airlift Technology, a Nepal-based company, is deploying drones to deliver supplies up the mountain and remove waste on the return trip. After successful trials in 2024, the company estimates it removed over one metric ton of trash between March and May 2025. The drones can quickly transport up to 33 lbs of supplies, such as oxygen bottles, to base camp, helping sherpas avoid carrying heavy equipment through dangerous areas.</p>
