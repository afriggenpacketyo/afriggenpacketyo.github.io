          <p>Physicists are recording rocket launches, especially by SpaceX, to learn about the acoustics of spaceflight and mitigate noise pollution. With increasing frequency of launches, scientists like Kent Gee are studying sonic booms and their impact on communities. SpaceX's Starship, the largest rocket ever, is expected to be the loudest, prompting the need to address potential disruptions. Dr. Gee's team is analyzing the unique sounds generated during launches, including the three-part sonic boom of Falcon 9 boosters, to understand how sound waves travel and affect the environment.</p>
