          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled against the Trump administration's attempt to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan migrants under the Alien Enemies Act, citing insufficient time for the migrants to challenge their deportations. The court's decision emphasizes the importance of due process and adequate notice for individuals facing removal. While the court did not rule on the lawfulness of the Alien Enemies Act itself, it remanded the case to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to determine the appropriate level of due process required.</p>

The test measures proteins in the blood linked to amyloid plaques in the brain and is intended for adults aged 55 and older presenting cognitive decline in specialized care settings. The FDA clearance follows concerns about previous blood tests for Alzheimer's being sold without such approval. The FDA's action was challenged in court, but the agency says this test offers more reliable and accessible early diagnosis.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court upheld its block on President Trump's deportations of Venezuelan migrants under the Alien Enemies Act, citing a lack of adequate due process. The justices agreed that providing roughly 24 hours' notice before removal, without information on contesting the action, did not meet legal standards. The court clarified that the administration could pursue deportations under other immigration laws. The ACLU had argued that migrants were being readied for imminent removal without proper judicial review.</p>
