          <p>GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik believes President Trump's executive orders on nuclear power could enable the deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs) in the US by late 2030.  Trump's order mandates faster approval processes for new nuclear plants.  Strazik anticipates approvals for SMR construction by 2027, potentially leading to deployment in 2030 or 2031.  The development highlights the potential for SMRs to become a significant part of the US energy sector.</p>

          <p>Toyota aims to significantly increase its sales of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) in the coming years, reaching approximately 20% of its U.S. sales by 2030.  The company highlights the PHEV powertrain's advantages and plans to increase its all-electric driving range.  This strategy comes amidst uncertainty surrounding all-electric vehicle adoption and regulations.  Toyota's continued investment in both PHEVs and EVs demonstrates its commitment to electrified vehicles.</p>
