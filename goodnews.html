        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Labour government has significantly altered its welfare reform plans, reversing a key proposal to cut Personal Independence Payments (Pip) for existing disability benefit recipients. The original plan aimed to save ¬£5 billion annually by 2029-30, but the U-turn means changes will now only apply to new claimants starting in November 2026. This reversal is estimated to cost between ¬£2.5 billion and ¬£3 billion, more than halving the anticipated savings from the welfare bill. The decision raises questions about fiscal stability but provides relief to hundreds of thousands of current claimants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a massive recall of over 1.2 million power banks due to fire risks, Chinese electronics firm Anker Innovations has announced a strategic partnership with Amperex Technology Limited (ATL), a known supplier for Apple. Anker will initially purchase 45 million lithium-ion batteries from ATL to secure its supply chain and rebuild consumer trust. The recall was attributed to defective battery cells from a previous supplier, which Anker has since ceased business with. This move represents a significant pivot for Anker as it aims to ensure the safety and quality of its products.</p>

          <p>Tokyo's Nikkei Stock Average closed above the 40,000 mark for the first time since January, rising for a fourth consecutive day. The 1.43% gain was fueled by investor optimism following the U.S. administration's indication that it might extend a pause on certain tariffs, easing trade tensions. Additional support for the market came from a de-escalation of conflicts in the Middle East, which encouraged investors to take on more risk. Despite the strong performance, some analysts caution that the market's footing remains unstable and may not reflect underlying economic fundamentals. (not investment advice)</p>

Walking barefoot in public areas, wearing hotel robes in the lobby, and hogging pool chairs are among the top complaints. In response, some hotels are using subtle cues, such as staff speaking in quieter voices, or providing etiquette guidelines in pre-arrival emails to encourage more mindful behavior. While some luxury establishments are relaxing traditional dress codes to make guests feel at home, others are more concerned with disruptive outbursts and are training staff in de-escalation techniques.</p>

With members aiming to raise defense expenditure to 5% of GDP by 2035, companies in the space and defense industries are poised to benefit.

This new legal body, likely to be based in The Hague, aims to hold high-ranking Russian leaders, potentially including President Vladimir Putin, accountable for the decision to invade Ukraine. The tribunal is designed to close a legal loophole, as the International Criminal Court (ICC) cannot directly prosecute Russia's leadership for aggression because Moscow is not a signatory to its statute. This represents a significant step in the international effort to ensure accountability for the war.</p>

          <p>For the first time in its history, the Wimbledon women's singles draw will feature three British players aged 17 or under, signaling a promising new wave of talent. Mika Stojsavljevic, 16, who won the US Open girls' title, is joined by fellow 16-year-old Hannah Klugman, a recent French Open girls' finalist, and 17-year-old Mimi Xu. All three have been awarded main-draw wildcards, providing them with a major opportunity to compete at the senior level. Their collective emergence is seen as a highly positive sign for the future of British women's tennis, demonstrating a pack of peers pushing each other forward.</p>
