          <p>The mayor of Tulsa has unveiled a $105 million reparations package aimed at addressing the lasting impact of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. This plan represents the first large-scale effort to provide reparations for the atrocity, which decimated the Greenwood District, also known as "Black Wall Street." The funds will be raised privately and allocated to housing assistance, scholarships, and economic development initiatives. The goal is to revitalize the affected community and provide restorative justice for the descendants of the victims. This marks a significant step towards acknowledging and rectifying the historical injustices suffered by the Black community in Tulsa.</p>

          <p>Conservative historian Karol Nawrocki has been elected as Poland's new president, narrowly defeating Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski. Nawrocki secured 50.9% of the votes, marking a significant turnaround from initial exit polls that favored Trzaskowski. As president, Nawrocki is expected to use his veto power to block Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda, supporting traditional Catholic and family values while advocating for Polish sovereignty within the EU. Both candidates support continued assistance for Ukraine, but differ on their approach to the EU, with Trzaskowski favoring closer ties with Germany and France. The result is likely to re-energize the national conservative Law and Justice (PiS) opposition.</p>

          <p>Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson (Soul Patts) and its affiliate Brickworks have announced a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger, causing their shares to surge. The new company, listed in Sydney, will acquire all outstanding shares of both Soul Patts and Brickworks, with holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit totaling A$13.1 billion. The merger aims to simplify the structure, add scale, and create a more investable company by unwinding a 56-year mutual ownership designed to fend off hostile takeovers. The investors clearly approve of this move as it simplifies the odd structure that saw both companies trade at a discount to their peers.</p>

The MLSPA said the players have sought to meet with MLS to make changes, but the league has failed to bring forward a reasonable proposal.</p>

          <p>Students are being warned about potential subject "cold spots" as universities cut courses due to financial challenges, with a government review underway to address higher education funding. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is supporting collaboration where possible to mitigate the impact of course closures. A Universities UK report suggests greater collaboration could help institutions cut costs and improve efficiency. There is a risk of limited opportunities for students to study desired subjects in their home cities, which would require universities to look at which subjects they recruit the fewest students for and come to an agreement to prevent these cold spots.</p>

This decision contrasts with other Jan. 6 defendants who sought and utilized their pardon certificates.</p>
