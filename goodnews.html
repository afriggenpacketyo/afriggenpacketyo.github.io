          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense has granted significant contract awards for artificial intelligence development to Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and Elon Musk's xAI. The funding, potentially reaching $200 million, is managed by the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office to accelerate the adoption of advanced AI for national security challenges. This initiative aims to develop AI agents across various mission areas, enhancing the department's strategic advantage. The announcement coincides with xAI launching Grok for Government, a new suite of AI products for U.S. government customers.</p>

          <h2>Guidance on Choosing Between Federal and Private Student Loans for the Upcoming Academic Year</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 13:33:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the academic year approaches, students face the critical decision between federal and private student loans. Federal loans are generally recommended as the first option due to their fixed interest rates and robust borrower protections, such as income-driven repayment plans and potential forgiveness. However, they have strict borrowing limits that may not cover the full cost of attendance. Private loans can fill this funding gap but often require a strong credit history or a co-signer and lack the flexible repayment options of their federal counterparts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis of Recent Rulings on AI Training and Copyright Law Reveals Unresolved Legal Questions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 13:19:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two recent judicial rulings in cases against AI firms Anthropic and Meta have provided initial, yet conflicting, guidance on the use of copyrighted material for training AI models. While both judges deemed the training process itself to be "fair use," they diverged on key issues, such as whether AI-generated content unfairly competes with human authors. The rulings also left the companies vulnerable to litigation over their methods of acquiring training data, including the use of pirated book libraries. This article argues that these decisions are merely the first step in a complex legal debate that will define the future of generative AI and creative professions.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, has launched a preview of Kiro, a new artificial intelligence program designed to assist developers in writing code. The tool represents a deeper move into "vibe coding," where developers use natural language to direct AI in creating software with minimal human intervention. Kiro aims to streamline the development process by helping define requirements, design systems, and create task lists before code is written. This launch places Amazon in direct competition with similar AI coding assistants from Google and Microsoft.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has pushed back against a recent Morgan Stanley downgrade of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, suggesting the subsequent dip in stock price could be a buying opportunity. Morgan Stanley shifted its rating to equal weight, arguing that after a 50% rise since April, the stock's high valuation fully prices in near-term growth expectations. Cramer remains optimistic, anticipating a strong second half as the company moves past the financial impact of a major IT outage last year and converts promotional client packages to full-price contracts.

          <p>Thirty-five years after the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), prospective parents with disabilities continue to face discriminatory barriers in the adoption process. This article highlights the story of Kelly and Larry Peterson, a couple with spina bifida, who were outright rejected by an adoption agency due to their disability. They eventually succeeded in adopting a girl who also has spina bifida, believing their shared experience makes them uniquely qualified to care for her. Advocates emphasize that adults with disabilities should not be discounted and that resources can be provided to support them.</p>

          <p>Ultium Cells, a joint venture between General Motors and LG Energy Solution, is upgrading its plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, to produce lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells. This type of battery is significantly cheaper to manufacture because it does not require expensive minerals like cobalt and nickel, which are used in conventional lithium-ion batteries. GM stated this move will help scale production of lower-cost EV technologies in the U.S. and diversify its electric vehicle portfolio. Commercial production of the new LFP cells is expected to begin by late 2027.</p>

          <p>Calvin Duncan, who was wrongfully convicted of murder in 1982 and sentenced to life, has graduated from law school after spending over 28 years in prison. While incarcerated, Duncan became a "jailhouse lawyer," studying law to help himself and hundreds of other inmates navigate the legal system. With the help of the Innocence Project, he proved that detectives had lied to the jury and was released in 2011, later being fully exonerated. Now 60, he has earned his law degree and founded the Light of Justice program to help currently incarcerated people access the courts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. housing market is showing clear signs of cooling, as a combination of high mortgage rates, rising inventory, and falling demand puts downward pressure on prices. According to mortgage technology firm ICE, nearly one-third of the 100 largest housing markets are now seeing annual price declines of at least one percent from their recent peaks. National home price growth slowed to just 1.3% in June, its slowest rate in two years. While prices are still gaining in the Northeast and Midwest, they are softening significantly in the South and West. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new federal spending bill is poised to significantly boost the private jet market by reinstating a key tax provision. The law brings back 100% bonus depreciation, allowing businesses to immediately write off the full purchase price of a new or used jet in the first year of ownership. Aviation brokers report a surge in interest from clients who were waiting for the bill to pass. This tax incentive arrives as the jet market was beginning to cool from its post-pandemic highs, and it is expected to drive a spike in sales, particularly toward the end of the year.
