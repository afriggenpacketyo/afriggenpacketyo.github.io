        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republicans are encountering challenges in passing President Trump's tax bill, officially known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, due to disagreements over spending cuts, Medicaid, and state and local tax deductions (SALT). Some right-wing lawmakers want deeper cuts to reduce the national debt, while others object to Medicaid cuts, fearing they would harm lower-income constituents. Lawmakers from high-tax states are also pushing for a higher SALT deduction cap, with House Republican leaders seeking a compromise to raise the cap to $40,000 for individuals and $80,000 for joint filers, but it is still not enough. The bill has passed the budget committee, but still needs to pass the House and Senate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Morrisons, a major UK supermarket chain, anticipates that the recent UK-EU trade deal will alleviate pressure on food prices by removing trade barriers and simplifying import processes. The deal sets out post-Brexit relations on areas including fishing rights, farming exports, trade, travel, and defense. Other business groups, including the CBI and BCC, have also praised the agreement as a positive step forward, but emphasize the need for further improvements to strengthen UK-EU business relations. While retailers hope to pass on cost savings to consumers, price reductions will depend on suppliers also reducing their prices, which is not guaranteed.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and the European Union have announced a new agreement aimed at resetting post-Brexit relations by strengthening trade and defense ties.

The agreement also sets the stage for greater British involvement in European defense efforts, including a loan program for joint procurement and investment.

The agreements have been described as a "reset" and championed by U.K. Prime Minister Kier Starmer and EU leader, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Trump's hardline push for increased NATO defense spending and his stance on Ukraine aid have pushed Western allies to strengthen relations.</p>

          <p>Annuities are financial products designed to help individuals grow their retirement income and protect against outliving their savings, but come with both advantages and disadvantages. The pros of annuities include guaranteed lifetime income, market volatility protection, tax-deferred growth, no contribution limits, and customizable options. The cons include fees, limited access to money, early withdrawal penalties, complex terms, and inflation risk for fixed annuities. Experts advise balancing investments, researching the company's strength, creating a financial plan, and reviewing current economic conditions before buying an annuity. (not investment advice)</p>

Davies noted that Biden's Gleason score of 9 indicates a high-risk cancer, but treatment options like hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy can extend his life.

          <p>Sleep specialists recommend rethinking eating habits to improve sleep quality, suggesting that nutrients, fats, sugar, and fiber all play a role. Eating foods rich in tryptophan, such as almonds, salmon, and yogurt, can help the brain produce serotonin and melatonin, which are important for sleep. Swapping sugary and processed foods for fruits and vegetables can also improve sleep, as fruits and veggies are good sources of fiber and sleep-supporting nutrients. Avoiding caffeine in the late afternoon and evening and refraining from drinking alcohol or eating heavy meals right before bed are also recommended.</p>
