          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that a potential agreement between Israel and Hamas to release hostages is the closest the parties have come to a resolution. While expressing optimism, he cautioned that significant obstacles and pitfalls remain in the negotiations, which are set to continue in Egypt. The U.S. is pushing for a swift agreement, particularly on the initial phase of returning the hostages, to build momentum for a broader peace plan. The American diplomatic team, including special envoy Steve Witkoff, is actively participating in the talks.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission is considering a proposal, prompted by President Trump, to allow public companies to file financial reports semi-annually instead of quarterly. Proponents argue this would save companies significant time and money, allowing managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term earnings pressure. However, the move could substantially reduce revenue for the "Big Four" accounting firms that audit these reports, potentially impacting their business models and hiring practices. The debate centers on balancing corporate efficiency with investor transparency and market stability. (not investment advice)</p>

Insufficient sleep can impair a child's cognitive development, emotional regulation, and ability to learn.

          <p>Recently passed tax legislation championed by President Trump introduces several key benefits aimed at supporting small and Main Street businesses. The new law allows for 100% deductions on certain business purchases, a significant increase from previous limits, and restores the ability to immediately deduct all domestic research and development costs. Additional provisions include a more generous calculation for deducting business loan interest and the permanent implementation of the 20% Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction. These measures are designed to reduce the tax burden and encourage reinvestment and growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 190th Oktoberfest in Munich has concluded after drawing 6.5 million visitors who consumed an equal number of liters of beer over two weeks. Festival organizers described the event as a "roller-coaster," marked by a record-hot opening day, temporary closures due to overcrowding, and a significant disruption caused by a bomb scare. Despite these challenges, officials reported a positive outcome, highlighting the resilient and celebratory atmosphere that prevailed once the festival reopened. The event also saw around 4,500 lost items reported and a 12.4% reduction in garbage collected compared to the previous year.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed the frequent protests and death threats she has faced, particularly since the overturning of Roe v. Wade. She stated that she is not afraid and refuses to live in fear, viewing the threats as an attempt to intimidate that she will not reward. Barrett explained her ability to remain emotionally detached from the criticism, focusing on her analytical and originalist approach to law rather than public opinion. This mindset, she says, is essential for performing her duties on the court without being swayed by external pressures.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is engaged in a massive, nationwide search for suitable locations to build its next-generation "Stargate" data centers, which are essential for training increasingly powerful artificial intelligence models. Led by infrastructure head Keith Heyde, the company is evaluating sites based on access to immense amounts of power, scalability, and community support. This strategic push to own its physical infrastructure, backed by up to $100 billion from Nvidia, elevates compute capacity to a core pillar of the company, on par with model development. The move reflects a broader industry race to control the future of AI through proprietary supercomputing hubs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Across global crisis zones, from refugee camps in Bangladesh to war-torn Ukraine, children are demonstrating remarkable resilience by using play to cope with trauma and instability. They create toys from discarded materials, such as kites from aid parachutes in Gaza, and adapt games to reflect their harsh realities, like pretending to be soldiers. Child psychologists affirm that play is not a frivolous activity in these contexts but a vital lifeline that helps children manage stress, express emotions, and reclaim a sense of control. These activities, often rooted in local culture, also foster a sense of community and belonging.</p>

          <p>The fire department in Wiesbaden, Germany, responded to four separate emergency calls regarding suspected gas leaks, all of which were ultimately traced to the potent smell of durian fruit. The initial calls came from a shopping center, where the building's ventilation system had spread the fruit's distinctive odor from an Asian supermarket. Later that evening, residents in another building reported a gas smell in a staircase, which was also found to be caused by a neighbor who had brought home a durian. No actual gas leaks were detected in any of the incidents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent tax legislation is set to change the landscape for charitable giving, prompting financial experts to advise a multi-year planning approach. A key change beginning in 2026 is a new tax break for non-itemizers, which could make it beneficial to delay smaller year-end donations until then. Conversely, for some high-income earners, the value of the charitable deduction will be reduced starting in 2026 due to a new income floor and a cap on the benefit. This could incentivize accelerating larger donations into the current tax year, possibly through tools like donor-advised funds. (not investment advice)</p>

The operation, part of the country's 15th and largest Arctic expedition, utilized the Jiaolong manned submersible in coordination with uncrewed vehicles. During the mission, researchers collected hundreds of deep-sea samples and gathered extensive data on the region's biodiversity, hydrology, and sea ice conditions.

          <p>Elvira Alvarado, a 70-year-old Colombian marine biologist, is pioneering the use of in-vitro fertilization (IVF) to save the country's endangered coral reefs. Her team collects coral eggs and sperm during the brief annual spawning event, fertilizes them in a lab, and nurtures the hatchlings before transplanting them back to the ocean. This technique allows for the propagation of coral varieties that show more resistance to rising ocean temperatures and disease. Known as "the mother of Colombian corals," Alvarado is also mentoring a new generation of scientists to continue this vital ecosystem restoration work.</p>

They gain popularity because their visually stimulating nature is perfectly suited to capture attention on platforms like TikTok and Instagram. This shift represents how algorithmic social media, rather than traditional tastemakers, now dictates what becomes ubiquitous, often with little context or meaning.</p>

Critics had pointed out that the study's reported effects seemed implausible, rivaling those of prescription weight-loss drugs.
