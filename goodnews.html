          <p>Oprah Winfrey announced Wally Lamb's "The River Is Waiting" as her newest book club pick, marking the third time she has chosen one of Lamb's novels. The book tells the story of Corby Ledbetter, a stay-at-home dad who causes a tragedy and journeys through prison, exploring themes of guilt, redemption, and forgiveness. Winfrey was surprised that Lamb, known for his work with women in prison, wrote about a male character, and Lamb explained that he wanted to explore the differences between men and women. Lamb hopes readers will understand the possibility of escaping addiction through 12-step programs. The optimism score is not directly related to the summary.</p>

          <p>An op-ed argues that Wall Street should develop its own AI systems instead of relying on Big Tech's general-purpose AI, which lacks the necessary domain expertise for finance. Specialized AI, fine-tuned with real-world data and enhanced by synthetic data, is crucial for financial calculations, regulatory compliance, and navigating complex decision trees. Financial institutions should partner with fintechs that focus on specific use cases, rather than trying to build in-house solutions, to avoid getting trapped in a cycle of development and maintenance. The author suggests firms should focus on their unique strengths and let specialized fintechs handle the complementary heavy lifting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government announced a ¬£14.2 billion investment in the Sizewell C nuclear power plant, aiming to lower household energy bills and enhance energy security. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the project would create 10,000 jobs and reduce reliance on foreign energy sources, although the plant is not expected to generate power until the mid-2030s. Critics have raised concerns about the project's potential cost overruns and environmental impact, with some suggesting the total cost could double initial estimates. The funding only covers five years of the decade-long project, and private investment is still needed for building work to commence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament are scheduled to vote on decriminalizing abortion in England and Wales, where it is currently illegal under Victorian legislation but allowed under certain circumstances through the 1967 Abortion Act.

This move aims to protect women from investigation or imprisonment, while retaining the requirement for two doctors to sign off on the procedure in healthcare settings.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article compares debt forgiveness and debt consolidation as strategies for managing high credit card debt. Debt consolidation combines multiple debts into a single payment, potentially lowering interest rates without reducing the principal balance. Debt forgiveness involves negotiating with creditors to accept less than the full amount owed, which can significantly reduce the debt but also damages credit scores. The article provides a cost comparison of both strategies, highlighting the potential savings and credit implications, and suggests that debt consolidation is preferable for those who can manage monthly payments, while debt forgiveness may be necessary for unmanageable debt loads.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer denied that his government's reversal on winter fuel payments was due to political pressure, attributing it instead to an improved economy. The government will extend the payment, worth up to ¬£300 a year, to more pensioners with an annual income of ¬£35,000 or less. The initial decision to withdraw the payments from most pensioners was made to address a "broken" economy, but better-than-expected growth has allowed for the expanded eligibility.
