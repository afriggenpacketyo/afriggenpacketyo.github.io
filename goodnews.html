          <p>Shares for fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters surged after the company credited its marketing collaborations with celebrities Sydney Sweeney and Travis Kelce for driving strong sales. Despite a minor sales dip in the previous quarter, the company now projects low single-digit growth, citing an uptick in customer engagement following the viral ad campaigns. One campaign featuring Sweeney generated significant online debate but also led to her signature jeans selling out within a week, showcasing the high impact of the celebrity endorsements on the brand's performance.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova achieved a significant victory over Iga Swiatek in the US Open quarter-finals, attributing her success to a changed mindset following a difficult loss. Just 53 days after a crushing 6-0, 6-0 defeat to Swiatek in the Wimbledon final, Anisimova strategically rewatched the match to learn from her mistakes. She credits her ability to bounce back to a mental health break from the sport, which allowed her to approach the rematch with a positive and fearless attitude, leading to a 6-4, 6-3 win.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has voided the Trump administration's decision to freeze $2.2 billion in research grants to Harvard University, labeling the action an illegal and "ideologically-motivated assault." The ruling found that the administration unlawfully retaliated against Harvard for refusing to alter its academic and diversity programs, using concerns about antisemitism as a pretext. The freeze had halted numerous critical research projects, including studies on tuberculosis and support for veterans, and the White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision.</p>

This commitment includes helping to secure Ukraine's skies, seas, and land to deter future aggression. The statement of solidarity comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin, speaking from China, conveyed a defiant message that his military objectives would continue, though Western officials suggest Russia is under significant pressure.</p>

          <p>China is making significant strides in the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in the development of "agentic frameworks" used to build autonomous AI agents. Major tech companies like Tencent and ByteDance have recently open-sourced their platforms, positioning themselves as direct competitors to U.S. players such as OpenAI. These frameworks provide the tools to create AI agents capable of performing complex, multi-step tasks for users, signaling a key area of focus in the ongoing U.S.-China tech competition.</p>

          <p>An 18th-century painting looted by the Nazis during World War II, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Ghislandi, has been recovered by authorities in Argentina. The long-lost artwork was rediscovered after it appeared in an online real estate listing posted by the daughter of the Nazi officer accused of stealing it from a prominent Dutch-Jewish art collector. The recovery, prompted by an investigation by Dutch journalists, marks a significant moment for the heirs of the original owner, who have been seeking to reclaim their family's stolen art for decades.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled against the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan migrants. The court's decision stated that the current situation does not meet the law's criteria of an "invasion or predatory incursion" by an enemy nation. This ruling grants a preliminary injunction, blocking the administration from using this specific wartime statute to remove the migrants who brought the lawsuit, marking a significant legal setback for the policy.</p>

          <p>In Montana's Blackfoot Valley, ranchers are challenging the conventional, industrial food system by adopting regenerative ranching practices and forming a cooperative to sell their products directly to consumers. This approach focuses on improving soil health and ecosystem resilience by rotating cattle and allowing land to rest, which has been shown to increase grass production even in dry years. By processing and selling their beef locally, they aim to create a more sustainable and economically viable model for the future of agriculture.</p>
