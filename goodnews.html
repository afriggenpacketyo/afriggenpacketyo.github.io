          <p>Shipments of iPhones from India to the U.S. experienced a significant increase of 76% in April, contrasting with a 76% drop in shipments from China, as Apple adapts to Washington's tariffs. This shift reflects Apple's strategic investments in India's supply chains, which began during the COVID-19 pandemic, to mitigate the impact of trade tensions. However, analysts predict that this growth may plateau due to India's manufacturing capacity not expanding quickly enough to meet total U.S. demand, potentially facing further pushback from both Washington and Beijing regarding Apple's tariff mitigation strategies. Despite Trump's threats of tariffs on iPhones made outside the U.S., Apple CEO Tim Cook has reiterated plans to manufacture most iPhones sold in the U.S. in India (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Mary Earps, the England goalkeeper, has announced her retirement from international football just five weeks before Euro 2025, where England will defend their title. Earps, who is 32 years old, made 53 senior appearances for England over eight years and played a vital role in England's Euro 2022 victory and their journey to the 2023 Women's World Cup final. She recently lost her starting position to Hannah Hampton but was still wanted as part of the squad by England manager Sarina Wiegman. Earps expressed that this is the right time for her to step aside and allow the younger generation to thrive, while also expressing her support for the team in Euro 2025 and wishing them success.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is considering abolishing the two-child benefit cap, a policy that restricts most families from claiming means-tested benefits for third or additional children born after April 2017. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson acknowledged that the policy has pushed people into poverty, but also warned that removing the cap would be costly. A decision is expected in the autumn, coinciding with the publication of the government's child poverty strategy, which has been delayed until autumn, with Phillipson and Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall leading the Child Poverty Taskforce putting together the strategy. Phillipson emphasized that a Labour government would never have introduced the cap, signaling a potential shift in priorities and choices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Due to Donald Trump's anti-"woke" policies, several U.S. corporations have reduced or eliminated their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, leading European companies to face similar pressures. Some German companies, including Volkswagen and Deutsche Telekom, are scaling back or ending their DEI initiatives in the U.S., while SAP has abandoned gender quotas in Germany. Despite this trend, a survey by Germany's Charta der Vielfalt indicates that many German companies remain committed to DEI, with 90% intending to continue their programs unchanged. Some US companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Costco have also reaffirmed their support for DEI, despite the backlash, with about 75% of US companies having not changed their diversity efforts.</p>

          <p>Seven & i Holdings Co., the Japanese operator of the Seven-Eleven convenience store chain, has appointed Stephen Hayes Dacus as its first foreign CEO, who is committed to growth over the next decade. This decision comes as the retail giant aims to enhance its corporate value amid a buyout offer from Canadian rival Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. Dacus, who has experience working at various Japanese companies and even at a 7-Eleven store in the U.S. during his teenage years, replaces Ryuichi Isaka. The company is currently examining both the buyout offer and the possibility of remaining independent, while also implementing restructuring steps such as selling its supermarket business and planning a U.S. listing for its U.S. 7-Eleven business unit in 2026.</p>

          <p>Sherron Watkins and Cynthia Cooper, who exposed accounting fraud at Enron and WorldCom, are raising concerns about a proposal to eliminate the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). They argue that eliminating this watchdog would increase the risk of corporate disasters, emphasizing the importance of the PCAOB's independence and its role in ensuring audit quality. They highlight that the PCAOB's rigorous inspections and enforcement have improved audit credibility and uncovered deficiencies, while its operational independence from the SEC is crucial for maintaining a laser focus on audit oversight. The authors emphasize that the P.C.A.O.B. was built to protect trust and that if it‚Äôs allowed to erode, we will all pay the price from market volatility, higher borrowing costs and potentially taxpayer-funded cleanup efforts (not investment advice).</p>

Cervical cancer is caused by certain high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV), a common virus that most sexually active people will contract at some point in their lives, with other risk factors including having HIV, other STIs, smoking, and a family history of the disease. Cervical screening is routinely offered to anyone with a cervix aged 25 to 64 on the NHS, and early diagnosis significantly improves the chances of effective treatment.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani hit another leadoff home run and Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a strong performance on the mound as the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Cleveland Guardians 7-2. Yamamoto allowed two runs on three hits and two walks over six innings, striking out seven, while Ohtani's leadoff home run marked his MLB-leading 19th of the season. Yamamoto demonstrated his defensive skills by fielding a bunt and diving to tag the runner, and he noted that he gets a lot of help from his teammates.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has called on domestic universities to consider temporarily accepting students enrolled at U.S. schools after Washington's move to bar foreign students from Harvard University. The move follows the University of Tokyo's consideration to accept international students from Harvard affected by the U.S. policy. The education ministry stated that the Japan Student Services Organization plans to release each university's stance on providing support and that the ministry will provide a consultation service for students studying in the United States.</p>
