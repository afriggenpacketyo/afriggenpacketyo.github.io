          <p>Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have signed an agreement in Cairo to resume cooperation and relaunch inspections of Iranian nuclear facilities. The deal, mediated by Egypt, comes after Iran suspended all cooperation with the UN watchdog following a war with Israel in June that saw strikes on its nuclear sites. This diplomatic development occurs as European nations move to reimpose sanctions on Iran for non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal. The agreement marks a critical step toward verifying Iran's nuclear stockpile, which has been a source of serious international concern.</p>

          <p>While credit card issuers are unlikely to completely waive payments for customers who have lost their jobs, many offer temporary hardship programs that can provide relief. These programs may include reduced minimum payments, lower interest rates, or a temporary pause on payments, though interest often continues to accrue. To qualify, customers typically need to contact their issuer directly and may need to provide proof of their job loss. The article also outlines alternative strategies for managing debt during unemployment, such as contacting a credit counselor, exploring debt settlement, or using a balance transfer card.

          <p>Cracker Barrel has announced it is suspending all restaurant remodels following significant public backlash against its recent rebranding efforts. The controversy began when the company introduced a new, modernized logo that removed its iconic "Old Country Store" branding, a move that even drew criticism from President Donald Trump. After customers expressed that the new designs did not reflect the brand's beloved vintage Americana aesthetic, the company decided to halt the planned updates. This decision follows the company's earlier move to revert to its original logo after its stock price was positively impacted by the change.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is rolling out its new "Green Apron Service" model, a $500 million initiative aimed at improving customer service and restoring profitability to pre-pandemic levels. Led by CEO Brian Niccol, the plan involves increasing staff, upgrading technology, and redesigning cafes to achieve a four-minute service target and enhance the customer experience. While the changes have shown early signs of success in test locations, the company's operating margins have contracted for five consecutive quarters due to the significant investment. Investors are closely watching to see if the strategy can deliver on its promise of long-term margin recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Potential Earnings of a $40,000 High-Yield Savings Account Amid Rate Changes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With interest rates on high-yield savings accounts currently around 4.35%, a deposit of $40,000 could earn approximately $1,740 in interest over one year, assuming the rate remains constant. However, these accounts have variable rates that are expected to decline following anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts, making precise calculations difficult. While offering liquidity and better returns than traditional savings, the article notes that their value must be weighed against other options. For those seeking a guaranteed return, a certificate of deposit (CD) offers a fixed rate that would not be affected by future market changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has named Sébastien Lecornu, his 39-year-old armed forces minister, as the new prime minister. The appointment follows the ousting of François Bayrou's government in a no-confidence vote, making Lecornu the fifth prime minister of Macron's second term. Lecornu faces the immediate and difficult challenge of passing a cost-cutting budget through a parliament where his party lacks a majority. His appointment has already been met with criticism from both the left and right, signaling the contentious political environment he will have to navigate as France grapples with a spiraling public debt.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As mortgage rates show signs of falling, adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) are being highlighted as a potential tool for homebuyers. ARMs currently offer lower initial interest rates compared to traditional 30-year fixed-rate loans, with rates fixed for a period of seven or ten years before adjusting annually. This structure can provide immediate cost savings and allows borrowers time to gauge the market before their rate changes, offering a chance to refinance if rates stabilize at a lower level. While not suitable for everyone, an ARM can offer protection against short-term rate volatility for buyers comfortable with future adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An unsettled weather pattern is set to mark the beginning of autumn in the United Kingdom, with wind and rain sweeping in from the Atlantic. A strengthening jet stream is pushing low-pressure systems toward the UK, bringing cooler temperatures and a risk of thunderstorms that will continue into the weekend. This shift follows an unusually dry spring and summer for many parts of the country, which led to drought declarations and hosepipe bans. While the incoming rain is welcome, meteorologists note that sustained rainfall throughout the autumn and winter will be necessary to fully replenish depleted water resources like reservoirs and aquifers.</p>

          <p>With an imminent Federal Reserve interest rate cut expected to lower returns for savers, choosing the right certificate of deposit (CD) term has become a key strategic decision. Short-term CDs currently offer higher rates and provide flexibility, allowing savers to reinvest sooner in a changing market. Conversely, long-term CDs allow individuals to lock in today's still-favorable rates for an extended period, protecting them from a series of potential future rate cuts. For those unsure which path to take, the article suggests a "CD ladder" strategy, which involves spreading funds across multiple CDs with varying maturity dates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dave Rowntree, the drummer for the iconic Britpop band Blur, is releasing a book of his personal photographs titled "No One You Know." The collection captures the band's early, pre-fame years around the release of their 1991 debut album, "Leisure." Rowntree says he focused on capturing the unremarkable, in-between moments of touring and life on the road, providing a candid and naive glimpse into the band's origins. The photos, which he recently rediscovered in a metal box, offer a unique behind-the-scenes look at the birth of Blur and the nascent Britpop scene before it became a global phenomenon.</p>
