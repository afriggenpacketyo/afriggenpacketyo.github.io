          <p>Students across Scotland are set to receive their exam results, but deliveries of physical certificates will be delayed in some areas due to Storm Floris. The storm has caused widespread travel disruption, impacting Royal Mail services to the Outer Hebrides, Orkney, and Shetland. While email and text results are unaffected, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) has advised affected candidates to contact their schools for their results. Education officials and a dedicated helpline are available to provide support and guidance for students on their next steps.</p>

          <p>Following a narrow series loss to India, analysis suggests England's cricket team faces a monumental challenge in the upcoming Ashes series in Australia. The team's success appears heavily dependent on the fitness and performance of captain Ben Stokes, who embodies the 'Bazball' spirit. With a poor track record in Australia over the last decade and a squad largely inexperienced in those conditions, a victory would be considered one of Stokes' greatest accomplishments. The article highlights the contrast between England's strong batting lineup and Australia's formidable bowling attack, setting the stage for a highly anticipated contest.</p>

          <p>In response to falling prices and strong competition from imports, China has introduced a new plan to support its domestic cattle industry and stimulate consumption. The policy, announced by the nation's top economic planner, aims to increase beef production and implement a quality-grading system to promote higher-quality local meat. Wholesale beef prices have fallen significantly from their 2023 levels, creating challenges for local producers. This initiative is part of a broader government effort to strengthen key agricultural sectors and enhance the appeal of domestic products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. border agents have reportedly been instructed to stop deportations under President Trump's asylum ban following a federal court order. A U.S. Court of Appeals panel partially granted an order that limits the administration's ability to use the ban to completely suspend humanitarian protections for asylum seekers. According to Department of Homeland Security officials, Customs and Border Protection was directed over the weekend to cease these specific deportations. The development is the latest in a series of legal challenges against the administration's broad immigration restrictions at the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>

          <p>Australia has announced a significant upgrade to its navy through a deal to acquire 11 advanced Mogami-class frigates from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The agreement, valued at 10 billion Australian dollars, is described as the largest defense-industry deal ever between the two nations and strengthens their strategic partnership in the Indo-Pacific. The move is part of Australia's broader military restructuring to enhance long-range strike capabilities in response to China's military expansion. The first three warships will be built in Japan, with the remaining eight to be constructed in Western Australia.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) has agreed to pay $1.7 million to settle a lawsuit brought by 45 California counties alleging the company improperly disposed of hazardous waste. The investigation found that UPS had discarded corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials in regular trash bins, which were then sent to landfills not equipped to handle such waste. UPS was reportedly cooperative with the investigation and has already implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs across its California facilities to prevent future violations and ensure environmental safety.</p>

          <p>It is currently tarantula mating season in California, leading to increased sightings of the large, fuzzy spiders as males leave their burrows in search of mates. The season, which runs from August to December, sees male tarantulas traveling long distances, making them more visible in areas like Joshua Tree National Park, the Santa Monica Mountains, and Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. Experts note that while their appearance can be intimidating, native California tarantulas are generally harmless to humans unless provoked and their bite is not considered dangerous, though their hairs can cause skin irritation.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles star running back Saquon Barkley has declined an invitation to serve on President Trump's revitalized council on sports, fitness, and nutrition. Barkley stated that due to being "super busy," he and his family decided it was in his best interest not to accept the position. The council, part of an executive order that also brought back the Presidential Fitness Test, includes other prominent sports figures. Barkley, who has previously golfed with both Trump and Barack Obama, said he was shocked but appreciative to have been considered for the role.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists and cave explorers have discovered the remains of an auroch, an extinct species of large wild cattle, in a cave near Ingleborough in the Yorkshire Dales. The discovery, part of a larger project studying the area's history, sheds new light on the fauna of the Bronze Age. The team also found evidence that the cave system was used for human burials during the earlier Neolithic period. These findings help document the long history of human and animal activity on the fells of Northern England.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged over 20% after President Trump praised the company's new marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. In a Truth Social post, Trump called the ad the "HOTTEST' out there" and encouraged his followers to support the brand. The ad had previously drawn some online criticism for its wordplay on "genes" and "jeans," which some interpreted as having racial undertones. Trump's endorsement, which contrasted the campaign with what he called "woke" advertising, fueled a meme-driven rally for the retailer's stock.</p>

          <p>A hiker was rescued by a helicopter crew after falling 25 feet down Big Falls waterfall in the San Bernardino Mountains. The man lost his footing on slick rocks and plunged into a pool below, but was fortunate that someone heard his screams and called for help. A specialized rescue helicopter from the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department responded, lowering a paramedic to the injured man. He was then secured in a rescue basket and airlifted to a trauma center with severe but non-life-threatening injuries from the notoriously dangerous location.</p>

          <h2>Increased Screenings Lead to More Early-Stage Colon Cancer Diagnoses in Younger Adults</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 20:21:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows a significant increase in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among people aged 45-49, which is linked to a rise in screenings for this age group. Following recommendations to lower the screening age to 45, screenings increased by 62% from 2019 to 2023. This has corresponded with a sharp rise in the detection of localized cancers, which are more treatable. While researchers call the findings promising, they note that screening rates for this younger demographic remain suboptimal and inequitable across different socioeconomic groups.</p>
