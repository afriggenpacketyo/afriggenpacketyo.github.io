          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick clarified that the Trump administration's decision to permit Nvidia to resume selling AI chips to China involves significant restrictions. Lutnick stated that China would only receive Nvidia's "fourth best" chip, which is considerably slower than the top-tier technology used by American companies. This strategic move is designed to keep China reliant on the American technology ecosystem without providing access to the most advanced hardware. The policy reversal, which followed a meeting between President Trump and Nvidia's CEO, aims to balance trade with national security interests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple has entered into a $500 million agreement with MP Materials to source rare earth magnets, a move aimed at strengthening its U.S. supply chain for critical components. The deal caused MP Materials' stock to climb by 22%. Under the agreement, MP Materials will supply magnets from its Texas facility and collaborate with Apple on a new recycling line in California. This partnership aligns with U.S. efforts to reduce dependency on China, which currently dominates the global rare earth market, and is part of Apple's broader investment in American manufacturing.

          <p>An ancient Roman mosaic depicting an erotic scene, stolen by a Nazi German captain during World War II, has been successfully repatriated to the archaeological park of Pompeii. The artwork, which dates back to the first century, was returned by the heirs of a German citizen who had received it as a gift from the Wehrmacht officer. After diplomatic arrangements and authentication by Italian authorities, the mosaic is now on display. Officials hailed the return as a significant cultural moment and a healing of a historical wound, highlighting a changing mentality regarding the possession of stolen art.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is actively working to bolster U.S. production of critical minerals and rare earth magnets to reduce reliance on China's dominant market position. A defense official stated that the department is taking immediate action to identify opportunities for strengthening the domestic supply chain. This initiative follows a recent Defense Department investment in MP Materials, the operator of the only rare earth mine in the U.S. These minerals are essential for advanced military technology, including F-35 fighter jets and submarines, making a secure domestic supply a key national security priority.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. has reached a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia, which he says includes a 19% tariff on Indonesian exports to the U.S. while exempting American exports from tariffs. Trump also stated that Indonesia has committed to purchasing $15 billion in U.S. energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets. However, the Indonesian government has not yet publicly confirmed these terms, and the announcement follows a pattern of Trump unveiling trade deals that are still being negotiated or have not been fully accepted by the other party.

          <p>Charles Collins and Brian Boles, who were convicted of a 1994 murder in Harlem as teenagers, have been exonerated after spending decades behind bars. The Manhattan District Attorney's office found that their convictions were based on coerced confessions and were contradicted by exculpatory evidence, including DNA that proved their innocence. Both men were questioned as minors without an adult present and were lied to by police. The case, which remains unsolved, highlights systemic issues, and the D.A.'s office has since implemented new practices to prevent future wrongful convictions.</p>
