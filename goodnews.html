        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Matcha, the green tea powder, is experiencing a global surge in popularity, leading to soaring prices and supply shortages even in Japan. Fueled by its superfood reputation on platforms like TikTok and a post-pandemic tourism boom, Japanese green tea exports quadrupled in a decade. The government is considering subsidies for farmers to increase tencha cultivation, the tea used for matcha, which is labor-intensive and facing a shortage of workers. Retailers are rationing supply, and producers worry that this summer's record heatwave could further impact next year's harvest, pushing prices even higher.</p>

          <p>The Met Office, Met Éireann, and KNMI have released their new list of storm names for the 2025-26 season, chosen from over 50,000 public suggestions. Storms like Amy, Bram, and Chandra will be the first named systems, with selections reflecting diversity and often having personal stories behind them. This naming system, initiated in 2015, helps to communicate severe weather warnings clearly when storms are forecast to cause medium or high impacts, typically due to strong winds, heavy rainfall, or snow. The previous season saw a significant reduction in named storms compared to the year before.</p>

          <p>Two New Orleans high school seniors, Calcea Johnson and Ne'Kiya Jackson, independently developed new trigonometric proofs for the Pythagorean Theorem, a mathematical feat previously thought impossible for 2,000 years. Their achievement, which garnered global attention and commendation from figures like Michelle Obama, was presented at an American Mathematical Society conference. Despite their groundbreaking work, both students, who have since graduated with scholarships, do not plan to pursue math careers, though Calcea may minor in the subject. Their success highlights the unique educational environment at St. Mary's Academy, their all-girls Catholic school.</p>

These genres, rooted in the region's diverse cultural blend of French, African American, Creole, and Spanish influences, are heard in dance halls and dive bars. Artists like Grammy-winner Chubby Carrier and Jourdan Thibodeaux are touring globally, serving as cultural ambassadors. Despite the diminishing use of Louisiana French, the music has become a crucial vehicle for transmitting culture, with countless children learning the language through songs.

The school's success is deeply rooted in the vision of its foundress, Henriette Delille, a Creole nun who defied anti-literacy laws to educate non-White people in the 19th century. Delille founded the Sisters of the Holy Family, one of America's oldest Black Catholic sisterhoods, which established St. Mary's. The school rebuilt and persevered after Hurricane Katrina, continuing its mission of empowering young African American women.</p>

          <p>Will Smith hit a pinch-hit, walk-off home run to give the Los Angeles Dodgers a 5-4 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks, preventing a three-game sweep. The win, secured despite blowing a three-run lead in the ninth inning, moved the Dodgers two games ahead in the National League West. Manager Dave Roberts had urged his team to play with more pride after two frustrating losses, and while the win was hard-fought, it provided a much-needed morale boost. The team's inconsistent second-half performance continues to be a concern, with Roberts emphasizing the need for sustained focus and improved play from the entire roster.</p>

          <p>The Oval Invincibles men's team achieved a historic 'three-peat' in The Hundred 2025, dominating the competition for a third consecutive year. Their success is attributed to expert team building by coach Tom Moody, a strong core of retained players, and shrewd selections for specific roles, such as power-hitter Donovan Ferreira. The team's varied bowling attack, featuring leg-spin and left-arm seamers, has also been crucial. However, with new investment and potential format changes, including a shift to T20, this era of Invincibles dominance may be drawing to a close, raising questions about future squad stability.</p>

The film, starring Jessie Buckley as Agnes and Paul Mescal as Shakespeare, delves into grief and the alchemy of creativity, moving away from cosmic spectacle to intimate human drama. Zhao, who previously won an Oscar for 'Nomadland,' describes going through a "very painful fire" after her Marvel film 'Eternals,' which prepared her for the deeper exploration of grief in 'Hamnet.' She aims for an embodied portrayal of emotion, arguing that societal restrictions on grief have caused damage.</p>

          <p>Liverpool secured a 1-0 victory over Arsenal at Anfield, with Dominik Szoboszlai scoring a magnificent 83rd-minute free-kick. Arsenal's conservative approach, despite significant transfer spending, drew criticism for failing to challenge Liverpool's defense effectively. Manager Mikel Arteta cited injuries to key players like Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard, but the team's passive play until falling behind proved costly. This defeat extends Arsenal's winless streak at Anfield in the Premier League to 13 games, marking an early psychological blow in the title race and prompting questions about Arteta's strategy in big matches.</p>
