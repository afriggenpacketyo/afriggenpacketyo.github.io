          <p>The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at 4.25%-4.5%, defying President Trump's calls for cuts.  Despite projecting two rate reductions by the end of 2025, the committee's "dot plot" shows continued uncertainty among officials.  Economic projections indicate persistent stagflationary pressures, with GDP growth at 1.4% and inflation at 3% in 2025.  The Fed's decision reflects a cautious approach amidst ongoing economic uncertainty and the impact of Trump's trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>
