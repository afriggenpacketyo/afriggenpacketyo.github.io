          <h2>World Faces Potential 'China Shock' with a Silver Lining for Inflation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global economy may be on the cusp of another 'China shock' due to overcapacity in Chinese manufacturing, leading to a flood of cheap exports. This situation is driven by intense competition in China's domestic market and weak consumer demand, prompting suppliers to offer steep discounts. While this causes anxiety in other Asian economies fearing squeezed local industries, it also offers a silver lining for inflation-hit countries. The influx of low-cost Chinese goods could ease the cost-of-living crisis and provide central banks with some relief as they balance lowering living costs and reviving growth amid trade tensions (not investment advice).</p>

After escaping Germany, he emigrated to the US and delivered radio speeches to his compatriots, urging them to resist.

The judge stated that Harvard demonstrated it would sustain "immediate and irreparable injury" if the ban were to take effect. The proclamation was seen as retaliation for Harvard's rejection of White House demands, and the university filed a legal challenge calling it illegal. The decision ensures that thousands of students scheduled to attend Harvard's summer and fall terms will be able to continue their studies for now.</p>
