          <p>Southwest Airlines reported a surprise profit for the third quarter and anticipates record sales for the final three months of the year, driven by strong travel demand and higher fares. The carrier expects unit revenue to rise 1% to 3% for the fourth quarter, with capacity up 6% year-over-year, assuming current demand levels persist. Despite cutting its 2025 profit forecast earlier, Southwest reaffirmed its outlook. The company's efforts to enhance competitiveness, including abandoning policies like open seating, contribute to its positive revenue growth. This article highlights the airline's strong financial performance and optimistic demand forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former officials from the Biden administration are urging Washington to prioritize strategic, cutting-edge technologies in its industrial policy, rather than pursuing a wholesale revival of U.S. manufacturing. Gina Raimondo, former Commerce Secretary, highlighted the necessity of industrial policy for national security in areas like the Chips Act, but expressed disagreement with a broader "make everything in America" approach. This perspective comes amidst debates on whether the U.S. should adopt elements of China's state-led advanced manufacturing strategy, with Raimondo suggesting the U.S. lacks a competitive advantage in certain basic manufacturing sectors. The article outlines a nuanced approach to industrial growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla reported a 12% increase in third-quarter revenue, ending two consecutive periods of decline, but its earnings missed analyst estimates, causing the stock to fall about 2%. Total revenue climbed to $28.10 billion, with automotive revenue up 6%. However, net income fell 37% due to lower EV prices and a 50% increase in operating expenses, partly attributed to AI and R&D projects. The end of federal EV tax credits also pulled sales forward into the quarter. Despite the stock drop, Tesla aims for "volume production" of Cybercab, Semi trucks, and Megapack 3 in 2026, and its energy generation business saw significant growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pittsburgh Steelers offensive tackle Broderick Jones playfully suggested he might tackle quarterback Aaron Rodgers again, despite Rodgers' initial anger over a recent touchdown celebration. Jones, a 300-pound player, brought Rodgers to the ground after a 68-yard touchdown pass, causing the veteran quarterback, who is two years removed from an Achilles injury, to fume. Jones clarified that there's "no love lost" between them, stating they are still joking about the incident, and Rodgers even told him "Don't lose the fire." The article notes Rodgers appeared uninjured by the poorly judged celebration tackle and the Steelers are now preparing to face his former team, the Green Bay Packers, marking Rodgers' first game against them since his 2023 trade.</p>

          <h2>New Studies Suggest Link Between Gum Disease and Increased Risk of Stroke, Brain Damage</h2>

          <p>New research published in Neurology Open Access indicates that adults with gum disease may have a higher likelihood of showing signs of damage to the brain's white matter. Dr. Souvik Sen, a study author, explained that gum disease is associated with inflammation, which is linked to atherosclerosis and hardening of small blood vessels. A separate study, also led by Sen, found that having both gum disease and cavities increases stroke risk by 86% compared to individuals with healthy mouths. However, maintaining good oral hygiene, including regular brushing, flossing, and dentist visits, was shown to reduce stroke risk by as much as 81%. This article emphasizes the significant impact of oral health on cardiovascular and brain health.</p>

          <p>IBM reported third-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street estimates and subsequently raised its full-year guidance, attributing this success to ongoing tailwinds from artificial intelligence. Despite these positive financial indicators, the company's stock dropped 5% in extended trading. IBM's revenue increased 9% year-over-year to $16.33 billion, with net income reaching $1.74 billion, a significant turnaround from a loss a year prior.

          <p>Data from the FDIC reveals that traditional savings accounts offer negligible interest rates, currently averaging 0.40%, which fails to keep pace with inflation. In contrast, high-yield savings accounts typically offer rates around 4.20% to 4.30%, providing significantly better returns for savers. This article highlights the potential for earning hundreds of dollars in interest annually, depending on the deposit amount, with interest compounding rapidly over time. While these rates are variable and subject to future cuts, they remain competitive. The article also suggests considering Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts for fixed rates that are immune to future rate declines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Wholesale Turkey Prices Rise Significantly Ahead of Thanksgiving Due to Supply Shortages</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wholesale turkey prices are projected to increase by 40% this year, reaching $1.32 per pound, significantly impacting retailers ahead of Thanksgiving. This surge is primarily due to a shrinking supply, a result of slightly weakened demand and ongoing avian flu outbreaks that have affected over 3 million turkeys this year. Despite the wholesale increase, economists anticipate a smaller rise in consumer prices, as retailers often use turkeys as "loss leaders" to attract holiday shoppers. Major retailers like Walmart and Aldi are already offering competitive deals, aiming to keep Thanksgiving meal costs under $4 per person, demonstrating efforts to mitigate the impact on budget-conscious consumers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many Americans are likely to receive heftier tax refunds next year, largely due to new provisions in the Republicans' "one big, beautiful bill" act, according to an Oxford Economics analysis. Total taxpayer savings could amount to an additional $50 billion through larger refunds or reduced 2026 tax bills. The new law, signed by President Trump in July, extended 2017 tax reductions and added breaks like eliminating taxes on some overtime and tipped income, and lifting the SALT deduction cap to $40,000. Because the IRS has not yet updated withholding tables, many taxpayers will have overpaid this year, leading to a "windfall" at tax time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's unbeaten streak in the Women's Cricket World Cup came to an end with a defeat to Australia, despite earlier securing a semi-final spot for both teams. The article describes England showing improved performance compared to their previous Ashes encounter, with strong spells in batting and bowling. However, Australia's deep and resilient batting lineup, exemplified by Annabel Sutherland's and Ash Gardner's match-winning partnership, proved too formidable. The article concludes that while the loss isn't a "hammer blow" to England's World Cup chances, it serves as a crucial reminder of the perfection required to overcome Australia's consistent excellence in the sport.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase analysts suggest that Wall Street is significantly underestimating the future AI revenue potential for major chipmakers Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom. The investment bank predicts that AI revenue forecasts will soon increase as deal visibility improves and production capacity expands. For example, JPMorgan believes AMD's OpenAI alliance alone could generate $30-35 billion annually, potentially outperforming current Street estimates for data center GPU sales. Similarly, Broadcom's AI revenue might reach $100 billion by 2027, far exceeding average projections. This article emphasizes that the next phase of the AI rally will be hardware-driven and power-limited, with these three companies at its core. (not investment advice)</p>
