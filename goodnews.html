          <p>A ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas is moving forward, with an Israeli official indicating that the first group of 20 living hostages could be released as early as Sunday or Monday. The agreement has been welcomed by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who hopes it will lead to a permanent political solution. However, the deal faces internal opposition within Israel's government, as far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has announced he will vote against it. This highlights the delicate political balance Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must navigate to secure the return of the hostages.</p>

He has given away hundreds of laptops, providing recipients with crucial access to technology for education and job opportunities.

          <p>Germany's governing coalition has presented a comprehensive package of reforms after marathon negotiations, revealing underlying tensions between the partner parties. Led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, the agreement includes tighter restrictions on social welfare payments, changes to the pension system, and new subsidies for electric vehicles to counter competition from China. The reforms, particularly the welfare changes, reportedly faced significant opposition from the center-left SPD. Despite the disagreements, the coalition presented a united front, emphasizing a commitment to strengthening the economy and social obligations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in history, renewable energy has overtaken coal as the world's primary source of electricity, according to a report from the energy think tank Ember. In the first half of 2025, renewables like solar, wind, and hydro accounted for 34.3% of global consumption, narrowly surpassing coal's 33.1%. This shift was largely driven by rapid adoption in populous developing countries, particularly China. While this marks a significant milestone in the global energy transition, challenges remain as rising electricity demand, partly fueled by AI data centers, tests the capacity of new clean energy infrastructure to keep pace.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of first responders are turning to ketamine-assisted psychotherapy to treat severe depression and PTSD resulting from high-trauma careers. The treatment, which combines low doses of the hallucinogenic drug with therapy, can help individuals process deeply buried traumatic memories. While practitioners report significant success, the approach faces major obstacles, including a widely unregulated market, high costs often not covered by insurance, and a lingering stigma associated with the drug. Despite these challenges, many police officers and firefighters find it to be a uniquely effective tool when traditional therapies have failed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas marks a significant breakthrough in the two-year conflict, largely credited to the personal diplomatic pressure exerted by US President Donald Trump. This first phase of the plan involves releasing remaining hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, alongside an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of Gaza. While this is a major diplomatic victory, significant hurdles to a permanent peace remain. Key unresolved issues include Hamas's disarmament and the long-term governance of the devastated territory, making the future of the peace process uncertain.</p>

          <p>A growing movement among Gen Z consumers is pushing back against "fast furniture"—cheap, mass-produced items designed for short-term use that contribute to millions of tons of landfill waste annually. Driven by environmental concerns, tighter budgets, and a desire for unique pieces with a story, younger shoppers are increasingly turning to secondhand sources like Facebook Marketplace. This trend challenges the business model of retailers that promote ever-changing seasonal styles, encouraging a more sustainable approach to home decor. Advocates say this shift toward reuse is a key antidote to the disposable culture's significant carbon footprint.</p>

          <p>The Denver Broncos are emerging as potential dark horses in the NFL, thanks to a strategic focus on a powerful running game led by head coach Sean Payton. This run-first offensive approach, featuring running back JK Dobbins, effectively controls the clock and alleviates pressure on young quarterback Bo Nix. Nix's mobility and poise, combined with Payton's experienced play-calling, have allowed the offense to thrive, as demonstrated in a recent comeback victory over the previously undefeated Philadelphia Eagles. This disciplined strategy could be the key for the Broncos to challenge the long-standing dominance of the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC West.</p>

          <p>Catherine, the Princess of Wales, has warned that the overuse of smartphones and other digital devices is creating an "epidemic of disconnection" that harms family life. In a new essay, she argues that while technology promises to keep people connected, it often has the opposite effect, causing individuals to be "physically present but mentally absent." The princess expressed particular concern for children, who are growing up in a world immersed in technology and may be less equipped to form the warm, meaningful relationships essential for a healthy life. Her comments are part of her ongoing campaign focused on early childhood development.</p>
