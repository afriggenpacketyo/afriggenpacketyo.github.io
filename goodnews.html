        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A lynx born at Newquay Zoo in Cornwall may become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild. Due to a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding program, the zoo was asked to contribute. The lynx has been moved to Germany's Black Forest for monitoring to assess its survival skills. The goal is to introduce new cats to increase genetic diversity among European lynx populations, as they once roamed the UK but were driven to extinction centuries ago, and conservationists aim to reintroduce them.</p>

          <p>Apple anticipates a $900 million impact from President Trump's tariffs this quarter, despite electronics exemptions. The company is shifting iPhone production for the American market away from China, with the majority now made in India.

China will remain the primary country of origin for products sold outside the U.S., and the company is trying to mitigate tariff impact.</p>

The film follows a team of misfit side characters, including Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), as they face off against a corrupt CIA director. The movie aims to be punk-rock and snarky, with a sense of humor and visual awe. While the plot delves into themes of trust, trauma, and mental illness, the film's plainness and occasional reliance on after-school PSA tropes may appeal to some while leaving others wanting more.</p>
