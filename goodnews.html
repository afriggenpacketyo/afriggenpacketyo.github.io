          <p>South Korean soccer superstar Son Heung-min has officially joined Major League Soccer's Los Angeles FC (LAFC) for a record-breaking transfer fee reported to be $26 million. The 33-year-old forward leaves Tottenham Hotspur after a decade, bringing immense global appeal and on-field talent to his new club. LAFC views Son not just as a player who can deliver immediate results, but as a crucial building block to expand its international brand, particularly in Asia. His arrival is expected to energize the local Korean community and the broader fan base, continuing the team's strategy of signing high-profile international players.</p>

          <h2>UK University Admissions Body Predicts Record Placements for Domestic Students</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 19:13:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The head of the UK's Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) predicts a record number of 18-year-old domestic students will secure their first-choice university placement this year. This is partly due to uncertainty surrounding international student enrollment, which is making UK undergraduates a more stable and desirable option for universities' financial planning. Consequently, institutions may be more flexible, potentially accepting students who narrowly miss their required grades. The trend comes as tuition fees for English and Welsh students are set to rise for the 2025-26 academic year for the first time since 2017.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>DoorDash announced strong financial results for the second quarter, surpassing analyst expectations for both earnings and revenue. The food delivery company reported a 25% year-over-year revenue increase to $3.28 billion and posted a net income of $285 million, a significant turnaround from a loss in the same period last year. Total orders grew by 20% to 761 million, reflecting sustained consumer demand for delivery services. The positive report, which also included recent acquisitions of Deliveroo and SevenRooms, caused the company's stock to rise in after-hours trading, continuing a strong performance for the year.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 19:02:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England is widely expected to announce an interest rate cut on Thursday, lowering the benchmark rate from 4.25% to 4%. This would be the fifth reduction since last August and would bring borrowing costs to their lowest point since March 2023. While this move could reduce monthly payments for homeowners with variable-rate mortgages, it will likely mean lower returns for savers. The decision comes amid signs of a cooling UK economy, with stagnant growth in April and May and a slowing labor market, even as inflation remains above the Bank's 2% target.

          <p>Archaeologists have found new evidence indicating that people returned to live in Pompeii after the city was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. Research from new excavations suggests that some survivors, possibly unable to afford relocating, resettled among the ruins. This post-eruption settlement is described as a 'precarious' and informal community that existed until the 5th century. The inhabitants are thought to have lived in the upper floors of buried buildings, using the lower levels as cellars, and likely scavenged for valuable materials within the ash-covered city, challenging the long-held belief that the site was completely abandoned.</p>

          <p>England all-rounder Chris Woakes has been widely praised for his courage after emerging to bat with a suspected dislocated shoulder during the final day of the fifth Test against India. Despite his arm being in a sling, Woakes came to the crease with England needing 17 runs to win, stating he 'wouldn't have been able to live with himself' if he didn't try. He did not face a ball but managed to run four times before his partner was dismissed, resulting in a narrow six-run victory for India. Woakes, who is now in doubt for the upcoming Ashes series, said the support from the public has helped him cope with the devastating loss.</p>

          <p>This article examines the potential returns for savers placing $10,000 in either a 6-month certificate of deposit (CD) or a money market account in the current interest rate environment. While rates are currently similar, a CD offers a fixed rate, guaranteeing a predictable return, whereas a money market account's rate is variable and likely to decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts rates. Based on current rates, a 6-month CD would yield slightly more, and this advantage could grow if market rates fall. The analysis suggests that for savers prioritizing maximum guaranteed returns over liquidity, a CD may be the preferable option. (not investment advice)</p>
