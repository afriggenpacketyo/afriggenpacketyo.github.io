          <p>China is actively working to expand its global influence through a diverse soft power strategy that encompasses culture, media, and commerce. This initiative includes promoting hit streaming shows and popular 'ugly-cute' toys like Labubu to engage international audiences, particularly in the West. Concurrently, Chinese academics and think tanks are being urged to develop a more assertive, 'self-centered' narrative to counteract Western perspectives and strengthen the nation's discourse power on the world stage. This push aims to control China's global image and build cultural capital despite waning interest in Mandarin language studies abroad.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to allow the U.S. and European allies to offer Ukraine security protections similar to NATO's Article 5. This potential concession, described as 'game-changing,' emerged from the recent summit between President Trump and Putin in Alaska. The arrangement could provide a workaround to Russia's long-standing opposition to Ukraine's formal NATO membership by creating a strong defense pact against future aggression. European leaders have welcomed the development, though Ukrainian President Zelenskyy noted that specific details on how such guarantees would function remain unclear.</p>

          <p>Several key European and NATO leaders are traveling to Washington to join Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for his critical meeting with President Trump. This unified front, including leaders from France, Germany, and the European Commission, aims to support Zelenskyy and ensure European interests are represented in discussions about a potential peace deal with Russia. The move is seen as an effort to prevent a repeat of a previous contentious Oval Office encounter and to counter concerns that Ukraine might be pressured into an unfavorable agreement following Trump's direct talks with Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <p>Actor Chris Pratt shared a series of rare photographs on social media to celebrate his son Jack's 13th birthday, marking his transition into a teenager. In an Instagram story, Pratt expressed his pride in the 'incredible young man' his son is becoming, sharing images of them at sporting events and engaging in various activities. Pratt, who co-parents Jack with his ex-wife Anna Faris, has previously spoken about how his son's premature birth and early health scares profoundly deepened his religious faith.

          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has incorporated over 6,000 new words and phrases this year, including internet slang terms like 'skibidi,' 'delulu,' and 'tradwife.' These additions reflect the growing influence of online culture, particularly from Gen Z and Gen Alpha, on the English language. 'Skibidi' is a nonsense word from a viral YouTube series, 'delulu' is short for delusional, and 'tradwife' describes women embracing traditional gender roles on social media. Lexicographers noted that while it is unusual for such terms to be added, they are included only when they demonstrate significant staying power and impact on everyday speech.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets demonstrated a mostly upward trend on Monday, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and China's CSI 300 posting gains, while South Korea's Kospi experienced a decline. Investors are closely monitoring the geopolitical landscape, particularly awaiting further details from the high-stakes talks between the U.S. and Ukraine, following a U.S.-Russia summit that did not result in a ceasefire. The market movements also came as Singapore reported a larger-than-expected 4.6% contraction in its non-oil domestic exports for July, contrasting with recent positive performance on Wall Street.

          <p>Actress Dame Helen Mirren has asserted that the iconic role of James Bond should continue to be played by a man, stating that casting a woman 'just doesn't work.' Despite identifying as a feminist, Mirren believes the character is fundamentally male, and changing this would transform it into something else entirely. Her comments were echoed by former Bond actor Pierce Brosnan, who is co-starring with Mirren in an upcoming film. The discussion comes as Amazon MGM Studios prepares for the 26th installment of the franchise, promising a fresh take while honoring the character's legacy.</p>

          <p>A renewed sense of pan-Africanism is gaining momentum across the Caribbean, strengthening cultural, social, and economic connections with the African continent. This movement is visible in the rising popularity of Afrobeats music, Nigerian cuisine, and increased tourism from the Caribbean to African nations like Ghana and South Africa. On a governmental level, institutions such as the African Export-Import Bank are fostering deeper trade relationships, with leaders calling for improved transportation links and even a shared currency to bolster economic integration. This modern wave of African pride is amplified by social media, helping to reshape perceptions and unify people of African descent.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler clinched the BMW Championship title after Scotland's Robert MacIntyre saw his four-shot overnight lead evaporate on the final day.

Scheffler remained composed, securing his victory with a remarkable chip-in on the 17th hole to finish two strokes clear at 15 under par. The win marks Scheffler's 18th PGA Tour success, while MacIntyre was left to analyze what went wrong after a promising start to the tournament.</p>

          <p>Two of China's largest drug manufacturers, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals and Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group, are projected to report substantial profit increases for the first half of the year. This growth is driven by the successful rollout of innovative new drugs and increased revenue from technology licensing agreements. Analysts estimate Hengrui's net profit could rise by 40 percent, reflecting a strategic shift away from generic drugs towards more profitable, novel treatments. This transition is expected to continue, with generics predicted to account for a significantly smaller portion of Hengrui's revenue in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>
