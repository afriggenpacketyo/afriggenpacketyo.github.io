          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has urged Europe to assert a stronger global role, expressing deep concern over the continent's current inability to pressure Russia effectively in the Ukraine conflict and its ongoing reliance on American assistance. Merz emphasized Germany's responsibility to drive renewed European unity and more robustly protect its own interests on the world stage. Concurrently, Germany is launching Jupiter, Europe's first exascale supercomputer, a €500 million system capable of a quintillion calculations per second. This technological leap aims to significantly advance AI, climate forecasts, and brain simulations, highlighting a dual focus on geopolitical influence and scientific innovation to close the AI gap with global leaders.</p>

          <p>The London City Lionesses have shattered the women's football transfer record by signing French international Grace Geyoro from Paris St-Germain for an unprecedented £1.4 million, making her the most expensive female player in history. This acquisition marks the third time the record has been broken this summer, underscoring the rapid growth and increasing investment in women's football globally. The newly promoted Women's Super League club, independently owned by Michele Kang, is building a formidable squad with several high-profile signings, signaling ambitious plans to disrupt the league's established order. Geyoro's arrival is a clear statement of intent, elevating the team's profile and competitive aspirations for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>A23a, the world's largest and oldest iceberg, which once rivaled the size of Oahu, is rapidly breaking apart and melting in the warmer waters of the South Atlantic Ocean, signifying the end of its nearly 40-year journey. After spending decades grounded, the iceberg freed itself in 2020 and began its final drift, a process scientists confirm is a typical part of an iceberg's natural life cycle and not directly linked to climate change. Scientists from the British Antarctic Survey have closely tracked A23a since its calving in 1986, and its demise will continue to provide valuable data. Research on its path and melting impact will offer crucial insights into ocean carbon levels and the broader marine environment.</p>

          <p>Suzy Chase, 58, shares her personal journey of regaining fitness and losing 50 pounds in a year with the help of Zepbound, a GLP-1 medication, after the pandemic and menopause led to significant weight gain. Despite a lifelong struggle with weight, Chase maintained an active lifestyle until gym closures and hormonal changes impacted her health. She credits tirzepatide for improving her sleep, reducing "food noise," and alleviating joint pain, allowing her to pursue her new goal of "training for 80." The article highlights the medication's effectiveness in conjunction with hormone replacement therapy, though it notes the high out-of-pocket cost.</p>

          <p>Michael Bradley, set to be honored for his decorated US men's national team career, amassed the third-most caps and second-most assists, starting in two World Cups, yet remained a surprisingly divisive figure among fans. Despite a highly accomplished career that included playing for Roma, his presence on the team often sparked debate, partly due to perceptions of nepotism given his father's coaching role. Bradley's intense focus, guarded public persona, and relentless competence on the field were often underestimated, as he consistently set high standards and elevated his teammates. His legacy is seen as a Rorschach test for American soccer fandom, reflecting deep-seated hopes and insecurities.</p>

          <p>China has set an ambitious goal to expand its sports sector to 7 trillion yuan (US$980 billion) by 2030, nearly doubling its 2023 scale, as part of a national strategy to foster consumption-driven economic growth. A recent directive from the State Council, chaired by Premier Li Qiang, emphasizes developing internationally influential sports companies and events across the nation. This initiative aims to strengthen coordination for hosting international events and capitalize on growing enthusiasm for spectator sports and outdoor activities among its vast population.

          <p>UK retail sales volumes saw a 0.6% increase in July, surpassing analyst expectations, primarily driven by sunny weather and the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 tournament. Clothing, footwear, and online retailers experienced strong growth, with some tech stores also benefiting from demand for air conditioners during hot nights. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) apologized for previous data errors, revising past retail sales figures and implementing improvement plans. However, economists caution that the boosts from weather and football are temporary, and impending tax rises ahead of the November Budget could dampen future retail sector performance.</p>
