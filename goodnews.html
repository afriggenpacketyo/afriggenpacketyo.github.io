          <p>European stock markets are poised for a higher open, even as new data confirms the UK economy experienced zero growth in July, influencing the Bank of England's upcoming monetary policy update. The European Central Bank recently held its key interest rates steady in an anticipated move. This article also highlights significant corporate news, such as Spanish lender Sabadell's board recommending the rejection of a hostile takeover bid from BBVA, and Ryanair's CEO threatening to cut flights to Spain amid tax policy disputes. International investors are also keenly awaiting the US Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon's Project Kuiper has secured its first in-flight Wi-Fi contract with JetBlue, marking a significant step in its race against SpaceX's dominant Starlink satellite internet service. Despite this win, Kuiper's current constellation of 102 satellites lags far behind Starlink's 8,393, with Amazon facing a mandate to deploy thousands more by 2029 to meet FCC requirements. The burgeoning satellite internet market, driven by projections for future 6G communications, is attracting massive investment, aiming to connect billions globally who currently lack internet access.

          <p>New Housing Secretary Steve Reed has firmly insisted on the government's "absolute commitment" to building 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029, a central Labour general election manifesto pledge. Reed, who recently took over the housing brief, emphasized a "build baby build" approach, threatening sanctions on developers who delay projects and promising an "acceleration package" for planning approvals. However, industry leaders caution about "huge challenges" due to escalating costs and bureaucratic delays, while the Conservatives express skepticism about Labour's ability to meet these ambitious housing promises.</p>

          <p>China has become the leading foreign investor in Thailand's Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), committing US$8.4 billion between 2019 and 2024. This substantial investment, representing 16% of all foreign capital in the three-province cluster, includes backing for a 220km high-speed railway line, an "aerotropolis" design, and potential property development. Only Thailand itself has invested more in the EEC, with Japan ranking third. The railway project, a collaboration with China Railway Construction Corporation, was started seven years ago but was suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic and is now expected to take another five years to complete.

          <p>California's Assembly has passed Senate Bill 79, a controversial housing bill designed to override local zoning laws and expand high-density housing near public transit hubs. The legislation, championed by Senator Scott Wiener, would permit buildings up to nine stories adjacent to certain transit stops, impacting single-family neighborhoods within a half-mile. While supporters argue drastic measures are needed for the state's affordability crisis, critics, including the Los Angeles City Council, condemn it as a "one-size-fits-all mandate" that strips local authorities of control and could alter communities. Support surged after amendments added union hiring provisions.</p>
