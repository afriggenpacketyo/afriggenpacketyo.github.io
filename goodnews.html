          <h2>Super Micro Computer Plans to Expand Manufacturing in Europe Amid Surging AI Demand</h2>

          <p>AI server manufacturer Super Micro Computer intends to significantly increase its investment in Europe, including expanding its manufacturing capabilities to meet the region's rapidly growing demand for AI technology. CEO Charles Liang confirmed the plans, stating that the company, which produces servers packed with Nvidia chips, will build on its existing facilities in the Netherlands. This move aligns with a broader push for Europe to enhance its computing capacity. Despite a recent stock decline and weaker-than-expected guidance, Liang expressed confidence in the company's strong growth trajectory, citing fundamental technology development and business scope expansion.</p>

          <p>John Fogerty, six weeks after his 80th birthday, performed an energetic and powerful rock-and-roll show at the Hollywood Bowl as part of his "Celebration Tour." The concert heavily featured classics from his time with Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR), whose song rights he fully regained two years ago after a long legal battle. Despite his age, Fogerty's vocal performance remained remarkably consistent and forceful, and he played guitar for the entire two-hour show without a break. The performance highlighted enduring hits like "Bad Moon Rising" and "Fortunate Son," demonstrating their continued relevance and his lasting impact on music.</p>

          <h2>Brazil and India Announce Plans to Triple Trade, Showing Unity Amid Trump's Brics Criticism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 22:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a show of unity against recent criticism from Donald Trump, Brazil and India have vowed to triple their trade flows. The move comes after Trump described the Brics economic bloc, which includes both nations, as being set up to harm the U.S. and threatened a 10% tariff on any member country. The Brics group, which has expanded to include several other emerging economies, aims to reform Western-dominated international institutions and unite the Global South. This new trade commitment between two of its key members signals a strengthening of alliances within the bloc in response to potential U.S. protectionist policies.</p>

          <p>Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was once again the world's busiest airport in 2024, processing over 108 million passengers, according to a new report from Airports Council International.

          <p>An opinion article argues that as the United States dismantles parts of its international development sector, Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to become a new hub for global public goods. The piece contrasts the recent end of USAID's independence with the high-profile launch of the China-initiated International Organisation for Mediation (IOMed) in Hong Kong. The author suggests that the U.S. "America first" mentality is creating a vacuum in international development and soft power. This shift provides an opportunity for China, and specifically Hong Kong as a cosmopolitan city, to take a more proactive role in meeting the needs of the Global South.</p>

          <p>An Iranian mother, Mandonna “Donna” Kashanian, who had lived in the U.S. for 47 years, has been released from ICE detention after Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise intervened on her behalf. Kashanian was detained last month from her New Orleans home despite having no criminal record and regularly checking in with immigration authorities as required. Following a surge of community support, Scalise asked the Department of Homeland Security to review the case, stating she should be judged on her life's work. Her attorney called the intervention "absolutely crucial," highlighting a rare case of bipartisan and community advocacy influencing an immigration outcome.</p>

          <p>As forecasters predict an above-average hurricane season, a growing number of homeowners on the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts are investing in climate-resilient home designs. These homes often feature aerodynamic round shapes to reduce wind pressure, reinforced roofs, and foundations anchored deep into the ground with flood vents. Builders like Deltec Homes specialize in these structures, which are rated to withstand winds of up to 190 mph. While costing more upfront, these resilient designs can lead to long-term savings, including lower insurance premiums, and offer greater peace of mind in an era of stronger storms fueled by climate change.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly expanding its offshore wind energy capacity, adding over 4.4 gigawatts in the first half of the year, equivalent to its total for all of 2024. A new report from Global Energy Monitor projects China will add at least 9GW this year, over half of the global total, with another 22GW already under construction. This surge is driven by strong government support and is part of President Xi Jinping's broader strategy to advance the nation's marine economy. The development highlights China's growing dominance in the renewable energy sector and its push into deep-sea wind technology.</p>

          <p>An Instagram post by UK television personality Gemma Collins has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) for illegally promoting a prescription-only weight-loss drug. In the post for the Swedish brand Yazen, Collins claimed she was "two sizes down" thanks to its app and medication. It is illegal to advertise prescription-only medicines to the public. This action was part of a broader crackdown by the ASA, which banned eight other similar adverts from various companies for breaching its code. Collins accepted the ruling and agreed to follow guidance in the future.</p>
