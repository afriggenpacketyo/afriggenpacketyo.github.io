          <p>President Trump hosted a "One Big, Beautiful Event" at the White House to build momentum for his major tax and spending bill, despite recent setbacks in the Senate. The event featured Americans who would purportedly benefit from the legislation, including delivery drivers and law enforcement officers. The rally occurred shortly after the Senate parliamentarian rejected key Medicaid provisions in the bill, a major blow to the Republican strategy. The White House, however, remains insistent that Congress must pass the legislation by the July 4th deadline.</p>

          <p>The White House has indicated that President Trump's upcoming July deadlines for imposing steep tariffs on imports from numerous countries are "not critical" and could be extended. This statement suggests a potential softening of the administration's hardline stance, providing more time for trade negotiations. A White House official noted that if countries refuse to make a deal, the president could unilaterally impose a "reciprocal tariff rate" he deems advantageous. This flexibility has been interpreted by some as a sign that deals are not imminent, despite previous suggestions to the contrary. (not investment advice)</p>

The article suggests that a favorable inflation report in mid-July could prompt lenders to lower rates preemptively. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's meetings at the end of July and, more likely, in mid-September, could result in a formal interest rate cut.

          <p>This article compares the potential interest earnings of placing $10,000 into either a short-term certificate of deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account. The analysis shows that for 3-month and 6-month terms, a CD currently offers slightly higher returns, while a high-yield savings account marginally outperforms a 9-month CD. Because the interest earnings are so similar, the choice depends on a saver's outlook on future interest rate movements. Locking in a CD rate may be wise if rates are expected to fall, whereas a savings account offers more flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

Crucially, the court's decision establishes that the statute of limitations does not apply in these civil cases, opening a path to justice for other victims.
