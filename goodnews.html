          <h2>Neuroscientist Explains the Science of Limerence and How to Overcome Romantic Obsession</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Neuroscientist Tom Bellamy's work explores "limerence," a term for intense romantic infatuation characterized by obsessive thoughts and emotional highs and lows. While this state can be a normal part of early love, it can become a detrimental "person addiction" when a relationship is uncertain or unattainable, leading to anxiety and craving. Bellamy suggests that overcoming unhealthy limerence involves recognizing it as an internal mental state and taking active steps to break the cycle. Strategies include limiting contact, reframing positive daydreams into negative scenarios, and focusing on new personal goals to create a sense of purpose outside the obsession.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the UK's Liberal Democrat party gathers for its conference, it confronts a key strategic question: how to build on its recent general election success. Leader Sir Ed Davey's attention-grabbing stunts, such as bungee-jumping, helped the party gain seats, but polling suggests voters may now want a more serious approach. With both the Labour and Conservative parties facing internal turmoil, the Lib Dems see an opportunity to attract centrist voters. However, the party must now define a broader policy platform beyond its core issues and find a way to make moderate positions exciting in an increasingly polarized political landscape.</p>

          <h2>AI in the Workplace Presents Both a Solution and a Cause for Employee Burnout</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Artificial intelligence is being adopted in workplaces as a tool to combat employee burnout by automating repetitive tasks, but its impact is proving to be complex. While AI can reduce emotional exhaustion by handling administrative duties, some studies suggest that frequent AI users are more likely to experience high levels of burnout. This paradox arises because the time saved by AI is often filled with more work, and the continuous cognitive engagement required to use these tools can be draining. Experts argue that for AI to be a true solution, companies must focus on rebalancing workloads rather than simply increasing output.</p>

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released and are returning to the UK after being detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for almost eight months. The couple, who had lived and run a charitable training program in the country for nearly two decades, were reunited with their daughter in Qatar following negotiations brokered by the Qatari government. The Taliban stated the couple had broken Afghan laws but never specified the reason for their detention. Despite the ordeal, the couple and their family have expressed a desire to return to Afghanistan to continue their work.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, are preparing to face France in a highly anticipated World Cup semi-final, carrying the weight of an imposing statistical dominance. England is on a record 31-match winning streak and has defeated France in their last 16 encounters. Despite these numbers, France has consistently been England's toughest opponent, often coming within a single score of victory in recent matches. French coaches and players are downplaying the historical statistics, emphasizing that in a high-stakes World Cup semi-final, past results are irrelevant against their desire to reach their first-ever final.</p>

          <p>The WNBA semi-finals are confirmed, guaranteeing a new league champion this season. The Minnesota Lynx, who had the best regular-season record, will face a confident Phoenix Mercury team that eliminated the New York Liberty. In the other best-of-five series, the defending champion Las Vegas Aces will play the Indiana Fever, who won their first playoff series in a decade despite the absence of injured star Caitlin Clark. While the Lynx hold a regular-season advantage over the Mercury, Phoenix notes that they were not at full strength during those earlier contests, setting the stage for competitive matchups.</p>

          <p>In what was likely his final regular-season start at Dodger Stadium, veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw received an emotional send-off from fans and teammates one day after announcing his retirement. The celebrated 18-year career, spent entirely with the Dodgers, has been marked by numerous accolades and a complex journey through postseason challenges. On a night dedicated to his legacy, the Dodgers clinched their 13th consecutive playoff berth with a 6-3 victory over the San Francisco Giants. The moment provided a fittingly triumphant backdrop for the beloved Los Angeles sports icon.</p>

          <p>As the school year begins, many parents are choosing to leave school-related WhatsApp groups to escape the constant notifications, competitive parenting, and unnecessary anxiety they can generate. While these groups can be useful for sharing important information like non-uniform days, they often become forums for polarized opinions and negativity, sometimes requiring intervention from school administrators. Some parents also note the chats reinforce traditional gender roles, with mothers predominantly handling school communications. For many, opting out is a way to reduce digital noise and set healthier boundaries around school life.</p>
