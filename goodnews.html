          <p>The California FAIR Plan, the state's insurer of last resort for fire coverage, faces increasing scrutiny due to its lack of transparency. A CBS News California investigation revealed that the FAIR Plan withholds basic financial data and keeps board meetings secret, unlike similar plans in other states. New rules now require all property insurance holders to cover the FAIR Plan's debts, making its operations a matter of public concern. Following the investigation, the California FAIR Plan agreed to publicly disclose more information, including the composition of its board, its reinsurance structure and the dates of cash distributions back to its member companies.</p>
