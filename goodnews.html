          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 10:18:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Receding water levels at the Mosul Dam reservoir in northern Iraq, caused by a severe multi-year drought, have led to the discovery of approximately 40 ancient tombs. Archaeologists believe the tombs date back over 2,300 years to the Hellenistic period. While the drought has had devastating effects on agriculture and electricity in Iraq, it has created an unexpected opportunity for archaeological excavation. The team is working to excavate and preserve the artifacts before the area is submerged again. The discovery highlights the severe impact of climate change and upstream damming by neighboring countries on Iraq's water resources.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that Donald Trump exceeded his presidential powers by imposing widespread tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The court found that the law does not grant the president unlimited authority to impose tariffs or taxes without congressional approval. The ruling specifically voids the broad tariffs introduced in April but has been stayed until October to allow the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court. This decision represents a significant legal challenge to Trump's trade agenda and could have major financial implications, potentially requiring the refund of billions in collected import taxes.

          <p>Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan Maclean, three brothers from Scotland, have set a new world record by completing the fastest unsupported row across the Pacific Ocean in 139 days. They journeyed over 9,000 miles from Peru to Cairns, Australia, becoming the first team to row the full distance non-stop. The trio endured significant hardships, including storms and injuries, while successfully raising over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar through their charity. Their arrival in Australia, greeted by family and supporters, marked the culmination of an extraordinary feat of endurance and philanthropy, breaking the previous record of 160 days.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Photographer Zed Nelson's new book, "The Anthropocene Illusion," examines the contrived and paradoxical ways humans interact with the natural world they are simultaneously altering. Rather than focusing on large-scale environmental destruction, Nelson captures curated and hyper-managed versions of nature, such as tourists recreating movie scenes on safari or taking selfies with captive elephants in Sri Lanka. His work suggests that as we become more disconnected from genuine nature, we create illusions to satisfy a craving for it, often without acknowledging the artifice. The project serves as a commentary on our species' complex and often hypocritical relationship with the environment.</p>

          <p>E-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding announced robust earnings, leading to a 13% jump in its New York-listed shares. Company executives attribute the success to gaining "consumer mindshare" and scaling up user growth through its Taobao Instant Commerce initiative, which focuses on on-demand delivery for a wide range of products. CEO Eddie Wu expressed confidence that the company can achieve industry-leading efficiency long-term due to its newly achieved scale. The positive results suggest Alibaba is successfully regaining momentum in China's highly competitive domestic market and expects its cloud computing business to continue its upward trajectory.

          <h2>Activist Investor Elliott Management Takes Position in Rexford Industrial Realty to Drive Value</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 08:55:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elliott Investment Management, a prominent activist investment firm, has announced taking a significant position in Rexford Industrial Realty, a REIT focused on the Southern California market. Despite Rexford's prime portfolio, its stock has underperformed, trading at a discount to its net asset value. Elliott is expected to push for changes to address what it sees as poor corporate governance, bloated expenses, and a misaligned management strategy that has diluted shareholder value. Given Elliott's history, this could lead to a board reconstitution, better capital allocation, or even catalyze a strategic acquisition of the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pastor Kelvis Reid survived a major cardiac arrest caused by AL amyloidosis, a rare and serious condition where abnormal proteins damage organs. His heart had become "hard as cement," but his life was saved by his family, who had been trained in CPR by his doctor just before the event. After weeks on life support, Reid underwent a successful heart and kidney transplant. His story highlights the importance of early diagnosis for the often-misdiagnosed disease and the critical role of bystander intervention in cardiac emergencies. Eighteen months post-transplant, Reid has recovered remarkably and returned to his pulpit.</p>

          <p>The Indian restaurant scene in the U.S. is undergoing a significant transformation, moving beyond "cheap food and curry houses" to sophisticated, upscale dining experiences that are attracting both customers and investors. Chefs like Vikas Khanna are exploring hyper-regional Indian cuisines, earning Michelin stars and generating massive waitlists for reservations. This boom is driven by a growing consumer appetite for unique global flavors, the increasing affluence of the Indian American population, and a post-pandemic desire for elevated dining. The trend has captured the attention of private equity, with firms now seeing Indian cuisine as a viable and growing market.</p>

          <h2>Author Explores Why China Builds Rapidly While American Infrastructure Projects Stall</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 07:45:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his new book "Breakneck," author Dan Wang explores the stark contrast between China's rapid infrastructure development and America's struggles to build. He posits a key difference: China is an "engineering state" run by leaders with technical backgrounds who approach society as a problem to be solved, while the U.S. is a "lawyerly society" dominated by legal frameworks and procedures. This engineering mindset in China has led to monumental achievements in high-speed rail and bridges, but also to brutal social engineering projects like the one-child policy. The article suggests America's procedural focus, while protecting pluralism, has also led to paralysis and gridlock.</p>

          <h2>Legacy Coffee Chains Like Costa Face Challenges from Changing Tastes of Younger Consumers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 07:44:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Large coffee chains such as Costa Coffee are reportedly struggling as consumer preferences, particularly among younger generations, shift towards new trends like matcha and artisanal experiences. Newcomers like Blank Street Coffee have gained a cult following with trendy, colorful drinks that appeal to Gen Z and have a strong social media presence. Analysts suggest that the rise of home coffee machines and cost-of-living pressures mean customers expect a unique treat when they buy coffee out. This has put mid-market chains in a difficult position, caught between cheaper options and higher-end independent cafes, forcing them to re-evaluate their strategy.</p>

          <p>Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, 58, announced that he has received treatment for skin cancer. In an Instagram post, he revealed that doctors had removed a basal cell carcinoma, a common type of non-melanoma skin cancer. He thanked his medical team for their quick work and used the opportunity to urge his followers to use sunscreen to reduce their own risk. Ramsay shared a photo showing a plaster on the side of his face following the procedure. Basal cell carcinoma is often easily treated, and its primary cause is exposure to ultraviolet light from the sun or sunbeds.</p>
