          <p>England's Red Roses rugby team is preparing for a critical match against France, viewing it as a key step toward their goal of winning the Women's Rugby World Cup. Wing Abby Dow describes their journey as climbing "Everest," a metaphor reinforced by a talk from an actual Everest mountaineer. The team is focused on learning from their last narrow victory over France, aiming for a more dominant performance this time. Dow, who has recovered from injury, emphasizes the team's collective focus on the World Cup, setting aside personal contract negotiations until after the tournament.</p>

          <p>The European Union has sanctioned an Indian refinery, Nayara Energy, for processing Russian crude oil, raising questions about the future of a potential EU-India free trade agreement. However, experts suggest the move is largely symbolic and will not significantly impact trade negotiations. A more pressing issue for India is the threat of high tariffs on its goods from the United States under the Trump administration. This pressure from the U.S. may paradoxically push India to finalize a trade deal with the EU, seeking more stable and predictable economic partnerships. (not investment advice)</p>

Webster directed the FBI from 1978 to 1987 under Presidents Carter and Reagan, and then served as CIA director from 1987 to 1991 under Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush.

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully created high-purity hexagonal diamonds in a laboratory, a significant breakthrough in materials science. This rare diamond structure, first discovered in a meteorite in 1967, is distinct from the common cubic diamond and was believed to form under the immense pressure of meteorite impacts. Previous attempts by global research teams to synthesize this material resulted in mixed-phase samples. The Chinese team produced pure hexagonal diamond crystals up to 100 micrometres in size, providing definitive proof of the material's macroscopic existence and opening new research possibilities.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders delivered an impressive performance in his NFL preseason debut, earning praise from figures like LeBron James. Sanders, a fifth-round draft pick, started the game due to injuries and led three touchdown drives, completing 14 of 23 passes for 138 yards and two touchdowns. He displayed significant poise and pocket awareness against the Carolina Panthers in the Browns' 30-10 victory. While coach Kevin Stefanski was pleased, he noted it is too early to determine Sanders' future role in the team's open quarterback competition.</p>

          <p>Four astronauts from NASA's Crew-10 mission have begun their journey back to Earth after spending five months aboard the International Space Station. The crew, consisting of two American astronauts, one Japanese, and one Russian, undocked from the ISS in a SpaceX Dragon capsule for an 18-hour trip ending with a splashdown in the Pacific. During their 146-day mission, the astronauts conducted over 200 scientific experiments, studying phenomena like plant growth and cell behavior in microgravity. Their mission had replaced the Crew-9 astronauts who were temporarily stranded on the station due to equipment issues.</p>

          <p>Frustrated by the negative experiences and "dating burnout" from traditional dating apps, 30-year-old Lucy Rout has founded Haystack Dating, a company that organizes in-person events. The model aims to create more meaningful connections by matching attendees into small groups based on interests and personality traits before they engage in a shared activity. This approach counters the declining use of major dating apps, which studies have linked to negative mental health impacts. Rout's venture taps into a growing demand for real-life interactions, with even established apps now funding their own in-person events.</p>

          <p>Actor Chris Hemsworth has described learning he has a significantly higher genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's disease as a "gear shift" in his life. The discovery, made during filming for his show "Limitless," revealed he carries two copies of the APOE4 gene, increasing his likelihood of developing the disorder by eight to ten times. Hemsworth stated the news prompted him to re-evaluate his life's purpose, shifting his focus from what he can collect to what he can contribute. This change in mindset influenced the second season of his show, making it a more personal and educational exploration of health.</p>

          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is on the rise, as people spend on small luxuries and memorable experiences to boost their mood during uncertain economic times. This phenomenon, an evolution of the "lipstick effect," involves consumers cutting back on daily essentials while splurging on items like makeup or larger one-off events like concert tickets. Economists note this behavior is driven by a desire to inject guilt-free joy into life when traditional milestones like home ownership feel unattainable. This trend is expected to persist as global economic uncertainty continues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the renowned astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97. Lovell famously led his crew safely back to Earth after an in-flight explosion, turning a potential tragedy into what became known as a "successful failure."

The city's mayor praised the rapid intervention, which he said "averted a catastrophe." The blaze reportedly started in a chapel, possibly due to a short circuit in an electric sweeper. No major damage to the iconic structure was reported.

          <p>Walmart has agreed to a $5.6 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit filed by several California counties alleging the retailer overcharged customers. The lawsuit claimed that Walmart sold products, particularly items sold by weight like produce and baked goods, for prices higher than advertised or for weights less than labeled. This practice violates California's false advertising and unfair competition laws. As part of the settlement, Walmart will pay $5.5 million in civil penalties and has agreed to implement measures ensuring accurate pricing and weighing in its California stores.

          <p>This article analyzes the settlement between Disney and actress Gina Carano, who was fired from "The Mandalorian" in 2021 over controversial social media posts. The author argues that the settlement, which includes a statement from Lucasfilm hoping to work with Carano again, was the "right thing to do." It posits that the initial firing was an overreaction and an act of pandering to a social media mob. While acknowledging the current political climate, the piece frames the settlement not as corporate capitulation, but as a reasonable course correction for an extreme initial decision.</p>
