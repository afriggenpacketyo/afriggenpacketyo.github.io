          <p>China Telecom Quantum Group has launched what it claims is the world‚Äôs first commercial cryptography system impervious to hacking, even by quantum computers. The system integrates Quantum Key Distribution, which uses quantum mechanics for secure transmission of encryption keys, and Post-Quantum Cryptography, relying on complex mathematical problems for data lockdown. The company also completed a cross-regional quantum-encrypted phone call between Beijing and Hefei, spanning over 1,000km, utilizing this integrated system. As quantum computing advances, traditional cybersecurity frameworks face increasing threats, making this new system a significant development in data protection.</p>

Bale was inspired to take action 17 years ago when he looked at his young daughter and imagined her without parents. He recruited Tim McCormick to help him open Together California, a village in Los Angeles that houses groups of foster siblings in individual houses around a central garden, where they're cared for by trained foster parents. The village broke ground in February 2024 and is hoping to welcome the first kids early next year.</p>

          <p>Hawaii is renowned for lei-making, an ancient tradition with significant cultural importance. However, the future of this craft is threatened by suburban sprawl, climate change, and the disappearance of flower farms. As a result, around 90% of flowers used in leis are now imported, leading lei-makers to adapt by incorporating unconventional materials like unripe fruit and wood beads. Despite these challenges, the tradition persists, with events like the Annual Lei Day Celebration showcasing the artistry and cultural significance of lei making.</p>
