          <p>President Trump has arrived in Saudi Arabia, marking the start of his four-day tour through the Gulf, his first major overseas trip of his second term. He aims to secure business deals worth over $1 trillion with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, focusing on investments in artificial intelligence, energy, and arms purchases. The trip is under scrutiny due to the Trump family's pending deals with Saudi-owned real estate firms, a UAE cryptocurrency deal, and a Qatari-backed golf project. The article notes the ethical concerns surrounding the potential donation of a luxury Boeing 747-8 from the Qatari royal family for use as Air Force One. Relevant context includes the history of Trump's relationships with these nations and the potential conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>The UK jobs market is showing signs of cooling, with the unemployment rate increasing to 4.5% and the number of workers on payrolls falling. Wage growth has slowed but remains faster than inflation, while job vacancies have also decreased. The Office for National Statistics has cautioned that the unemployment figures should be treated with caution due to low response rates. Increases in employer National Insurance contributions and the National Living Wage in April are believed to have impacted recruitment. The Bank of England recently cut interest rates but is monitoring wage growth closely due to concerns about inflationary pressures.</p>

Cities like Jakarta are improving bus services and infrastructure to encourage public transport use.

          <p>The US Army is shifting its focus to deterring Chinese aggression in the Pacific, along with border security and missile defense. The changes include transforming the kinds of weapons America uses, how they are bought, and how fast they get into the hands of soldiers. The Army is redirecting billions of dollars from Cold War equipment to invest in systems better suited for high-intensity conflict. The Army Futures Command will merge its mission of tech innovation into a larger entity that also will provide training.</p>

          <p>The U.S.-China tariff cuts, even if temporary, address a major pain point: Christmas presents. The two global superpowers' sudden doubling of tariffs in early April forced some businesses to halt production, raising questions about whether supply chains would be able to resume work in time to get products on the shelves for Christmas. Nearly a fifth of U.S. retail sales last year came from the Christmas holiday season. U.S. duties on Chinese goods aren't completely gone.</p>
