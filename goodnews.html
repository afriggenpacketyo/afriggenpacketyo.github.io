          <p>Bronny James showcased his potential during a Lakers' NBA Summer League game, scoring 14 points in a victory over the New Orleans Pelicans. His father, LeBron James, was present courtside, actively offering instruction and encouragement throughout the game, which appeared to positively influence Bronny's play. The performance highlighted not only his scoring ability but also his solid defense and decision-making, earning praise from the Lakers' Summer League coach. This game was a significant moment for the younger James as he begins his professional career.</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests China's Upstream Dams May Increase India's Dry-Season Water Flow</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 00:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study offers initial evidence that China's large dams on the Brahmaputra river in Tibet may not cause the droughts in India that were previously feared. By analyzing data from two existing dams, Zangmu and Jiacha, researchers found that downstream water flow during the dry season has actually increased. Specifically, low flows in February were observed to be up by more than 50%, suggesting the dams help regulate the river by storing water during wet seasons and releasing it during dry periods. This finding provides a new perspective on the potential transboundary water impacts of China's dam projects.</p>

          <p>Iga Swiatek secured her sixth Grand Slam title by defeating American Amanda Anisimova in a remarkably one-sided Wimbledon women's final. Swiatek won the match 6-0, 6-0, in just 57 minutes, marking the first time a player failed to win a single game in the women's final in 114 years. For Anisimova, it was her first Grand Slam final appearance after a notable comeback to the sport, which included an upset victory over the world's number one player in the semi-finals. Swiatek's victory continues her impressive record in major finals, where she remains undefeated.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of devastating floods in Texas Hill Country, a group of over 30 active and former Navy SEALs have volunteered their expertise to assist in search and recovery efforts. The SEALs are utilizing their skills in navigating difficult terrain and diving to search the debris-laden Guadalupe River for missing persons. Volunteers described the immense destruction and the emotional difficulty of the task, particularly when finding children's belongings from a nearby camp. Their efforts are being supported by a non-profit organization that is providing meals to the hundreds of first responders and volunteers on site.</p>

          <p>China's space sector is experiencing a boom in private investment, aligning with global trends that project the space economy to reach US$1.8 trillion by 2035. This growth is driven by new commercial interests in areas like satellite constellations, space manufacturing, and resource mining on the moon and asteroids. Chinese private aerospace companies like i-Space and LandSpace have already achieved significant milestones, such as launching rockets into orbit. This expansion presents an opportunity for Hong Kong to leverage its financial and legal expertise to become a key hub supporting the nation's burgeoning private space industry.

          <p>Boeing's iconic C-17 Globemaster III, a massive military cargo aircraft, ceased production in 2015 primarily due to a lack of new orders and defense budget cuts. Developed in the 1980s, the C-17 was prized for its ability to carry heavy payloads, like tanks and helicopters, and land on short, undeveloped runways. After fulfilling the U.S. Air Force's order, and with international demand waning, Boeing closed the Long Beach production facility. Despite its discontinuation, 275 of the 279 aircraft built remain in service globally, and recent geopolitical conflicts have reportedly sparked discussions about potentially resuming its production.</p>

          <p>Several start-ups, including UK-based Better Dairy, are developing cheese using precision fermentation, a process that creates dairy proteins like casein without involving animals. The goal is to produce a vegan alternative that more closely mimics the taste and texture of traditional cheese, addressing a common criticism of current plant-based options. However, these companies face significant hurdles, including high initial production costs, regulatory approval processes for "novel foods," and a recent decline in the plant-based market. Success will depend on their ability to scale production, lower prices, and convince consumers to try their innovative products.</p>

This shift in consumption habits allows viewers to keep up with the drama without committing to the daily hour-long episodes.
