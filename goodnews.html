          <h2>Trump Administration Closes De Minimis Loophole, Increasing Prices for Shein and Temu</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 08:25:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has closed the 'de minimis' loophole, a trade rule that allowed retailers to ship packages worth less than $800 to the US without duties or taxes, impacting Chinese online retailers like Shein and Temu. The move, intended to combat the smuggling of illegal goods and protect American businesses, has led to price increases for US consumers. Shein and Temu have already raised prices in anticipation of the change, and experts estimate that eliminating the exemption could add billions in annual costs for consumers. The UK and EU are considering similar measures, which could lead to price increases for consumers there as well.</p>

          <p>A suspected glitch on the Deliveroo app caused some Co-op product prices to drop by as much as 100%, allowing some shoppers to acquire items like pasta sauce, coffee, and cookies for free. The Co-op acknowledged the pricing error, attributing it to a 'clerical error' that was quickly resolved. Some shoppers were able to take advantage of the low prices before the error was fixed, with one person obtaining over ¬£80 worth of goods for just ¬£3.29 and donating them to a local food bank. The incident is unrelated to a recent cyber attack affecting the Co-op's IT systems.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that Japan will prioritize its national interests in ongoing tariff negotiations with the United States, emphasizing that both nations need to make substantial efforts to reach an agreement. While describing the talks as 'very positive and constructive,' Ishiba acknowledged remaining gaps between the two countries. Japan is seeking exemption from higher tariffs on imports of cars, iron, steel, and aluminum, while the U.S. aims for Japan to further open its auto and farm sectors. Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato suggested using Japan's holdings of U.S. Treasuries as a bargaining chip in the trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>A relationship expert, Jackie Dorman, discusses the public's fascination and scrutiny surrounding the romance between Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson, highlighting the unusual nature of the relationship given Belichick's past. Dorman suggests that the public's speculation stems from the significant age gap and questions about the motivations behind the relationship. She notes that while age differences are not inherently problematic, a nearly 50-year age gap often raises concerns about transactional dynamics. Dorman also points out that statistics indicate a low success rate for marriages with large age gaps, emphasizing the importance of shared life goals and compatibility.</p>

While the State Department spokeswoman learned of Rubio's new role through social media, the appointment highlights the trust placed in him by Trump and his close relationship with Chief of Staff Susie Wiles.

While this offers a valuable tool for higher earners seeking tax deductions, a small percentage of retirement plans have not yet added this feature.

          <p>Cities across America, particularly in California, are increasingly adopting tiny homes and tougher laws to address homelessness. The Grants Pass v.

San Jose and San Francisco are leading the charge, with plans to build more temporary housing units and enforce anti-camping bans. While critics worry about a two-tiered housing system, supporters argue that interim housing is a faster and cheaper solution.
