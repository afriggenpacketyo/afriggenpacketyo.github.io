          <p>Liverpool claimed a dramatic 3-2 victory against Atletico Madrid in their Champions League opener, with a stoppage-time winner from Virgil van Dijk. The match saw Liverpool take an early 2-0 lead before Atletico fought back to equalize, continuing a trend of late-game heroics for the English club this season. The game also marked the debut of £125m signing Alexander Isak, who showed promising signs of linking up with new playmaker Florian Wirtz despite looking rusty. The result gives Liverpool a winning start to their European campaign, though their manager expressed concern over the team's pattern of conceding leads.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump praised the "special relationship" between the United States and the United Kingdom during a state visit featuring extensive royal ceremony at Windsor Castle. The visit, which Trump called one of the highest honors of his life, is seen by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer as an opportunity to secure economic investment and strengthen diplomatic ties. While Trump was treated to a lavish banquet and military welcome, thousands of protesters gathered in London to voice their opposition to the visit. The trip aims to convert Trump's known anglophilia into tangible benefits, including $42 billion in pledged tech investments from major U.S. companies.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to avoid making drastic portfolio changes. He argued that the move was widely expected and does not fundamentally alter major market themes, suggesting the mixed market reaction might even present buying opportunities. Cramer stated that investors should not trade based on Fed statements alone and pointed to sectors like technology and banking as areas that can continue to perform. He characterized the Fed's decision as a prudent, "steady as she goes" approach amid challenges like inflation and a weakening labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

The 11-time Grand Slam champion, who is currently in remission after an operation, revealed the diagnosis was psychologically difficult but that he is committed to fighting the disease. In the interview, the 69-year-old also reflected on his storied career, including his famous rivalry with John McEnroe, which he described as a fight to be the best in the world. Borg noted that while they were not friends during their playing days, he and McEnroe now share a good friendship.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's de facto central bank has cut its base interest rate for the first time this year, mirroring the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent 25-basis-point reduction. The move is intended to lower funding costs to support local businesses and ease the financial burden on mortgage holders in the city. The Fed's decision, which was widely anticipated, was justified by Chairman Jerome Powell as a response to growing signs of weakness in the U.S. labor market. This initial cut is viewed by many as the beginning of a rate-reduction cycle that could continue into the next year, reflecting concerns over economic conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following his team's 3-2 Champions League loss to Liverpool, Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone said he regretted his reaction towards home fans at Anfield. The incident occurred after Liverpool scored a late winner, when Simeone appeared to be goaded by supporters, leading to a heated exchange with the fourth official that resulted in his being sent off. While expressing remorse for his part, Simeone also criticized what he described as "insults for the whole game" from some fans. He called for managers to receive the same protection from insults as players do from racism, highlighting the intense pressure of the environment.</p>

          <h2>Experts Discuss the 'Boomer Panic' Stereotype Seen on Social Media</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The term "boomer panic," coined on TikTok, describes instances where older adults exhibit outsized frustration over minor inconveniences, particularly with technology or customer service. While not a clinical term, experts suggest these reactions may stem from factors like feeling overwhelmed by rapid technological change and the stress of being in the "sandwich generation." Some psychologists note that younger generations were raised to prioritize emotional regulation, whereas many baby boomers were not, potentially leading to lower frustration tolerance. However, research also indicates older adults are often better at managing stress, suggesting the viral trend is more of a stereotype than an accurate description of most individuals.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government is promoting a £150 billion investment package from U.S. companies, announced during President Trump's state visit, as a major economic victory. The deal, which includes a £90 billion commitment from private equity firm Blackstone, is intended to create thousands of jobs and demonstrate the UK's economic strength. However, the announcement has been met with some skepticism, with critics like former Deputy PM Nick Clegg calling a related tech deal "sloppy seconds from Silicon Valley." The investment news serves as a political buffer for Starmer, who has faced criticism for hosting the controversial U.S. president amid recent domestic political turmoil. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve's Interest Rate Decision: Five Key Takeaways</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point, a move that was widely expected by markets. The central bank's updated forecast, or "dot plot," signals the possibility of two more cuts before the end of the year but a more hawkish outlook for 2026 with only one anticipated reduction. Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the cut as a "risk management" move, and the mixed signals between short-term dovishness and long-term hawkishness led to an uneven market reaction. The decision was not unanimous, with new Governor Stephen Miran dissenting in favor of a larger half-point cut, highlighting a diversity of views within the committee. (not investment advice)</p>
