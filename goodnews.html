          <p>Sig Hansen, the veteran captain from the Discovery Channel series "Deadliest Catch," has admitted that his perspective on retirement is shifting due to fear and a desire to spend more time with his family. After decades on the treacherous Bering Sea, Hansen confessed that the loss of fellow fishermen and his own mortality have made him more fearful each time he goes out. While not ready to retire immediately, the 59-year-old explained that his priorities have changed, especially with four grandchildren at home, and that the call of family is growing stronger than the call of the sea.</p>

          <p>The non-profit organization Black People Will Swim is working to address a stark racial disparity in swimming ability, rooted in a history of segregation at public pools. Due to decades of exclusion, 64% of Black children have little to no swimming ability, and they are significantly more likely to drown than their white peers. Founder Paulana Lamonier started the organization to make swimming more accessible and create a ripple effect of more Black swim instructors and lifeguards. By providing lessons and support, the group aims to dismantle historical barriers and address what some call a public health crisis.</p>

The singer, who was born in London to Kosovan-Albanian parents, lived in Kosovo's capital, Pristina, for a period during her childhood. Lipa, who now holds British, Albanian, and Kosovan citizenship, said the honor "completes the duality I have always had within."

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-02 12:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has emerged as a national leader in solar energy, adding more utility-scale solar capacity than California last year, driven primarily by utility companies rather than rooftop installations. This growth is fueled by favorable economics, as solar becomes cheaper than natural gas, and streamlined state regulations that expedite project approvals. A key example is the solar-powered town of Babcock Ranch, which maintained power during Hurricane Ian, demonstrating the resilience of decentralized energy grids. However, future growth faces challenges from the rollback of federal tax credits and increasing strain on the existing power grid. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a stunning turn of events, Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc claimed a surprise pole position for the Hungarian Grand Prix, narrowly out-qualifying the dominant McLaren team. Leclerc's final lap was just enough to beat McLaren's Oscar Piastri by 0.026 seconds, with championship contender Lando Norris starting third. Leclerc expressed disbelief after the session, calling it one of his best pole positions because it was so unexpected after a difficult qualifying. The result sets up an intriguing race, with Mercedes and Aston Martin also showing strong pace while Red Bull's Max Verstappen struggled, qualifying in eighth.</p>

          <p>The general secretary of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), Dr. Wajid Akhter, has stated that Muslims must take a leading role in the artificial intelligence revolution or risk being marginalized. In a leaked video, he warned that the community risked missing the AI revolution just as it had missed previous technological shifts like the computer and social media revolutions. Dr. Akhter argued that Muslims, who were historically at the forefront of scientific advancement, must step up to ensure their values and perspectives are integrated into the development of AI, framing it as a crucial moment for the community's future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new psychological study indicates that tailoring fitness routines to match one's personality type could lead to greater enjoyment and adherence to exercise. The research found that extroverts tend to prefer high-intensity group workouts, while conscientious individuals enjoy goal-oriented activities like marathon training. People prone to anxiety may benefit more from private, one-on-one sessions, whereas those who are open and agreeable prefer varied and fun options like Zumba or rock climbing. The findings suggest that instead of forcing a particular workout, individuals may find more success by choosing activities that align with their natural tendencies.</p>

          <p>Comedian Marc Maron's latest HBO Max special, "Panicked," continues his exploration of personal anxiety and societal decay, tackling subjects from his cat's health to his father's dementia and the rise of fascism. The special is described as Maron at his most controlled, using long-form narratives and a confrontational yet self-reflective style to find humor in dark subjects, including his own potential childhood trauma. This article reviews the special as part of a loose trilogy of work where Maron's consistent, cantankerous voice remains a powerful tool for excavating humor from emotional vulnerability and a chaotic world.</p>

          <p>Construction on the new $9.5 billion Terminal 1 at New York's JFK International Airport is advancing, with the first phase scheduled to open in mid-2026. The terminal, which will be JFK's largest, is now weathertight, and its future ticket counters and baggage systems are taking shape. Designed specifically for international travelers, the facility will feature light-filled spaces, a dedicated AirTrain stop, and its own resilient microgrid. This project is a major part of the Port Authority's $19 billion overhaul of JFK, aimed at replacing aging infrastructure to accommodate growing air traffic.</p>

          <p>A newly declassified document from Special Counsel John Durham's investigation has further weakened claims of a high-level conspiracy to undermine Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. The document confirms that emails used to suggest a plot by Hillary Clinton's campaign were likely fabricated by Russian intelligence, a composite of materials obtained through hacking. This finding directly challenges the narrative pushed by National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard and others that a "deep state" manufactured intelligence about Russian interference. The disclosure reinforces previous findings by Robert Mueller and the Senate Intelligence Committee about the reality of Russia's actions.</p>

          <p>The Australian Wallabies secured a hard-fought 22-12 victory over the British and Irish Lions in a rain-soaked and dramatic final Test match in Sydney. The win prevented the Lions from achieving a 3-0 series whitewash, a feat they were hoping to accomplish. In a physical and intense contest delayed by lightning, Australia dominated early and outscored the tourists by three tries to two. The result marked a strong comeback for the Wallabies, who showed significant improvement throughout the series after a slow start in the first Test, ending the Lions' tour on a sour note.</p>
