        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from Adobe Analytics forecasts that U.S. online holiday spending will increase by 5.3% to $253.4 billion, a slower growth rate compared to the previous year's 8.7% rise. This deceleration reflects broader economic concerns and a consumer base that is increasingly focused on finding discounts. Despite the slowdown, spending is expected to remain robust as shoppers are determined to celebrate the season, with mobile devices anticipated to drive over half of all online sales for the first time.

The price adjustments also coincide with rising tariffs on goods made in Asia, which the company expects will significantly impact its gross margins in the coming fiscal year.

          <p>The International Criminal Court has convicted former Janjaweed militia commander Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman on 27 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The charges, which include murder, persecution, and sexual assault, relate to atrocities committed in Sudan's Darfur region in the early 2000s. This verdict marks a significant step toward accountability for the conflict, which resulted in the deaths of up to 300,000 people and the displacement of millions more under the regime of then-President Omar al-Bashir.</p>

          <p>As China formulates its 15th five-year plan, it is identifying the next five years as a critical period for achieving global leadership in science and technology, with a particular focus on artificial intelligence and semiconductors. This strategic push comes amid intensifying international competition and U.S.-led export restrictions that have limited Beijing's access to advanced chip-making technologies. The nation aims to build on its existing strengths in areas like 5G and new energy to close the gap in these key strategic sectors.</p>

          <p>Gold and Bitcoin have both reached record prices, fueled by investor uncertainty amid the U.S. government shutdown, global geopolitical instability, and concerns over the U.S. dollar's long-term viability. Gold surpassed $3,900 an ounce, acting as a traditional safe-haven asset, while Bitcoin broke the $125,000 barrier, benefiting from the Trump administration's supportive stance on cryptocurrencies. The dual rallies indicate a broader trend of investors seeking alternative assets and hedges against conventional economic and political risks. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece frames her success as the result of effectively building a media platform for a growing faction of centrists and disillusioned liberals who feel alienated by the modern left.</p>

          <p>Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi have been awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize in medicine for their foundational discoveries related to peripheral immune tolerance. Their collective work identified regulatory T cells (T-regs) and the controlling gene Foxp3, which are crucial for preventing the immune system from attacking the body's own tissues. This research has opened up a new field of immunology and is now pivotal for developing treatments for autoimmune diseases and certain types of cancer.</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, savers can find high interest rates on certificates of deposit (CDs), often surpassing the rate of inflation. An unusual market condition known as an inverted yield curve has resulted in short-term CDs, such as those with 6-month or 1-year terms, offering higher annual percentage yields than longer-term CDs. Financial experts suggest that online banks typically provide the most competitive rates, and savers can use a laddering strategy to take advantage of high short-term yields while planning for long-term goals.

          <p>A recent poll conducted by The Economist and YouGov indicates that talk show host Jimmy Kimmel holds a higher net favorability rating than President Donald Trump. The survey was conducted after a controversy in which Kimmel's show was temporarily suspended by ABC following pressure from the Trump administration, only to be reinstated after public outcry. The poll found Kimmel with a +3 net favorability, while Trump registered a -13, suggesting the public dispute may have bolstered the comedian's standing relative to the president.</p>
