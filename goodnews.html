          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed southeast of Bermuda and is tracking north-northeast in the open Atlantic Ocean. As of Sunday morning, it was located about 300 miles southeast of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 40 miles per hour. Forecasters anticipate it will strengthen into a hurricane by Monday before gradually weakening on Tuesday, posing no immediate threat to land and remaining well east of Bermuda. This development follows Hurricane Erin, which previously reached Category 5 strength without making landfall, causing strong winds and rip currents along parts of the East Coast. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had predicted an above-normal hurricane season this year, expecting between 13 and 18 named storms, with five to nine becoming hurricanes.</p>

          <p>Coyotes are increasingly adapting to urban environments across the US, with New York City's Central Park hosting a pair known as Romeo and Juliet. Naturalists and photographers are documenting their presence to educate the public, emphasizing that coyotes rarely attack humans and should be given space. This eastward expansion of coyotes, previously confined to the West, is attributed to declining wolf populations and suburbanization. While officials have historically mishandled urban coyote encounters, New York City now promotes coexistence through initiatives like WildlifeNYC, encouraging safe observation and responsible pet ownership to protect both humans and wildlife.</p>

        </div>

          <p>Gen Z has popularized the "performative male" meme on TikTok, poking fun at men who curate an alt, intellectual, and "soft" aesthetic, often to attract progressive women. These men might drink matcha, read feminist literature, or listen to women singer-songwriters. While largely lighthearted, the trend also raises deeper questions about authenticity, with some viewing such behaviors as strategic or deceptive, building on previous archetypes like the "wife guy." The article explores how this skepticism reflects broader distrust in dating, yet also suggests a potential shift towards acknowledging personal desires without immediate suspicion.</p>

The festivities began early Sunday with J'ouvert, where revelers were covered in bright paint and powder. Throughout the Bank Holiday weekend, a 72-second silence will be observed daily at 3 PM to honor the 72 lives lost in the Grenfell Tower fire, as well as those who have died at Carnival in recent years, and Kelso Cochrane, whose 1959 murder became one of the catalysts for the event. The annual celebration has been running for over 50 years.</p>

          <p>Former USC quarterback Todd Marinovich discusses his new memoir, "Marinovich: Outside the Lines in Football, Art and Addiction," describing the writing process as cathartic despite its difficulty. The book chronicles his journey from a football prodigy with an overbearing father to a drug-induced downfall, including his time at USC and with the Raiders. Marinovich reflects on his complicated relationship with his father, the early media attention that created a "monster" narrative, and his struggles with addiction, which he calls the hardest thing he's ever had to do. He shares lessons learned from his multiple "rock bottoms" and his ongoing path to recovery.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tennis is gaining popularity as a lifetime sport, offering comprehensive physical and cognitive benefits for players of all ages. Beyond being a full-body workout that improves cardiovascular health and bone density, studies show tennis players live nearly a decade longer than sedentary peers and other athletes. The sport demands complex motor coordination and rapid decision-making, providing significant cognitive advantages and buffering against decline. Despite minor injury risks, tennis ranks highly for safety among team sports. Its engaging learning curve and stress-reducing fun encourage long-term participation, making it an ideal activity for sustained well-being.</p>

          <p>An author shares her personal experience of reading aloud to her five children from birth, highlighting how the practice fostered deep connection and helped her understand their developing minds. She initially read poetry and novels, later incorporating board books with pictures. The article notes a concerning decline in parents reading aloud to young children in the UK, suggesting a missed opportunity for instilling a love of reading and guiding children's understanding of the world. The author emphasizes that this shared activity allowed her to "read" her child's expanding self through their expressions and engagement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues for a shift in AI development from full automation to collaborative tools, especially where human expertise remains crucial. It uses examples like radiology, where AI tools designed for automation can degrade human performance due to lack of transparency and collaborative features. The piece highlights the 2009 Air France Flight 447 crash as a cautionary tale of automation failure and human deskilling. Instead, it advocates for AI that amplifies human capabilities, like heads-up displays in aviation or Google's AMIE in medicine, by integrating AI's vast data processing with human judgment, context, and ethics.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores a radical proposal to combat climate change by treating excess atmospheric carbon as a "sacred hoard," similar to the US government's gold reserves in Fort Knox. Drawing on the history of monetary systems, experts Gustav Peebles and Ben Luzzatto suggest creating community-based carbon banks. These banks would accept organic waste, pyrolyze it into stable biochar, and issue digital currency to depositors, effectively taking carbon out of circulation. The idea aims to foster a grassroots movement, bypassing political gridlock, by imbuing waste carbon with symbolic and economic value to incentivize sequestration.</p>

The Met Office anticipates prolonged rain and potentially stormy weather later in the week.
