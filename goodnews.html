          <p>George Wendt, known for his iconic role as Norm Peterson on the sitcom "Cheers," has died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 76. A family representative confirmed that Wendt was a devoted family man and friend, having earned six Emmy nominations for his portrayal of the beer-loving barfly. Wendt began his comedy career at Chicago's The Second City theater, later appearing in shows like "M*A*S*H" and "Taxi" before landing his breakthrough role on "Cheers," where he starred in all 275 episodes. Wendt also made appearances on "Saturday Night Live" and in films such as "Fletch" and "Forever Young."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has outlined new regulatory guidance for future COVID-19 vaccine boosters, establishing stricter approval standards for healthy Americans. The agency will now require new clinical trials demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of COVID shots before approving them for healthy adults and children, a shift from previous approvals based on antibody response tests. This change aims to balance regulatory flexibility with robust scientific evidence, particularly for those at low risk of severe illness. The new guidelines may impact revenue for vaccine manufacturers like Pfizer and Moderna, but are viewed as fair and considerate of the benefits and risks associated with additional vaccinations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As discussions progress between Iran and the United States, the potential for Washington's investment in Iran following the lifting of sanctions emerges as a key consideration. While Tehran is open to enticing US investors, its willingness is highly conditional, particularly tied to complete sanctions relief. Iran is wary of economic espionage and investment frameworks which could involve strategic concessions. If a nuclear framework stabilizes, phased US investment under regional mediation could emerge as a possibility. However, any substantial economic opening would require approval from the US Congress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Joe Biden's recent diagnosis with advanced prostate cancer that has spread to his bones has sparked questions about screening practices and the disease's progression. Biden had not undergone prostate cancer screening during his last medical checkup in February 2024, as guidelines do not routinely recommend screenings for men over 70. His spokesperson said his last PSA test was in 2014. Doctors suggest that the cancer's rapid spread indicates an aggressive form of the disease. Experts emphasize the importance of tailoring medical decisions to the individual, highlighting that Biden's new urinary symptoms prompted further evaluation leading to the diagnosis.</p>

The vote authorizes the league to negotiate safety provisions and scheduling logistics with the NFL Players Association and international governing bodies. Each NFL club will be limited to one player on Olympic rosters, which will be selected by the national committee for each country. Flag football, a five-on-five non-contact sport, was approved as an Olympic sport in October 2023.

          <p>President Trump announced plans to construct a new missile defense shield called the "Golden Dome," estimating a cost of $175 billion with much of the system operational within three years. The project, led by Gen. Michael Guetlein, aims to intercept missiles from any location, including space. Trump stated the technology has improved since Reagan's "Star Wars" program, which this project echoes. Critics question the necessity and potential financial strain on other vital programs, while supporters highlight the need to protect against advanced aerial attacks. The project follows Trump's calls for a U.S. missile defense shield after observing Israel's Iron Dome.</p>

The State Department has said that Joseph St. Clair, whose release was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, was wrongfully detained. As Mr. Maduro has lost support both abroad and at home in recent years, his government has arrested dozens of prisoners from around the world to use as leverage in negotiations.</p>
