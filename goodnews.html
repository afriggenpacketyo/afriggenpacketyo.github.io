        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have developed electronic warfare technology that can create a 'ghost fleet' illusion on enemy radar. The system uses networked 1-bit jammers to mimic multiple warships, potentially deceiving incoming missiles and protecting real naval assets. Developed by the Beijing Research Institute of Telemetry, the technology was detailed in a peer-reviewed paper published in the Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics. This "unprecedented" technology aims to trick enemy missiles into pursuing phantom targets, allowing actual warships to evade radar detection entirely. The system utilizes signals that could deceive even advanced radar systems from a distance, offering a significant tactical advantage in naval warfare.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz has become Germany's new chancellor after a dramatic and unprecedented first-round vote failure, marking the weakest possible start to his leadership. Merz faces the daunting task of addressing economic woes, including stagnating GDP growth and divisions within the country over migration and defense spending. A key element of his plan is a 500 billion euro infrastructure and climate investment fund, but the turmoil surrounding his election has cast doubt on other fiscal policies. Overcoming distrust within the ruling coalition, comprised of the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party, will be crucial for implementing necessary economic reforms.</p>

          <p>Uber's first-quarter earnings exceeded expectations, but revenue fell slightly short, causing shares to drop. The ride-sharing company reported a 14% revenue increase and a net income of $1.78 billion, a significant improvement from the previous year's loss. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi highlighted the company's expansion in autonomous vehicles, noting an annual run-rate of 1.5 million autonomous vehicle trips. Despite a lawsuit from the FTC regarding deceptive billing practices for its Uber One subscription service, Khosrowshahi remains optimistic about the future of autonomous vehicle technology and its potential impact on Uber's business.</p>

          <p>Arsene Wenger, former Arsenal manager, is proposing a change to the offside rule to favor attacking players. Wenger suggests that a player should only be considered offside if their entire body is beyond the last defender, drawing a parallel to a rule change implemented after the 1990 World Cup to encourage more goals. He argues that the precision of VAR has eliminated the benefit of the doubt for attackers, making the game less exciting. The proposed adjustment aims to restore the advantage to the striker in cases of marginal offside decisions.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have identified a gene in upland rice that obstructs the development of deeper, thicker roots, which are crucial for drought resistance. By removing this gene, HMGB1, from irrigated rice, they were able to develop longer roots and greater drought tolerance, similar to upland rice. This discovery could transform widely cultivated irrigated rice into drought-tolerant varieties, enabling it to thrive in water-scarce environments. The findings, published in Molecular Plant, represent a significant step towards enhancing food security.</p>
