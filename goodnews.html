          <p>England's women's cricket team has advanced to the World Cup semi-finals after a tense four-run victory against co-hosts India. Heather Knight's century was instrumental in setting England's total of 288, but India appeared poised for victory, led by Smriti Mandhana's 88 runs. A late-game collapse by India's middle order following Mandhana's dismissal allowed England to clinch the win in the final over. The victory continues England's winning streak, while India now faces a difficult path to the semi-finals.</p>

          <p>Following meetings with top CEOs in San Francisco, a financial commentator shared several key takeaways about the current market, particularly in the tech sector. He noted that Salesforce's AI platform is showing real-world utility, potentially boosting the company's outlook, while skepticism grows around OpenAI's consumer-focused spending. The article also emphasized that the AI chip market is not a zero-sum game, with room for Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom to thrive simultaneously. It advised caution on nuclear and quantum computing stocks, suggesting they are currently overvalued. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new book titled "The Biblio Diet" suggests that a dietary plan based on foods mentioned in the Bible can significantly improve physical and spiritual health. Co-authors Dr. Josh Axe and Jordan Rubin, who both credit the diet with helping them overcome serious health issues, advocate for consuming foods like red meat, olive oil, and whole-grain sourdough. The authors also highlight the importance of spiritual practices like fasting and prayer as part of a holistic wellness approach. They recommend avoiding processed foods and items designated as "unclean" in the Bible, such as pork and shellfish.</p>

          <p>While smoking prevalence has significantly decreased in Southeast Asia over the past two decades due to strong public health policies, the fight against tobacco is not over. Population growth has led to an increase in the absolute number of smokers, and the region now confronts the rising popularity of e-cigarettes, particularly among adolescents. Furthermore, the tobacco industry continues to exert considerable influence on policy, as seen in Indonesia, which has not ratified the WHO's tobacco control framework and recently scrapped a planned tax hike. These factors present ongoing challenges to public health initiatives.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to resume processing student loan forgiveness for borrowers in two specific income-driven repayment plans, settling a lawsuit filed by the American Federation of Teachers. The administration had previously paused cancellations under the Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) and Pay as You Earn (PAYE) plans, citing court orders related to a different program. This agreement reopens a crucial path to debt relief for over 2.5 million borrowers enrolled in these plans. The administration also clarified that forgiveness granted in 2025 will not be subject to federal taxes.</p>

          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has indicated that the government is considering cutting the 5% VAT on household energy bills ahead of the November Budget. While not confirming the move, Miliband acknowledged the severe "cost-of-living crisis" and stated that officials are "looking at all of these issues." This potential measure comes as the government faces pressure to reduce high energy costs, which recently increased again under the regulator's price cap. Scrapping the VAT could save the average household around £86 per year, offering some relief to struggling families.</p>

          <p>American figure skater Ilia Malinin began his Olympic season with a commanding performance, winning the Grand Prix de France by an astounding 40-point margin. The 20-year-old, known as the "Quad God," successfully landed five quadruple jumps in his free skate, securing a total score of 321.00. This victory extends his unbeaten streak to nearly two years and solidifies his position as a top contender for the upcoming Winter Olympics. Malinin achieved the dominant win without even attempting his signature quadruple axel, a jump he is the only person to have ever landed in competition.</p>

          <p>The 2025 J.D. Power North American Airport Satisfaction Study has identified the top-performing "mega-airports," defined as those serving 33 million or more passengers annually. The study evaluates overall satisfaction based on factors like ease of travel, terminal facilities, and food and retail options. For the second consecutive year, the same three airports topped the list, praised for their efficiency in core services like security screening and cleanliness. An expert noted that while the ongoing government shutdown is affecting air travel, it has not yet had a "huge impact" on these satisfaction rankings.</p>

          <p>A financial analysis illustrates the mathematical reality that larger investment losses require disproportionately larger gains to break even. For example, a 50% loss necessitates a 100% gain to recover the initial value. However, historical data for the S&P 500 shows that the market consistently overcomes these hurdles, demonstrating an "asymmetric upside." While the average bear market decline is 31%, the average bull market that follows has delivered a 254% return, far exceeding what is needed to simply recover losses and reach new highs over the long term.

          <p>The streets of Madrid were filled with the sounds of bells and bleating as thousands of sheep and goats were herded through the city for the annual Transhumance Festival. The event, which draws large crowds, honors the ancient pastoral practice of moving livestock between seasonal grazing grounds. Organizers use the parade to highlight the environmental benefits of traditional grazing, which helps prevent wildfires by clearing flammable undergrowth. The festival serves as a vibrant connection to the region's rural heritage, briefly transforming the modern urban landscape into an ancient migration route.</p>

          <p>Following more than a week of intense and deadly fighting, Pakistan and the Taliban government in Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire. The agreement, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, aims to establish mechanisms for lasting peace after the worst clashes since the Taliban regained power in 2021. The conflict had escalated amid accusations from Islamabad that the Taliban harbors militant groups, a claim the Taliban denies. Both sides will refrain from hostile actions and are scheduled to hold further talks in Istanbul to consolidate the truce.</p>
