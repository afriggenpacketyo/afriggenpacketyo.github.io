          <p>Novo Nordisk has revised its 2025 sales growth projections downwards, anticipating sales growth between 13% and 21%, which is below the previous forecast of 16% to 24%. Despite exceeding first-quarter profit expectations with a net profit of 29.03 billion Danish kroner ($4.4 billion), the company faces increased competition from copycat compounders affecting Wegovy sales. While Wegovy sales rose 83% to 17.36 billion Danish kroner, they fell slightly short of analyst predictions. Overall, Novo Nordisk's revenues increased by 18% to 78.09 billion Danish kroner, aligning closely with anticipated figures, and Ozempic sales surpassed forecasts, reaching 32.72 billion Danish kroner.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani continued his impressive form by hitting his 10th home run of the season during the Los Angeles Dodgers' 5-4 loss to the Miami Marlins in 10 innings. Ohtani's solo home run tied the game in the sixth inning, marking his fifth consecutive season with double-digit home runs. He also contributed a double, finishing the game with two hits and two RBIs. Despite Ohtani's efforts and a home run from Freddie Freeman, the Dodgers were unable to secure the win, with Miami ultimately prevailing thanks to a walk-off single by Jesus Sanchez.</p>

          <p>A new bill proposed in Parliament seeks to add up to two years in prison for criminals in England and Wales who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings. The move aims to prevent offenders from evading justice, as stated by victims' families whose loved ones' killers did not attend sentencing. While some believe the additional sentence may not be a significant deterrent for those facing lengthy jail terms, others suggest restricting family visits and parole eligibility as alternative measures. The article reports that the bill is a step in the right direction for families who seek a moment of reckoning for the convicted.</p>

          <p>China's top securities regulator, the CSRC, has committed to further opening up financial markets and improving foreign institutional access, particularly emphasizing Hong Kong's role as a global finance hub. This move comes as trade tensions and decoupling risks between China and the US intensify. The CSRC plans to simplify approval processes for foreign investors, encourage foreign firms to apply for licenses in securities and fund advisory services, and support yuan-denominated stock counters in the southbound Stock Connect mechanism. The regulator also aims to protect the interests of Chinese companies listed abroad and facilitate overseas-listed firms to offer shares on mainland and Hong Kong exchanges.</p>

          <p>Seagate, a data storage firm, plans to develop a 100-terabyte hard drive by 2030, citing increased demand from data centers due to the artificial intelligence boom. BS Teh, Seagate's chief commercial officer, said that the company aims to launch such a drive, which would have about three times the capacity of the firm's top-of-the-line hard drives. The company's largest hard disk drive is currently the 36-terabyte Exos M model. The company is positioning itself as an AI player amid the rise of foundational models like those being developed by OpenAI, Microsoft and Google.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions are facing squad selection issues ahead of their announcement, particularly regarding the captaincy. Caelan Doris's shoulder injury during Leinster's Champions Cup semi-final has cast doubt on his touring hopes, potentially clearing the path for Maro Itoje to be captain. Former England and British and Irish Lions scrum-half Matt Dawson believes Itoje is the ideal choice due to his guaranteed team spot, respected leadership, and strong recent form for England. Shane Horgan agrees, noting Itoje's respected aura is essential for a Lions captain.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have announced a series of policy measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, to stimulate economic growth amidst trade concerns. The People's Bank of China will cut the seven-day reverse repurchase rates by 10 basis points to 1.4%. Measures to support financing for key sectors like technology and real estate were also announced, along with a 500-billion-yuan relending tool for consumption and elderly care. Analysts suggest that these measures are a response to the depreciation pressure on the Chinese yuan and reflect a greater urgency to bolster the economy.</p>

These changes reflect the island's independence-leaning authorities' ongoing efforts to grapple with and redefine historical narratives. The revised guidelines also reflect the 2014 reclassification of Taoyuan as a metropolitan area.</p>
