        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO leaders have gathered in The Hague for a summit focused on European security, with all 32 members expected to pledge 5% of national output to defense. Secretary General Mark Rutte praised President Trump's handling of the Western alliance and the situation in Iran. The summit, scaled back to accommodate Trump's schedule, includes discussions on increased defense spending and support for Ukraine, where recent Russian attacks have caused numerous casualties, including children. Despite the commitment to increased spending, many NATO members still fall short of the alliance's defense spending targets, but some countries are taking steps to meet these goals by the end of the decade. The commitment includes a portion dedicated to core defense requirements and another portion allocated to defense-related expenditures such as cybersecurity and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>President Trump is pressuring Congress to pass his "big, beautiful bill" before lawmakers leave for vacation. He urged senators to remain in session until a deal is reached, emphasizing the importance of passing the bill immediately. The bill faces challenges in the Senate due to policy disagreements, particularly regarding its impact on federal deficits and the state-and-local-tax deduction cap. Senate Majority Leader John Thune is pushing for a vote this week, despite some GOP lawmakers' reservations. The self-imposed deadline for Republicans to pass the bill is July 4th.</p>

          <p>New Orleans Saints defensive end Cameron Jordan has voiced his opinion that the NFL should relax its rules on taunting and excessive celebrations. Speaking at Fanatics Fest, Jordan argued that players should be allowed to celebrate touchdowns and sacks without penalty. The NFL has cracked down on taunting in recent seasons, leading to a decrease in flags, but Jordan believes that harmless taunting and celebration should be allowed. He argues that allowing players to express themselves adds to the entertainment value of the game.</p>

Sources suggest Xi's absence is due to his having met with Brazilian President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva twice recently, once at the G20 summit and again in Beijing. Xi has never missed a BRICS summit as China's leader, though he did send a commerce minister in his place at the last minute in 2023.</p>
