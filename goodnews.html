          <p>The White House has announced plans to construct a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a project long advocated by President Trump. The $200 million cost will be covered by private donations, including from the president himself, with construction slated to begin in September. This new facility, to be built alongside a modernized East Wing, will seat approximately 650 guests, eliminating the need for temporary tents for large state functions. The administration states the design will respect the historical architecture of the White House while providing a much-needed venue for future administrations.</p>

          <p>Pop star Justin Timberlake has disclosed that he battled a "relentlessly debilitating" case of Lyme disease throughout his recent Forget Tomorrow world tour. The 44-year-old singer shared on Instagram that the diagnosis explained the severe nerve pain and fatigue he experienced on stage. Despite the physical and mental toll, he chose to continue the tour, viewing it as a test of his mental tenacity. Timberlake's revelation comes after a challenging year that also included a DWI arrest, and he stated he aims to be more transparent about his personal struggles with his fans.</p>

          <p>The British government is reforming its civil service internship program to exclusively admit university students from "lower socio-economic backgrounds." This change, driven by minister Pat McFadden, aims to increase representation from working-class families within Whitehall and ensure the civil service better reflects the country it serves. Successful interns will be given priority for the Fast Stream, the main graduate entry program. The move is part of a broader effort by the Labour government to make the civil service less dominated by privileged individuals and to diversify its talent pool.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook stated the company will "significantly" increase its investments in artificial intelligence and is "very open" to mergers and acquisitions to accelerate its AI roadmap. This comes as Apple faces pressure to match the massive AI spending of competitors like Google and Microsoft. While Apple's capital expenditures are lower, Cook noted the company is reallocating internal staff to focus on AI features and has acquired around seven smaller companies this year. He emphasized Apple's strategy is to create AI features that are personal, private, and seamlessly integrated across its platforms. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers had a relatively quiet trade deadline, making modest additions rather than the blockbuster deals of their National League rivals. The team acquired veteran relief pitcher Brock Stewart and outfielder Alex Call to address key needs without giving up significant prospect capital. This conservative approach signals that the front office is betting on its current talented roster, which won the World Series last year, to find its form. While competitors like the San Diego Padres made major acquisitions, the Dodgers are counting on internal improvement and returning injured players for their late-season push.</p>

          <p>FICO CEO Will Lansing defended his company's pricing structure against criticism from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), stating the cost of a FICO score is not a barrier to homeownership. He noted that the $4.95 charge for a mortgage score is a minimal part of the thousands in closing costs. This response follows the FHFA's decision to allow lenders to use rival VantageScore, a move Lansing claims raises "safety and soundness concerns." He asserted FICO's dominance in the market is due to its superior predictive power, not a government mandate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cole's French Dip, a historic Los Angeles restaurant, has postponed its planned closure for 45 days following an overwhelming outpouring of community support. Since the closure was announced, long lines of customers have flocked to the establishment, which claims to have invented the French dip sandwich. The surge in business prompted owner Cedd Moses to negotiate a temporary extension with the landlord, providing a brief reprieve for the staff and loyal patrons. While grateful for the support, Moses stated the business model remains challenging and is actively seeking a new buyer who will preserve the landmark's legacy.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve pausing interest rate cuts, consumers carrying high-interest credit card debt are advised to create a proactive repayment strategy rather than waiting for external relief. Financial experts suggest borrowers assess their situation and consider independent debt-reduction methods like the "debt snowball" or "debt avalanche" plans. For those with significant balances, exploring professional debt relief services such as debt management programs or credit counseling may be beneficial. The article stresses the importance of taking control of one's finances now, as even future rate cuts are likely to have a minimal impact on high credit card APRs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is bringing back the presidential fitness test, a program first initiated in 1956 by President Eisenhower over concerns about national security and the physical fitness of American youth compared to Europeans. The test typically assessed cardiovascular fitness, strength, and flexibility through exercises like a one-mile run and pull-ups. However, its effectiveness is debated, as data from recent decades shows that child health metrics in the U.S. have generally worsened, not improved. The revival of the test reopens a long-standing discussion about the role of schools in promoting physical health among children.</p>

With rates for both account types currently over 4%, the difference in interest earned over a year is often minimal, though high-yield savings accounts currently have a slight edge. The choice between the two may therefore depend on other features, such as the check-writing capabilities and debit card access that often come with money market accounts.
