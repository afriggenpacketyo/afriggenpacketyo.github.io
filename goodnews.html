          <p>TeleMessage, an Israel-founded messaging app used by former President Trump's national security advisor, has temporarily suspended its services due to a potential security incident. The app, marketed as a secure way for government agencies to retain copies of chats, is investigating the breach with an external cybersecurity firm. The suspension follows reports that TeleMessage's method of storing messages could undermine Signal's end-to-end encryption. The app was photographed on Mike Waltz's phone during a Cabinet meeting, showing communications with high-ranking officials. This situation raises concerns about the security of official communications and adherence to federal record-retention laws.</p>

          <p>A brief outage at Newark Liberty International Airport caused air traffic control computer screens to go dark for approximately 60 to 90 seconds, preventing controllers from communicating with aircraft. The incident contributed to already significant delays at the airport, which were exacerbated by air traffic control tower staffing shortages, runway construction, and adverse weather conditions in the New York City metro area.

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway shares are under pressure following Warren Buffett's surprise announcement to step down as CEO, with Greg Abel set to replace him. Buffett will remain as chairman. Berkshire Class A shares dropped 3.7% after closing at a record high. Shareholders expressed confidence in the transition but also recognized the end of an era for Berkshire, which Buffett transformed from a failing textile mill into a juggernaut worth nearly $1.2 trillion.</p>

          <h2>Social Security Reduces Overpayment Clawbacks to 50% After Concerns Over Financial Hardship</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 14:50:00 EDT</div>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is reducing overpayment clawbacks to 50% from 100% after concerns that it could cause financial hardship for tens of thousands of beneficiaries. The change comes after the SSA started recovering erroneous overpayments by taking 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check, up from the prior rate of 10%. The agency's inspector general found that 73,000 overpayments in 2022 were due to problems with Social Security's own calculations. The 50% clawback for overpayments started April 25, according to the SSA's statement.</p>

          <p>A debt management program could help ease the burden caused by high-rate debt, but you'll need to qualify first. These programs consolidate unsecured debts into one manageable monthly payment, lower interest rates, waive certain fees and set up a multi-year repayment schedule. To qualify, you'll need eligible types of debt, sufficient income, a meaningful level of debt, willingness to close your credit cards and approval from a counselor. If you don't qualify, other options include debt settlement, debt consolidation and bankruptcy. (not investment advice)</p>
