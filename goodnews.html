          <p>Billy Evans, the partner of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, has raised millions for a new AI-driven biotech startup named Haemanthus, which aims to develop a product for medical testing. Holmes, currently serving an 11-year prison sentence for fraud related to Theranos, has been advising Evans on the startup. Haemanthus is in its early stages and is focusing on Raman spectroscopy, a technology that can help diagnose diseases like ALS and cancer, with the goal of making it commercially available to patients by using light detection technology and AI sensors. The company hopes to lower the technology's cost and expand its accessibility, with potential applications in testing biological materials such as sweat, urine, saliva, and blood.</p>

          <p>Mexico has filed a lawsuit against Google after the tech giant changed the label for the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on its maps platform, following a U.S. presidential order to rename the body of water. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that the lawsuit was filed because Google's change affects the continental shelf of Mexico and Cuba, despite the U.S. order only applying within U.S. territory. Google Maps now displays the Gulf as 'Gulf of America' within the U.S., 'Gulf of Mexico' within Mexico, and both names elsewhere, citing its policy of following local official names where they vary between countries. The lawsuit follows the House's passage of the Gulf of America Act, which seeks to codify the name change.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani hit a three-run home run in the ninth inning, capping off a wild comeback for the Dodgers in a high-scoring game against the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Dodgers had initially built a five-run lead, which they squandered before rallying in the ninth inning with doubles from Andy Pages and Kik√© Hern√°ndez, and a single from Max Muncy to tie the game. The Diamondbacks' decision to pitch to Ohtani with a runner on proved costly, as he launched the game-winning home run. The game featured multiple lead changes and highlighted both teams' offensive capabilities in a hitter-friendly environment.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is preparing to introduce new measures aimed at reducing UK net migration, which stood at 728,000 last year. The proposed plans will require employers to invest in UK skills before hiring workers from overseas, targeting sectors like IT and telecommunications. Visa applications from countries with high overstay rates, such as Pakistan, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka, may face stricter screening. Additionally, migrants may need to wait longer before applying for permanent residency, and English language requirements could be tightened, with new rules already in effect for recruiting international care workers.</p>

          <p>Former New Labour cabinet member Lord Mandelson, now the UK's ambassador to the US, has praised the recent UK-US trade deal as a foundation for expanding trade opportunities between the two nations. The deal reduces or eliminates tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on some UK imports, including cars, steel, and aluminum. While discussions about the UK's Digital Services Tax (DST) continue, Mandelson clarified that abolishing the DST was not part of the agreement. Despite differences, Prime Minister Starmer and President Trump maintain a strong working relationship focused on defending their respective national interests.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese officials in Geneva to discuss de-escalating trade tensions. The talks come after President Trump raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, prompting China to retaliate with 125% levies. While expectations for a major breakthrough are low, there is hope that both countries will agree to scale back tariffs, which could relieve financial markets and businesses dependent on U.S.-China trade. Trump has suggested the U.S. could lower its tariffs to 80%, and the meetings are the first between Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released from immigration custody after a judge ordered her to be freed on bail. The judge cited "very substantial" claims that her First Amendment and due process rights were violated when her student visa was revoked following an opinion piece she co-authored. Ozturk's lawyers stated that she had been a political prisoner for six weeks and they are looking forward to seeing the government in court to vindicate her rights in full.</p>
