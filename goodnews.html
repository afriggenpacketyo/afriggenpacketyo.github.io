          <p>According to a report in The New York Times, the UK is poised to become the first nation to establish a trade agreement with the U.S. after President Trump hinted at a forthcoming announcement. While neither the White House nor the British Embassy responded to requests for confirmation, a UK Department for Business and Trade spokesperson affirmed ongoing discussions with the U.S., emphasizing the aim to alleviate pressures on UK businesses and consumers. The nature of the potential agreement remains unclear, with possibilities ranging from a finalized deal to a framework for future negotiations. The optimism score is based on the potential for economic cooperation between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) has revealed a takeover bid of 2.37 trillion yen to acquire the remaining shares of NTT Data Group Corp., aiming to make it a wholly-owned subsidiary. This strategic move is intended to enhance the competitiveness of NTT's overseas businesses, which are primarily managed by NTT Data. NTT, which already holds approximately 58 percent of NTT Data Group shares, will purchase the remaining stock through a tender offer, subsequently delisting the unit from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The reorganization aims to streamline operations and bolster NTT's global presence in the telecommunications sector.</p>

          <p>Nintendo forecasts selling 15 million units of its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026, marking the first sales projection since announcing the successor to its popular Switch device. The Switch 2, priced at $449.99 in the U.S., is set to launch in June with improved features. This forecast comes after Nintendo lowered its sales expectations for the original Switch to 11 million units for the year ended March 31. Investors are hopeful that the company can maintain its success, driven by popular games and expansion into films, though delays in pre-orders due to tariffs have posed challenges.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's has postponed its auction of sacred jewels linked to Buddha's remains in Hong Kong after the Indian government threatened legal action. India argued that the relics constituted inalienable religious and cultural heritage and that their sale would violate Indian and international laws. The auction, which had drawn criticism from Buddhist academics and monastic leaders, was suspended to allow for discussions between the involved parties. The collection, known as the Piprahwa Gems, was unearthed in northern India nearly 130 years ago, alongside bone fragments identified as belonging to the Buddha.</p>

Once admired as a tech visionary, Musk is now disliked by many Americans, while Navarro represents the slash-and-burn version of Trump‚Äôs foreign trade policy.
