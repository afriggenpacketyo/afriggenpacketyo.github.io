          <p>Analysts suggest that the United States could leverage next-generation fighter jets and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs), or ‚Äúloyal wingmen,‚Äù to counterbalance China's numerical advantage in military fleet size, potentially extending operational reach in the Indo-Pacific region. General David Allvin, US Air Force chief of staff, highlighted the YFQ-42A UCAV as part of the collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) program, emphasizing its cost-effectiveness and lethality. Developed by General Atomics, the UCAV is undergoing ground testing, with production slated for 2026, while China is also advancing in military technology, narrowing the technological gap.</p>

          <p>A significant power outage impacted southeastern France, causing traffic disruptions and a temporary halt to activities at the Cannes Film Festival as it prepared for its closing ceremony. About 160,000 households in the Alpes-Maritimes department experienced electricity loss due to a fallen high-voltage line, following an earlier fire at an electrical substation near Cannes. While the Palais des Festivals switched to an independent power supply to ensure scheduled events proceeded, screenings at the Cineum were briefly suspended.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump delivered the commencement address at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, amid his administration's crackdown on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in the military. West Point recently disbanded several student clubs, including the National Society of Black Engineers, following Presidential Executive Orders. Trump previously dismissed military academy boards, alleging leftist ideology. Critics, including former West Point teachers, argue these actions undermine the values and education of the academies. Two protests were planned during the ceremony. Trump's prior address in 2020 raised health concerns due to his movements.</p>

Early data for 2025 suggests the possibility of the lowest murder rate in US history. The decline is attributed to the waning pandemic, the return of social services, and government interventions like community violence interruption programs. Despite the positive trends, public perception lags behind reality, influenced by bad news bias and the prevalence of crime stories in the media.</p>

The surgery, performed by Dr. Eugene Grossi, involved carefully removing the thickened pericardium. Mauceri has since recovered and resumed conducting, expressing gratitude for the medical intervention.</p>

          <p>Labour MPs are increasingly questioning Chancellor Rachel Reeves' fiscal policies, particularly welfare cuts and tax increases. A leaked memo highlighted disagreements within the government regarding economic strategies. Critics propose alternative approaches, including a wealth tax and relaxed fiscal rules, to alleviate pressure on unprotected departments. Some MPs advocate for restoring the 50p top tax rate and aligning capital gains tax with income tax. Others suggest revising the Office for Budgetary Responsibility's remit and implementing a windfall tax on companies that profited from Covid contracts. The debate reflects growing unease within Labour's ranks regarding economic priorities.</p>
