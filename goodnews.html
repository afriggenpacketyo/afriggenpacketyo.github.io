          <p>Salman Rushdie, in his first major television interview since the 2022 attack, discusses the near-death experience and his new book, "Knife," which explores the incident and its aftermath. Rushdie recounts having a premonition of the attack and describes the moment he was stabbed multiple times at a literary festival in Chautauqua, New York. He reflects on the irony of speaking about protecting writers under threat and the feeling of being dragged back into the past. Despite losing his right eye, Rushdie expresses a determination to fight back with art and language, refusing to be defined solely by the attack. The author's resilience and commitment to free expression are evident as he reclaims his narrative through writing. </p>

          <p>Salman Rushdie discusses the growing trend of censorship in America, noting that it comes from both progressive and conservative voices. He argues that suppressing speech, even with good intentions, can be a slippery slope that ultimately harms minority groups. Rushdie, who faced a fatwa for his novel "The Satanic Verses," emphasizes the importance of hearing from voices that may offend, as they challenge people and promote critical thinking. He expresses concern that offense has become an aspect of identity politics and encourages people to simply shut a book if it offends them. Rushdie hopes to be remembered for his lifetime of storytelling rather than the threats to his life. </p>

          <p>An exploration into why Australia produces a disproportionate number of successful actors, directors, and film crew, including Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, and Cate Blanchett, the article delves into the country's unique theatrical culture and training institutions. The National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), with its rigorous training and emphasis on devising original work, plays a significant role in shaping Aussie talent. The article highlights the importance of a "can-do" attitude, strong training grounds like NIDA and soap operas, and a grounding upbringing in fostering self-reliance. The distance from Hollywood is also seen as a blessing, allowing actors to develop their skills without constant scrutiny. </p>

          <p>The article explores the increasing use of robots in sculpture, particularly in Carrara, Italy, where Michelangelo once sought marble. Companies like Robotor use robots to carve stone with precision and speed, but not all artists are happy with this development. Some artists believe that only a human touch can create true art, while others embrace robots as tools that enable new possibilities. The debate raises questions about the nature of artistry and the role of technology in creative expression. The use of robots is seen as a way to revive Carrara's artistic fortunes by handling the heavy lifting, while still allowing human artisans to add the final touches. </p>
