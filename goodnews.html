The release involved a temporary pause in combat in the Gaza area where Alexander was held, and he was met by his mother at an Israeli military base before being taken to a Tel Aviv hospital. The agreement is viewed as a goodwill gesture towards the Trump administration and a potential opening for broader conflict talks. Israel remains committed to securing the release of all remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at slashing drug costs by tying U.S. medicine prices to those in other developed nations. The "most favored nation" policy seeks to ensure the U.S. pays the lowest price available worldwide, targeting countries that negotiate lower drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. The order directs agencies to crack down on foreign policies that "suppress" drug prices and establishes a pathway for U.S. patients to buy drugs directly from manufacturers at the lowest prices. The policy could help patients by lowering prescription medication costs, which is an issue top of mind for many Americans.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has unveiled new immigration measures aimed at significantly reducing net migration over the next four years. The proposals include banning the recruitment of care workers from overseas, tightening access to skilled worker visas, and raising costs for employers who hire foreign staff. While no precise target was set, the Home Office estimates these policies could lead to a 100,000 drop in immigration per year by 2029. These measures are intended to bring the immigration system "back into control" and ensure a "selective" and "fair" system, although some critics argue the changes don't go far enough, while others accuse Starmer of mimicking far-right rhetoric.</p>

          <p>President Trump is pushing for drugmakers to lower their prices to match those charged in other high-income countries, threatening to impose steep caps on Medicare earnings if they don't comply. He stated that the U.S. will no longer subsidize the healthcare of foreign countries and claimed that some drug prices could be reduced by 50% to 90% almost immediately. This move expands on the "most favored nation" idea, seeking to revive price caps in Medicare and allow Americans to buy drugs directly from manufacturers at the lowest prices.

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to a temporary reduction in tariffs, signaling a potential de-escalation in their ongoing trade war. The U.S. will reduce tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% from 145%, while China will lower its import duties on American goods to 10% from 125%. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized that neither side wants a decoupling of their economies and that the agreement breaks an impasse that had halted much trade.

Trump had initially threatened severe consequences for any country that defied him, but China's countermeasures led to a 90-day agreement with reduced tariffs. This situation underscores that submission to Trump's demands often leads to further abuse, while standing up to him, though not guaranteeing victory, prevents exploitation. The lesson is that succumbing to a bully like Trump only guarantees a loss.</p>

          <p>Treasury yields increased as the U.S. and China reached an agreement to slash tariffs, signaling optimism about avoiding a recession. The 10-year Treasury yield rose, and the 2-year Treasury yield jumped significantly. The U.S. and China negotiated a trade deal to lower tariffs, with both countries announcing the suspension of most levies implemented on each other's imports. BMO noted that the thawing of trade relations between the U.S. and China would afford the Fed further flexibility. The fed funds futures market implies a low likelihood of a rate cut from the Federal Reserve in the near term.</p>

          <p>The royal family of Qatar is donating a jumbo jet for President Trump's exclusive use as a presidential plane, though it will not be ready for his current trip to the Middle East. The plane, a 747-8, needs to undergo security checks before being accepted and will be donated to the future Trump presidential library shortly before he leaves office. Trump defended receiving the plane, calling it a "gift" and noting the current Air Force One is nearly 40 years old. The move has prompted ethical concerns and calls for investigation.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that tirzepatide, sold as Zepbound and Mounjaro, leads to more significant weight loss than semaglutide, known as Ozempic and Wegovy. Tirzepatide users lost about 20% of their body weight, compared to approximately 14% for semaglutide users, over a 72-week period. Beyond weight loss, these drugs offer additional health benefits such as reduced blood pressure and improved blood sugar and cholesterol levels. However, the high cost of these medications, averaging over $1,000 out of pocket, remains a barrier, with only one in four insurance companies covering them.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is preparing to close its remaining nuclear reactor, effectively ending its nuclear power program due to strong public opposition driven by safety concerns and waste disposal issues. The anti-nuclear movement gained momentum following incidents like the storage of nuclear waste on Lanyu Island without local consent. While some advocate for reversing course to boost energy security and meet climate goals, concerns about nuclear waste disposal and potential risks persist. Taiwan currently stores all nuclear waste at decommissioned plants and faces challenges in finding a permanent underground repository.</p>
