          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has informed U.S. President Donald Trump about a new European Union plan concerning energy consumption from Russia. The discussions aim to address Europe's reliance on Russian energy sources amidst ongoing geopolitical tensions. This development occurs as protests have also erupted in Slovakia, where citizens are demonstrating against their government's perceived pro-Russian policies. The talks signal a potential shift in transatlantic energy strategy and coordination in response to Russia's influence in the region.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that Hong Kong presents a unique and strategic opportunity to co-host China's proposed World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organisation, challenging Shanghai's frontrunner status. While Shanghai offers extensive AI infrastructure, Hong Kong's distinct legal system under the "one country, two systems" framework could help mitigate Western skepticism and encourage broader international participation. This move could position Hong Kong at the center of China's AI diplomacy, leveraging its international credibility to help shape global AI standards amid escalating U.S.-China tech tensions.</p>

          <p>A man from Norfolk, Dan Cooper, has successfully brought his attacker to justice two decades after he was sexually assaulted in 2004. Inspired to re-report the crime after serving on a jury in 2018, his perseverance led to the conviction of Shaun Gilder, who was sentenced to eight years in prison. Cooper, who waived his anonymity, described the long-term trauma and PTSD he suffered from the attack, which occurred when he was 17. He now uses his experience to help others by sharing his story on social media, creating a supportive community for fellow survivors.</p>

The incident occurred when the suspect brandished a knife and demanded she hand over her beverage. The woman's quick thinking to toss the drink gave her an opportunity to escape and call for help. San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputies responded swiftly and arrested 29-year-old Rashawn Lee at the shopping center shortly after the event. No injuries were reported in the unusual attempted robbery.</p>

          <p>Robert Redford, the iconic actor and director, is being remembered for a career defined by both his classic Hollywood appeal and his deliberate pursuit of complex, challenging roles. Despite his matinee-idol looks, Redford consistently sidestepped simple, heroic parts in favor of characters that explored the souring of American idealism and questioned the nation's self-image. From antihero crooks in "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" to truth-seeking journalists in "All the President's Men," he used his charisma to draw audiences into stories with darker undercurrents. His work as both an actor and filmmaker left an indelible mark on cinema by challenging conventions.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Attorney's office has announced that five partially built, illegal homes in Laurel Canyon will finally be demolished, ending a legal fight that has spanned over two decades. The structures were part of a development halted in 2002, with a demolition order issued in 2003 that was never enforced by a series of subsequent owners. The current developers pleaded guilty to failing to comply with city orders after neighbors reported that construction had resumed. This resolution marks a significant victory for the community, which has long dealt with the dangerous and dilapidated properties.</p>

          <h2>Shift to Electric Vehicles Drives Surge in Automatic Car Driving Tests in UK</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 19:08:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data from the UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency reveals that one in four driving tests are now taken in automatic cars, a significant increase from just over 6% a decade ago. This trend is largely attributed to the rise of electric vehicles (EVs), which do not have manual gearboxes, and the upcoming 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. Driving instructors note that automatics are simpler for learners, reducing stress and allowing more focus on road safety. The shift reflects changing consumer preferences and the automotive industry's transition towards an electric future.</p>

          <p>Strong winds in Washington state have kicked up volcanic ash from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, creating hazy conditions and lowering air quality in the region. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Weather Service have confirmed that this phenomenon, known as ash resuspension, is not due to any new volcanic activity. The area has been experiencing severe drought, leaving the dry, loose ash susceptible to being lifted by gusts. Officials have reiterated that the volcano's alert level remains at "Normal," but caution that the resuspended ash can be hazardous to aircraft.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur has shifted its strategy from an attack-focused approach to a more pragmatic, defensive style under new manager Thomas Frank. The team's 1-0 victory against Villarreal in the Champions League marked their fourth clean sheet in five games this season, a stark contrast to their record at the same point last year. Players have highlighted a new "clean sheet mentality," focusing on strong defensive structure and making the team difficult to beat. While this cautious approach has proven effective in securing results, it has come at the cost of offensive excitement, with the team managing only one shot on target in their recent win.</p>
