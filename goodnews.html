          <h2>Neuroscientist Explains the Science of Romantic Obsession and How to Overcome It</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The psychological state of intense romantic infatuation, known as "limerence," is explored by neuroscientist Tom Bellamy in his new book. Limerence is characterized by intrusive thoughts and extreme emotional highs and lows, often escalating into an unhealthy obsession when the feelings are not reciprocated or the relationship is uncertain. Bellamy explains that this state can become an addiction driven by the brain's reward system. The article outlines strategies for breaking free, such as limiting contact, reframing daydreams into negative scenarios, and finding new personal goals to shift focus.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following significant gains in the last general election, the UK's Liberal Democrat party is now contemplating its future strategy. Leader Sir Ed Davey's attention-grabbing stunts, like bungee-jumping, have raised the party's profile but also led to criticism that they lack seriousness. Polling suggests many voters, including their own supporters, are tired of the antics and unsure of the party's core policies. As the two major parties face internal strife, the Lib Dems see an opportunity but must now develop more substantive ideas to appeal to voters and solidify their position.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is emerging as a double-edged sword in the fight against employee burnout. While AI tools like ChatGPT can automate repetitive tasks and reduce cognitive load, potentially lowering emotional exhaustion, they can also contribute to the problem. Some studies indicate that frequent AI users report higher levels of burnout, as the efficiency gains often lead to increased workloads rather than more downtime. Furthermore, the pressure to become proficient with new AI systems adds another layer of stress, highlighting the need for careful implementation by companies.</p>

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released from Taliban custody in Afghanistan after being detained for almost eight months. The couple, who had lived and run a charitable training program in the country for nearly two decades, were reunited with their daughter in Doha, Qatar. Their son expressed his gratitude for their release, which was secured after negotiations brokered by Qatar. The couple had remained in Afghanistan after the Taliban's 2021 takeover and now plan to return to the UK.</p>

          <p>The return to school has renewed the debate over the utility and stress of parent WhatsApp groups. While these chats can be useful for sharing important reminders about school events, many parents find them overwhelming and a source of anxiety. The article highlights common complaints, including the high volume of notifications, the spread of unhelpful opinions, and displays of competitive parenting. Some parents are choosing to leave the groups entirely to reduce this "background noise" and avoid the associated stress, despite the potential of missing some information.</p>

          <p>Early voting has commenced in Virginia's gubernatorial election, a key political contest viewed as a public referendum on President Trump's policies. The race pits Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears against former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger. National issues, particularly the Trump administration's cuts to the federal workforce, are playing a significant role in the campaign, as Virginia is home to a large number of federal employees. The outcome of this election is often seen as a bellwether for the political climate in the year following a presidential election.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Northern Command is actively testing a variety of counter-drone systems to defend against the increasing threat of incursions over sensitive military facilities. At an event at Eglin Air Force Base, technologies ranging from acoustic detection systems to interceptor drones that capture targets with nets were demonstrated. With an estimated 8,000 drones in U.S. airspace at any time and hundreds of incursions reported over military bases, the Pentagon is working to establish rapid response teams. These efforts aim to protect critical infrastructure from surveillance, smuggling, or potential attacks.</p>
