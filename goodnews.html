          <h2>Certain Fruits May Aid Sleep, According to Health Experts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 14:28:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Certain fruits, rich in natural hormones and antioxidants, may help Americans fall asleep faster and improve sleep quality, according to board-certified dietitian nutritionist Kendall Mackintosh. She notes that as fall brings shorter days and less natural light, supporting melatonin naturally becomes increasingly important for sleep, mood, and metabolism. Tart cherries are highlighted for their ability to increase melatonin and provide tryptophan, a precursor to serotonin and melatonin. Kiwi consumption has also been associated with significantly improved sleep quality and duration, as evidenced by a 2024 study on elite athletes. Grapes, containing a degree of melatonin and being low in calories, are recommended as a beneficial evening snack, with experts advising consumption in their natural, unprocessed form for optimal nutrition.</p>

          <p>Formula 1 drivers are divided over the use of cooling vests at the Singapore Grand Prix, the first race declared a 'heat hazard' by the FIA due to high temperatures and humidity. Red Bull's Max Verstappen criticized the system and proposed mandatory use, citing discomfort, lack of cockpit space, and potential for the system to become ineffective if dry ice melts. In contrast, Mercedes' George Russell plans to use the vest, noting team improvements in car cooling. McLaren's Oscar Piastri remains undecided, highlighting the benefits if it works versus the risks if it fails. The debate underscores challenges in driver safety and comfort in extreme conditions.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), a predominantly white denomination, has installed the Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop. Curry's six-year term, which began October 1st, follows his election in July and marks a historic moment for the church. He succeeds the Rev. Elizabeth Eaton, the ELCA's first woman leader. Curry, a former social worker and public schoolteacher from Chicago, aims to foster a more connected church from local congregations upward. His leadership is seen as a significant step in elevating the contributions of African Americans to Lutheranism and addressing challenges common to mainline Protestant denominations, including declining membership.</p>

Engelbert denied some specific comments attributed to her but expressed regret that players feel unappreciated. She announced plans for a new "state of the game" committee to review officiating and confirmed upcoming meetings with the players' union to negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA). Engelbert affirmed her commitment to the league beyond the CBA, emphasizing shared goals for increasing player salaries and benefits while ensuring the WNBA's long-term growth and viability.</p>

          <h2>Costco to Offer Discounted Weight-Loss Drugs Like Ozempic and Wegovy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 12:27:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Costco has partnered with Novo Nordisk to offer its members GLP-1 anti-obesity medications, including Ozempic and Wegovy, at approximately half their usual cost. Through the store's prescription program, a four-week supply of these injectables will be available for $499, exclusively for out-of-pocket payers, as many insurers do not yet cover them. This initiative aims to increase access to semaglutide, the active ingredient, which helps regulate appetite and insulin production, leading to significant weight loss. Costco's entry into this market could further boost demand and access, especially given the rising prices and limited supply of these popular drugs.</p>

          <h2>Egypt Opens Amenhotep III's Tomb in Valley of the Kings After Two Decades of Restoration</h2>

          <p>The tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep III, who ruled ancient Egypt between 1390 B.C.E. and 1350 B.C.E., has been opened to the public in Luxor after two decades of Japanese-led restoration. The tomb, one of the largest in the Valley of the Kings and over 3,000 years old, suffered severe deterioration. Discovered in 1799, its contents were looted, including the sarcophagus. The refurbished site features a 36-meter-long, 14-meter-deep passageway and main burial chambers for the king and Queens Tiye and Sitamun. Its exquisite wall paintings are considered among the finest from the Eighteenth Dynasty, with restoration work adhering to the highest international standards.</p>

          <p>Hamas has officially agreed to key components of President Trump's proposed Gaza ceasefire deal, including the release of all hostages, while signaling a need for further negotiations on specific details. U.S. officials consider Hamas's response positive, anticipating discussions on aspects like weapons decommissioning to commence next week. Following this development, President Trump urged Israel to immediately cease bombing Gaza to ensure the safe and swift release of hostages, expressing belief that Hamas is prepared for a lasting peace. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's office stated preparations are underway to implement the first phase of Trump's plan for immediate hostage liberation, marking a significant, albeit complex, move towards ending the conflict.</p>

          <p>Veteran left-handed pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been added to the Los Angeles Dodgers' National League Division Series (NLDS) roster, marking his return to postseason play after being left off the wild-card round roster. Kershaw, who went 11-2 with a 3.36 ERA this season, is expected to pitch out of the bullpen, providing much-needed left-handed depth and veteran presence against the Philadelphia Phillies. The Dodgers made only two roster changes, also adding Anthony Banda, while maintaining their 15-man position player group, including Will Smith who is recovering from a fractured hand. This inclusion could be Kershaw's final career postseason series if the Dodgers don't advance.</p>
