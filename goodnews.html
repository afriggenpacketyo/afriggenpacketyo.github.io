          <p>India has announced the reopening of its embassy in Kabul, four years after its closure following the Taliban's resurgence in Afghanistan in 2021. Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar confirmed the upgrading of India's Technical Mission to the status of a full embassy during a bilateral meeting with Afghan counterpart Amir Khan Muttaqi. Muttaqi's landmark six-day visit to India, the first by a senior Taliban leader since the group retook power, was made possible by a UN Security Council travel ban exemption. This diplomatic move signifies a potential shift towards greater engagement and normalization of relations between India and the Taliban-led Afghan government, indicating a strategic re-evaluation of the region's geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>The Pima County Sheriff’s Department in Arizona is pioneering the use of Axon's Draft One, an artificial intelligence program that generates initial incident reports from body camera audio and deputy-provided information. This innovative technology aims to drastically reduce the time deputies spend on administrative tasks, potentially cutting a 30-minute report down to just five minutes, thereby boosting productivity and efficiency, especially amidst resource shortages in law enforcement. While acknowledging the program's benefits, experts and department officials emphasize the critical need for human review to verify accuracy and completeness, addressing concerns about potential flaws in AI data that could lead to serious consequences like false arrests. The successful trial with 20 deputies is set to expand to corrections officers, showcasing a cautious yet forward-looking adoption of AI in policing.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase is now mandating that employees at its new New York headquarters provide biometric data, such as fingerprints or eye scans, for building access, a policy shift from earlier voluntary plans. This requirement is reportedly being implemented to enhance security measures, especially following a recent shooting involving a health insurer CEO near JPMorgan's offices. While the bank notes some exemptions, this move raises significant questions regarding employee privacy and the increasing scope of workplace surveillance, particularly given the bank's prior directive for hybrid workers to return to the office five days a week. The company has also launched a "Work at JPMC" mobile app, further integrating technology into daily operational access.</p>

During Taiwan's National Day celebrations, President Lai pledged to establish a robust defense network featuring advanced detection capabilities and effective interception mechanisms, aiming to safeguard the lives and property of citizens. Furthermore, he committed to substantially increasing defense spending, targeting over 3% of GDP next year and reaching 5% by 2030, to bolster the island's domestic defense industry. Lai also urged Beijing to abandon its use of force or coercion, asserting Taiwan's determination to maintain peace through strategic strength against China's territorial claims.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the "first phase" of a 20-point peace plan for Gaza, following intense negotiations in Egypt. This initial phase entails the release of all 20 live hostages by Hamas, followed by Israel's withdrawal to an agreed-upon line controlling 53% of the Strip. Israel will then release approximately 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees, while hundreds of aid lorries will enter Gaza. A multinational force will monitor the ceasefire, though sticking points remain for later phases, including Hamas's disarmament and the future governance of Gaza, which the plan suggests would be led by a temporary committee and later the Palestinian Authority.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A burgeoning skepticism among Chinese scholars towards established Western classical history and its academic frameworks is now extending its focus to ancient Egyptian treasures, introducing an unexpected twist to the long-standing partnership between China and Egypt. The Shanghai Museum's significant exhibition on ancient Egypt, a collaborative effort with the Egyptian government, notably attracted the attention of retired art history professor Huang Heqing. Huang, who earned his doctorate from the Sorbonne in Paris, specifically highlighted certain artifacts from the exhibition, indicating a deeper academic inquiry into the prevailing interpretations of world history. This article points to a growing intellectual movement within China aimed at re-evaluating historical narratives, potentially fostering new global perspectives on cultural heritage and academic discourse.</p>

          <p>The announcement of the Nobel Peace Prize winner is imminent, a moment shadowed by former US President Donald Trump's public assertions that he deserves the prestigious award for purportedly having "stopped eight wars."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England football legend Wayne Rooney has strongly defended his "golden generation" team against recent criticism from former teammate Steven Gerrard, who suggested their lack of international success stemmed from players being "egotistical losers." Speaking on his BBC podcast, Rooney firmly asserted that his team worked diligently and gave their utmost effort, ultimately just failing to "get over the line" in major tournaments, rather than lacking a proper attitude. He acknowledged the inherent difficulty in fostering strong relationships between players from rival clubs like Manchester United and Liverpool during their active careers, though he noted this dynamic has since eased considerably. Rooney maintained that despite not reaching semi-finals, the team consistently held a "100%" belief in their ability to win.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rhun ap Iorwerth, the leader of Plaid Cymru, has declared that his party is fully prepared to replace Welsh Labour in the upcoming Senedd election, promising to deliver "a new government, with new energy and new ideas." Welsh Labour has maintained political dominance since devolution began in 1999. Ap Iorwerth aims to strategically position Plaid as the leading anti-Reform UK party, actively seeking to attract voters who wish to prevent Nigel Farage's party from gaining power. While Plaid has historically struggled to unseat Labour, recent opinion polls suggest they are now strong contenders for the top spot. The party is emphasizing a "radical" policy agenda, including a commitment to tackling child poverty, in an effort to broaden its appeal beyond its traditional Welsh-speaking strongholds.</p>

While her identity is now known, the precise cause of death remains unexplained, and police continue their ongoing investigation into the circumstances. This article highlights the remarkable success of collaborative international policing efforts, such as Interpol's utilization of "black notices," in resolving long-standing cold cases and providing long-awaited answers to families of missing persons across Europe.</p>
