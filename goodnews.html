        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new all-time high, exceeding $118,000, driven by a significant influx of capital into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, these ETFs recorded their largest single-day inflow of the year, totaling $1.18 billion. The rally was also supported by a divergence in opinion among Federal Reserve officials regarding interest rate cuts and political commentary suggesting the next Fed leader will be dovish. This price movement triggered over $650 million in short liquidations, further fueling the upward trend as traders covered their positions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Levi Strauss & Co. has raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance after reporting stronger-than-expected second-quarter results. The company now anticipates revenue growth of 1% to 2%, a significant improvement from its previous forecast, citing resilient consumer demand and the success of new product innovations. Despite the positive outlook, Levi's faces uncertainty from potential U.S. tariffs on goods from Southeast Asia, where much of its manufacturing is based. For now, the company plans to absorb the initial tariff costs, which it estimates will have a minimal impact on its earnings per share. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>FDA to Factor in Drug Affordability for New Expedited Approval Vouchers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 09:21:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will now consider the affordability of drugs when granting new national priority vouchers, which can significantly speed up the approval process. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary stated that making medications more affordable is a key national priority, aligning with the Trump administration's goal of lowering drug prices. The program aims to incentivize development in critical areas like Type 1 diabetes and universal flu shots. However, it remains unclear how the FDA will assess affordability, as drug prices are typically set after approval, raising questions about the new policy's implementation.</p>

          <p>Prominent sports executive Timothy Leiweke has been criminally charged by a federal grand jury for allegedly organizing a bid-rigging scheme to secure a $388 million sports arena project for his company. Leiweke, the CEO of Oak View Group (OVG) and former head of companies owning major sports franchises, is accused of conspiring with a competitor to ensure OVG was the sole bidder for the Moody Center at the University of Texas. He has since resigned as CEO and maintains his innocence. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison and a substantial fine.</p>

          <p>In a notable development, the Shanghai branch of China's State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) has called on state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to research the potential of digital assets. The regulator urged SOEs to study the role of stablecoins and other digital currencies in areas like cross-border trade, supply chain finance, and asset tokenization. This directive is significant given China's strict ban on most cryptocurrency activities. It aligns with recent state media discussions about potentially regulating yuan-backed stablecoins to enhance the global role of the Chinese currency.</p>

          <p>A new book, "A Flower Traveled in My Blood" by Haley Cohen Gilliland, examines Argentina's decades-long process of confronting the trauma of its "Dirty War." The article reviews how the book uses the story of one family, shattered by the military junta's campaign of kidnapping and murder, to explore universal questions of justice, memory, and reconciliation. It highlights the pioneering work of the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, who have used genetic science to locate 140 children stolen at birth. The review positions Argentina as a crucial case study in how a society navigates the difficult path between forgetting past atrocities and demanding accountability.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. will send Patriot air defense systems and other weapons to Ukraine through NATO, with the alliance set to cover the cost. The announcement followed a conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has urgently requested at least 10 Patriot systems to counter a recent surge in Russian missile and drone attacks. This move signals a shift after the U.S. had recently paused some critical weapons shipments. The advanced Patriot systems are crucial for Ukraine's ability to defend its cities and critical infrastructure from relentless Russian bombardment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>IMAX is poised for its best year on record, with CEO Rich Gelfond forecasting a global box office of $1.2 billion, driven by a consumer shift towards premium movie-going experiences. The company's market share is growing, with films like "F1: The Movie" earning over 20% of their total gross from IMAX screenings, despite IMAX representing less than 1% of screens worldwide. This success is bolstered by an increasing number of major films being shot with IMAX cameras, a strong slate of upcoming blockbusters, and expansion into local-language films in international markets.

          <p>Following an investigation that found tens of millions in taxpayer funds were spent with little oversight, Texas is overhauling its Thriving Texas Families program. The program, which funds crisis pregnancy centers to promote alternatives to abortion, will now require organizations to document all expenses and be reimbursed only for state-approved services. Previously, a flat-rate payment system allowed some centers to bill for more than services cost and use public funds for unrelated expenses like real estate. The changes aim to bring greater accountability to the program, whose annual funding is set to reach $100 million.</p>

The bank's tech chief, Marco Argenti, stated that Devin will augment the firm's 12,000 human developers, initially handling tasks like updating internal code. This move signals the arrival of "agentic AI" on Wall Street, where AI programs can execute complex, multi-step jobs with minimal human supervision. While the bank envisions a "hybrid workforce," the technology's potential to dramatically boost productivity raises new questions about the future of jobs in the financial sector.</p>
