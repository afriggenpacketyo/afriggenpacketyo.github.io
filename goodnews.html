          <p>Patrick Schwarzenegger discusses his role as Saxon Ratliff in the latest season of HBO's "The White Lotus," a character he describes as a "sex-obsessed, protein shake-chugging bro." Schwarzenegger initially had reservations about the role, particularly regarding the extent of the character's sexual behavior and nudity. He also shares anecdotes about series creator Mike White joking about Schwarzenegger not appearing rich enough despite his famous family. He acknowledges the advantages his name brings but emphasizes his desire to forge his own path in acting, having spent a decade in acting class and recently starring in HBO's "The Staircase."</p>

          <p>Verbal jousting and psychological tactics have commenced ahead of the British and Irish Lions tour, with Wallaby coach Joe Schmidt and Lions general manager of performance David Nucifora engaging in early mind games. Schmidt's comments about the Lions' team composition have sparked debate, while Nucifora has subtly criticized Schmidt's thinking. This tradition of psychological warfare dates back to at least 1896, as documented by England's Walter Carey, highlighting the long-standing practice of using mental strategies in addition to physical prowess in Lions tours.</p>

          <p>Fred Smith, the founder of FedEx Corp., has died at the age of 80. Smith revolutionized the express delivery industry, overseeing the growth of FedEx into a global transportation and logistics company that handles an average of 17 million shipments per business day. Smith, a Marine Corps veteran, used a business theory he developed in college to create a delivery system based on coordinated air cargo flights centered on a main hub. The company also played a major role in the shift by American business and industry to a greater use of time-sensitive deliveries and less dependence on large inventories and warehouses.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Cultural Fears Explored in Light of Black Arts Movement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 09:00:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses how Trump's actions against Black cultural institutions stem from a fear of the power Black culture holds when it is not controlled by white institutions. The author draws parallels between Trump's actions and historical attempts to suppress Black culture, particularly referencing the Black Arts Movement (BAM). BAM's success in establishing independent Black institutions and scholarship is highlighted as a model for cultural resistance. The article critiques the emphasis on diversity and inclusion as insufficient, arguing that Black culture's true power lies in challenging white cultural dominance.</p>
