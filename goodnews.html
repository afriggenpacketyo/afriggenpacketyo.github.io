          <p>Chinese officials are rushing to comply with President Xi Jinping's austerity orders, ensuring their offices are modest and meal receipts are in order. This campaign, running since 2012, aims to curb overspending among Communist Party and government bodies to improve the party's image and reduce corruption. Analysts suggest the campaign is also about efficient spending to bolster China's rivalry with the United States and identifying loyal cadres for promotion. Questions remain about the campaign's effectiveness due to strict media control and the challenge of enforcing detailed rules on a large scale.</p>
