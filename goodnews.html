          <p>The UK government is set to introduce the long-awaited "Hillsborough Law," which will legally require public officials and bodies to be truthful and cooperative during investigations into major disasters. The legislation includes a "duty of candour," with potential criminal sanctions for those who breach it, aiming to prevent cover-ups like those seen in the aftermath of the 1989 Hillsborough football tragedy. Campaigners, including families of the 97 victims, have welcomed the confirmation after fears the bill would be weakened. The law is also intended to apply lessons from other major scandals, such as the Grenfell Tower fire and the Post Office Horizon controversy.</p>

          <p>Amazon is expanding its use of artificial intelligence by rolling out "Hear the Highlights," a feature that provides short, AI-generated audio summaries for products on its mobile app. The AI synthesizes information from product descriptions, customer reviews, and other web sources to create these clips, which are now available for over one million products to all U.S. customers. While the feature aims to simplify the shopping experience and improve accessibility, it also raises questions about whether AI can capture the nuance and unique insights found in human reviews.

          <p>Shares of CoreWeave, a cloud infrastructure provider for AI, increased by nearly 8% after the company revealed a substantial purchase agreement with Nvidia valued at a minimum of $6.3 billion. According to a regulatory filing, the deal obligates Nvidia to buy any of CoreWeave's unsold capacity through April 2032. This arrangement underscores the strong relationship between the two companies, as CoreWeave is a major customer for Nvidia's GPUs and Nvidia is a significant investor in CoreWeave. The news boosted investor confidence in the recently public company, which plays a key role in the expanding AI ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that Zohran Mamdani holds a significant lead in the New York City mayoral race, with voter concerns about the city's unaffordability being a primary driver of his support. The survey reveals that voters prioritize a candidate who can bring change over one with experience, a sentiment that benefits Mamdani. Former Governor Andrew Cuomo performs better among voters whose top issue is crime, but this is a smaller segment of the electorate. The poll also shows that incumbent Mayor Eric Adams has very low approval ratings, and that a majority of voters prefer a mayor who would oppose President Trump.</p>

          <p>Wall Street continued its upward trend, with the S&P 500 closing at a new record high, driven by positive performance in the technology sector. Major stocks like Tesla and Alphabet saw significant gains, with Google's parent company surpassing a $3 trillion market capitalization. The market's optimism is largely fueled by the widespread expectation that the Federal Reserve will announce its first interest rate cut of the year this week. However, investors remain watchful, as the central bank's future projections and commentary on inflation and the job market will be critical in determining if the recent rally can be sustained.

          <h2>Trump Proposes Shifting Corporate Earnings Reports from Quarterly to Semiannual</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 16:26:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from reporting their earnings every quarter to a semiannual basis, an idea he floated on his Truth Social platform. He argued that such a change would save companies money and encourage managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits, contrasting it with China's longer-term business view. The proposal, which would require approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), revives a topic Trump raised during his first term. While supporters of the idea believe it fosters long-term growth, critics argue that quarterly reports provide essential transparency and timely information for investors.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase has announced plans to decrease the weighting of major issuers like China and India in its widely-tracked GBI-EM Global Diversified emerging-market bond index. The issuer cap will be lowered from 10% to 9% in the first half of 2026, a move intended to reduce concentration risk and enhance the index's overall yield. This adjustment will redirect investment flows away from larger markets, including Indonesia and Mexico, and toward smaller nations such as Thailand, Poland, and South Africa. The change reflects feedback from investors who favored a more balanced regional exposure within the flagship index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price saw a notable increase of over 3% after CEO Elon Musk revealed he had purchased approximately $1 billion worth of the company's shares. This significant insider acquisition, his first in the open market since 2020, was interpreted by investors as a strong vote of confidence in the electric vehicle manufacturer. The purchase comes as Tesla's stock has been recovering from a difficult start to the year, impacted by slowing sales and brand challenges. The move is seen by some analysts as Musk reinforcing his commitment to the company's long-term AI and robotics strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former MMA champion Conor McGregor has announced he will not be a candidate in Ireland's upcoming presidential election, ending his short-lived political bid. McGregor, who has become a prominent anti-immigration voice, stated that after reflection and consultation with his family, he was withdrawing his candidacy. In his announcement, he criticized Ireland's political rules as being "fixed" to favor establishment-approved candidates, alleging that a civil court case where a woman claimed he had sexually assaulted her was politically motivated. To appear on the ballot, a candidate must be nominated by either 20 members of parliament or four local authorities.</p>

          <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has become the fourth U.S. company to achieve a market capitalization of over $3 trillion, following a more than 4% jump in its share price. The stock's recent surge was partly fueled by a favorable antitrust ruling that imposed lighter-than-feared penalties on the company. This milestone comes as Alphabet navigates increasing competition in the artificial intelligence space and heightened regulatory scrutiny in both the U.S. and Europe. The achievement places Alphabet in an exclusive club alongside tech giants Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple, reflecting strong investor confidence in its market position and future growth prospects.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve prepares to potentially lower its benchmark interest rate, experts advise that homeowners should not expect a significant, immediate decrease in mortgage rates. While the Fed's policy influences short-term borrowing, fixed-rate mortgages are more closely tied to the performance of long-term bonds, like the 10-year Treasury note. Financial markets have already anticipated the Fed's move, with average mortgage rates recently falling to their lowest level in nearly a year. Therefore, the central bank's official announcement is largely priced in, and future rate movements will depend more on long-term economic outlooks and inflation expectations.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. homeowners holding record levels of home equity, many are considering tapping into this resource for financing major expenses. The article outlines the primary methods for borrowing $50,000, including home equity loans, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), and cash-out refinances. A home equity loan offers the stability of a fixed interest rate and predictable monthly payments, making it ideal for budgeting. In contrast, a HELOC provides a flexible, revolving line of credit suitable for ongoing projects with uncertain costs, though typically with a variable interest rate. A cash-out refinance might offer a lower rate but involves replacing the entire mortgage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials have reportedly agreed on a "framework" deal concerning the ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations, potentially averting a ban of the popular social media app. The announcement came from U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent during trade talks in Madrid, who indicated the deal would pave the way for U.S. ownership and protect national security interests. While President Trump confirmed the talks went well, Chinese officials stated that no deal would be finalized at the expense of Chinese companies' interests. This development comes as a deadline looms for TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to sell its American arm.</p>
