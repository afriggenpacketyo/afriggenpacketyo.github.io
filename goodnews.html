          <p>Daisy Crawford, traveling from Bristol to Belfast with breast milk and a pump, was told by EasyJet staff that she would need to pay an additional charge for her hand luggage, despite researching the rules beforehand. She was allowed to travel out of Belfast without any issues, but faced problems on the return journey at the gate. EasyJet has since apologized for the incident, stating that they allow customers an additional free bag for breast pumps and milk, and that Ms. Crawford's experience did not meet their expected service standards. Ms. Crawford expressed embarrassment and frustration over the lack of understanding from the staff, emphasizing she wasn't seeking special exceptions but simply adhering to what she believed were the airline's policies.</p>

          <p>A lynx born at Newquay Zoo in Cornwall may become the first UK zoo-born cat to be released into the wild, and has been moved to Germany to be monitored for its suitability. The lynx is being considered for release due to a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding program. The cat will be monitored in an enclosure to assess its survival skills and relationship with humans. If successful, the lynx will join efforts to increase genetic diversity among wild lynx populations in Europe and help control deer populations.</p>

          <p>Despite widespread criticism and low approval ratings, Donald Trump's core supporters remain unwavering in their faith and enthusiasm for his presidency. Interviews with Trump fans at a rally in Michigan reveal a belief that he is steering the economy towards prosperity, securing borders, and protecting democracy. Supporters expressed admiration for Elon Musk's efforts to cut government waste and view any short-term economic pain as a necessary sacrifice for long-term gains. These individuals reject accusations of dictatorship and see Trump as fulfilling his campaign promises.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 06:00:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent poll indicates strong support for American reindustrialization, with 80% believing it would benefit the country. While only 25% feel they would personally benefit from working in manufacturing, this figure still represents a significant portion of the population and underscores the dissatisfaction with the current "knowledge economy". A strong manufacturing sector is linked to higher wages, economic stability, and national self-sufficiency. Reindustrialization is also seen as a politically viable strategy for winning back working-class voters.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Secretary of State Shirley N. Weber argues that the SAVE Act, recently approved by the House, is a thinly veiled attempt to disenfranchise millions of eligible voters, particularly targeting underserved populations, those with name changes, and military personnel. Weber asserts that the bill, framed as preventing illegal voting, would impose unnecessary documentation requirements, creating barriers to participation and undermining decades of progress in voting rights. She highlights that voter fraud is virtually nonexistent and that states already have measures in place to ensure election security. Weber is actively fighting back, including leading a lawsuit against an executive order requiring documentary proof of citizenship on the federal mail voter registration form.</p>

          <p>Nonprofit organizations are working to combat gentrification in Altadena, California, following the Eaton fire, by purchasing burned lots and ensuring displaced residents can afford to rebuild. Eshele Williams, who lost her rental home in the fire, is benefiting from this effort, as Neighborhood Housing Services of Los Angeles County purchased her burned lot and plans to build a new home for her at an affordable price. A coalition of nonprofits is seeking to raise funds to acquire more properties and prevent developers from escalating home prices in the community, particularly impacting long-standing Black residents.</p>

          <p>Christina Li's novel, "The Manor of Dreams," tells the story of two families brought together by a will reading in a crumbling Altadena mansion, revealing secrets and suppressed damage. The plot involves Vivian Yin's daughters, Lucille and Rennie, and Elaine Deng and her daughter Nora, who must stay in the haunted mansion for a week to contest the will. As the women experience ghostly phenomena and uncover hidden truths, a queer romance develops between Nora and Madeline. The novel explores themes of family secrets, exploitation, and queer love, though its attempt to tie the mansion's haunting to Chinese migrant exploitation falls short.</p>

          <p>Euro zone inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in April, according to flash data from Eurostat, defying expectations of a decrease. Core inflation rose to 2.7%, and services inflation also picked up to 3.9%. Experts suggest that the increase in services inflation is likely due to Easter timing effects, which are expected to reverse in the coming months, leaving the door open for further interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank. However, uncertainty regarding potential tariff escalations could pose a risk to this outlook.</p>

Reform are frequently stacking up between a fifth and a third of the vote in some of the key tussles so far. The Conservative party are braced for more grim news later in their former rural heartlands where the Liberal Democrats smell blood.</p>
