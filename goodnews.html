          <p>In an interview for his new memoir, "Life, Law & Liberty," former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy expressed concern over the current court's confrontational tone. At 89, Kennedy reflects on his career as a pivotal "swing vote" on landmark cases like abortion rights and same-sex marriage. He stated his worry that a growing lack of civility in public discourse threatens democracy, noting that some of the court's recent opinions have become "a little bit too personal."</p>

          <p>This advice column addresses the dilemma of enjoying the Harry Potter universe while disagreeing with author J.K. Rowling's anti-transgender stance. The author argues it is possible to separate the art from the artist, noting the books' core message of rejecting supremacy is valuable, even if flawed. Rather than simply boycotting or offsetting purchases with donations, the article suggests fans should actively and critically interrogate the works in a community setting. This approach can generate social good and transform the fandom into a space for continued moral discussion.</p>
