          <p>Disney has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will resume broadcasting on ABC this Tuesday, reversing a previous decision to suspend the show indefinitely. The initial suspension followed comments by Kimmel linking the alleged killer of a conservative activist to President Trump's political movement, which prompted major affiliate station owners like Nexstar and Sinclair to threaten preemption. After several days of discussions with Kimmel, Disney executives decided to reinstate the program, stating the host will address the controversy upon his return.</p>

          <p>The future of the Reel Inn, an iconic seafood restaurant on the Pacific Coast Highway, remains uncertain months after it was destroyed in a fire. The owners initially received a letter from California State Parks stating they could not rebuild on the state-owned land, sparking public outcry. Following the backlash, the agency reversed its stance and has now committed to exploring a path for the beloved 40-year-old establishment to be rebuilt on or near its original site, though a clear timeline has not yet been provided.</p>

          <p>Ousmane Dembélé has completed a remarkable career turnaround by winning the men's Ballon d'Or, fulfilling the potential many experts once doubted he would reach. His triumphant 2024-25 season with Paris St-Germain, where he was central to their domestic and Champions League treble, was the culmination of a personal and professional transformation. A key factor in his success was a tactical shift by manager Luis Enrique, who moved him into a central "false nine" role after Kylian Mbappé's departure, encouraging a more goal-focused approach.</p>

          <p>A new, small asteroid, designated 2025 PN7, has been discovered orbiting the sun in a path similar to Earth's, acting as a "quasi-moon." Scientists believe this celestial object, estimated to be between 60 and 120 feet across, has been Earth's travel companion for about 60 years and will continue to be for several more decades. Unlike our actual moon, quasi-moons are not gravitationally bound to Earth but offer astronomers a rare opportunity to study a single near-Earth object over an extended period.</p>

Under this arrangement, software company Oracle would provide comprehensive security oversight, including monitoring the app's powerful algorithm to prevent malicious use or foreign influence, though China has not publicly confirmed its agreement.</p>
