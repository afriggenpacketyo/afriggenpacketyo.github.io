        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin recently reached a new record high of $124,496, with Ether also nearing its all-time peak, driven by investor optimism following a cooler-than-expected inflation report. However, both cryptocurrencies experienced a downturn after July's wholesale inflation data came in higher than anticipated. Despite the Thursday dip, Bitcoin is poised for weekly gains, and Ether has seen a significant rally since June, becoming a market leader due to institutional buying and a more favorable regulatory environment. Experts suggest the rally has further potential, signaling crypto's growing integration into global portfolios. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 2028 Los Angeles Olympics will be the first Games to permit corporate naming rights for venues, a departure from the International Olympic Committee's traditional "clean venue policy." This agreement aims to provide a new revenue stream for the privately funded Games, with LA28 having secured about 70% of its domestic sponsorship goal. Existing venue sponsors can retain their names by becoming founding partners, while new opportunities exist for temporary facilities.

The page was discovered missing from Mexico's national archives between 1985 and 1993.
