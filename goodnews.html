          <p>A 20-story residential building in the Bronx experienced a partial collapse after a suspected boiler room explosion, leaving a large hole in the structure's corner. Despite the extensive damage, which sent debris raining onto the street, officials reported no injuries or loss of life. Mayor Eric Adams stated that an investigation is underway, with a preliminary theory suggesting the blast occurred while the heating system was being activated for the season. Residents from 38 apartments have been evacuated, and inspections are ongoing to ensure the building's structural integrity.</p>

          <p>Despite global gold prices reaching record highs, consumers in Hong Kong and mainland China continue to purchase gold jewellery, particularly for traditional wedding customs. Prices have surged significantly, with one retailer noting that consumers have gradually adapted to the new, higher price levels. The strong cultural demand for items like dragon and phoenix bracelets for weddings is sustaining the market even as costs rise. This trend reflects how essential cultural practices can influence consumer behavior in the face of major market shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actor Raymond Cruz, known for his role in “Breaking Bad,” will not face criminal charges following a confrontation with three women while washing his car. The Los Angeles city attorney’s office declined to file charges after the women accused Cruz of intentionally spraying them with water. Cruz’s agent stated the incident was accidental, occurring after the women parked extremely close to his vehicle and refused to move while he was washing it. The actor was held in police custody for five hours following the initial complaint last month.</p>

          <p>The 133-year-old coffee brand Maxwell House has launched a viral marketing campaign that rebrands itself as “Maxwell Apartment Coffee” to connect with younger, renting consumers. The tongue-in-cheek ads directly address the housing affordability crisis, joking, “Maxwell House? In this economy?” The campaign reflects the reality that the median age of first-time homebuyers in the U.S. has reached an all-time high of 38. This creative marketing effort uses humor to tap into the economic anxieties of a generation struggling with high home prices and interest rates.</p>

          <p>A judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by Spencer Elden, the man who appeared as a naked baby on Nirvana's 1991 "Nevermind" album cover. Elden had claimed the image constituted child pornography, but the judge ruled that no reasonable jury would view the photo as pornographic, comparing it to a family picture. This is the second time the case has been thrown out, with the judge stating Elden's claims were also filed too late. The band's surviving members and their legal team expressed relief at the end of what they termed a "meritless case."</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's net worth briefly exceeded $500 billion, making him the first person ever to reach this financial milestone, according to Forbes. The surge in his wealth is primarily linked to the rising stock value of Tesla, in which he holds a significant stake. Valuations of his other companies, such as SpaceX and xAI, have also contributed to his growing fortune. This achievement solidifies his position as the world's wealthiest individual, significantly ahead of other global tech leaders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French automaker Renault is reportedly in talks with China's Chery to manufacture cars together in South America. The potential partnership would involve Chery using Renault's existing factories in Colombia and Argentina to produce vehicles. In return, Chery would provide capital and product design, with most cars being sold under the Renault brand. The discussions, which are still ongoing, could see Chery invest in a plug-in hybrid pickup truck line in Argentina, signaling a strategic move for the Chinese carmaker to expand its presence in the region.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from cutting $34 million in anti-terrorism funding for New York City's transit system. The judge stated that New York would likely succeed in proving the funds were being improperly withheld as a punitive measure for the city's non-cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The state sued after the administration announced cuts to the Rail and Transit Security Grant Program, which was created after the 9/11 attacks. The ruling temporarily safeguards funds intended to protect the city from chemical, biological, and explosive threats.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders used silence to respond to media questions about remaining the team's third-string option. After Dillon Gabriel was promoted to starter, Sanders pantomimed answers without speaking, a move seen as a creative way to avoid controversy or fines. The gesture follows critical comments from analyst Rex Ryan about Sanders' earlier remarks suggesting he was capable of starting in the league. Sanders' silent protest is being compared to other famous non-responses from athletes like Marshawn Lynch and coaches like Bill Belichick.</p>

Though less heralded than the arrivals of Deandre Ayton and Marcus Smart, LaRavia is expected to be an important "three-and-D" player. A career 42.9% three-point shooter, LaRavia is focused on complementing stars like Luka Doncic by spacing the floor and bringing energy on defense.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to analyze the top-performing stocks of the third quarter as a guide for the remainder of the year. He noted that fund managers often buy these recent winners to bolster their portfolios, suggesting stocks like AppLovin, Western Digital, and Warner Bros. Discovery could see continued gains. However, Cramer cautioned that while these stocks remain a good place to invest, the most significant gains for the year may have already occurred. His analysis points to the AI boom and potential corporate takeovers as key drivers behind the quarter's biggest successes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A University of Cambridge nutrition expert has debunked several common myths surrounding the health and use of different cooking oils. Contrary to some claims, common vegetable and sunflower oils are not unhealthy; they are low in saturated fats and can help reduce disease risk when used in place of butter or lard. Modern margarines are also a healthy option, as harmful trans fats have been removed from their formulation. While extra virgin olive oil is beneficial, its low smoke point makes it unsuitable for deep frying, for which vegetable or sunflower oil is better suited.</p>
