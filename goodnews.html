        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from gun rights advocates, allowing Maryland's ban on assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines to remain in place. This decision leaves in place a ruling by the Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, which stated that the state can constitutionally prohibit the sale and possession of these weapons. Justices Alito, Gorsuch, and Thomas dissented, while Justice Kavanaugh expressed that he expects the high court to weigh in formally on the legality of the AR-15 in the coming years. Maryland has seen a decline in gun violence since enacting laws aimed at curbing access to dangerous weapons, particularly targeting gun kits.</p>

          <p>Marc Maron has announced that he and his producer, Brendan McDonald, will conclude their "WTF With Marc Maron" podcast after nearly 16 years of production. Maron cited burnout as the primary reason, noting the commitment of producing two shows a week for such an extended period. The podcast, which began in 2009, is credited with helping to establish podcasting as a viable medium for self-expression, featuring interviews with numerous notable guests, including former President Obama and Bruce Springsteen. Maron plans to focus on stand-up comedy, acting, and personal enjoyment after the podcast concludes this fall.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has removed a list of "sanctuary jurisdictions" from its website after facing backlash from local leaders and law enforcement. The list, which included cities and counties allegedly noncompliant with federal statutes, was intended to push back against municipalities obstructing immigration enforcement. Critics, including the National Sheriffs' Association, cited a lack of transparency and input in the list's creation. DHS maintains that the list is constantly reviewed and based on factors such as self-identification as a sanctuary jurisdiction and restrictions on information sharing.</p>

Profits and losses will be shared equally between the two companies.
