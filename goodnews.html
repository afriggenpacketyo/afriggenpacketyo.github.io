          <h2>Used Vehicle Prices Surge Due to Auto Tariffs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A closely watched index for used vehicle pricing, the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, jumped to its highest level since October 2023, increasing 4.9% year-over-year. The surge in used car prices is attributed to consumers rushing to make purchases amid fears of price hikes due to auto tariffs. Cox Automotive's Jeremy Robb noted that the 'spring bounce' in prices extended throughout April, with wholesale appreciation trends being much stronger than typically observed, reflecting the expected response to the tariffs. The index also marked a 2.7% increase from March.</p>

          <h2>Three Key Considerations for Borrowers Seeking $100,000 HELOCs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 14:46:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With average home equity levels high, a $100,000 home equity line of credit (HELOC) may be accessible for many homeowners, but strategic planning is crucial. First, HELOCs are currently the cheapest way to borrow home equity. Second, they are likely to become less expensive in the coming months as interest rates may decline. Third, volatility must be priced in, considering that HELOC rates are variable. Borrowers should calculate repayments against various realistic interest rate scenarios.</p>

          <p>During a traffic stop in central Ohio, a Springfield Township Police Officer encountered a pet raccoon named "Chewy" sitting in the driver's seat of a car with a glass methamphetamine pipe in its mouth. A subsequent search of the vehicle revealed methamphetamine, crack cocaine, and additional used methamphetamine pipes. The car's owner, Victoria Vidal, was arrested and charged with drug possession and drug paraphernalia charges, while the raccoon was unharmed and turned over to the authorities to determine if proper paperwork and documentation existed.</p>

          <h2>Mortgage Rates Remain Steady Following Fed Rate Pause</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve maintaining its benchmark rate, the question arises whether mortgage rates will decline. Mortgage rates are influenced by various factors, including inflation trends, economic growth, investor sentiment, and global uncertainty. While the Fed's rate pause could create favorable conditions for a mortgage rate decline, it is only one part of the broader economic picture. Homebuyers are encouraged to improve their credit score, shop around for offers, consider a rate buydown, and explore different loan types to secure the lowest possible mortgage rate.</p>

          <h2>Home Equity Loan vs. HELOC: Which Is Better With Interest Rates On Hold?</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the federal funds rate paused, prospective home equity borrowers face the decision of choosing between a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC). In today's climate, a HELOC is arguably better due to its lower average interest rate and the likelihood of further rate cuts. HELOCs have also dropped more in percentage points since September 2024, with the ability to adjust payments with the variable rate. Borrowers should still compare both home equity loans and HELOCs.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services has granted an exemption to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to hire a new class of its disease detectives, averting a feared halving of the highly selective fellowship. The CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service officers are often dispatched around the country to support the agency's response to investigating outbreaks and other health emergencies. This decision comes after concerns that the program would be affected by a federal hiring freeze. The program is often seen as a way for aspiring public health workers to get a start at the agency.</p>
