          <p>Following Karen Read's acquittal on murder and manslaughter charges in the death of her boyfriend, John O'Keefe, her parents expressed relief and are trying to return to normalcy. They praised their daughter's strength and determination throughout the two-year ordeal, referring to her as the "fifth lawyer" due to her active involvement in the case. Read's parents acknowledged the misogynistic comments and dehumanization she faced, stating the experience has motivated them to advocate for others in need. Despite the acquittal, the question of who is responsible for O'Keefe's death remains unanswered, and Read still faces a civil wrongful death suit filed by the O'Keefe family.</p>

          <p>Visits by foreign tourists to locations associated with manga and anime in Japan have significantly benefited local economies, according to a study by the Meiji Yasuda Research Institute. In 2024, approximately 3 million foreign tourists, or 8.1 percent of inbound visitors, visited these sites, a notable increase from 2016. Purchases of anime and manga-related goods totaled an estimated 54.3 billion yen last year, reflecting the growing global popularity of Japanese entertainment content. While this trend, known as "seichi junrei," boosts local economies, it also presents challenges such as overtourism, requiring local governments to develop multilingual support systems.</p>

The team plans to offer additional support to organizations assisting immigrant communities, including the California Community Foundation and the L.A. County Federation of Labor.

Khalil, a permanent resident, was arrested in March and labeled a national security threat, with the administration seeking his removal; upon his release, Khalil criticized the Trump administration for targeting him for protesting Israel's actions in Gaza, but the government is still attempting to deport Khalil based on allegations that he lied to obtain his green card.</p>

          <p>As summer approaches and temperatures rise, the debate over wearing shorts in the office continues, despite the increasing relaxation of dress codes. Stylists say the appropriateness of shorts depends on the context, with tailored shorts being more acceptable than beach or sports shorts. Many companies, including Accenture and British American Tobacco, don't have explicit dress codes but expect staff to dress professionally, however, some companies are okay with more casual attire. The perception of shorts also differs between men and women, with some men feeling less comfortable wearing them outside of holiday settings.</p>
