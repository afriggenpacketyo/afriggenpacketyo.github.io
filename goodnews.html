          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is set to become the largest shareholder in MP Materials, the owner of the only operational rare earth mine in the United States. The Pentagon will invest $400 million to expand the company's processing capacity and magnet production, a move aimed at reducing U.S. reliance on China for these critical minerals. These rare earths are essential for manufacturing key components in advanced military hardware, including F-35 jets and drones. This public-private partnership is framed as a strategic effort to onshore a vital supply chain for national security. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has blocked President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship, issuing a preliminary injunction and certifying a class action lawsuit for all children who would be affected. The judge found the plaintiffs' arguments persuasive, stating that the deprivation of U.S. citizenship constitutes irreparable harm. The lawsuit challenges the administration's interpretation of the 14th Amendment, which has historically granted citizenship to all persons born in the United States. This ruling is one of several legal challenges seeking to prevent the policy from taking effect, creating a temporary reprieve for affected families.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists from the University of Houston have discovered the tomb of Te K'ab Chaak, the first dynastic ruler of the ancient Mayan city of Caracol in Belize. The tomb, dating to around A.D. 350, contained the ruler's remains along with numerous artifacts, including pottery, a jadeite death mask, and carved bone tubes. This is the first time researchers have found an identifiable ruler's resting place in the city's 40-year excavation history. The discovery provides significant new insights into the early history of Caracol and its connections with the powerful central Mexican city of Teotihuacan, suggesting these interactions began earlier than previously thought.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's praise of Liberian President Joseph Boakai's "good English," this article outlines five key facts about Liberia's deep historical connections to the United States. It explains that Liberia was founded by freed American slaves, English is its official language, and its capital, Monrovia, is named after U.S. President James Monroe. The nation's flag, culture, and institutions bear a strong American influence. While some Liberians found Trump's comments ignorant, the country's foreign minister stated they were not offended, attributing the remark to a global lack of understanding about Africa's linguistic diversity and Liberia's unique history.</p>

          <p>At Wimbledon, the tradition of "the Queue" allows dedicated tennis fans to camp out for days to purchase premium tickets at affordable prices. This organized, grassy field near Centre Court transforms into a temporary village with its own rules, social events, and a strong sense of community. Hundreds of the best seats are reserved daily for those willing to wait, making it a unique feature among Grand Slam tournaments. For many attendees, the experience of camaraderie, tennis-themed parties, and shared anticipation in the Queue is as memorable and important as watching the tournament itself, embodying the spirit of the event.</p>

While Manchester City had previously shown interest, they have since cooled their pursuit, leaving Tottenham as the frontrunner. Nottingham Forest is not under immediate pressure to sell, having recently secured a significant transfer fee for another player, but the talks for Gibbs-White are expected to advance quickly.</p>

          <p>Massachusetts has been named America's most improved state for business in 2025, jumping 18 spots to rank 20th overall in CNBC's annual study. A key factor in this turnaround is the state's relative financial independence from Washington D.C., as it is less reliant on federal funds and has a smaller federal workforce compared to other states. This positions the Bay State to better withstand potential federal budget cuts. However, the article notes that Massachusetts still faces significant challenges, including being the second-most-expensive state to do business in and facing threats to its vital research institutions from targeted federal grant freezes.</p>
