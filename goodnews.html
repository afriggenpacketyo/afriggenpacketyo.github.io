          <p>President Trump has agreed to extend the deadline for imposing 50% tariffs on goods from the European Union to July 9, following a request from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Von der Leyen stated that the EU needs the additional time to secure a favorable trade agreement with the United States, emphasizing the importance of the EU-US trade relationship. Trump expressed frustration with the pace of negotiations, having previously threatened to increase tariffs due to a perceived unfair trade relationship, but ultimately granted the extension to allow for further discussions to reach a mutually agreeable resolution. This decision provides a window for both sides to continue negotiations and avert a potential trade war. Optimism score is based on the potential for improved trade relations.</p>

          <p>A mosaic that once adorned one of Emperor Caligula's extravagant party ships in the first century A.D. resurfaced as a coffee table in a Park Avenue apartment. The ships were sunk after Caligula's assassination and later recovered by Mussolini, only to be destroyed in World War II. The mosaic's journey from Lake Nemi to Manhattan involved theft, rediscovery by an Italian marble expert, and eventual seizure by the Manhattan district attorney's office. The mosaic has since been cleaned and put on display at Nemi's Museum of the Roman Ships, marking the end of its unusual journey.</p>

This approach focuses on accepting a child's emotions without judgment, responding without shame, and viewing "bad" behavior as a signal for support. Emotionally safe parents do inner work to understand their own triggers and model healthy communication and repair. The goal is to foster emotional resilience, trust, and connection in children, helping them to thrive.</p>
