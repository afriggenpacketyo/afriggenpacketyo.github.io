          <p>Brian Williams, Karen Bass's former deputy mayor of public safety, has admitted to fabricating a bomb threat targeting Los Angeles City Hall in October 2024. Williams used a Google Voice application to make a call to his city-issued cellphone, then falsely reported the threat to police and city officials. The LAPD responded to the threat, searching City Hall for suspicious devices, but none were found. This article details the investigation that revealed Williams made the bomb threat himself, leading to his agreement to plead guilty to a single count of "information with threats regarding fire and explosives."</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from proceeding with its plans to dismantle the Department of Education, preventing the firing of half its workforce and the transfer of federal student loans to the Small Business Administration. Judge Myong Joun issued a preliminary injunction, stating that the administration's actions would make it impossible for the department to carry out its mandated functions. The article notes that the judge dismissed the claim that these changes were merely a reorganization and not an attempt to abolish the department. The injunction is a victory for those who challenged Trump's efforts to reduce the size of the Department of Education.</p>

The article notes that China has experienced a significant outflow of millionaires, but America is not seen as a desirable destination due to safety and geopolitical tensions.
