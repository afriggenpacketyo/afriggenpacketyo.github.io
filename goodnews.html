          <h2>UK and EU Nearing Agreement to Reset Relations Amid Global Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 03:30:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK and EU are reportedly close to finalizing a deal to reset relations after Britain's exit from the EU in 2020, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer hosting European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for a summit in London. Talks have intensified, focusing on issues like youth mobility and fishing rights, with a potential agreement expected soon. This reset is seen as crucial given the unpredictable global landscape and a shift towards U.S. isolationism, though the UK remains cautious due to rising support for Reform UK. The agreement aims to pave the way for UK participation in EU security and defense policy, reduce trade friction, and enhance cooperation on energy and carbon taxes. </p>

          <p>Qualcomm plans to launch data center processors designed for artificial intelligence, which will link to Nvidia's GPUs and software, marking a re-entry into the data center market after previous unsuccessful attempts. The new CPUs will connect to Nvidia's GPUs, essential for training AI models, and are based on Arm designs acquired from Nuvia in 2021. This move is part of Qualcomm's strategy to diversify beyond smartphones into chips for cars and PCs, competing with Intel and AMD in the data center CPU market. Qualcomm is touting its chips as power-efficient and capable of running AI processes on-device for faster and more secure applications. </p>

          <p>NBA star Tyrese Haliburton shared his personal struggles with form, anxiety, and negativity from social media, revealing how it affected his mental health and made it difficult for him to show up to work. His candidness highlights the often-hidden mental health challenges faced by athletes, which is further supported by a study on Bundesliga players that found significant levels of depression and anxiety during the season. The study also indicated that female players reported higher depression scores than their male counterparts, and that team sports may have a preventive effect on mental health disorders. Since addressing his struggles, Haliburton has improved his performance, demonstrating the importance of opening up about mental health. </p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan, the liberal and pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, won the Romanian presidential election after a tense race against right-wing nationalist George Simion, leader of the AUR party. Simion had won the first round following the annulment of the previous election due to claims of Russian interference. Dan secured 53.6% of the vote, campaigning on fighting corruption and supporting Ukraine, while Simion attacked the EU and called for cutting aid to Kyiv. The election took place amidst broader discontent with mainstream parties and political turbulence in the EU and NATO member state. </p>

          <p>Dementia is common among older dogs and cats, with symptoms including disorientation, anxiety, and changes in behavior, according to veterinarians. Early intervention is crucial, involving a low-sugar diet, exercise, and mental stimulation, though limited medications are available. Cats often become anxious and vocal at night, while dogs may lose house-training habits. The disease brings changes not only for the affected animals, but also for their families, but with patience and the right care, the progression of the incurable disease can be slowed down. </p>

Co-founder Gilberto Loureiro, who experienced the inefficiencies of textile factories firsthand, claims Smartex has prevented 1 million kilograms of fabric from going to waste in the past three years. The company's defect-spotting technology means 0.37% more garments can be produced per kilogram of finished fabric, which adds up, if you consider that fashion giant Inditex (owner of Zara) used 678,596 tonnes of raw materials in its products in 2024. Smartex is one of the climate tech startups that Amazon is backing via its AWS Compute for Climate Fellowship. </p>

By using different colors of glitter, the Initiative for Nature Conservation Cymru (INCC) hopes to track different families of water voles and understand their range. This tracking will help conservationists adjust the environment to support the species' dispersal and survival, including removing invasive conifers and fencing off riverbanks to prevent grazing. </p>
