          <p>Reform UK's deputy leader, Richard Tice, insists the party knows "exactly what it is doing" after a tumultuous 48 hours involving its chairman, Zia Yusuf, who resigned and then returned in a different role.

Yusuf's initial decision to quit followed criticism of Sarah Pochin, Reform's newest MP, for her question at Prime Minister's Question about banning the burka. Tice insists that Yusuf's return to focus on spending cuts at councils demonstrates the party's commitment to its goals. </p>

The speaker rejoices in the minutiae, including a gold flare in cottonwood leaves, and the smell of split pi√±on and juniper in a garage.
