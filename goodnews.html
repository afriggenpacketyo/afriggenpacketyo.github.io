        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK and the European Union have reportedly reached an agreement to reset relations following Britain's departure from the bloc in 2020. Prime Minister Keir Starmer hosted European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for a summit in London, where discussions intensified on issues like youth mobility and fishing rights. The deal includes reciprocal access to fishing waters until June 30, 2038, energy cooperation, and a security and defense partnership. This agreement marks a significant step towards mending the strained relationship between the UK and the EU in a world where America is a less reliable ally.</p>

          <p>Top officials from Britain and the European Union met in London to discuss a post-Brexit future, focusing on a major reset of relations. The summit, hosted by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, aimed to strengthen the partnership with the EU, particularly in defense and security. Officials announced a new defense agreement to set the tone for future relations, especially as Russia's war in Ukraine continues and the United States urges European nations to increase military spending. Discussions also covered trade and immigration, with the goal of benefiting jobs, bills, and borders. Tensions arose over fishing rights and a youth mobility scheme, but the ultimate deal is expected to lay the groundwork for future collaboration.</p>

          <p>Contrary to stereotypes, many Gen Z professionals are leading the return-to-office trend, driven by a desire to learn from older colleagues and climb the corporate ladder. A recent study found that young workers are in the office more often than other generations and crave in-person interaction. Gen Z views the office as a launchpad for their careers, seeking to develop corporate norms, communication skills, and build relationships. Despite enjoying the benefits of remote work, they recognize the importance of being present to accelerate their learning and career progression, aiming to be recognized by higher-ups and achieve success.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Domestic energy prices in the UK are forecast to decrease in July, marking the first drop in the regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that the bill for a typical household using gas and electricity will fall by ¬£129 annually, a decrease of nearly 7%. This would result in a typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit costing ¬£1,720, down from the current level of ¬£1,849. The price cap is based on the cost of each unit of energy, not the total bill, so usage still affects the overall cost.</p>
