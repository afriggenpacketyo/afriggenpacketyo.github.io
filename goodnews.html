        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Britain’s Foreign Secretary, David Lammy, received a written warning from the UK’s Environment Agency for fishing without a license. The incident occurred during a visit by US Vice President JD Vance to Lammy's country estate, where the two were photographed fishing at a nearby river. Lammy belatedly purchased a license and reported himself, calling it an "administrative error" and avoiding a potential fine of nearly $4,000. This article highlights a minor gaffe during a bilateral meeting that otherwise focused on international issues, with Vance jokingly noting Lammy's lack of fishing success compared to his children. The agency did not disclose if Vance had a license, citing privacy.</p>

The event will commemorate the 80th anniversary of China’s victory in the "war of resistance against Japanese aggression," drawing state leaders globally, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. Security measures include barricades, X-ray screenings for luggage, and body searches at major public areas like shopping destinations near Tiananmen Square.

          <p>Kiyan Anthony, son of basketball star Carmelo Anthony and a new Syracuse University student, has stirred controversy with his opinion that upstate New York residents are "not even from New York." Growing up in New York City, Anthony's comments on a stream suggested that only those from the city's boroughs truly represent New York. This article highlights the age-old debate within the state about regional identity, with many having differing views on where "upstate" begins. Despite his college being located in upstate New York, his message implies a significant cultural divide between the city and the rest of the state, potentially perturbing his new fanbase.</p>

          <p>Chinese smartphone maker Vivo has unveiled its new mixed-reality headset, the "Vivo Vision," positioning it as a direct competitor to Apple's Vision Pro. The Vivo device boasts a significantly lighter design, weighing about 35% less than its US rival, and is expected to cost approximately one-third as much. Featuring high-resolution OLED displays that deliver 8K resolution and powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2 Platform, the headset offers intuitive eye tracking and hand gestures. This article notes that it currently requires specific Vivo phones or Windows computers for full functionality, addressing a common concern regarding VR headset weight.</p>

While many airports offer discounts or waivers, the article highlights that some still charge, and others require cumbersome online pre-registration processes that can be difficult for non-computer-literate individuals. Disabled Motoring UK argues that people with disabilities should not face these charges, emphasizing the need for respect and dignity. This issue affects spontaneity and accessibility for disabled travelers, with only a few airports currently offering entirely free drop-offs for all passengers.</p>

          <p>Three previously unknown oil paintings attributed to avant-garde artist Kazimir Malevich, potentially worth over £100 million, are on display in Bucharest, but their authenticity is facing significant skepticism. The works were reportedly discovered under a pensioner's mattress and inherited by an Israeli businessman. Ukrainian-American scholar Konstantin Akinsha highlights incomplete provenance records and a lack of documentation during Malevich's lifetime, stating no private sales were recorded after 1917. This article details how supporting certificates from an art historian, who previously authenticated disputed works, and technical analyses have been questioned, with laboratories stating their reports do not prove authenticity.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament's e-petitions system marks its tenth anniversary, prompting an examination of its impact and effectiveness. The article highlights both significant successes, such as "Finn's Law" which changed legislation for service animals, and numerous humorous or less impactful campaigns. While millions have signed petitions, only a few have garnered over a million signatures, and not all have led to direct policy changes. Despite some public skepticism about its practical outcomes, with critics arguing it gives an "illusion of a feedback loop," the system is defended as a "bridge between the public and Parliament," allowing citizens to engage directly in democracy.</p>

          <p>Patrick Cantlay and Tommy Fleetwood are tied for the lead at the Tour Championship, setting up a compelling final-day battle for glory.

This article highlights Fleetwood's resilience after a double bogey, bouncing back with birdies on the 16th and 17th. The outcome holds significant Ryder Cup implications, particularly for Cantlay, who is virtually assured a captain's pick, and Keegan Bradley, whose strong performance could make him the first playing captain since 1963.</p>

The reconstructions reveal features of Ancient Ancestral South Indians, with traces of Middle-East Eurasian and Austro-Asiatic ancestries, sparking discussions on India's diverse historical narratives and challenging traditional views of Indian civilization's origins.</p>

This article highlights ongoing concerns about the league's lack of competition at the top, which has hindered its global sporting and commercial standing compared to leagues like the Premier League. In response, the DFL is implementing new strategies, including awarding streaming rights to YouTube content creators for live matches in the UK and Ireland, aiming to attract a new generation of global fans who consume football non-traditionally.

          <p>The UK government is planning significant sentencing reforms that would allow courts to impose non-custodial punishments like bans from pubs, concerts, sports matches, driving, and travel. This article details how these new restrictions, which could also include mandatory drug testing for offenders on probation, aim to "toughen up community punishments" and deter reoffending. The proposals come as part of wider efforts to address prison overcrowding and provide more sentencing options short of incarceration, shifting pressure onto probation and police services. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood emphasizes that criminals must face restrictions on their freedom within the community.</p>

          <p>Major US retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, are adapting to the Trump administration's new tariff increases by diversifying sourcing, negotiating with vendors, and selectively adjusting prices. This article highlights that while tariff costs are rising for retailers, widespread consumer price hikes have largely been avoided so far. Walmart's CFO noted that prices were raised on some items, but discounts were expanded elsewhere, with consumer spending remaining resilient overall. Retail executives indicate lower-income shoppers are more sensitive to price changes. Companies are also leveraging strong brands and new revenue streams like advertising to absorb costs, making earnings steadier. (not investment advice)</p>
