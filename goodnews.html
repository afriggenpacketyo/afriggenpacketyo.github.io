          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 20:10:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK and EU are engaged in negotiations over a "youth mobility scheme" that would allow young people to move freely between the UK and EU for up to four years, a right that was lost post-Brexit. The UK government is wary of the impact on immigration numbers, with some officials suggesting limiting visas to one year to avoid impacting immigration figures. Fishing rights are also a key point of contention, with the EU seeking an extension of current arrangements while UK fishing groups advocate for changes to benefit their industry, including restricting EU vessels' access to coastal waters and easing access to EU markets. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses how the Doom franchise is adapting to the modern gaming landscape with its latest installment, Doom: The Dark Ages. Developers aim to attract new players by offering a shorter, more accessible experience compared to "forever games" like Fortnite. The game incorporates customization options and a new "Medieval sci-fi" setting to broaden its appeal. The article also addresses the ongoing debate over game pricing, with Doom's producers arguing that a one-time purchase can be more cost-effective than free-to-play games with microtransactions. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 20:07:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla has amended its corporate bylaws to require shareholders to hold at least 3% of the company's outstanding shares to file derivative lawsuits for breach of fiduciary duty. This change, enabled by Texas state law, significantly raises the barrier for investors seeking legal action against Tesla's board or executives. Ann Lipton, a corporate law expert, notes that this move contrasts with Tesla's previous incorporation in Delaware, where lawsuits could be brought with minimal share ownership. The move follows Tesla's relocation of its incorporation to Texas after a court ruling against Elon Musk's compensation package. </p>

          <p>Two British men accused of robbing a luxury jewelry store in Tokyo can be extradited to Japan following a landmark ruling. Kaine Wright and Joe Chappell are accused of stealing items worth ¬£679,000 from a Harry Winston store in 2015. Despite the absence of an extradition treaty between the UK and Japan, a judge has ruled that their extradition would be compatible with their human rights. The case now passes to the home secretary to decide whether they should be sent to Japan. </p>

          <p>A California environmental oversight board voted to rescind a proposal that would have allowed municipal landfills to accept contaminated soil, a decision that follows months of scrutiny from residents and environmental groups. The proposal had raised concerns about toxic dust and chemicals leaching into groundwater. The board's decision upholds California's stringent hazardous waste standards. The discussion of hazardous waste disposal has been thrust into the public spotlight recently as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers continues to remove toxic ash and contaminated soil from properties destroyed in the Eaton and Palisades wildfires. </p>
