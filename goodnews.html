          <p>A 13-year-old boy, Micah, was diagnosed with the extremely rare Danon disease after experiencing chest pains, a condition his mother also unknowingly had. This genetic disorder led to severe heart failure, necessitating a heart transplant for Micah, just as his mother had years earlier. The shared, harrowing experience inspired Micah and his mother to create "Transplant Teenz," a non-profit virtual support group for teenagers awaiting organ transplants. This initiative aims to provide a community and resources that Micah found lacking during his own journey.</p>

          <p>A year after China's Chang'e-6 mission returned rock samples from the moon's far side, a scientific debate is raging over the age of the South Pole-Aitken basin. Chinese scientists have proposed a new age of 4.25 billion years based on direct analysis of these samples, challenging existing models that rely on crater counting. This new finding, described as the most credible evidence to date, has faced resistance and was reportedly rejected twice for peer review by a panel of Western scientists. The dispute highlights ongoing tensions and differing methodologies within the international planetary science community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Author Katie Gatti Tassin, in her book "Rich Girl Nation," describes the significant financial burden of beauty standards on women as a "hot girl hamster wheel." She argues that spending on aesthetic enhancements is an insidious force, creating a cycle of recurring expenses on what are essentially depreciating assets. Tassin suggests women conduct a "hot girl detox" by annualizing these costs to see their true impact and then experimenting with cutting back. The saved money, she advises, can then be used more effectively to pay down debt, build savings, or invest for the future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Reflecting on the recent deadly flood at Camp Mystic in Texas, this article explores the essential role of summer camp in fostering bravery and resilience in girls. The author, whose mother ran a Girl Scout camp, argues that camp is a place where girls learn to handle discomfort and challenges, preparing them for life's trials. While acknowledging the tragedy as a "worst nightmare" for camp leaders, the piece advocates against over-protection in its wake. It posits that camp provides a unique space for personal growth, and the experience of overcoming fear is a fundamental part of its value.</p>

          <p>While many students believe a finance degree offers the best career prospects, recent data suggests a more complex employment landscape. A CFA Institute survey shows high student confidence in finance, but New York Fed data reveals that majors like art history and nutritional sciences have lower unemployment rates for recent graduates. The report highlights a growing demand for humanities majors, as skills like creative thinking become more valuable in an AI-driven economy. Even major financial firms like BlackRock are reportedly adjusting hiring strategies to include more graduates with degrees in fields like history and English. (not investment advice)</p>

This article argues the backlash is overblown, pointing out that Superman's origin has always been an immigrant story and the film itself emphasizes all-American values of kindness and assimilation. The piece contrasts the fictional hero's story with the current political climate of targeted immigration raids, suggesting that while Superman is an immigrant, his story has rarely delved into the complex realities faced by many immigrants in the U.S.</p>

As climate change increases the frequency of flooding, many are unknowingly in harm's way, partly because 14 states have no flood disclosure laws for home sales. The article recommends asking about a property's flood history, using online tools like Realtor.com or FEMA's maps to check future risk, and understanding the costs and requirements of flood insurance. It stresses that official FEMA maps can be outdated and may not account for future climate-driven risks.</p>
