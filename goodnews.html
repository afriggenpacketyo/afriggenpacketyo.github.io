          <p>President Trump's U.K. state visit included a news conference with Prime Minister Keir Starmer after signing a tech investment deal. The leaders engaged in trade and geopolitical discussions at Chequers, Starmer's official country residence. Commitments from the U.S.-U.K. trade deal were finalized, alongside discussions on tariffs and the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. The U.K. government has hailed £150 billion in inward investment during the visit, expected to boost jobs and growth across the country. The two leaders appear to have a strong relationship, despite their different political backgrounds, which has been key to the visit's success. </p>

          <p>Uber Technologies is partnering with Flytrex to launch a drone delivery service for Uber Eats customers in select U.S. pilot markets by the end of the year. Uber aims to create a flexible, multimodal delivery network beyond cars, bikes, and couriers. Flytrex drones have already completed over 200,000 deliveries in suburban areas and is one of the few companies authorized for "Beyond Visual Line of Sight" operations. This announcement comes after Uber's recent unveiling of helicopter booking options, marking advancements in the company's offerings. Other companies, including DoorDash, are also exploring drone delivery as the technology becomes more mainstream. </p>

          <p>The Bank of England has maintained UK interest rates at 4%, cautioning that the country is "not out of the woods yet" regarding rising inflation. Despite expectations of a hold, two members of the Monetary Policy Committee voted to cut rates to 3.75%. The Bank expects inflation to return to its 2% target but remains cautious about future rate cuts, emphasizing that any further reductions will depend on evidence of easing price pressures. The Bank also announced a slower pace for reducing its holdings of government debt, weeks after financial market turmoil. The Bank's regional offices reported that business sentiment is downbeat, with firms citing the upcoming autumn Budget as a source of uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Katarina Johnson-Thompson is preparing for the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, approaching it as a new experience rather than a chance for redemption. The athlete's previous experience in Tokyo was marred by an injury during the 200m at the Olympics. She has since recovered, winning multiple world titles and an Olympic silver medal in Paris. Johnson-Thompson aims to enjoy the competition and experience Japan fully, focusing on the present and future rather than dwelling on past setbacks. Despite the challenges, she remains competitive and dedicated to her sport, looking forward to facing rivals like Nafi Thiam for global gold. </p>

          <h2>Attorneys General Warn Colleges Against Suppressing Free Speech</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of state attorneys general has warned public universities and colleges against using Charlie Kirk's death as a pretext to stifle conservative free speech. The letter emphasizes the importance of content-neutral security fees and viewpoint-neutral application of security policies. It cites previous instances where colleges allegedly misused security policies to unconstitutionally chill conservative speech on campus. The attorneys general assert that students might be considered "consumers" under state consumer fraud acts, and universities could violate these laws by imposing exorbitant fees on student groups. They pledge to investigate complaints and ensure state entities, including public colleges, follow the Constitution. </p>

          <p>A coalition of 22 attorneys general are opposing the Trump administration's proposed regulation that could narrow eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. The attorneys general expressed their concerns in a letter to Education Department Secretary McMahon, citing the potential harm to public servants. The proposed rule could deny loan forgiveness to borrowers employed by organizations involved in activities the administration disapproves of. The attorneys general argue the regulatory language is vague, leading to uncertainty about eligible employers and granting broad authority to exclude programs. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program allows non-profit and government employees to have their federal student loans canceled after 10 years of payments. </p>

Durant began investing in bitcoin around 2016, after hearing about it from his teammates. Bitcoin's value has risen dramatically since then, trading at almost $116,000, compared to between $360 and $1,000 in 2016.

          <p>Liverpool has been scoring late winners in all five of their competitive matches this season, averaging a match-winning moment after 91 minutes. This run of late goals is a marked difference from last season, when they only scored four stoppage-time goals in 48 matches. Manager Arne Slot attributes this success to self-belief and fitness, emphasizing the team's mentality to always push. Despite the squad's average age, older players have been heavily involved in the late-goal involvements. The team's success is attributed to both the manager's strategy and the experience of the players on the pitch. </p>
