          <p>Chinese toy company Pop Mart is content with the recent drop in resale prices for its popular Labubu monster toy, despite previous markups of over 2,000%. The company stated its products are intended for art appreciation and joy, not profit-making, aiming for a more sustainable model. This shift follows increased production to meet demand and complaints about scalpers, with Pop Mart now churning out 30 million plush toys monthly. Analysts view the secondary market as a barometer for product popularity, and while Pop Mart's shares have fallen recently, they remain significantly up year-to-date. The article suggests this move could help the company avoid being a one-hit wonder and focus on long-term customer engagement.</p>

Despite blowing a 14-point fourth-quarter lead, the Seahawks rallied after the Cardinals tied the game with 33 seconds left. Key plays included Darnold's pass to Jaxon Smith-Njigba to get into field-goal range, and the Seahawks' defense sacking Kyler Murray six times.

Currently, elections cannot be held under martial law, which has been in effect since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. The article notes that Zelenskyy's five-year term would have ended in May 2024 if not for the ongoing conflict, and he has now served beyond his original mandate. (Fox News Article)</p>

As of Thursday evening, it was located northeast of the northern Leeward Islands with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph, extending 90 miles from its center. This is the eighth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, following Hurricane Gabrielle, which is not impacting land. The National Hurricane Center is also monitoring a second system in the northeast Caribbean that could become a tropical depression and potentially bring heavy rains to Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic before strengthening near the Bahamas.</p>

          <p>Raj Ganguly, co-founder of B Capital, asserts that artificial intelligence is in the early stages of a 'super cycle' that could extend for 15 to 20 years, profoundly changing the world. He highlights AI's impact on diverse sectors, from drug development to the job market, following the advent of generative AI with ChatGPT in late 2022. Ganguly identifies three major shifts: Silicon Valley's resurgence, the empowerment of sole founders through AI, and a pivot towards 'deep tech' beyond consumer-facing companies. While acknowledging a potential 'bubble' of overvaluation, he sees significant opportunities in AI-native apps, particularly from markets like India. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has granted preliminary approval to a $1.5 billion settlement between AI company Anthropic and authors/publishers who alleged nearly half a million books were illegally pirated to train its chatbots. The agreement, which will compensate authors and publishers approximately $3,000 per book, does not apply to future works. This article notes that the Association of American Publishers views this as a significant step towards holding AI developers accountable for infringement. Anthropic expressed satisfaction with the approval, emphasizing that the court's prior ruling on AI training as transformative fair use remains intact. This settlement is seen as a milestone in authors' fight for their rights, pushing AI companies toward legal licensing.</p>

          <p>California Senate Bill 576, introduced by Senator Tom Umberg, seeks to regulate the volume of commercials on streaming services, ensuring they don't blast louder than the content. The bill was inspired by the experience of parents whose baby was repeatedly woken by jarringly loud ads. While federal law (CALM Act of 2010) already regulates traditional TV broadcasters, streaming services are currently exempt. Due to California's significant market influence, this state-level legislation could effectively set a national standard. The bill, which has passed the state Senate, faces opposition from the Motion Picture Association, but proponents argue that streaming platforms possess the technical capability to control ad volume. This article highlights a consumer protection issue with potentially widespread impact.</p>

          <p>The UK's first stem cell collection center solely dedicated to transplants has opened at Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre, aiming to significantly increase life-saving donations. Run by the Anthony Nolan charity in partnership with NIHR, the center will create 1,300 new donation slots annually, addressing a global shortage of facilities. This expansion is crucial as growing demand has strained existing donation centers, with only a fifth of UK registry donors able to donate on time in 2022-23. The article highlights the profound impact on patients with blood cancers and disorders, for whom a timely stem cell transplant can be their only hope.

          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto, the eighth named storm of the season, is swirling north of the Caribbean and, while not expected to make landfall, could interact with another developing system. This potential interaction could lead to the rare 'Fujiwhara effect,' where two storms merge or orbit each other. CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan explains that the outcome depends on the storms' characteristics, with a stronger system typically absorbing a weaker one. The National Hurricane Center is monitoring a second system near Humberto, which is forecast to strengthen into a tropical depression. This article delves into the scientific possibility and implications of such a meteorological phenomenon, noting any path changes would likely be slight.</p>

          <p>Approximately 200 pieces of live coral, illegally smuggled from Indonesia, have found a new home at the New York Aquarium after being seized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Trading in coral is highly restricted, with many species protected under international conservation agreements. The coral, in poor health after five days in transit, was rescued by the aquarium, which functions as a 'coral hospital.' Staff have successfully rehabilitated many of the corals, which are now on public display. This article highlights the vital role of aquariums in wildlife conservation and educating the public about endangered species and the illegal wildlife trade.</p>
