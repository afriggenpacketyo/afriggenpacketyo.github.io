        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has officially approved a £2.2 billion, privately-financed plan to bring a second runway into regular use at London's Gatwick Airport. The project, which involves moving an existing northern runway, is intended to boost economic growth, create jobs, and increase the airport's flight capacity from 280,000 to nearly 389,000 annually. Despite the government's support, the expansion faces significant opposition from environmental campaigners and local groups concerned about increased noise, pollution, and climate impact. The approval is contingent on the airport meeting stricter noise controls and public transport usage targets.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that conservative media figures Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch are likely to be part of the investment group acquiring TikTok's U.S. operations. The deal is being structured to address national security concerns, with plans for a seven-member board controlled by six Americans and U.S. oversight of the app's algorithm and data privacy. The move is part of an ongoing effort to allow the popular social media platform to continue operating in the United States under American ownership, thereby avoiding a congressionally mandated ban.</p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan initiated a one-day trial banning all traffic from a half-mile stretch of the iconic Oxford Street, calling it the day "the fight back began to rescue this street." The event is a precursor to a potential permanent pedestrianization aimed at increasing foot traffic and revitalizing one of the world's busiest shopping districts. While many pedestrians welcomed the car-free environment, the proposal has raised concerns among some local residents and councillors about traffic being diverted to smaller side streets and potential accessibility issues.</p>

          <p>U.S. runner Cole Hocker claimed the gold medal in the men's 5,000-meter final at the World Athletics Championships with a dramatic finishing kick. Hocker was in 11th place at the start of the final lap but surged past his competitors to win in 12 minutes and 58.30 seconds. The victory served as a powerful redemption for Hocker, who had been controversially disqualified from the 1,500-meter semifinals earlier in the competition. He stated that he felt "robbed" in the earlier race and was determined to end the championships on his own terms.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the Ryder Cup at Bethpage, European captain Luke Donald has suggested that the U.S. team's decision to accept a $500,000 payment per player could create added pressure from the home crowd. Donald speculated that New York fans, who are paying high ticket prices, might be more inclined to turn on the American players if they are not performing well, especially given the financial incentive. He contrasted this with the European team, whose members continue to play for free, emphasizing that their motivation comes from purpose and tradition, not monetary reward.</p>

          <p>China's first domestically developed large passenger jet, the C919, is being assembled in a futuristic factory that integrates 5G and time-sensitive networking to prevent production errors. This advanced system creates a unified communication loop connecting every robot, tool, sensor, and worker on the final assembly line. The goal of this "sensing-transmission-control integration" is to eliminate quality control lapses, such as missing bolts or tools left inside aircraft, which have been issues for other major aeronautical manufacturers, positioning China as a technologically advanced competitor in the global aviation market.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, some Wall Street strategists believe the stock market could continue its record-setting climb. They argue that the current S&P 500 is fundamentally different from historical benchmarks due to the high profitability of dominant tech companies and the productivity gains driven by artificial intelligence. However, other market experts express caution, warning that further rate cuts could fuel a speculative "melt-up" based on investor FOMO rather than fundamentals, which could lead to a sharp correction.

          <p>According to well-being expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can accelerate the body's aging process on a cellular level by shortening telomeres, the protective caps at the end of our chromosomes. In a recent podcast, she explained that our cells are constantly "listening" to our thoughts and lifestyle. Fortunately, this process can be slowed or even reversed. Epel recommends simple, sustainable daily practices like taking short five-minute breaks, adopting a Mediterranean diet, and prioritizing deep rest through yoga or breathwork to help restore cells.</p>

          <p>A child development expert, after studying over 200 parent-child relationships, has identified key behaviors of parents whose children exhibit exceptional social skills. Rather than memorizing phrases, these skills are built through an environment of emotional safety at home. Key practices include openly discussing feelings, modeling empathy in daily life, teaching conflict resolution, and validating a child's emotions. By treating mistakes as learning opportunities and listening more than lecturing, parents provide a blueprint for developing emotionally intelligent and socially aware individuals.</p>
