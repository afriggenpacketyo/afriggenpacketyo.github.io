          <h2>Corporate Buzzwords: Why We Love to Hate Them</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Corporate buzzwords are often used to convey meaning, but they can also impede trust and create insecurity among employees. Studies show that employees who feel lower-status tend to use more jargon, possibly as a way to fit in or appear more knowledgeable. While some believe buzzwords foster a culture of inclusion, others find them distracting and a way to avoid direct communication. The article suggests using plain language instead of relying on jargon, and encourages people to read poetry for richer metaphors. </p>

          <p>The UK government is preparing to unveil a major review of the military, the strategic defence review, amid growing concerns about global security threats. The review will emphasize modernizing the forces, highlighting the importance of drones and adapting existing equipment quickly. There will be an emphasis on modernizing the forces, not least because the war in Ukraine has demonstrated the importance of drones and adapting existing kit quickly to lethal effect. The review is expected to stress a greater need for public involvement in protecting the country, including British industry creating more defense equipment and expanding the cadet forces. </p>

          <p>British rider Simon Yates delivered a remarkable performance on the penultimate stage of the Giro d'Italia, seizing the pink jersey from Isaac del Toro and effectively securing his second Grand Tour title.

          <p>A psychiatrist with experience working with young adults suggests five simple rules for parents to navigate the complexities of raising successful children. The rules emphasize trusting instincts, following cultural traditions, paying attention to the child's individual interests, prioritizing enjoyment over strict developmental milestones, and being authentic rather than striving for perfection. The psychiatrist suggests that by focusing on these core principles, parents can reduce anxiety and create a supportive environment for their children's growth. The emphasis is on connection, authenticity, and understanding the child's unique path. </p>

          <p>Sharon Horgan, the Bafta award-winning actor, writer, producer, and director, shared that she found confidence after the second series of her hit show, Bad Sisters. Horgan also discussed how she began writing due to a lack of acting roles, leading her to create parts for herself. She expressed concerns that her female-led sitcom might limit opportunities for other women, feeling that it was a one-in, one-out system. Motherhood was a theme the Irish star returned to when she created the hit BBC series Motherland, alongside Holly Walsh and Graham Linehan.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri secured pole position for the Spanish Grand Prix, outperforming his McLaren teammate Lando Norris in Barcelona. Piastri's advantage suggests that a rule change aimed at restricting the flexing of front wings for aerodynamic gain has had no effect on McLaren. It was introduced by governing body the FIA after intensive lobbying by Red Bull, who - along with Ferrari - hoped it would peg back some of McLaren's performance. Norris made errors in a couple of corners on his final run and, although he improved his time, fell short of Piastri.</p>
