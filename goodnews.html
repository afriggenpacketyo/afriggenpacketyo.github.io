          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated that his primary goal is to end the war with Russia and that he is prepared to leave office once peace is achieved. In an interview, he confirmed he would be open to holding national elections during a ceasefire, a significant statement given that elections are currently suspended under martial law. Zelenskyy, whose original five-year term would have ended in May 2024, emphasized that seeking another term is not his personal ambition. His focus remains on leading the country through its current conflict and securing a victory for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has acknowledged that left-wing parties, including his own, have historically shied away from addressing public concerns about illegal immigration. In an op-ed, Starmer stated that Labour must tackle the issue to counter the rise of the "populist Right," specifically noting the challenge from Reform UK. This shift in rhetoric comes as his government prepares to announce a compulsory UK-wide digital ID scheme to manage immigration more effectively. Starmer's comments aim to reposition the Labour Party on a key electoral issue ahead of its annual conference.</p>

          <p>According to Raj Ganguly, co-founder of venture capital firm B Capital, the world is in the early stages of an artificial intelligence "super cycle" that could last for 15 to 20 years. He predicts that AI will profoundly change every global industry, from drug development to the job market, in ways that go beyond consumer technology. While acknowledging that the current market may be somewhat "frothy" or overvalued due to high expectations, Ganguly believes the long-term impact is undeniable. He also highlights India as a key market for developing AI-native applications that could become global leaders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is set to open the world's highest bridge to traffic in the mountainous southwestern province of Guizhou, a region already known for its record-breaking bridges. The new structure crosses the Huajiang Grand Canyon, with its deck rising 625 meters (2,050 feet) above the river below, a height comparable to China's tallest skyscraper. With a total length of 2,890 meters, it is also poised to become the world's longest mountain bridge. This engineering feat further solidifies Guizhou's reputation as a global hub for advanced bridge construction and infrastructure development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has granted preliminary approval for a $1.5 billion settlement between the AI company Anthropic and a group of authors and publishers. The lawsuit alleged that Anthropic illegally used nearly half a million pirated books to train its AI models, such as Claude. Under the agreement, authors and publishers will receive approximately $3,000 for each book involved, though it does not cover future works. The settlement is seen as a significant step in holding AI developers accountable for copyright infringement and may push other AI companies toward legally licensing training materials.</p>

          <h2>California Bill to Regulate Loud Streaming Commercials Awaits Governor's Signature</h2>

          <p>A California bill aimed at regulating the volume of commercials on streaming services is now on the governor's desk, with the potential to set a nationwide standard. The legislation, inspired by a state senator's staffer whose baby was repeatedly woken by loud ads, seeks to apply rules similar to the federal CALM Act to services like Netflix and Prime Video. While federal law already limits ad volume on broadcast and cable TV, it does not cover streaming platforms. Due to California's large market size, if the bill is signed, streaming companies are likely to adopt the standard nationally rather than create separate policies.</p>

          <p>The UK's first collection centre dedicated solely to stem cell transplants has opened in Nottingham, aiming to increase the availability of life-saving treatments for patients with blood cancers. Run by the charity Anthony Nolan, the new facility is expected to create 1,300 new donation slots annually, addressing a global shortage of collection facilities. This shortage has often caused delays for patients needing timely transplants. The centre will streamline the donation process, where stem cells are collected from a donor's bloodstream, allowing for more efficient matching and delivery to patients in need across the UK and internationally.</p>

          <p>A diverse field of candidates running for Governor of California in 2026 offered their perspectives on the successes and failures of the current Newsom administration and the state legislature. In a series of interviews, Democratic candidates like Toni Atkins and Xavier Becerra praised Newsom's efforts on issues like healthcare and the economy, while suggesting areas for improvement such as housing. Republican candidates, including Sheriff Chad Bianco and Leo Zacky, were highly critical, struggling to name any positive actions taken by the current leadership.

          <p>Meteorologists are monitoring a potential interaction between Tropical Storm Humberto and a nearby developing storm, which could result in a rare phenomenon known as the Fujiwhara effect. This occurs when two tropical cyclones get close enough to orbit a common center, potentially merging or altering each other's paths and intensity. While such an event is considered unlikely in this case due to the distance and strength difference between the two systems, it remains a scientific possibility. The Fujiwhara effect can make storm tracking more complex, and forecasters are closely watching the systems as they move through the western Atlantic.</p>

          <p>Around 200 pieces of live coral, illegally smuggled from Indonesia and seized by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at JFK Airport, have found a new home at the New York Aquarium. The coral, which is protected under international conservation agreements, was in poor health after being in transit for five days. Staff at the aquarium acted as a "coral hospital," nursing the animals back to health before moving many of them to public display. The incident highlights the ongoing issue of illegal wildlife trade and the crucial role aquariums can play in conservation and education efforts.</p>

          <p>Pfizer's acquisition of Metsera, a developer of next-generation obesity and metabolic disease drugs, for up to $7.3 billion is expected to intensify research and development in the weight-loss drug sector. Analysts believe the deal signals that major pharmaceutical companies are still willing to make significant investments in innovative treatments in this high-demand market. Metsera's drug candidates aim to offer better efficacy and tolerability with fewer injections than current market leaders. The move is likely to encourage other companies, including those in China, to advance their own innovative obesity drug pipelines to remain competitive.</p>

          <p>A "very mean squirrel" has been attacking residents in the Lucas Valley neighborhood of San Rafael, California, sending at least two people to the emergency room with bites and scratches. An 80-year-old woman was among the victims, and a flier posted in the area warns that the squirrel "comes out of nowhere" to attack. The local humane society suggests the squirrel's unusual aggression is likely the result of being hand-fed by humans, which causes wild animals to lose their natural fear and approach people expecting food. Officials advise the public to never feed wildlife to prevent such incidents.</p>

          <p>A former senior Chinese economic official, Yang Weimin, has urged the government to prioritize increasing household income as a key strategy in its upcoming five-year plan. He argued that weak consumer demand is the primary obstacle to China's economic growth and is fundamentally an issue of insufficient income. Yang, who was involved in drafting previous economic blueprints, recommended policies to increase the share of household disposable income in the national total. This would help shift China's economy towards a consumption-driven model, a long-stated goal for ensuring more sustainable long-term growth. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite facing inflationary pressures and higher tariff costs on imported goods, the company has managed its merchandise assortment to mitigate the impact. The CFO noted that overall inflation remained in the low- to mid-single-digit range, though non-food merchandise saw a return of inflation, driven primarily by imports. (not investment advice)</p>
