          <p>Under new government plans, developers who leave housing sites unfinished for extended periods could have their land transferred to local councils. The rules require housebuilders to commit to delivery time frames and submit annual progress reports. Those failing to meet targets may face penalties or be denied future permissions, as the government aims to build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029. Housing charity Shelter supports the plans, accusing developers of delaying construction to inflate prices and avoid building social housing.</p>

          <p>New high-definition images have been captured of the USS F-1, a World War I-era submarine that sank off the coast of San Diego in 1917, killing 19 crew members. The images were taken by interagency teams using deep-sea imaging technology during an expedition. The USS F-1 collided with its sister ship during training exercises, and its wreckage was discovered in 1972. The recent expedition provided the first close-up survey of the submarine, along with images of a U.S. Navy Avenger torpedo bomber that crashed in the same area in 1950.</p>

          <p>Iranian director Jafar Panahi, who won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for "It Was Just an Accident," spoke out against the restrictions imposed by the Iranian regime. Panahi, who has previously been imprisoned and banned from film-making, urged fellow Iranians to set aside differences and fight for freedom. His film, shot in secret and based on his experiences in prison, tells the tale of Iranians confronting a man they believe tortured them. The director vowed to return to Tehran despite the risks of prosecution.</p>
