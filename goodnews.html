          <h2>Understanding IRS Rules on Tax Extensions and Payment Deadlines</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 11:37:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A common misconception among taxpayers is that filing for a tax extension also postpones their payment due date. This article clarifies that while an extension provides six more months to file returns, thus avoiding late-filing penalties, the IRS still requires an estimated tax payment by the original April deadline. Failure to pay on time results in late-payment penalties and accruing interest, which can significantly increase a taxpayer's liability. The text also outlines options for those unable to pay their full tax bill, such as installment agreements or an Offer in Compromise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England has named spinner Liam Dawson to its team for the fourth Test against India, marking his return to the format after an eight-year absence. The 35-year-old left-armer replaces Shoaib Bashir, who is out with a broken finger, and is expected to strengthen England's lower-order batting in addition to his bowling. Dawson's last Test appearance was in 2017, and his recall comes after a long period away from the international squad. England currently leads the five-Test series 2-1 and can secure a series victory with a win at Old Trafford.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has named former biotech executive and physician-scientist George Tidmarsh as the new head of its Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). Tidmarsh, who has been involved in the development of seven approved drugs, will lead the crucial division responsible for reviewing most new drug applications. His appointment comes amid significant changes at the FDA under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Tidmarsh's past criticisms of certain FDA decisions, including the accelerated approval of Biogen's Aduhelm, suggest he may adopt a more stringent regulatory approach.</p>

          <p>A High Court judge has dismissed a legal challenge against the planned expansion of the Wimbledon tennis site, allowing the controversial project to move forward. The proposal, approved by the Greater London Authority, aims to nearly triple the site's size by adding 38 new courts and an 8,000-seat stadium on former parkland. The campaign group Save Wimbledon Park had argued the development was unlawful as it was on protected land. The All England Club expressed delight with the ruling, which paves the way for a significant transformation of the iconic venue.</p>

          <p>Following a strong rally earlier in the year, gold prices have consolidated, leading to speculation about whether they can reach the $3,500 threshold by the end of July. Most market experts believe this target is unlikely within the short timeframe, citing the need for a major economic shift or a change in the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy. However, some analysts note that gold can be volatile and a significant catalyst could trigger a rapid price increase. Key factors influencing the price include central bank activity, geopolitical events, inflation data, and the strength of the U.S. dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kenyan authorities have dropped the serious charge of terrorism against activist Boniface Mwangi, instead charging him with unlawful possession of ammunition. Mwangi, a well-known anti-corruption campaigner, was arrested in connection with recent street protests against the government. His supporters had feared he would face more severe charges after police initially accused him of facilitating terrorist acts. Mwangi was released on bond immediately after his court appearance, where he told supporters that the government was scared of young people organizing for a better country.</p>

While the total export volume was a significant increase from the previous month, it still represented a 38.2% drop compared to the same period last year.

          <p>Southwest Airlines has announced it will officially end its long-standing open seating policy and introduce assigned seats on January 27. This marks a major shift in the carrier's half-century-old business model, which has traditionally set it apart from competitors. The new system will feature eight boarding groups determined by factors like elite status and seat location, replacing the current A-B-C boarding process. This change is part of a broader overhaul aimed at generating new revenue, which also includes new fare types and fees for checked bags for many customers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the surprisingly relevant question of whether animals need sunscreen. While many creatures have evolved natural protections like fur or pigment, domesticated and zoo animals often face sun exposure challenges their wild ancestors did not. Vets and zookeepers increasingly use sunscreen on light-colored or sparsely-furred animals like pigs, horses, and certain dog breeds to prevent sunburns and skin cancer. The practice highlights a human-created problem, as selective breeding has produced animals vulnerable to sun damage. The piece discusses the practical challenges, from finding safe products to training an animal to accept the application.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the long-standing investment advice from billionaire Warren Buffett, who has consistently advocated for low-cost S&P 500 index funds as the most sensible choice for the majority of investors. Buffett argues that by periodically investing in a broad market index, even a "know-nothing investor" can outperform most professionals who charge high fees for active management. He advises investors to consistently buy into an index fund through both good and bad market conditions. The text highlights this philosophy as a cornerstone of building long-term wealth for those without specialized market expertise. (not investment advice)</p>
