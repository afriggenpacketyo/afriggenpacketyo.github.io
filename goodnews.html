          <h2>German Automakers See Hope for EU Tariff Breakthrough Following US-Japan Trade Agreement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 04:35:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European car manufacturers' shares surged after the U.S.-Japan trade deal, which lowered tariffs on Japanese autos, sparked optimism for a similar agreement with the European Union. The agreement, described by former President Trump as "massive," reduced U.S. tariffs on Japanese vehicles and parts to 15% from the existing 25% rate, a significant drop. This precedent has led economists to suggest it could influence ongoing negotiations with the EU and South Korea, as auto tariffs were reduced without an export cap for a major auto-exporting country. While European automakers have substantial investment plans in the U.S., the figures do not come close to Japan's commitment, yet the markets are reflecting strong hopes for a potential deal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a new trade framework agreement with Japan, U.S. President Donald Trump has now directed his attention towards upcoming trade negotiations with the European Union. Pressure is mounting for a deal before August 1, when 30% levies on U.S.-bound EU imports are set to take effect, with potential retaliatory tariffs from Brussels. The U.S.-Japan deal, which lowered auto tariffs to 15% without an export cap, has generated positive sentiment among experts who believe it could serve as a precedent for EU talks. The EU is keen on securing exemptions for key sectors, particularly road vehicles, which are among its top exports to the U.S., as European markets show an initial positive reaction.</p>

          <h2>DNA Analysis Uncovers Matrilineal Society in Ancient Turkish Settlement of Catalhoyuk</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 04:08:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New DNA analysis of 131 skeletons from the Neolithic settlement of Catalhoyuk in Turkey, dating back 9,000 years, strongly suggests a society centered around women. Researchers discovered that individuals buried under the same houses were often related through their mothers, indicating a matrilineal household structure where men moved in with the woman's family. Furthermore, female bodies were found with up to five times more grave goods than male ones, reinforcing the theory of an elevated societal position for women. This groundbreaking research, published in the journal Science, utilized advanced DNA extraction from inner ear bones, offering crucial insights into ancient social structures and highlighting a society that valued equality.</p>

          <p>The newly rebranded 'Prem' (formerly Premiership Rugby) season for 2025-26 will make history by beginning with a Thursday night fixture, as Sale Sharks host Gloucester on September 25. This marks a significant shift from the traditional weekend opener, aiming for a more informal, less corporate feel and to attract younger fans to the sport. Defending champions Bath will play Harlequins the following day, while runners-up Leicester Tigers face Bristol Bears on Sunday, September 28. The first of 18 rounds is strategically scheduled to avoid a clash with the Women's Rugby World Cup final at Twickenham, with the Prem final title decider set for June 21, 2026.</p>

Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta praised the club's "well-orchestrated plan" to secure Zubimendi, emphasizing his crucial role as a defensive midfielder. Zubimendi expressed excitement to learn from Arteta's meticulous approach, aiming to bring balance and provide a passing outlet to the team, despite increased competition in the squad.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a "massive" trade deal with Japan, establishing a 15% tariff on imported Japanese goods, a significant reduction from the previously threatened 25% rate. Trump claimed the agreement would create hundreds of thousands of jobs and involve Japan investing $550 billion in the U.S., with America receiving 90% of the profits. Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba confirmed the 15% auto tariff reduction, calling it beneficial for both sides. This deal is part of Trump's broader strategy to secure a "blitz" of trade agreements before higher tariffs kick in, aiming to revive U.S. manufacturing and correct perceived unfair trade practices and imbalances.

          <p>Singapore's headline inflation rate held steady at 0.8% in June, maintaining its lowest level in over four years and coming in below economists' expectations of 0.9%. Core inflation, which strips out prices of private transport and accommodation, also remained unchanged at 0.6%. This soft inflation figure clears the path for the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to potentially ease its monetary policy later in July, aiming to support economic growth amidst an uncertain global trade environment. The MAS projects full-year core inflation at 0.5%-1.5% and GDP growth between 0%-2%, indicating concerns about softening global consumption and investment, and the lagged impact of tariffs on its export-dependent economy.

Formerly Reed Elsevier, the company successfully transitioned from primarily print to electronic media, with print now accounting for only 4% of revenues.

          <p>Duck World, a unique chain of London stores selling rubber ducks, is defying the general decline in UK retail by staying afloat and expanding, with four prime locations in the city. Co-founder Irina Fedotova acknowledges challenges like sticky UK inflation, national wage increases, and business rate relief cuts, which have forced price raises. However, she attributes their success to the enduring appeal of rubber ducks to tourists, gift seekers, and collectors, particularly millennials, noting the "iconic" nature of the product. Retail analysts suggest high profit margins for collectibles. Despite facing issues like tariffs on Chinese-manufactured goods and skepticism about their legitimacy, Duck World remains optimistic, proving that even in a tough economic climate, "ducks persist."</p>

This decision, prompted by vulnerable island nations like Vanuatu facing existential threats from rising sea levels, will address what international law requires states to do to protect the climate and the legal consequences of inaction. While the ICJ's opinion will be non-binding, it is expected to serve as a crucial legal benchmark, potentially forming the basis for domestic lawsuits and international accountability.

          <p>Scientists analyzing a 13-million-year-old fossilized leg bone of a "terror bird" have discovered teeth marks suggesting it was killed by a much larger reptile. These fearsome avian predators, taller than humans with powerful legs and hooked beaks, were previously thought to be apex predators. However, 3D digital scans of the bite marks closely matched an extinct five-meter-long caiman species, Purussaurus neivensis, which likely ambushed its prey from the water's edge. This rare evidence, published in Biology Letters, provides unique insight into an ancient ecosystem, revealing that terror birds were more vulnerable to predators than previously believed, with the lack of healing indicating the bird likely died during the attack.</p>
