          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has created a high-resolution digital model of an early-stage human embryo, providing a powerful new tool for understanding organ formation. The research, published in the journal Cell, maps the intricate process where a single fertilized egg develops into hundreds of cell types. This digital embryo aims to decode the secrets of early life and identify why developmental defects occur. Researchers believe this breakthrough will be crucial for studying how abnormalities during this stage can lead to diseases later in life, advancing developmental biology.</p>

          <p>The British government has confirmed significant changes to its flagship welfare bill to avert a large-scale rebellion from its own Labour MPs. Under the new terms, current claimants of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and the health element of Universal Credit will not face cuts; only future claimants will be affected. This major concession follows pressure from over 100 backbenchers who threatened to vote against the legislation. While the move has been praised by rebel leaders as a protective measure for the vulnerable, it represents a significant U-turn for the government.</p>

          <p>At the World Economic Forum's "Summer Davos" in Tianjin, prominent economists argued that China must pivot its economy towards domestic consumption to achieve long-term prosperity. Professor Jin Keyu stated that China's heavy focus on subsidizing production is creating trade friction globally and is unsustainable. The experts called for structural reforms, suggesting that local governments should be incentivized to prioritize consumption growth as a measure of success. They emphasized that unless China becomes a major consumer country, it will struggle to harmonize its global trade relationships and reach its full economic potential. (not investment advice)</p>

The surge was driven by easing investor concerns over potential U.S. tariffs, following a White House announcement that President Trump might extend a 90-day pause on the duties. The market was also buoyed by gains in the U.S. tech sector, which boosted heavyweight semiconductor stocks, and by reduced geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers made a series of trades to move up in the second round of the NBA draft, ultimately acquiring 6-foot-6 wing Adou Thiero from Arkansas with the 36th pick. To secure the pick, the Lakers traded their 55th pick and cash to the Bulls for pick 45, then sent that pick and more cash to the Timberwolves. Thiero is described as a "super athletic wing" who can provide athleticism alongside Luka Donƒçiƒá, though he needs to improve his shooting. In other team news, guard Austin Reaves reportedly declined a four-year, $89 million maximum contract extension offer.</p>
