          <p>The United States has highlighted its freedom of navigation operations at the Paris Air Show, featuring the Poseidon P-8 maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft. Lieutenant Joseph Pitts, a US Navy mission commander, emphasized that ensuring freedom of navigation within international waters is central to the P-8's mission, particularly in areas like the Taiwan Strait. The P-8 is also used for anti-submarine and surface warfare missions, equipped with torpedoes, Harpoon anti-ship missiles, and sonobuoys. The deployment of the P-8 by US allies helps boost interoperability and optimize the aircraft's operation.</p>

          <p>Google is facing a setback as an advisor to the European Union's top court recommended dismissing the tech giant's appeal against a record 4.1-billion-euro antitrust fine.

          <p>Students should be prepared to encounter shocking and offensive views at university, according to Arif Ahmed from the Office for Students (OfS), which regulates universities. The OfS published guidance for universities in England on how a new law designed to protect free speech will work, placing a stronger responsibility on institutions to uphold freedom of speech and academic freedom. The guidance covers various aspects of university life, including protests, debates, training, and teaching, and clarifies that Holocaust denial is not protected speech. The guidelines aim to ensure that universities remain places where free speech is protected and promoted, with students expected to engage with diverse opinions respectfully.</p>

          <p>Samsung is set to unveil a thinner version of its flagship foldable smartphone to compete with Chinese rivals like Honor and Oppo, who have been releasing thinner and lighter devices. Slim foldables are increasingly important as consumers seek devices that offer the benefits of a folding phone without compromising on thickness and weight. While the market for foldables remains small, analysts suggest that thinner designs may attract more consumers, although the overall utility of folding devices remains a key challenge. Apple is also reportedly planning to enter the foldable market next year, intensifying competition.</p>

A decade ago, Mattel released Hello Barbie, an internet-connected doll that listened to kids and used AI to respond, but it was discontinued due to security vulnerabilities. While AI can be a powerful educational tool, there are concerns about children becoming overly reliant on technology and losing the ability to use their imaginations, as well as potential privacy and security risks.
