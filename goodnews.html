          <p>A federal judge in Oregon has issued a temporary restraining order, preventing the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard to Portland, stating the president's determination was "untethered to the facts." The judge, a Trump appointee, found no "colorable basis" to federalize the Guard, as demonstrations at the immigration facility were not significantly violent or disruptive. This landmark ruling highlights the complex intersection of federal-state relations, the role of the military in domestic law enforcement, and the balance of power among governmental branches. Oregon officials had strongly pushed back on the plans, asserting the state's capacity to manage public safety without federal interference and refuting the president's portrayal of the city.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), the largest US Lutheran denomination, has installed Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, marking a landmark moment for the predominantly white church. Curry, 53, succeeds Rev. Elizabeth Eaton, the ELCA's first female leader, and expressed hope that his presence would encourage more leaders of color. His six-year term begins with goals to foster a more connected and welcoming church, addressing challenges such as membership decline and ongoing theological discussions on LGBTQ+ inclusion. Curry's unique journey, from growing up Catholic in Chicago to becoming a social worker and teacher before his ordination, highlights the ELCA's efforts to grow diverse congregations within its established structures.</p>

          <p>Thousands of people participated in a banned Pride march in Pecs, Hungary, openly defying a police prohibition on LGBTQ+ rallies. Prime Minister Viktor Orban's ultra-conservative Fidesz party recently enacted a law permitting such bans, purportedly to "protect children," a move that Amnesty International has labeled "repressive legislation." Demonstrators, waving rainbow and EU flags, strongly condemned Orban's government, accusing it of authoritarian tendencies. Despite the risk of significant fines for attendees, the march drew an estimated 7,000 to 8,000 people, including several Members of the European Parliament, underscoring persistent resistance to the government's escalating restrictions on LGBTQ+ rights and fundamental human freedoms.</p>

          <p>Vilnius Airport in Lithuania temporarily closed its airspace in the early hours of Sunday, reportedly due to the sighting of multiple hot air balloons. The airport confirmed the closure, which diverted flights to other hubs like Riga and Kaunas, and advised passengers to check for updates. Lithuania's national broadcaster LRT indicated the decision was prompted by a "possible series of balloons heading toward Vilnius Airport." This unusual incident is the latest in a string of recent European airport closures, including one in Munich, Germany, over drone sightings, highlighting persistent challenges in maintaining airspace security against unexpected aerial phenomena.</p>

Neuheisel, elevated just four days before the game, devised an offensive plan that produced points on UCLA's first five drives, while Iamaleava accounted for five touchdowns, including three rushing and two passing. This unexpected upset, celebrated by an ecstatic home crowd, provided a significant morale boost for a team that had been nationally lampooned for its poor start. Despite a tense finish requiring a crucial defensive stop, the Bruins secured the win, offering a potential turning point in what had been a lost season.</p>

          <h2>Understanding "Freshers' Flu" and Why University Students Are Prone to Illness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 19:05:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>"Freshers' flu" is a widespread phenomenon among new university students, characterized by a rapid spread of common cold viruses within campus communities. Immunologists explain that students arriving from diverse locations introduce a "mixing pot" of infections, which, when combined with close living quarters, crowded lectures, and shared amenities, facilitates quick transmission. The article highlights that contributing factors like academic stress, an often-poor diet, insufficient sleep, and alcohol consumption significantly weaken the immune system, rendering students more vulnerable to illness. Although typically not serious, the initial exposure to many novel viruses can lead to persistent symptoms, underscoring the importance of adequate rest and self-care during this demanding transitional phase.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated Israel is "on the verge of a very great achievement" and hopes to announce the return of all hostages "in the coming days." He indicated that in the first phase of the US-backed peace proposal, Hamas would release all hostages, while IDF forces would redeploy but maintain control deep within Gaza. President Donald Trump issued a warning to Hamas to "move quickly, or else all bets will be off," as his special envoy and Jared Kushner head to Egypt for negotiations. The halt in IDF offensive activity is intended to allow Hamas to organize hostage releases, though Israel maintains it's not an official ceasefire or withdrawal.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, halting a Trump administration initiative that would have kept immigrant children in custody after their 18th birthdays and transferred them to adult detention centers. U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that automatically detaining these individuals violates an earlier 2021 court order, which explicitly prohibited such actions and mandated release to the "least restrictive setting available." This decision adds to a growing list of federal clashes over Trump’s controversial immigration policies, which also include accusations of reviving family separations and a plan to offer immigrant children $2,500 to self-deport, raising significant concerns among advocates about the welfare and legal claims of minors.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, 64, has been elected leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on its 70th anniversary, putting her on course to become the country's first female prime minister. Known as a staunch conservative and a protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, Takaichi has held senior government roles, including minister for economic security, and aims to revive Abe's "Abenomics" economic vision. Her political inspiration stemmed from observing US-Japan trade friction in the 1980s, leading her to believe Japan needed to defend itself. Takaichi now faces the challenge of leading a party struggling with voter trust and a rising far-right, while also addressing societal issues like women's health and care for the aging population.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv's Hostage Square to celebrate the potential Gaza ceasefire deal, expressing cautious hope for the return of hostages and an end to the prolonged conflict. Many protesters credited former US President Donald Trump for his role in brokering the agreement, with some openly criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for allegedly extending the war for political gain. The US-backed plan outlines Hamas releasing all remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian detainees and a phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Despite Netanyahu's public statements suggesting Israel is "on the verge of a great achievement," protesters remain wary of potential sabotage, emphasizing their profound desire for normalcy and the safe return of their loved ones.</p>

          <p>Scottish Premiership leaders Hearts have ignited title aspirations among their fans after securing a 91st-minute Edinburgh derby winner, extending their lead to five points. Head coach Derek McInnes, while professionally cautious about title talk, acknowledged the fans' right to excitement following the team's stunning unbeaten start. The early-season optimism in Gorgie is significantly bolstered by a £10m investment from Tony Bloom, the Brighton owner, who boldly claimed Hearts are in a position to challenge for second this season. With rivals Rangers in turmoil and reigning champions Celtic yet to hit top gear, many now consider this ambitious assessment increasingly realistic, despite the historical challenges of maintaining such form in the league.</p>

          <p>Turkey faces pressure from the US and G7 nations to reduce its significant reliance on Russian oil and gas, with over 66% of its oil imports and 41% of natural gas imports coming from Russia last year. While President Trump explicitly demanded Turkey stop these purchases, Turkey has not yet responded, benefiting from lower Russian energy prices post-Ukraine invasion. Instead of outright cessation, Turkey is quietly pursuing a diversification strategy, signing long-term LNG contracts with US and Australian firms. This strategic shift aims to enhance energy security and improve relations with the US, even as Turkey continues its complex energy balancing act, including Russian assistance for its first nuclear power plant.</p>

          <p>Piano sales have plummeted significantly since 1925, reflecting a cultural shift away from traditional home instruments, yet the article highlights a new generation embracing the instrument through digital pianos. A piano technician notes that various factors, including economic challenges like millennials struggling with homeownership, contribute to the decline in acoustic piano purchases. However, digital pianos offer a more affordable, smaller, and acoustically accurate alternative, making the instrument accessible to new learners and addressing issues older acoustic pianos might pose. Experts express optimism for a resurgence in piano playing, believing that as people grow weary of screens, they will increasingly seek the musicality and emotional expression offered by instruments, regardless of their format.</p>
