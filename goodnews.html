          <p>Kyoto experienced a record high of 10.88 million foreign visitors in 2024, with a total of 56.06 million visitors overall, but satisfaction levels among tourists remained high despite overtourism issues. According to a tourism survey by the Kyoto city government, 97.2% of foreign respondents and 94.6% of Japanese respondents were at least fairly satisfied with their visit. Temples, shrines, and historic sites were popular among foreign visitors, while Japanese visitors were more likely to express disappointment due to crowds and public transportation issues. Kyoto is implementing a lodging tax increase in 2026 to address overtourism, with revenue directed towards strengthening related measures.</p>

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is gaining renewed attention as Japan faces the potential absence of giant pandas for the first time in over half a century, against the backdrop of increasing Sino-U.S. rivalry. Decisions regarding panda loans are typically revealed during high-level bilateral talks, and a new loan to Japan may be announced during a possible visit by a Chinese political leader later this year. The panda has long been a symbol of friendship between the two countries, but some analysts believe that a new panda loan will not have a tangible impact on the Japanese government's diplomatic posture toward China.</p>

          <p>As the use of artificial intelligence increases, so do instances of potentially harmful responses, including hate speech, copyright infringements, and sexual content. Researchers emphasize the need for more regulations and thorough testing of AI models, with red teaming being a valuable method for uncovering potential harm. They advocate for opening testing to third parties, such as normal users, journalists, and ethical hackers, and adopting standardized 'AI flaw' reports to disseminate information on these flaws, similar to practices in software security.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Shares Phrases to Avoid and What to Say Instead</h2>

          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that parents who have an easy time getting their children to listen avoid threats, bribes, and harsh consequences. Instead, they use language that makes children want to cooperate, as traditional parenting phrases can trigger a child's fight-or-flight response. The expert recommends reframing common phrases to honor a child's autonomy while still holding boundaries, creating conditions where cooperation feels natural and fostering emotional safety and involvement.</p>

          <p>Prescriptions for Mounjaro, a weight loss jab, will be available at GP surgeries in England under strict criteria, initially targeting those most in need. NHS England is implementing a staggered approach to manage GP workload and NHS resources, with some practices warning patients who do not meet the criteria not to book appointments. Mounjaro, or tirzepatide, was initially licensed for type 2 diabetes but is now also prescribed for obesity, and patients will receive "wrap-around" care including support with exercise and diet. Pharmacy trade organizations are concerned that demand for Mounjaro from GPs will outstrip supply.</p>

          <p>China has become the world's leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold last year being electric, driven by government planning, funding, and a competitive landscape. The country's leadership laid out plans to dominate the technologies of the future, and Chinese EV makers like BYD are now leading the global market, aided by a vast domestic market and a focus on affordable EVs for the mass market. China has also dominated critical supply chains in battery production and built the world's largest public charging network, with the government providing subsidies and incentives to consumers and carmakers.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist hopes to set up a clinic by the end of the year offering ketamine as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for treatment-resistant depression. This move comes after a private clinic in Lanarkshire began offering ketamine assisted therapy, which combines ketamine infusions with psychotherapy, for treatment-resistant depression. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors and psychiatrists, with proponents believing it can make patients more receptive to psychotherapy and improve outcomes.</p>
