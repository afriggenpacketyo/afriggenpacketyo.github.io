          <p>This article presents a digest of news summaries from Kyodo News. Key highlights include Japan and South Korea agreeing to boost ties in their first in-person meeting, the G7 launching an action plan to de-risk critical mineral supply chains from China, and the Japanese lower house removing a panel chief for the first time in the postwar era. Additionally, foreign visitors to Japan hit a record 3.7 million in May, China responded to G7 allegations of market-distorting practices, and Japan enacted tougher rules to block access to online casinos. Three more bullet trains reported issues after a service halt in eastern Japan, and Shohei Ohtani's pitching return set an MLB streaming record.</p>

          <p>Mortgage applications to purchase homes decreased by 3% last week, despite interest rates falling to their lowest level since April, signaling weak consumer sentiment in the housing market. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages decreased to 6.84%, but economic uncertainty weighed on potential homebuyers' decisions. Refinance applications also fell by 2%, although they remain higher than the same week last year. The overall average loan size was the lowest since January 2025, and analysts predict a potential market reaction following the Federal Reserve's announcement on interest rates. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 50+1 rule in German football ensures that club members retain control over professional football clubs, preventing external investors from taking complete control. The rule, in place since 1999, stipulates that the parent club must hold at least 50 percent plus one vote in its spun-off professional football company. This rule aims to protect fan culture and ensure a level of equality, but critics argue it puts German clubs at a financial disadvantage compared to other countries. Exceptions exist for investors with 20 years of investment, and some clubs, like RB Leipzig, are criticized for circumventing the rule. </p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claims that Meta is aggressively trying to recruit his staff by offering "giant offers," including signing bonuses exceeding $100 million. Altman respects Meta's competitive approach but believes people are staying at OpenAI due to its mission of creating superintelligence and the resulting economic rewards. He considers OpenAI to have a better chance of delivering on superintelligence and becoming a more valuable company. Despite acknowledging Meta's rational pursuit of superintelligence, he expressed skepticism about their innovation capabilities.</p>

          <p>After a year of psychological warfare along the inter-Korean border, South Korea's new president, Lee Jae Myung, ordered a stop to propaganda broadcasts, leading North Korea to reciprocate. For a year villagers of Dangsan-ri and other border towns had to live with unnerving noises day and night. Lee's decision, aimed at easing military tensions and restoring trust, marks a shift from his predecessor's approach. The loudspeaker broadcasts, a form of psychological warfare, had escalated under the previous administration, causing stress and sleep deprivation for residents near the border.</p>

Los Angeles County election officials assert that these claims are false and unsubstantiated, emphasizing the safeguards in place to ensure only eligible voters cast ballots. To register to vote in California, individuals must be U.S. citizens, residents of California, and meet other eligibility requirements. The article outlines the voter registration process, verification methods, and the legal consequences of noncitizen voting, debunking the origins of the false claims and highlighting the researchers who have found that fraud conducted by voters at the polls is virtually nonexistent. </p>

The new film introduces "Slow-Lows" and "Alphas" as new additions to the zombie mythos. A new trilogy of films is being planned.</p>

          <p>The landscape surrounding the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art in Los Angeles, designed by Mia Lehrer and Studio-MLA, is intended to tell a story that complements the museum's focus on visual storytelling. The design draws inspiration from myths, movies, and the diverse terrain of California, creating a series of vignettes with varied textures, colors, and scales. The landscape includes a sinuous meadow, a hilly canyon, and an alpine-inspired roof garden. Plantings were selected to bloom in different seasons, creating a changing experience throughout the year.</p>
