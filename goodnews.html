          <p>Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson is poised for his first senior England national team call-up for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers. The 22-year-old is expected to replace the injured Jude Bellingham in the squad, which manager Thomas Tuchel will announce shortly. Anderson's inclusion comes after a series of impressive performances for his club since transferring from Newcastle. Meanwhile, Manchester City's Jack Grealish, currently on loan at Everton, is also back on England's radar after assistant manager Anthony Barry was sent to observe his recent standout performance.</p>

          <p>Four-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome is reportedly in good spirits and recovering after undergoing successful surgery for multiple serious injuries. The 40-year-old cyclist was involved in a severe training crash in France, resulting in five broken ribs, a collapsed lung, and a fractured lumbar vertebra. His team, Israel-Premier Tech, confirmed the procedures went as planned and that he is recuperating under medical care. This incident marks another significant setback for Froome, who suffered a similar near-career-ending crash in 2019, and he is now expected to miss the rest of the season.</p>

          <p>China's top economic planning agency is promoting a measured approach to its "AI Plus" initiative, which aims to integrate artificial intelligence across various industries. Officials from the National Development and Reform Commission urged regions to avoid "disorderly competition and blind expansion" by tailoring their AI development to local strengths and resources. To support this strategic growth, the government will continue issuing AI vouchers to subsidize computing power for companies and will pilot consumer subsidies for AI-powered products. This policy is part of China's broader goal of achieving technological self-reliance and bolstering its position as an innovation powerhouse.</p>

          <p>A legislative effort to prohibit members of Congress and their households from trading individual stocks is gaining rare bipartisan support, with backers including President Donald Trump and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Proponents argue the ban is essential for rooting out potential corruption and restoring public trust in government, as polls show over 80% of Americans favor such a measure. The bill aims to address concerns that lawmakers may use non-public information to achieve unusually high investment returns, which undermines the integrity of both financial markets and public service.

          <p>The 2025 NFL season presents opportunities for several long-standing records to be broken across the league. Jacksonville Jaguars kicker Cam Little could surpass the record for the longest field goal, having already hit a 70-yarder in preseason. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is on track to become the fastest player to reach 250 career passing touchdowns, likely achieving the feat within the first two weeks. Other potential records include Cincinnati's Joe Burrow challenging for the most 500-yard passing games and new kickoff rules potentially enabling a returner like Green Bay's Keisean Nixon to threaten Devin Hester's return touchdown record.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) will begin offering a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland starting next January. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab. Until now, parents had to pay privately for the vaccination, which can cost up to £200. Health officials hope the program will protect children from rare but severe complications of the illness and reduce the economic impact caused by parents taking time off work to care for sick children.</p>

          <p>YouTube and Fox have successfully negotiated a new distribution agreement, ensuring that Fox channels like Fox News and Fox Sports will remain available on the YouTube TV streaming platform. The deal was reached after a short-term extension prevented a potential blackout that could have affected nearly 10 million subscribers. The dispute arose when YouTube claimed Fox was demanding significantly higher fees than comparable partners. The resolution means viewers will not miss out on major sporting events, including highly anticipated college football games and the upcoming NFL season.</p>

The 24-year-old acknowledged that top players often dictate the pace and that the experience was a valuable lesson in his professional career. While showing flashes of his talent, Fearnley struggled with his serve, hitting 12 double faults in the loss against the more consistent German player.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have successfully tested a new vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) drone that bears a striking resemblance to the "Gimbal" UFO filmed by U.S. Navy pilots in 2015. The experimental aircraft features a unique closed-loop airframe, with an elliptical, ring-like wing integrated with a central wing section, giving it a spindle-like appearance. This innovative aerodynamic design, which differs radically from conventional drones, could potentially offer improved endurance, stability, and versatility for uncrewed flight. The development represents a significant step forward in advanced aerospace technology.</p>
