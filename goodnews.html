          <p>A federal judge in California has ruled that the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard and U.S. Marine troops to Los Angeles during immigration enforcement protests violated the Posse Comitatus Act. This 1878 law prohibits using the military for domestic law enforcement purposes. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer issued an injunction, specific to California, preventing troops from engaging in activities like arrests, searches, and crowd control. The ruling marks a significant legal check on the executive branch's authority, though the judge has temporarily stayed the decision to allow for a potential appeal by the administration.</p>

Her daughter, Alissa Quart, initiated a project to find new homes for her mother's hundreds of paintings, selling some and gifting others to friends and strangers. The effort has brought joy to Barbara, who is happy that her art, created to capture moments of beauty, is now resonating with others. This initiative has not only preserved her artistic legacy but also deepened the connection between mother and daughter during a challenging time.</p>

          <h2>Home Depot's Acquisition Strategy Focuses on Trade Credit to Attract Professional Contractors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 13:23:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Depot is significantly expanding its business with professional contractors through strategic acquisitions, most notably the $18 billion purchase of SRS Distribution. A key element of this strategy is the expansion of its trade credit program, which allows contractors to buy supplies and pay for them later, effectively making Home Depot a financier for their projects. The company has seen a double-digit spending increase from pros who use these accounts and plans to integrate the credit system into its physical stores. This push into the "complex pro" market is seen as a major growth driver, distinguishing it from the more stagnant DIY consumer segment. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts suggest that new tax legislation from the Trump administration could create a "golden opportunity" for more investors to qualify for the 0% long-term capital gains tax rate. This bracket allows individuals to sell profitable assets without paying taxes if their taxable income is below certain thresholds, which are set at $48,350 for single filers and $96,700 for married couples in 2025. The strategy, known as "tax-gain harvesting," can be particularly useful during lower-income years for rebalancing portfolios or resetting an asset's cost basis for future tax savings. Higher standard deductions and other new tax breaks may make this accessible to a wider range of people. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>To combat financial pressures and avoid closures or acquisitions by larger health systems, independent rural hospitals across the U.S. are forming "clinically integrated networks." These collaborations allow them to pool resources, share specialists, and collectively negotiate better prices for services like mobile MRI units and employee health insurance. By combining their patient populations, these hospitals can also participate in value-based care contracts that reward quality of care. This model offers a path for small, vital hospitals to maintain local autonomy while improving services and ensuring their long-term viability in underserved communities.</p>

These include being at least 62 years old, using the property as a primary residence, and having sufficient home equity. Lenders also conduct a financial assessment to ensure borrowers can cover ongoing costs like property taxes and insurance, and mandatory counseling is required to explain the loan's implications.
