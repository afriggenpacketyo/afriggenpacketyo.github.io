          <h2>Ancient Chinese Star Catalogue May Be Oldest in the World</h2>

          <p>Two Chinese scientists propose that "Shi's Star Catalogue," an astronomical list of celestial bodies, is the world's oldest star log, dating back approximately 2,400 years. Published in the journal Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics, the study cites new evidence suggesting the catalogue was created around 335BC, predating the Hipparchus star catalogue from Greece. The researchers used image processing technology to convert ancient records into measurable celestial coordinates, confirming observation years in the catalogue's main content, followed by revisions around AD125. This research suggests that detailed astronomical studies began in China and Greece around the same time, challenging the previously held belief that the Greek catalogue was the oldest.</p>

          <p>The finance ministers and central bank governors of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, along with Japan, China, and South Korea, have cautioned about the potential global economic fallout from protectionist trade policies following the U.S.'s increased import tariffs. In a statement, they highlighted that escalating trade protectionism could fragment global trade, impacting trade, investment, and capital flows across the region. This warning was issued during a meeting held on the sidelines of the Asian Development Bank's annual meeting in Milan, Italy, reflecting concerns over the broader economic implications of recent trade measures.</p>

          <h2>Roses Were Likely Originally Yellow, Study Suggests</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new genomic study by Chinese and Dutch researchers indicates that the first roses were likely yellow, contrary to the popular association of roses with red. The study, published in Nature Plants, analyzed domesticated and wild rose samples, revealing that their common ancestor probably had single-petal flowers with a yellow color and seven leaflets. Roses are among the most extensively cultivated ornamental flowers, known for their variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, but the ancestral traits suggest a different origin than the multilayered, pink and red roses commonly seen today.</p>

          <p>Eric Schmidt and Selina Xu argue that China is rapidly catching up to the United States in various technologies, especially in artificial intelligence, and has developed a real edge in commercializing and manufacturing tech. They note that Chinese AI models are nearly on par with U.S. versions, with some even surpassing them in certain benchmarks. They suggest the U.S. needs to openly share more of its AI technologies, innovate faster, and double down on diffusing AI throughout the economy to maintain its competitive edge. This perspective challenges the belief that America is always ahead and calls for a strategic response to China's growing technological prowess.</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking fell to fourth among OECD members in 2024, with Britain reclaiming third place, according to preliminary data. The United States remained the top donor, followed by Germany. Japan's decline was primarily attributed to the yen's depreciation and a contrast to sharp increases in 2022 and 2023 when many development projects resumed after COVID-19 suspensions. Despite the decline, Japan views ODA as a crucial diplomatic tool in pursuing a "free and open" Indo-Pacific amid China's growing influence. Overall ODA by Development Assistance Committee members also fell due to reduced contributions to international organizations and decreased aid for Ukraine.</p>
