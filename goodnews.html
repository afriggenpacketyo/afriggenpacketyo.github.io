        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>French actor G√©rard Depardieu was found guilty of sexual assault in a French court, stemming from incidents on a film set in 2021 involving two women. The court stated that both women provided consistent and credible accounts of the assaults, with witness testimony supporting their claims. Depardieu received an 18-month suspended prison term and was ordered to pay damages to the victims. His lawyer has indicated that he will appeal the verdict, which is considered a significant moment for France's #MeToo movement and the broader conversation around defining assault within the film industry. The case had been delayed multiple times due to scheduling and medical reasons before the trial commenced in March 2025.</p>

This visit aims to strengthen trade, cultural, and defense ties between the two nations, following King Charles' visit to France in September 2023, which sought to rebuild relations post-Brexit. The visit also comes amid uncertainties regarding negotiations over Ukraine and potential tariffs from the United States.

          <p>The Trump administration is considering implementing significant cuts to prescription drug prices in the United States, potentially aligning them with prices in other developed countries. This initiative aims to lower medication costs for Medicare, Medicaid, and treatments covered by private health insurance, and could include popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic. The proposal directs the US health secretary to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical companies, potentially enforcing a "most favored nation" pricing model. The pharmaceutical industry is expected to strongly resist these measures, warning of potential impacts on research and development investments. </p>

          <p>The Wall Street Journal's editorial board has criticized President Trump's trade policies, describing his retreat from mega-tariffs on China as "more surrender than Trump victory." The newspaper argued that Trump's approach has damaged America's credibility and undermined efforts to rally international support against Beijing's mercantilism. The editorial board suggested that markets forced Trump to abandon his belief that high tariff walls would usher in a new "golden age," which the Journal characterized as "more leaden than golden."</p>
