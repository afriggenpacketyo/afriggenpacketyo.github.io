          <p>Thailand's Supreme Court is set to deliver its verdict regarding the prison term of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who returned to Bangkok after a period of exile. Thaksin, a prominent figure in Thai politics, faces scrutiny over whether he properly served his sentence, which was initially commuted by the king and later saw him released on parole. The court's decision comes amid ongoing political tensions and concerns about the influence of the Shinawatra family, whose popularity has waned with the rise of other political movements. Supporters of Thaksin gathered outside the Supreme Court, awaiting the ruling amidst tight security measures. The verdict will have implications for Thai politics and the legacy of the Shinawatra dynasty. </p>

          <p>Boeing aircraft have become a recurring symbol in trade deals negotiated by President Trump, with countries often announcing large orders for Boeing jets after striking agreements with the US. These deals serve as visible statements of trade, demonstrate commitment to reducing trade surpluses, and avoid ruffling feathers in domestic industries. Aircraft orders also offer the advantage of spanning years due to Boeing's significant production backlog. Despite safety concerns, Boeing remains an iconic American company and a key player in international trade. </p>

Analysts predict near-term volatility but anticipate long-term policy stability and a pro-growth environment for the equities market.

          <p>The article reflects on a Chinese film depicting the Nanking massacre in 1937 and the author's experience watching it in a Chinese theatre. The film tells the story of civilians taking refuge in a photo studio and risking their lives to smuggle out evidence of Japanese atrocities. The author notes the emotional impact of the film on the audience and contrasts it with the perceived lack of recognition of Chinese war pain in the West. The author hopes to bring awareness to the importance of acknowledging and understanding different cultural perspectives on historical events. </p>

          <p>A port operator in northeastern China is constructing a transit center to handle seaborne imports of durians, complementing a new "durian express" shipping service. The service aims to reduce shipment times to as little as six days, handling approximately 10,000 TEUs of durians annually. Northeastern China's population of roughly 100 million wants more durians, but shipments from major sources such as Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam take a relatively long time to reach Dalian, threatening the freshness of deliveries. This initiative seeks to improve logistics and freshness for durian deliveries to the region. </p>

The bill seeks to prevent buyers from being misled about the origin of their puppies and ensure transparency in pet sales. It builds on a 2019 law that banned pet stores from selling commercially bred dogs, addressing the growing online pet sales market. The bill now heads to Governor Newsom for consideration. </p>
