          <p>Jim Lovell, the esteemed commander of the Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97, leaving behind a legacy of courage and innovation in space exploration. Lovell was a pivotal figure, renowned for his leadership during the 1970 Apollo 13 mission, which, despite an oxygen tank explosion thousands of miles from Earth, was famously dubbed a "successful failure" due to his and his crew's safe return. He also played a crucial role as the command module pilot for the 1968 Apollo 8 mission, the first to carry humans to the moon and back. NASA and his family praised his unwavering integrity, calm strength under pressure, and profound ability to inspire millions through his remarkable contributions to human spaceflight.</p>

          <p>Firefighters successfully extinguished a significant blaze that erupted at the historic mosque-turned-cathedral in Cordoba, Spain, averting what the city's mayor called a "catastrophe." The fire, which originated in one of the chapels within the monument's Almanzor naves, is suspected to have been caused by a short circuit in an electric sweeper. The swift and effective intervention by three fire teams ensured the flames were brought under control within a short period. This UNESCO World Heritage Site, celebrated as a jewel of Islamic architecture and later adapted into a cathedral, is a major tourist attraction, and the incident highlighted the vulnerability of cultural heritage sites, drawing parallels to the 2019 Notre Dame fire.</p>

The narrative follows four artists in Los Angeles who encounter a fictional application promising assistance in their careers, drawing direct inspiration from the increasing prevalence of AI tools like ChatGPT. Director Durán highlights that while AI can be a creative aid, it fundamentally cannot replicate the human essence, emotional depth, and unique connection crucial to the experience of live theater, emphasizing the enduring value of human artistry.</p>

          <p>Walmart has agreed to a significant $5.6 million settlement in a lawsuit alleging the retail giant systematically overcharged California customers by selling products at prices higher than advertised. The legal action, initiated by district attorney offices from Santa Clara, San Diego, San Bernardino, and Sonoma counties, also contended that some items, particularly baked goods, produce, and other prepared foods, were sold with weights less than what their labels described, thereby violating California's False Advertising and Unfair Competition laws. As part of the resolution, Walmart will pay $5.5 million in civil penalties and has committed to implementing measures to ensure employees accurately weigh and price products across all its California stores, aiming to rebuild consumer confidence and adhere strictly to state regulations.</p>

          <p>The iconic Ford Transit van is celebrating its 60th anniversary, marking six decades since its revolutionary debut in 1965. Upon its release, it was lauded for its spaciousness, power, and practical design, quickly becoming an indispensable tool for tradespeople and a popular choice for aspiring rock bands seeking affordable transport. Famously, in 1972, a Metropolitan Police spokesman even dubbed it "Britain's most wanted van" due to its unexpected appeal as a getaway vehicle for bank robbers. Despite numerous redesigns and shifts in production, the Transit remains the world's best-selling van, with over 13 million units built. Ford continues to highlight its strong UK heritage in engineering and manufacturing, as the brand looks towards an uncertain future with electric vehicles and software-defined technologies.</p>

          <p>Four International Space Station (ISS) crew members, including commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi, and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov, have successfully undocked from the orbital complex. They are now on course for a Saturday splashdown off the Southern California coast, concluding their 148-day mission. McClain expressed profound gratitude for the privilege of living and working aboard the ISS, highlighting the mission as a powerful reminder of what humanity can achieve through international cooperation, especially during global challenges. This Crew 10 flight marks a significant milestone as the first NASA-sponsored crew to land in the Pacific Ocean, a new operational protocol implemented by SpaceX to ensure any discarded capsule sections splash down safely away from populated areas.</p>

          <p>An unexpected friendship has developed between US Vice President JD Vance and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, bridging their distinct political ideologies and personal backgrounds. Vance is currently spending his UK holiday at Chevening House, Lammy's grace-and-favour country home, where they have engaged in activities such as fishing. Despite their past critical remarks about Donald Trump, both men have since revised their opinions and found common ground, bonding over shared experiences of challenging childhoods and their Christian faith. This personal connection is considered particularly significant in the current political climate, especially under the Trump administration, which often personalizes international relations, potentially influencing future diplomatic ties between the United States and the United Kingdom.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral social media claim, made by a self-proclaimed retired pilot, alleging that Donald Trump's plane flew to Jeffrey Epstein's island at least 37 times, has been thoroughly debunked. Fact-checkers found no credible evidence to support this assertion, pointing out that Epstein's Little St. James island notably lacks an airstrip, meaning visitors would arrive by boat or helicopter from nearby St. Thomas, not by plane landing directly. Furthermore, the individual's claimed pilot credentials were questionable, with his uniform pin appearing identical to a costume prop. Trump has consistently denied ever visiting Epstein's island. The article underscores the prevalence of online misinformation, particularly concerning politically charged topics, and emphasizes the critical importance of verifying claims with reputable sources.</p>

          <p>English golfer Tommy Fleetwood has opened up a commanding four-shot lead at the St Jude Championship in Memphis, delivering an impressive six-under 64 in the second round before play was suspended due to severe weather. Building on his strong opening round of 63, Fleetwood's performance, highlighted by seven birdies and only one bogey on the 18th, puts him in a formidable position to secure his first ever PGA Tour victory. Two-time major champion Collin Morikawa and fellow American Akshay Bhatia are currently tied for second at nine under, with 21 players still needing to complete their rounds due to the lightning delay. The interruption adds an element of anticipation to the FedExCup play-offs' inaugural event.</p>

          <p>Seoul has launched innovative "warm-hearted convenience stores" as a direct response to the city's growing challenges of loneliness and social isolation, particularly affecting young people and the elderly. These unique, cafe-like spaces provide free instant ramen noodles, communal activities such as movie days, and access to dedicated social workers and counselors. The initiative was spurred by a notable increase in single-person households and a rise in "lonely deaths" among older residents, aiming to offer a stigma-free environment for connection and support. The stores facilitate low-level bonding and provide practical assistance, like air-conditioning during hot months for low-income residents, representing a proactive societal effort to address mental health and foster community well-being in a rapidly evolving urban landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Commerce Department has commenced issuing licenses to Nvidia, permitting the export of its H20 chips to China, effectively reversing a previous ban on these specific semiconductors. This decision removes a significant hurdle for the prominent AI chipmaker in accessing a crucial market, although Nvidia had previously cautioned that the initial restrictions would lead to an $8 billion reduction in its sales. The H20 chip was specifically engineered by Nvidia to comply with the Biden-era AI chip export controls. While exports of Nvidia's other advanced AI chips to China remain restricted, this licensing action suggests a more nuanced approach to U.S.-China technology trade, especially following a recent meeting between Nvidia's CEO and President Trump.

          <p>Armenia's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev have signed a historic peace deal at the White House, brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump, aiming to end nearly four decades of conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. Both leaders lauded Trump for his instrumental role in achieving this breakthrough, declaring the agreement opens a "chapter of peace" and expressing their intention to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize. A central component of the deal is the establishment of a trade and transit corridor through the South Caucasus, which will be named after Trump, with the United States gaining exclusive development rights. This accord also signals a significant geopolitical shift, indicating a weakening of Russia's long-standing influence in the South Caucasus region.</p>
