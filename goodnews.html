          <p>Aston Villa's manager, Unai Emery, has publicly backed striker Ollie Watkins to overcome his current 10-game goal drought for both his club and the England national team. Despite Watkins missing a penalty in a recent Europa League match, Emery praised the player's work ethic, pressing, and overall contribution to the team's performance. The manager emphasized that Watkins' effort and tasks for the team are the most important factors and that the goals will eventually follow. Watkins has struggled for form recently, missing all five of his big chances this season.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order approving a deal to allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States under a new corporate structure. The agreement creates a U.S.-based joint venture with a majority of American investors, including Oracle, to address national security concerns about its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. Under the deal, ByteDance's ownership will be less than 20%, and U.S. user data will be hosted by Oracle, which will also review the app's code. The order declares this a "qualified divestiture" under a law passed by Congress, pushing back enforcement to allow the final details to be arranged.</p>

After moving to LIV Golf, DeChambeau knew qualifying would be difficult and ultimately was not selected as a captain's pick last year. However, his strong performances in major tournaments since then, including a U.S. Open win, secured his automatic qualification for the event at Bethpage Black. DeChambeau described making the team as his primary mission and praised the current team's unity.</p>

Officials stated that a major fiber cut caused the outage and there was no indication of malicious activity.

The agreement establishes a new U.S.-based company, valued at $14 billion, with American investors like Oracle holding a majority stake and control over the board, while parent company ByteDance's ownership will be under 20%. The deal addresses national security concerns by having Oracle store U.S. user data and oversee a new algorithm retrained on that data. This structure was designed to satisfy a 2024 law requiring ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations or face a shutdown.</p>

This pull-ahead purchasing behavior has benefited automakers like General Motors and Toyota so far this year.
