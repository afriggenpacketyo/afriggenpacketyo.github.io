          <p>A United Nations agency, Unesco, hosted a global forum in Bangkok to advocate for its ethical guidelines on artificial intelligence, urging international collaboration among governments and civil society.

          <p>During the World Economic Forum event in Tianjin, prominent economists argued that for China to achieve long-term prosperity, it must pivot from a production-focused to a consumption-driven economy through structural reforms. Professor Jin Keyu noted that China's current model, which heavily subsidizes production, creates trade imbalances and global friction. She suggested that boosting internal consumption, particularly in the services sector and smaller cities, is crucial for harmonizing its international trade relationships. The experts recommended that local governments should be evaluated on consumption metrics to incentivize this necessary economic shift. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A pilot project in Chelsea, Massachusetts, is demonstrating effective strategies for combating the Urban Heat Island effect, where dense urban areas become significantly hotter than surrounding greener spaces. The "cool block" initiative, led by the environmental group GreenRoots, has implemented solutions like planting over 100 trees, resurfacing streets with lighter colors, and painting rooftops white to reflect heat. This urban laboratory provides a tangible template for other cities as they grapple with rising temperatures due to climate change. Research shows such interventions can reduce peak urban temperatures by several degrees, potentially saving lives during heat waves.</p>
