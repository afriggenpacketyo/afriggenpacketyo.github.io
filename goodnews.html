          <p>Four members of Japan's Ground Self-Defense Force sustained minor injuries in an explosion while handling an unexploded bomb near the U.S. military's Kadena Air Base in Okinawa. The incident occurred at a GSDF storage facility where the soldiers, belonging to an explosive ordnance disposal unit, were preparing to dispose of a bomb left over from World War II. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi emphasized the importance of continuing disposal efforts due to the numerous unexploded bombs still buried in Okinawa. The Self-Defense Forces conducted over 1,800 disposal operations nationwide in fiscal year 2023, with a significant portion occurring in Okinawa, which hosts the majority of U.S. military facilities in Japan.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery plans to divide into two publicly traded companies, separating its cable networks (including CNN and TNT Sports) from its streaming and studios business (including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television). CEO David Zaslav will lead the Streaming & Studios division, while CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels will head Global Networks. This split, expected by mid-2026, reverses much of the 2022 merger that created Warner Bros. Discovery, as cable networks face declining viewership due to the shift to streaming services. The company believes this restructuring will allow each entity to pursue growth opportunities and enhance shareholder value.</p>
