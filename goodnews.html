          <p>A federal judge has ordered the immediate release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts doctoral candidate, from immigration custody. Ozturk, a Turkish national, was detained after the Trump administration revoked her student visa following an opinion piece she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. Judge Sessions stated that Ozturk's detention raised substantial claims of constitutional violations, as the government presented no evidence other than the op-ed to justify her detainment. The judge emphasized that her continued detention could potentially chill the speech of millions of non-citizens, and Tufts University expressed its pleasure in welcoming her back to campus.</p>

          <p>South Africa has criticized the U.S. over reports that Washington may accept white Afrikaners as refugees, calling the move politically motivated. The U.S. State Department stated it is interviewing individuals interested in resettling in the U.S., prioritizing Afrikaners who are victims of unjust racial discrimination. South African authorities said they would not block departures but seek assurances those selected have been vetted and do not have pending criminal charges. The South African government also disputes allegations of discrimination against its white minority.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) reported better-than-expected April sales, suggesting the AI infrastructure ramp remains in full swing. As Nvidia's primary chip supplier, TSMC's strong results are generally seen as a positive indicator for Nvidia. Nvidia is planning to release a downgraded version of its H20 AI chips for China to comply with U.S. export restrictions. The report remains unclear how these dumb-downed chips for China stack up against local competition from Huawei, but our inclination is to say that customers will always take as many Nvidia chips as they can get.</p>
