          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 22:33:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid slim party margins, the possibility of a tie vote in the U.S. House of Representatives has become more relevant, as seen during a February 2024 vote on impeaching a cabinet secretary. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House has no such mechanism. According to established House rules, any measure that results in a tie vote is automatically considered to have failed. This procedural reality underscores the challenges of governing with a razor-thin majority, where every single vote is critical for passing legislation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government has lifted export controls on chip design software destined for China, as announced by the American software company Synopsys. This move reverses a policy implemented in May that required companies like Synopsys to obtain special licenses for exporting semiconductor-related goods and software to China. Synopsys stated it is now working to restore access to its products for Chinese clients. The policy change suggests a potential de-escalation in the ongoing technology trade dispute between the two countries, although the U.S. Commerce Department has not yet commented.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a new, domestically produced hydropower turbine with a single-unit capacity of 500 megawatts, the largest in the world. The massive 80-tonne turbine was developed by Harbin Electric Machinery Company and is destined for the Datang Zala Hydropower Station on a tributary of the Nu River in Tibet. Constructed from durable and corrosion-resistant martensitic steel, the turbine is described as the "heart" of the new power unit.

          <p>Hong Kong's stock market is experiencing a significant boom in initial public offerings (IPOs), positioning it to potentially become the world's top listing destination this year. New listing volumes surged to $14 billion in the first half of 2025, a dramatic increase from the previous year, driven by Chinese companies seeking to raise capital. This revival is fueled by supportive policies from Beijing, a slower pace of listings on mainland exchanges, and concerns over potential U.S. delistings. The influx of capital reflects renewed investor confidence and a strategic push by Chinese firms for global expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked a Trump administration policy that broadly restricted migrants' ability to seek asylum at the southern border. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president exceeded his legal authority, stating that the executive branch cannot unilaterally create an "alternative immigration system" that bypasses laws enacted by Congress. The judge's order applies nationwide to all individuals covered by the president's executive order, which had declared the border situation an "invasion." The decision has been stayed for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology indicates that menopausal women under 55 using a combination of estrogen and progestin for hormone therapy face an increased risk of breast cancer. Conversely, the research found that using estrogen alone, typically prescribed to women who have had a hysterectomy, actually reduces the risk. This research refines the understanding of hormone replacement therapy, which has been a subject of evolving scientific consensus. Experts emphasize that the findings highlight the importance of personalized medical advice based on treatment type and individual health factors.</p>
