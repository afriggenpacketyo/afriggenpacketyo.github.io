          <p>Shares for the Canadian mineral exploration company Trilogy Metals experienced a dramatic surge of over 185% in premarket trading following a White House announcement. The U.S. government has made a $35.6 million investment in the company, securing a 10% stake as part of a strategic initiative to develop domestic supplies of critical minerals like copper and cobalt in Alaska's Ambler mining district. This move, which reverses a previous Biden administration decision, is aimed at strengthening U.S. supply chains for resources essential for energy infrastructure and defense technologies. The company praised the decision for its commitment to responsible resource development. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sungrow Power Supply, the world's largest manufacturer of solar inverters and energy storage systems, has filed for an initial public offering in Hong Kong. The Hefei-based company, already listed in Shenzhen, holds a significant global market share, having maintained its leading position in inverter shipments for ten consecutive years. The move comes as the Trump administration implements new import tariffs on Chinese-made solar energy products, which are expected to rise further in the coming months. Sungrow's decision to seek a Hong Kong listing aligns with a trend of mainland Chinese companies tapping into the city's robust stock market for capital. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police have arrested 18 suspects and uncovered over 2,000 stolen devices in the UK's largest-ever operation against mobile phone theft. The international gang is believed to be responsible for smuggling up to 40,000 stolen phones, primarily iPhones, from the UK to China in the past year, potentially handling half of all phones stolen in London. The investigation began after a victim tracked their stolen iPhone to a warehouse near Heathrow, leading police to uncover the sophisticated smuggling network. The operation comes as phone thefts in London have nearly tripled since 2020, driven by high demand for second-hand devices and their profitability overseas.</p>

His appointment comes as UNESCO faces significant financial challenges following the U.S. withdrawal from the agency under the Trump administration.

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index hit a record high for the second day in a row, buoyed by a technology stock rally on Wall Street, before closing flat. The surge was largely influenced by AMD's stock skyrocketing after announcing a significant deal with OpenAI, which is perceived as a major challenge to chip industry leader Nvidia. This news prompted gains in Japanese chip-related stocks like Advantest and Renesas Electronics. Meanwhile, Japanese Government Bond yields also rose to multi-year highs, with the 10-year bond yield reaching a level not seen since 2008, reflecting broader shifts in the financial markets.

          <p>China has launched the first commercial underwater data center in the world, located off the coast of Hainan province. The project involves installing server racks inside large, 1,300-tonne data cabins submerged 35 meters deep in the sea. This innovative approach utilizes the natural cooling properties of seawater to significantly reduce the energy consumption typically required for cooling land-based data centers, thereby lowering operational costs. The initial phase is part of a larger plan to build a subsea facility with 100 data cabins, positioning it as a key component of Hainan's strategy to develop new technologies for the marine economy.</p>

          <p>Stargazers can observe the first of three consecutive supermoons of 2025 on Tuesday night with the rise of the full Harvest Moon. A supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides with its closest approach to Earth, known as the perigee, making it appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than other full moons. This year's Harvest Moon, the full moon nearest to the autumn equinox, is occurring unusually late in October. The phenomenon provides extra light around sunset for several evenings, a trait historically beneficial for farmers. Two more supermoons are expected to follow this year in November and December.</p>

          <p>The World Bank has raised its 2025 economic growth forecast for China to 4.8%, up from a previous prediction of 4%, bringing it closer to Beijing's official target. The revision comes despite escalating trade tensions with the U.S. and is attributed to government stimulus measures and resilient export performance, particularly to Southeast Asia and Europe. However, the report cautions that this momentum may slow, projecting growth to ease to 4.2% in 2026. The bank also highlighted persistent domestic challenges for China, including a slump in the real estate sector, sluggish consumer spending, and high youth unemployment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD has announced that the United Kingdom is now its largest market outside of China, following an astounding 880% year-over-year sales increase in September. The company sold over 11,200 cars in the UK last month, with its plug-in hybrid Seal U SUV leading the sales, boosting its UK market share to 3.6%. This success is attributed to BYD's competitively priced models and the UK's lack of tariffs on Chinese EVs, unlike the EU and the US, which have imposed significant levies. The surge aligns with record-high EV sales in the UK, although gasoline and diesel vehicles still constitute the majority of new car purchases.</p>

          <p>For the first time in 100 years, pine martens are once again present in Exmoor National Park following a successful reintroduction effort by conservationists. The Two Moors Pine Marten Project released 19 of the mammals, sourced from Scottish populations, at undisclosed locations within the park. Each animal is fitted with a radio collar to allow researchers to monitor their progress and adaptation to the new environment. Conservationists hailed the return of the native species, which is roughly the size of a domestic cat, as a critical step toward restoring the woodland ecosystem, where they play an important balancing role.</p>

The announcement comes as Tesla faces slowing sales of its current lineup and increased pressure from competitors, especially in China and Europe. The company has been grappling with waning market share, and the launch of a more affordable vehicle is seen as a crucial step to attract a wider customer base.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers staged a crucial four-run rally in the seventh inning to secure a 4-3 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies, taking a 2-0 lead in the National League Division Series. After being shut down for most of the game by Phillies starter Jesús Luzardo, who had retired 17 consecutive batters, the Dodgers' offense came alive with aggressive baserunning and key two-out hits. A pivotal double from Freddie Freeman sparked the rally, which was capped by RBI singles from Will Smith and Shohei Ohtani.
