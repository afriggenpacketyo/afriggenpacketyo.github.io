          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that the EU is actively working to end its reliance on China for rare earth elements, which are crucial for producing smartphones, electric vehicles, and military technology. The move is a response to recent export curbs imposed by Beijing, which the EU claims are causing significant economic damage and forcing some European companies to halt production. The EU's strategy includes increasing recycling efforts, developing domestic production, and forming partnerships with other resource-rich countries to secure a stable supply chain.</p>

          <p>One year after the largest dam removal project in U.S. history, the Klamath River is showing remarkable signs of ecological recovery, inspiring global river restoration movements. Salmon have been observed in headwaters for the first time in over a century, water quality has improved, and native wildlife is returning to the area. The restoration was celebrated by a 30-day, 310-mile kayak journey by Indigenous youth, who became the first to navigate the entire river in more than 100 years, highlighting the cultural and environmental significance of the river's renewal.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight made an emergency return to Omaha just 18 minutes after takeoff due to a suspected security threat that turned out to be a technical malfunction. ESPN reporter Brian Windhorst, who was a passenger, described how flight attendants banging on the cockpit door, unheard by pilots due to a microphone issue, was misinterpreted as an attempted breach. The pilots declared an emergency, leading to a rapid descent and a police response on the runway, but thankfully no one was injured in the dramatic incident.</p>

Instead of simply prohibiting an action, parents should explain the reasoning behind the limit, especially regarding safety and kindness. The article suggests turning a 'no' into a teachable moment by offering alternative choices, which empowers children by giving them a sense of control within clear boundaries, fostering cooperation and connection rather than conflict.</p>
