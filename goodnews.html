          <p>The NJ Transit strike has ended after the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) approved a new deal, but train service will resume on Tuesday. The strike halted trains across New Jersey for three days, impacting hundreds of thousands of commuters. The agreement, described as fair and fiscally responsible, includes work rule concessions that will offset the cost of wage increases for the engineers. The article notes that NJ Transit will need about 24 hours to conduct safety checks and reposition equipment before full service can resume.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan, the liberal and pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, won the Romanian presidential election after defeating right-wing nationalist George Simion. Simion's strong first-round victory, fueled by anger over a previously annulled election due to Russian interference claims, was ultimately overcome by Dan's broader appeal. Dan campaigned on fighting corruption and supporting Ukraine, while Simion attacked the EU and called for cutting aid to Kyiv.

          <p>Nvidia is reportedly in advanced discussions to invest in quantum computing startup PsiQuantum.
