          <p>Clean energy stocks experienced a significant surge after a tax on solar and wind projects, which would have primarily affected components from China, was removed from the Senate's version of a major legislative bill. Companies like NextEra Energy and Array Technologies saw their shares jump, reflecting investor relief. The provision had been criticized by industry groups as punitive, potentially adding billions to the sector's tax burden. Despite this positive development, the Solar Energy Industries Association warned that the overall bill remains detrimental to the renewable energy sector, as it still phases out key investment and production tax credits that have historically supported the industry's growth.

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's multi-billion dollar investment in artificial intelligence, including a high-profile talent acquisition spree, has not negatively impacted the company's stock, as investors focus on the long-term potential. The company recently hired top researchers from competitors like OpenAI and Google to form a new "Meta Superintelligence Labs" (MSL), a move that could add an estimated $1 billion in annual expenses. Despite the high cost, Wall Street appears to be giving Meta a pass, believing these investments will enhance user engagement, improve ad targeting, and eventually lead to new revenue streams. However, the performance of Meta's Llama large language model, which currently lags behind competitors, will be a key metric for evaluating the success of this costly strategy.

          <p>A Republican legislative proposal aims to provide tax relief to seniors through a new temporary deduction, rather than by eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits as previously discussed. The Senate's version of the bill proposes a "senior bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for eligible taxpayers, while the House version suggests $4,000, both targeting individuals with modified adjusted gross incomes under $75,000. This approach is designed to benefit lower- and middle-income seniors more directly than a full tax repeal would. However, critics from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget warn that this deduction, combined with other tax cuts in the bill, would accelerate the insolvency dates for both Social Security and Medicare.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that the central bank would have likely lowered interest rates this year if not for the inflationary impact of President Trump's tariff plan. Speaking at a European Central Bank forum, Powell confirmed that the announcement of higher levies on imported goods caused inflation forecasts to rise materially, forcing the Fed to maintain its current policy stance. This admission provides context for the Fed's decision to hold rates steady despite pressure from the White House for an ease in monetary policy. Powell reiterated that future decisions will be data-dependent and made on a meeting-by-meeting basis, declining to signal whether a rate cut could be expected in July. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With rising home values, many U.S. homeowners possess significant tappable equity, presenting financial opportunities in the current high-interest rate environment. This article explores several strategic ways to utilize a large sum like $100,000 in home equity, such as consolidating high-interest credit card debt into a lower-rate home equity loan or HELOC. Other suggested uses include funding strategic home renovations that boost resale value, investing in a diversified portfolio, or financing a small business venture or educational pursuits. The text emphasizes that while these loans offer more favorable rates than other credit forms, they are secured by one's home and require careful consideration of the associated risks.

Bend was recognized for its low unemployment, significant income growth, and strong work-life balance, featuring a short median commute and a high percentage of remote workers. Richmond, Virginia, and Seattle, Washington, secured the second and third positions, respectively. The report also highlighted cities excelling in specific areas, such as Santa Clara, California, for employer-sponsored health care and Wichita Falls, Texas, for having one of the nation's shortest commutes.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Jack Draper advanced to the next round of Wimbledon after his opponent, Sebastian Baez of Argentina, retired due to an injury during their opening match. Draper, the fourth seed, was comfortably leading 6-2, 6-2, 2-1 when Baez, a clay-court specialist, could not continue after slipping on the baseline and receiving medical treatment. The 23-year-old Draper is considered the host nation's strongest contender for the title, especially in the first championship since Andy Murray's retirement. While it was a confident start, Draper acknowledged the unfortunate way the match ended and will now prepare to face a more experienced grass-court player, 2017 runner-up Marin Cilic, in the second round.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, blocking the Department of Health and Human Services from proceeding with its planned mass layoffs and major agency restructuring. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 19 Democratic attorneys general who argued the overhaul would cause "severe, complicated, and potentially irreversible" harm to public health services nationwide. In her decision, Judge Melissa DuBose stated that the Trump administration's plan lacked a "rational basis" and that HHS failed to provide evidence that critical services would continue uninterrupted. The plan, announced by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., involved laying off some 10,000 employees and consolidating numerous sub-agencies, a move the judge found was outside the executive branch's authority without congressional action.</p>

Cisneros was diagnosed over two years ago but found that focusing on writing new music with her bandmates was therapeutic and helped her through the difficult recovery. The band, known for its DIY work ethic and loyal following, rallied around Cisneros, viewing their bond as a sisterhood. Cisneros shared her journey publicly on social media, connecting with other cancer survivors and finding strength in their shared stories. Now in remission, she has relearned to play guitar and is rejoining the band for a West Coast tour.</p>

          <p>In a positive sign for consumers feeling the pinch of high food costs, Waffle House has officially removed the 50-cent surcharge it had added to egg orders. The temporary price hike was implemented in February in response to a major avian flu outbreak that devastated egg-laying chicken populations and caused wholesale prices to soar to record highs. Since then, egg prices have started to decline, although they remain significantly higher than a year ago. The removal of the surcharge at the popular 24-hour diner chain, which serves hundreds of millions of eggs annually, reflects a broader, albeit slow, normalization of food prices after a period of intense inflation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines whether pursuing credit card debt forgiveness is a sensible strategy for consumers struggling with high balances, particularly in the current high-interest-rate environment. Forgiveness programs can potentially reduce a person's debt by 30% to 50% for those with significant balances and a demonstrated financial hardship. With credit card APRs near record highs, taking action is crucial, as delaying can lead to spiraling interest costs. However, the article cautions that forgiveness is not a universal solution, as it can negatively impact one's credit score and takes time to complete. It advises individuals to thoroughly explore all alternative debt relief options, such as debt management or consolidation, before committing to a forgiveness plan. (not investment advice)</p>

Mamdani's victory, which was widely expected after he took a commanding lead on election night, represents a stunning upset and a major win for the progressive wing of the party.
