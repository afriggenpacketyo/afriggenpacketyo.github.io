          <p>Thousands of Orange Order members and spectators have gathered across Northern Ireland for the annual Twelfth of July parades, commemorating the 1690 Battle of the Boyne. The event, a significant celebration of Protestant culture and Ulster-Scots heritage, features marches in cities like Belfast, Coleraine, and Keady. Officials, including the Reverend Mervyn Gibson of the Orange Order, have described the day as peaceful and successful, highlighting it as a positive expression of cultural identity.

          <p>Technology platforms in the UK will soon be legally required to prevent children from accessing harmful material, such as pornography and content promoting self-harm, under new rules enforced by Ofcom. Taking effect on July 25, the regulations will mandate age verification for users, with companies facing substantial fines for non-compliance. While campaigners and some politicians welcome the move, there is an ongoing debate about whether the rules are sufficient, as they do not currently cover AI chatbots, in-app purchases, or harmful content shared on private messaging apps.</p>

          <p>A recent report from Fidelity provides key guidelines for retirees managing their 401(k) accounts in 2025, emphasizing that retirement age is a critical factor in financial planning. The firm recommends that individuals planning to retire at age 67 should aim to have saved 10 times their final salary, with that multiple increasing for earlier retirement and decreasing for later retirement. Similarly, suggested annual withdrawal rates vary, from 3.9% for those retiring at 62 to 4.9% for those retiring at 70, with adjustments for inflation in subsequent years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is rapidly advancing its deep space exploration program, with ambitious goals that include landing astronauts on the moon before 2030 and returning samples from Mars. All major hardware for the crewed lunar mission, including the Mengzhou capsule and the Long March-10 rocket, is now in advanced development and testing. This progress presents the most significant challenge to the United States' long-held leadership in space in over 60 years. While NASA's Artemis program aims for a 2027 crewed landing, it faces significant technical hurdles, potentially allowing China to close the gap.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A sex and psychotherapy expert warns that many couples underestimate the importance of intimacy and allow common habits to damage their connection. Four major "intimacy blockers" are identified: excessive phone use which signals a lack of presence, unresolved feelings about an ex-partner, a persistent negativity bias, and an unmanaged stress response. The therapist advises couples to set screen-time boundaries, work towards emotional closure from past relationships, challenge negative thoughts, and communicate openly about how stress affects their desire for connection.</p>

          <p>According to a negotiation expert, successfully securing a pay raise is rarely accomplished in a single meeting and is more likely to be a process that unfolds over several weeks. It is advised to initiate compensation discussions during a mid-year check-in rather than at an annual review, when budgets are often already set. The goal of the first meeting should be to open the dialogue and present your case, not to get a final agreement. Following up, documenting the conversation, and being patient are key to a collaborative and ultimately successful negotiation.</p>

          <p>An article argues that modern children are increasingly deprived of free, unstructured physical play, which is crucial for their development. This "self-domestication" and societal pressure for kids to "behave" stifles the natural, animal-like movement that builds healthier bones, muscles, and cognitive skills. Injury-prevention experts suggest that allowing children to climb, run, and wrestle helps them develop a robust "movement vocabulary," making them less prone to injury later in life. Parents are encouraged to overcome fears of minor injuries to provide their children with these essential developmental experiences.</p>

          <p>In her new book "Rich Girl Nation," author Katie Gatti Tassin describes the recurring expenses of maintaining an "acceptable feminine appearance" as a significant and often overlooked financial hurdle for women. She argues that spending on things like hair, nails, and skincare creates a "hot girl hamster wheel" because these are depreciating assets that require continuous investment. Tassin suggests women conduct a "hot girl detox" by annualizing these costs and experimenting with removing them to free up money, time, and mental energy for goals like paying off debt or investing.</p>
