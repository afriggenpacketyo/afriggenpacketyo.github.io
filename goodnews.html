        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to sources, the acting director of FEMA, David Richardson, reportedly told staff he was unaware that hurricane season had begun during a meeting. Hurricane season officially starts on June 1st and lasts until November 30th. A DHS spokesperson stated that Richardson was joking and that FEMA is focused on disaster response and protecting the American people. The advisory council was established by President Donald Trump and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, and Richardson is sticking with the old plan not to get in the way of the FEMA advisory council.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millennials are entering their 40s, redefining the traditional midlife crisis with a focus on personal growth and opportunity rather than the stereotypical abandonment of family and pursuit of fleeting pleasures. Unlike previous generations, millennials often lack the financial stability to drastically alter their lives, leading them to seek fulfillment through career changes, fitness journeys, and self-discovery. Factors like economic instability and the influence of social media contribute to a sense of uncertainty, but many millennials find support in their communities and embrace the ongoing journey of self-improvement. This generation is learning to accept that their lives may not mirror those of their parents and are finding new ways to make the most of their remaining years.</p>

          <p>South Korea's opposition party leader, Lee Jae-myung, is projected to win the country's snap presidential election, according to exit polls. This victory would position him as the next leader after the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol. Lee's win could influence South Korea's trade negotiations with the U.S. and its policies toward China and North Korea. While Lee had shifted to the political center, he is expected to pursue a more left-leaning agenda, focusing on economic revival and tariff negotiations with the U.S.</p>

This move reflects Klarna's efforts to rebrand itself as a comprehensive banking player ahead of a potential IPO.
