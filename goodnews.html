          <p>Liverpool is reportedly finalizing the acquisition of 18-year-old Italian defender Giovanni Leoni from Parma for a fee around £26 million. Leoni has become a primary target for the club under new manager Arne Slot. This potential signing is part of a broader defensive reinforcement strategy, as the team also continues negotiations with Crystal Palace for England's Marc Guehi. The club has been active in the transfer market, spending approximately £270 million this summer while offsetting costs with £170 million in player sales.</p>

The networking giant also issued an optimistic forecast for the upcoming fiscal year, projecting revenue between $59 billion and $60 billion. CEO Chuck Robbins highlighted significant growth in AI-related infrastructure orders, which more than doubled the company's initial $1 billion target.

          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining about 2%, while large-cap tech stocks, including the "Magnificent 7," saw a decline. This market rotation is driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. Lower rates are expected to particularly benefit smaller companies, which often rely more heavily on borrowing for operations and expansion. Traders are now pricing in a near-100% probability of a rate cut, a sentiment bolstered by recent weaker-than-expected economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon has announced a major expansion of its same-day delivery service for fresh groceries, including produce, meat, and eggs, to more than 1,000 cities and towns across the United States. The company plans to extend the service to at least 2,300 locations by the end of the year, intensifying its competition with rivals like Instacart and Walmart. The move follows successful testing where Amazon found that the availability of fresh items encouraged more frequent shopping. The service is free for Prime members on orders over $25, and the announcement led to a drop in the stock prices of several competitors.</p>

          <p>Walmart announced it is expanding its 10% employee discount to include nearly all grocery items, such as milk and meat, making the benefit year-round. Previously, the discount on most food items was limited to the holiday season. The move, which affects approximately 1.6 million U.S. employees, comes as concerns about rising consumer prices grow due to tariffs. The expanded perk is seen as a way to support its workforce financially, while also potentially boosting employee spending at Walmart and aiding in worker retention.</p>

          <p>Habit Burger & Grill has intensified its marketing rivalry with In-N-Out by updating a billboard near Los Angeles International Airport that directly trolls its competitor. After once again outranking In-N-Out in USA Today's fast-food burger contest, Habit altered the sign to cross out last year's '#2' and replace it with '#4' to reflect In-N-Out's new, lower placement. The campaign also takes a jab at In-N-Out's expansion to Tennessee and its CEO's departure from California. The move highlights a playful but pointed battle between the two Irvine-based burger chains.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 14:37:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new estimate from the Senior Citizens League projects that Social Security beneficiaries could receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026. This would be a slight increase from the 2.5% boost received in 2025. The Social Security Administration determines the official COLA each October based on third-quarter inflation data to ensure benefits keep pace with rising prices. While inflation has remained relatively stable this year, some economists worry that a moderate COLA might not be sufficient if tariff-related price pressures cause inflation to rise later in the year.
