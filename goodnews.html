          <p>Victoria Beckham has affirmed her commitment to a "very traditional" family life in a recent interview, emphasizing the importance of shared time and mutual support among her husband David and their four children. She described prioritizing family dinners and ensuring her children saw the value of both parents working, stating that work makes her the best version of herself. The comments come amid persistent rumors of a family rift involving her eldest son, Brooklyn, and his wife, Nicola Peltz, which the family has previously addressed. Beckham highlighted the pride she feels in her children and her marriage, viewing their current stage as a new chapter.</p>

          <p>Oracle has promoted two key executives, Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia, to the roles of co-CEOs, with former CEO Safra Catz transitioning to executive vice chair. Magouyrk previously led the company's cloud infrastructure, while Sicilia oversaw its industries division, both of which have been central to Oracle's recent growth fueled by the AI boom. The leadership change comes as Oracle's stock has surged significantly this year, driven by massive demand for its cloud services and access to Nvidia's GPUs. The company reaffirmed its financial guidance, signaling confidence in its strategic direction under the new leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in China have developed a new technique that demonstrates potential for analyzing old and poorly preserved biological samples, a task previously hindered by chemical damage from preservation methods. Researchers successfully applied the method to cancer tissues that had been stored for nearly a decade under suboptimal conditions. Co-corresponding author Li Yang of BGI-Research noted that while challenging, the technology could theoretically be used on historical samples like Albert Einstein's brain, depending on its original preservation quality. This breakthrough could open new avenues for studying historical biological materials and advancing medical research.</p>

          <p>Pfizer has announced a deal to acquire weight loss drug developer Metsera for up to $7.3 billion, signaling a major push into the lucrative obesity drug market. The acquisition comes after Pfizer faced setbacks with its own drug candidates, increasing pressure to compete with successful treatments from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Metsera's pipeline includes several promising oral and injectable treatments, which could help Pfizer capture a share of a market analysts predict could be worth $100 billion by the 2030s. The deal, which represents a significant premium on Metsera's stock price, is expected to close by the end of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has successfully conducted the first catapult launch of its J-35 stealth fighter from the new aircraft carrier, the Fujian, marking a significant milestone in its naval aviation capabilities. The J-35 is the world's second carrier-based stealth fighter, comparable to the U.S. F-35, and its integration with the Fujian's advanced electromagnetic catapult system represents a major leap for China's military power. State media reported that the successful tests demonstrate the carrier has achieved key operational capabilities. This development signals a transformative step for the Chinese navy as it modernizes its fleet to project power further from its shores.</p>

          <h2>Germany's Ambition to Lead in Autonomous Driving Encounters Significant Obstacles</h2>

          <p>Germany is aiming to become a global leader in autonomous driving technology, but its progress is hampered by several challenges, including high car ownership, a strong taxi lobby, and a well-developed public transit system. While driverless taxis are already operating in parts of the U.S. and China, German deployments have been limited to small-scale pilot projects on fixed routes. A consortium called NeMo Paderborn is developing a concept of lightweight autonomous cabs for short trips, which can form convoys for longer distances to improve energy efficiency. However, industry experts argue that for Germany to truly lead, the government must support a nationwide rollout rather than funding temporary pilot programs.</p>

          <p>A recent phone call between President Trump and President Xi Jinping, described by Chinese state media as constructive, may signal a shift towards a more stable, albeit competitive, U.S.-China relationship. This article suggests that both nations are moving toward accommodation rather than escalation, recognizing their mutual economic dependence despite strategic rivalry. The author posits that this pragmatic approach is necessary for global stability, as an all-out conflict would be devastating for both sides. The emerging dynamic is characterized as a "managed rivalry," where competition is carefully balanced with the necessity of cooperation on key issues.</p>

          <p>A new mutual defense agreement between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan is not expected to disrupt Riyadh's significant energy relationship with India, a key crude oil consumer. An informed source stated that commercial ties will be maintained and that India will continue to purchase Saudi oil, which is a top supplier for the nation. The pact is seen as part of Saudi Arabia's strategy to diversify its security alliances without compromising its economic interests. The source also dismissed speculation about Saudi Arabia moving away from the U.S. dollar for oil trading, reinforcing the greenback's continued dominance in its export pricing.

This was the second consecutive week the pair had a heated exchange, but Reid downplayed the incident, explaining that the team lacked emotional intensity in the second quarter. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes also commented, affirming the strong relationship between the coach and player. The incident is similar to past emotional displays from Kelce, including during last season's Super Bowl, which he later admitted was out of line.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz is urging President Trump to support raising the mandatory retirement age for airline pilots from 65 to 67. In a letter, Cruz argued that the current policy forces thousands of experienced pilots into early retirement annually and that the U.S. should lead international efforts on this issue at an upcoming UN aviation meeting. The proposal faces opposition from the Air Line Pilots Association, which cites health risks and potential cognitive decline in older pilots. Last year, Congress rejected a similar push, siding with the FAA's call for more safety analysis before making such a significant change.</p>

For the first time in his professional career, Williams was not sacked, allowing him to effectively distribute the ball and lead the offense with both explosive plays and sustained drives.
