          <p>Nearly 200 people completed a 14-day, 160-mile march from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C., to advocate for democratic principles and hold leaders accountable. The "We Are America" marchers, ranging from children to the elderly, were greeted by supporters and members of Congress upon their arrival in the capital. Their journey was intended to build a unified movement in response to actions by the Trump administration that they view as undermining democratic norms. Along the way, participants were supported by communities that provided food and shelter, reinforcing their sense of shared purpose and solidarity.</p>

The week's focus will also be on new economic data, particularly the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, a crucial inflation metric for the Federal Reserve. Cramer suggests that despite some investor skepticism about recent market performance, many sectors may continue their upward trend, with potential stock movements also influenced by details from President Trump's meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a comprehensive package of climate and environment bills designed to lower electricity and gasoline costs while also supporting California's oil sector. A key component extends the state's cap-and-trade program, which is expected to generate billions to reduce utility bills and fund public transit. The legislative package also controversially allows for new oil drilling in Kern County, a move that has angered some environmental groups. Officials have framed the laws as a necessary compromise to ensure energy affordability while advancing the state's transition to a clean-energy economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Canada's women's rugby team delivered a stunning upset by defeating the six-time world champion New Zealand in the World Cup semi-final, ending the Black Ferns' 11-year undefeated streak in the tournament. The Canadian side, which had to fundraise to even attend the competition, dominated the match with a powerful first-half performance. The victory, described as "seismic," propels Canada into their first World Cup final since 2014. The result follows a recent pattern of strong performances from Canada, who are ranked higher than New Zealand in the world standings.</p>

          <p>A UK cabinet minister has rejected President Trump's suggestion that the military should be used to stop asylum seekers crossing the English Channel. During a state visit, Trump advocated for military intervention to handle illegal migration, but UK Trade Secretary Peter Kyle clarified that the UK Border Force is specifically tasked with this role. He emphasized that the military's primary focus must remain on national defense, although a functional relationship with the Border Force exists. The comments come as a record number of migrants have crossed the Channel this year and the UK government proceeds with its own deportation policies.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has dismissed President Trump's defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, calling the 85-page complaint "decidedly improper and impermissible" due to its excessive length and detail. The judge criticized the filing for its "abundant, florid, and enervating detail" that violated federal rules requiring a concise presentation. Trump's legal team has been given 28 days to file a shorter, amended version of the complaint, which originally sought $15 billion in damages over the newspaper's coverage of his career and administration. The president's legal team has vowed to continue with the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have made significant progress toward a deal regarding TikTok's U.S. operations, but a final agreement was not reached during their recent phone call. A White House official indicated that while the two leaders moved closer to a resolution, more work is needed to finalize the terms. The popular video app faces a potential ban in the U.S. unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, divests its American business due to national security concerns. President Trump has repeatedly extended the deadline for the divestiture while negotiations continue to find a mutually acceptable solution.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrat party in the UK has proposed a new community policing initiative that would establish police counters in public venues like supermarkets, shopping centers, and libraries. The party argues this would enhance public confidence and make it easier for citizens to report crimes, especially following a decade of declining traditional police station counters. To fund the plan, the Liberal Democrats suggest abolishing the elected Police and Crime Commissioner roles, a move they claim would free up sufficient resources. The policy was announced at the party's annual conference as part of its strategy to address community safety.</p>

          <p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong confirmed that NBA superstar Kevin Durant has successfully regained access to his bitcoin holdings after being locked out of his account for years. Durant, an early investor in both bitcoin and Coinbase itself, had purchased the cryptocurrency in 2016 when its value was a fraction of today's price. The situation, which Durant's agent had recently joked about at a conference, highlighted broader customer service issues at the cryptocurrency exchange. Armstrong acknowledged the concerns and stated that the company is now putting a major focus on improving its customer support experience.</p>
