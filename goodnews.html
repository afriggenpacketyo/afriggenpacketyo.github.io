          <p>Conservationists in Wales are using edible glitter to track endangered water voles. The glitter is mixed with apple chunks, a favorite treat for captive-bred voles, and fed to them. Once consumed, the glitter is expected to appear in their droppings, allowing conservationists to track the voles' movements and territories. This innovative approach aims to help protect the species by informing habitat management strategies, such as removing invasive conifers or fencing off riverbanks to prevent grazing, ultimately aiding the water voles' dispersal and survival. </p>

          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed in April, indicating that consumption remains a concern for the economy, while industrial output surprisingly grew despite U.S. tariffs. The National Bureau of Statistics acknowledges external uncertainties and the need to consolidate economic recovery. Fixed-asset investment saw a slight increase, and the urban unemployment rate decreased. Despite a drop in shipments to the U.S. due to tariffs, China's exports surged due to increased trade with Southeast Asian countries. Automobile sales growth was weak, and the real estate sector continues to face challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple is significantly increasing iPhone production in India to mitigate the impact of U.S. tariffs and diversify its supply chain away from China. CEO Tim Cook announced that a majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. will originate from India. While this move presents opportunities for India's electronics manufacturing sector, challenges remain, including cost competitiveness, labor market rigidities, and infrastructure needs. To become a truly independent manufacturing hub, India must invest in infrastructure, skills, and technology, while also addressing potential geopolitical complexities.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan, the liberal and pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, won the Romanian presidential election after defeating right-wing nationalist George Simion. The election followed months of political turbulence and a previous annulled vote. Dan secured 54% of the vote, attracting support from Romanians seeking change and maintaining support for Ukraine. Simion, who attacked the EU and called for cutting aid to Kyiv, initially refused to concede but eventually acknowledged Dan's victory. The election reflects ongoing political divisions and a desire for stability in Romania.</p>
