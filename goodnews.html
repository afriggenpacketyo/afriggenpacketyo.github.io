          <p>The United Kingdom is set to commemorate the 80th anniversary of VE Day with a series of events spanning four days, from May 5th to 8th. Commemorations will include a military procession from Whitehall to Buckingham Palace, a flypast by the Red Arrows, and a service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey. King Charles and Queen Camilla are expected to appear on the Buckingham Palace balcony and host a tea party for war veterans. Street parties and community get-togethers are planned across the country, echoing the celebrations from 80 years ago, and the Tower of London will open an art installation of 30,000 ceramic poppies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>United Airlines is reducing its schedule at Newark Liberty International Airport by 35 roundtrip flights daily, approximately 10% of its Newark hub schedule, due to ongoing air traffic controller staffing shortages and technology problems at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). CEO Scott Kirby stated that 20% of air traffic controllers for Newark had recently left their jobs, exacerbating existing understaffing issues. The airline is urging the FAA to implement flight restrictions similar to those in place at other congested airports. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy acknowledged the outdated technology and vowed to fix the equipment outages, while the FAA confirmed staffing issues were causing delays.</p>

The Daily Mail highlights the "Reform revolution," while The Times notes Nigel Farage's confidence following his party's wins. The Daily Telegraph features Kemi Badenoch's reaction to the Conservative Party's losses. Several papers also focus on Prince Harry's interview, where he discusses his relationship with his father, King Charles, and concerns about his family's security in the UK. The Financial Times focuses on Reform UK's victories and concerns over British soldiers' drone training.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Kentucky Derby features a field of 19 horses, with Journalism being the morning-line favorite. Trained by Michael McCarthy, Journalism has won three straight graded-stakes races. Sovereignty and Sandman are also considered strong contenders. Last year's winner, Mystik Dan, won by a nose in a close three-horse finish. Jockey Brian Hernandez Jr., who rode Mystik Dan to victory last year, will be riding Burnham Square this year. Rodriguez was scratched from the race due to a foot bruise, making room for Baeza to enter the field. Bob Baffert returns to the Derby after a three-year suspension, with Citizen Bull among the horses given 20-1 odds.</p>

          <p>A 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck off the southern coasts of Chile and Argentina, triggering a tsunami warning that was later canceled. The quake was followed by several aftershocks, prompting Chilean authorities to issue an evacuation alert for coastal areas. People calmly evacuated in response to sirens, and authorities suspended water activities in Ushuaia, Argentina. The epicenter was located in the Drake Passage, and while the earthquake was felt in Ushuaia and other towns, no significant damage or casualties were reported. The Chilean Antarctic Institute evacuated bases as a precaution.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that the U.S. is in a "transition period" and will perform "fantastically," while minimizing the potential impact of a short-term recession. He cited strong employment figures and reiterated his call for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Trump's comments followed the release of data showing a marginal slowdown in job growth for April. Despite growing public discontent over his handling of the economy, Trump expressed confidence in the long-term economic outlook. Recent data indicated the first quarterly decline in GDP in three years, though some economists point to robust consumer spending as a positive sign.</p>

          <p>Australians are participating in a national election amidst concerns over the rising cost of living and economic uncertainty. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor party is in a tight race against the Liberal-National coalition, led by Peter Dutton. Surveys indicate that high prices and housing shortages are top voter concerns. The election is also influenced by the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump, particularly his trade policies.

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to halt its efforts to freeze funds to Maine schools, resolving a dispute over the state's support of transgender rights. The USDA had suspended funds for a child nutrition program after Maine refused to comply with demands to bar trans girls from girls' sports. Governor Janet Mills responded to the initial threat by saying she would see the president in court. The settlement restores funding to the program that helps feed 172,000 children in the state. The settlement does not affect a separate lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against the Maine Department of Education over its policy for trans athletes.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional, permanently blocking the administration from enforcing it. Judge Beryl Howell found that the order, which sought to punish the firm for representing Hillary Clinton and its progressive employment policies, violated the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. The judge said the directive sent a message that "lawyers must stick to the party line, or else." Howell's ruling is the first summary ruling in one of four cases brought by law firms penalized by the president for their associations with disfavored people and causes.</p>

          <p>The remains of two domestic cats discovered in a nearly 500-year-old Spanish shipwreck may represent the earliest evidence of cats in what is now the United States. The shipwreck, Emanuel Point II, sank in Florida's Pensacola Bay in 1559. Researchers believe the cats were brought on board to control rodents. Chemical analysis suggests the adult cat ate a diet of fish and possibly domestic meat, rather than relying on rats. Cats are not native to the U.S. and are believed to have been brought to the Americas by Europeans for pest control and were also considered lucky by sailors.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using the blood of a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Tim Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snake species in animal tests. Current antivenoms are species-specific, but Friede's 18-year mission could lead to a universal antivenom, which could save thousands of lives annually. Friede endured over 200 bites and 700 venom injections from some of the world's deadliest snakes. Researchers identified two broadly neutralising antibodies that could target two classes of neurotoxin, creating an antivenom cocktail that protected mice from fatal doses of 13 of 19 species of venomous snakes.</p>

          <p>President Trump's investments in cryptocurrency have reportedly increased his family's net worth by $2.9 billion in the last six months. This increase is attributed to the release of meme coins and a stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto exchange affiliated with the Trump family. An Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions in World Liberty Financial, further boosting the family's wealth. As the president's crypto investments have grown, the Securities and Exchange Commission has paused investigations into a dozen crypto companies.
