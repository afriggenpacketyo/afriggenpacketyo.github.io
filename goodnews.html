          <p>Photographer Miora Rajaonary created a photo exhibit titled "Sahy Rano" to raise awareness of female genital schistosomiasis (FGS), a disease affecting an estimated 56 million women and girls, primarily in Africa. The waterborne infection is spread by parasitic worms and can lead to infertility and increased HIV risk. The women in the portraits wear traditional Malagasy face masks to emphasize their courage in speaking about the disease. The backdrop simulates contaminated water with the women's clothing hanging as if freshly washed, highlighting the disease's impact on their lives.</p>

          <p>A federal appellate court panel has blocked a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in public school classrooms, deeming it unconstitutional. Civil liberties groups hailed the ruling as a victory for the separation of church and state, arguing that the mandate would isolate non-Christian students. Louisiana's Attorney General Liz Murrill plans to appeal the ruling, potentially taking it to the U.S. Supreme Court. Similar laws are being challenged in other states, testing the court on the issue of religion and government.</p>

          <p>A relationship expert suggests that couples should take a compatibility test to avoid deal-breakers later in the relationship.

          <p>This article argues that air conditioning is more than just a luxury and offers five reasons to be grateful for it. Air conditioning saves lives by preventing heat-related deaths, keeps people productive at work and school, helps people sleep better, has enabled the development of industries like movies and microchips, and allows people to live and travel in hot climates. While acknowledging the environmental impact of air conditioning, the author advocates for more efficient units powered by cleaner electricity, emphasizing that it should be a choice to go without it.</p>

          <p>Sue Baker, who had been struggling with heart issues for years and had an LVAD implanted, underwent a first-of-its-kind heart-liver transplant to address her high antibody levels. Faced with limited options, Baker agreed to the experimental procedure, which involved transplanting a liver alongside the new heart to reduce the risk of organ rejection. The surgery was successful, and Baker also donated her healthy liver to another patient in a domino operation. Although she faced personal tragedy and financial struggles after the surgery, Baker's case has paved the way for similar procedures, offering hope to other patients with complex medical conditions.</p>

          <p>China has successfully tested its home-grown operating system, OpenHarmony, in space, marking a significant step towards reducing reliance on foreign software. The OpenHarmony real-time operating system (RTOS) was tested on the Dalian-1 Lianli CubeSat, improving data updates and stability compared to earlier systems. The mission, running on a domestically produced chip, achieved a fully home-grown hardware-software solution. Following the mission, national technical standards have been proposed to guide the use of OpenHarmony in small satellites, encouraging broader adoption across commercial and research missions in China.</p>

The shared activity allows them to bridge their political and cultural divides, highlighting the importance of finding common interests to foster understanding. Litt argues that Democrats need to connect with working-class voters and find ways to communicate their message effectively.</p>
