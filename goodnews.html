          <p>This article addresses and refutes several claims made by the White House linking acetaminophen (Tylenol) use, particularly during pregnancy, to autism. Medical experts clarify that there is no scientific evidence supporting these assertions, including the baseless claim that the Amish community has no autism due to avoiding medication. Doctors emphasize that Tylenol remains the safest option for pain and fever relief during pregnancy when used as directed. The article highlights the dangers of spreading medical misinformation and advises consulting healthcare professionals for guidance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Labour-led Welsh government is warning of significant public service cuts if it cannot secure support for its upcoming budget in the Senedd. As a minority government, Labour lacks the votes to pass the £27 billion spending plan alone and must negotiate with opposition parties. The Conservatives have offered to discuss a deal in exchange for scrapping the land transaction tax, a Welsh equivalent of stamp duty. Failure to pass a budget by the start of the financial year in April would trigger automatic spending restrictions, potentially leading to widespread public sector redundancies.</p>

          <p>A new book titled "Candid New York" compiles the groundbreaking work of George Bradford Brainerd, a civil engineer and photographer from the 1870s. Often called the "father of instantaneous photography," Brainerd developed early handheld cameras that allowed him to capture candid scenes of everyday life on New York City streets. His innovative technology enabled him to document a wide range of subjects, from musicians and paperboys to beggars, with unprecedented detail. The book, authored by Erik Hesselberg, offers a unique visual record of the era.</p>

          <h2>Global Trade Growth to Slow but Remain Resilient Despite Tariff Hikes, Study Finds</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by DHL and NYU Stern School of Business suggests that global trade will withstand recent tariff increases, though its growth will be slower. The DHL Global Connectedness Tracker forecasts an average annual growth rate of 2.5% for global trade volume through 2029, a pace similar to the previous decade but down from an earlier 3.1% prediction. The report notes that while growth is expected to slow from 3.2% this year to 1.6% next year, a complete reversal of globalization is a risk but not a current reality. Researchers emphasize the enduring strength and creativity of international commerce in adapting to economic headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is championing a targeted screening program for prostate cancer, arguing it could "save countless lives." As a patron for Prostate Cancer Research, Sunak supports a new report proposing screening for men aged 45-69 who are at the highest risk, such as Black men or those with a family history of the disease. The charity estimates the program, involving MRI scans and blood tests, would cost £25 million annually. While proponents highlight the potential to save lives, some medical experts remain cautious, citing risks of over-diagnosis and unnecessary treatment.</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old from Inverclyde, Scotland, is advocating for mandatory CPR training in all Scottish schools after tragically losing both of his parents to heart conditions. The teenager, Cameron McGerr, believes that knowing CPR could have potentially saved his father, who suffered a cardiac arrest earlier this year. He has already successfully convinced his own school to introduce the life-saving training and recently shared his story with Members of the Scottish Parliament to push for a nationwide initiative. His "Pulse of Life" campaign aims to equip all young people with the skills to act in a medical emergency.</p>

          <p>With England captain Harry Kane in prolific form, the question of who serves as his primary backup remains a point of discussion for the national team. An injury to Ollie Watkins, the only other dedicated striker in the current squad, has highlighted a perceived lack of depth in the traditional number nine position. Only seven English out-and-out strikers have played in the Premier League this season, prompting concerns from even the Under-21s manager about the development of goal-scoring forwards. As England nears World Cup qualification, the race to secure the role of Kane's deputy is intensifying.</p>
