          <h2>Tariffs Have Yet to Significantly Impact Inflation Due to Several Factors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 11:18:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns, President Trump's tariffs have not yet caused a significant rise in inflation, with recent data indicating benign consumer and producer prices. Several factors have contributed to keeping inflation in check, including companies stockpiling imported goods before tariff implementation. The delayed pass-through of tariffs into the real economy and reduced consumer pricing power are also contributing factors. Economists expect the impact of tariffs to materialize in the coming months, but for now, inflation remains relatively stable. </p>

          <p>Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds are common investment vehicles for diversified portfolios, with both actively and passively managed options. ETFs trade like individual stocks with fluctuating prices during trading hours, while mutual funds are purchased and sold directly at the end-of-day market price. ETFs typically have lower expense ratios than mutual funds due to simpler transaction management. Investors should consult a fund's prospectus to understand its objectives, risks, fees, and performance history. Jim Cramer advocates for market beginners to invest their first $10,000 in an S&P 500 index mutual fund or ETF before selecting individual stocks. (not investment advice)</p>
