          <p>Europe has established a commanding 11½–4½ lead over the United States heading into the Ryder Cup singles matches, marking their largest ever pre-singles advantage. This article highlights the European team's imperious performance and the significant struggles faced by the American side, including leadership issues and the poor form of top players like Scottie Scheffler. The event was further complicated by controversial crowd behavior, with European players such as Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry reportedly subjected to personal insults. Despite the contentious atmosphere and American capitulation, Europe is now poised to retain the trophy, requiring only two and a half more points for a decisive victory.</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's new book, "Life, Law, & Liberty," offers a rare glimpse into his 30-year tenure, during which he often served as the court's swing justice. He expresses deep concern over the current state of American discourse and the increasingly partisan tone of some Supreme Court opinions. Kennedy discusses his pivotal votes on same-sex marriage and abortion, revealing his personal conflicts and his evolving interpretation of "liberty" beyond originalist views. This article also shares personal anecdotes, including a poignant reconciliation with Justice Antonin Scalia.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The effectiveness of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging is being critically examined, with experts expressing skepticism despite anecdotal evidence. Collagen, a vital protein for skin integrity, naturally declines with age. This article explains that while companies now use smaller collagen peptides for better absorption, their direct impact on skin is uncertain, as they may support other organs. Dermatologists recommend marine collagen over bovine or vegan types, but ultimately suggest sunblock, a healthy diet, and procedures like laser stimulation or microneedling as more proven methods for skin health.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that China's global initiatives could provide the necessary reform for a United Nations facing a "make-it-or-break-it moment." The author critiques the contradictions within the UN, exemplified by Germany's arms supplies to Israel despite the UN General Assembly President's concerns about global crises. This article suggests that the UN's current state, with major powers enabling conflicts, necessitates a re-evaluation of its effectiveness. It implicitly positions China's approach as a potential alternative for a more equitable and effective global governance.</p>
