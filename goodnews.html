          <p>At the All In: Texas event, 56-year-old wrestling legend Dustin Rhodes captured the vacated AEW TNT Championship in a four-way match against three younger competitors. The title was relinquished by Adam Cole due to health issues just hours before the show, leading to the hastily booked match. For Rhodes, this victory marked the first AEW championship of his career, an emotional moment for the veteran who has been with the company since its inception in 2019. This win makes him a triple champion, as he also holds the ROH World Tag Team and World Six-Man Tag Team titles, adding another accolade to his storied career across multiple promotions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As summer temperatures rise in Palm Springs, prices at luxury hotels are dropping to their lowest points of the year, creating an opportunity for travelers who can withstand the heat. With fewer tourists, high-end resorts like the Parker Palm Springs and the Thompson have reduced their nightly rates from over $550 to under $350. These hotels are also offering additional perks, such as multi-night stay discounts and resort credits, to attract visitors during the off-season. The strategy relies on guests enjoying the region's year-round beauty by spending their time in air-conditioned spaces and poolside, making a luxury desert escape more affordable.</p>

          <h2>Tim Merlier Wins Stage Nine of Tour de France After Daring Breakaway is Caught</h2>

          <p>Belgian sprinter Tim Merlier claimed his second victory of this year's Tour de France, winning stage nine in a bunch sprint to the finish line in Chateauroux. The win came after a dramatic day where Mathieu van der Poel nearly pulled off a stunning victory from a two-man breakaway he initiated at the start of the stage. Van der Poel's audacious effort was caught by the peloton with less than a kilometer remaining, setting up the sprint finish for Merlier. Despite the thrilling finale, the general classification remains unchanged, with defending champion Tadej Pogacar holding a 54-second lead over Remco Evenepoel.</p>

          <p>The new "Superman" film has launched successfully at the box office, earning an estimated $122 million in its domestic debut and signaling a strong start for the revamped DC cinematic universe. This opening is the first major release under the new leadership of James Gunn and Peter Safran, who aim to reinvigorate the franchise. The film's performance is a much-needed win for Warner Bros. and DC after a series of underperforming superhero movies, with its domestic haul surpassing that of 2013's "Man of Steel." Globally, the movie brought in a total of $217 million, providing a solid foundation for the studio's future projects.</p>

          <p>FIFA and the global players' union, Fifpro, have reached a significant agreement to introduce mandatory rest periods to protect players from injury and burnout. Following talks ahead of the Club World Cup final, both parties agreed on the need for a 72-hour gap between games and a minimum three-week rest period at the end of each season. This consensus marks a crucial step in addressing player welfare concerns, which have intensified with the expansion of competitions like the 32-team Club World Cup. While a victory for Fifpro, FIFA's statement also reiterated its commitment to creating more global competitions, highlighting an ongoing balance between player health and tournament growth.</p>

          <p>Investigative genetic genealogy, a technique combining DNA analysis with family tree research, is proving to be a revolutionary tool for solving cold cases. The article highlights the work of Barbara Rae-Venter, a patent attorney whose hobby led her to unmask the Golden State Killer. This method involves uploading crime scene DNA to public genealogy databases to find distant relatives of a suspect, then building out family trees to pinpoint the individual. The success of this technique has led to the resolution of dozens of violent crimes, including murders and sexual assaults, though it also raises significant questions about genetic privacy and law enforcement access to personal data.</p>

          <p>One year after the attempted assassination of President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service has implemented significant security upgrades to prevent a repeat of the incident. The agency has introduced a fleet of military-grade drones for enhanced aerial surveillance, addressing the failure to detect the shooter's own drone before the attack. Additionally, new mobile command posts, costing up to $1.5 million each, have been established to ensure direct radio communication between Secret Service agents and local law enforcement. These technological and procedural reforms aim to fix the critical communication and reconnaissance failures that were identified in multiple investigations following the shooting.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has announced that the government will take steps to make electric vehicles (EVs) more affordable for consumers, with details to be revealed later in the week. While she did not confirm if this would involve direct grants, the pledge comes amid reports of a potential £700 million subsidy package. The government also announced funding to improve charging infrastructure, including £25 million for "cross-pavement gullies" to help those without driveways. The move aims to boost EV sales, which remain below mandated targets as the country approaches its 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>To better project China's soft power and explain its practices to the world, Chinese think tanks must become more "self-centred" and develop an indigenous knowledge system, according to prominent policy adviser Zheng Yongnian. He argues that many Chinese universities remain stuck in Western academic frameworks, whereas think tanks should focus on empirical research grounded in China's unique practical experience. Zheng believes that by moving away from Western models and building a system based on its own policy formation and implementation, China can more effectively analyze its own development. This approach, he contends, is essential for accurately explaining China's present and predicting its future.</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon men's final will feature a highly anticipated rematch between the world's top two players, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. This marks the first time since the rivalry of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal that the same two men will compete in both the French Open and Wimbledon finals in the same year. Just five weeks ago, Alcaraz defeated Sinner in a grueling five-set epic at Roland-Garros, extending his winning streak against the Italian to five matches. Alcaraz, the two-time defending Wimbledon champion, is undefeated in Grand Slam finals, while Sinner is seeking his first title at the All England Club.</p>

          <p>Gisèle Pelicot, a 72-year-old woman who gained international acclaim for her testimony, has been awarded France's highest distinction, the Legion of Honour. She waived her right to anonymity during the trial of her husband, who was convicted of drugging her and orchestrating her sexual assault by dozens of men over a decade. Pelicot stated her goal was to inspire other survivors and to make "shame swap sides" from the victim to the perpetrator. President Emmanuel Macron praised her courage, and a memoir detailing her story is planned for publication.</p>
