          <p>Nuclear power stocks experienced a significant rally following reports that President Trump is planning to sign executive orders aimed at boosting the nuclear industry. The orders are expected to expedite the construction of nuclear reactors and secure vital materials for the sector.

          <p>Angel Reese's struggles with shooting were highlighted during the Chicago Sky's defeat against the New York Liberty. Reese missed all eight of her shot attempts, scoring only two points, and a viral sequence showed her grabbing five offensive rebounds in 19 seconds due to her own misses. This performance ended her streak of 136 games with at least one basket, dating back to 2021. Meanwhile, the Liberty set a WNBA record with 19 three-pointers, showcasing a stark contrast in shooting efficiency between the two teams.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of Japanese Gen Z workers are embracing 'quiet quitting,' prioritizing personal interests and work-life balance over traditional career ambitions. A study reveals that 45% of Japanese workers aged 20 to 59 admit to doing the bare minimum at their jobs, with employees in their 20s being the most likely to adopt this approach. This shift in attitude reflects a desire for more 'me time' and a rejection of the long working hours and sacrifices made by previous generations. Experts suggest that this trend is also influenced by changing economic conditions and a lack of traditional employer loyalty.</p>

          <p>OpenAI employees are reportedly frustrated by the company's restrictions on donating equity to charity, despite the company's soaring valuation. Employees receive profit participation units (PPUs) that can't be transferred without company approval, limiting their ability to donate equity via donor-advised funds (DAFs). This issue has been a topic of discussion at OpenAI, but the company has prioritized other matters, such as funding rounds and for-profit conversion. While OpenAI has partnered with Dechomai as its donor-advised fund, employees await further opportunities to donate, as they believe that donating to charity is a great opportunity not only for their charitable giving impulses but also for their taxes.</p>

          <p>The article examines the 'Wages for Housework' movement of the 1970s, which advocated for government pay for unpaid domestic labor. It argues that the movement's ideas, though radical, offer a potential solution to declining birth rates and the devaluation of care work. The author contrasts this approach with right-wing pronatalist policies that simply 'glorify motherhood' without providing material support. The article also discusses the movement's utopianism and its failure to achieve tangible victories, while emphasizing its important understanding of women's needs and the need for economic freedom.</p>

          <p>Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has expressed skepticism about NATO members' ability to meet President Trump's demand for defense spending to reach 5% of GDP. Mitsotakis believes 3.5% is a more realistic ceiling for hard defense spending, though he acknowledged that the 5% target could be achievable in the long term if broader expenses are included. NATO chief Mark Rutte has reportedly suggested a 3.5% defense spending target with an additional 1.5% for wider security-related matters. Many NATO countries have historically struggled to meet the current 2% target.</p>
