          <p>In the wake of Kamala Harris's defeat, Democrats are engaged in a debate over whether their political and policy mistakes stem from flawed messaging or deeper issues with their governance. Some argue that the party's failure to deliver material improvements in areas like housing and infrastructure has undermined their credibility. A recent poll suggests that voters prefer populist rhetoric focused on corporate power over technocratic arguments about supply-side bottlenecks. However, the article argues that Democrats do not need to choose between these approaches, as policies promoting abundance can be compatible with redistributing wealth and power. </p>

          <p>Max Verstappen has admitted that "frustration" led to his collision with George Russell during the Spanish Grand Prix, acknowledging that the move "was not right and shouldn't have happened". Russell had accused the Formula 1 world champion of deliberately driving into his Mercedes. Verstappen received a 10-second penalty for the incident, which dropped him from fifth to 10th place. The penalty leaves Verstappen 49 points behind championship leader Oscar Piastri. </p>

          <p>Vogue has declared that the word "chic" has lost its meaning due to overuse and co-option by influencers.

While acknowledging the usefulness of "chic," the author finds it less objectionable than other overused terms.

          <p>As the Senate debates President Donald Trump's multi-trillion-dollar tax and spending package, changes to the child tax credit are possible. The House-approved bill would make permanent the maximum $2,000 credit passed in 2017 and increase it to $2,500 from 2025 to 2028. However, the Senate may have different plans, leading to negotiations on the child tax credit. The proposed higher child tax credit comes as the U.S. fertility rate hovers near historic lows.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts argue that California's proposed ban on plants near homes to reduce wildfire risk may be misguided. Well-maintained plants and trees can help protect homes from wind-blown embers and slow the spread of fire. The state's plan for an "ember-resistant zone," prohibiting almost all plants within 5 feet of homes, could face public resistance. Research suggests that well-watered plants can act as heat sinks, absorbing energy and blocking embers, thus reducing fire risk. </p>

          <p>California is on the verge of implementing a sweeping bill that would mandate phonics-based reading instruction in schools, marking a significant shift in the state's approach to literacy education. The proposed law, backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, aims to address California's persistently low reading scores by requiring districts to adopt instructional materials based on the "science of reading." This approach emphasizes phonemic awareness, phonics, reading fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. The bill has garnered support from teachers unions and advocacy groups after compromises were made to provide districts with more flexibility in selecting instructional materials. </p>
