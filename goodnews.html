          <h2>Global Markets Brace for Another 'China Shock' Amid Overcapacity Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 03:34:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's manufacturing overcapacity is causing anxiety in global markets, as a flood of cheap imports could squeeze local industries, according to experts. Steep tariffs are deterring Chinese exports to the U.S., while domestic consumption remains a worry, leading to producer prices staying in deflationary territory for over two years. However, economists note that the influx of low-cost Chinese goods could provide some relief for inflation-hit economies, potentially easing pressure on central banks. This could pave the way for more rate cuts across Asia, as central banks further decouple from the Fed and deliver additional easing (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>North Korea claims to have successfully refloated a new destroyer that capsized during its launch last month, with plans to move it to a dry dock for repairs. The 5,000-ton warship, intended to be a symbol of North Korea's naval modernization, suffered a malfunction during the launch, causing damage to the hull. Leader Kim Jong Un deemed the incident a "criminal act" and ordered swift repairs before the late-June plenary session of the ruling Workers‚Äô Party. Analysts were surprised by the speed of the refloating process, which involved using aerostatic balloons attached to the ship‚Äôs hull.</p>

Mann gained global recognition for novels like "Buddenbrooks" and "The Magic Mountain," but also wrote political essays and radio speeches denouncing the German "catastrophe" that led to the Holocaust. He emigrated to the US in 1939, calling on Germans to resist Nazi policies through BBC broadcasts, and later returned to Switzerland, where he died in 1955.</p>

RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited softened inflation and slower growth amid global uncertainty as reasons for the move. The decision followed better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, but the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%. While highlighting growth concerns and tariff threats, the RBI also noted a downtrend in inflation, revising its outlook to 3.7% for the current financial year (not investment advice).</p>

This is Trump's latest attempt to prevent Harvard from enrolling a quarter of its students, who are foreign nationals. Harvard has attracted a growing number of the brightest minds from around the world, with international enrollment growing from 11% of the student body three decades ago to 26% today.</p>

          <p>New research by PwC challenges common myths about AI's impact, finding that AI makes workers "more valuable, not less." The 2025 AI Jobs Barometer report analyzed over 800 million job ads and thousands of company financial reports, revealing that both jobs and wages are growing in AI-exposed occupations. The report disputes fears that AI will automate jobs and cut wages, instead highlighting AI's potential to boost productivity and create new opportunities. According to the study, the key challenge is preparing workers with the new skills needed for AI-driven jobs.</p>
