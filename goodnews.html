          <p>Kenneth Rogoff and Yu Yongding, prominent economists from the US and China respectively, discussed the future of the US dollar and the potential rise of the Chinese yuan. Yu Yongding argued that foreign investors' demand for US assets would gradually decline, making it difficult for the US to maintain a strong dollar. Rogoff has warned of a crisis of legitimacy for the US dollar, while Yu has advocated for a free-floating yuan and broad fiscal stimulus in China. The discussion highlights concerns about the stability of the US dollar and the growing influence of the Chinese economy in the global financial landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Almonds are recommended by dietitians as a beneficial nut for weight loss due to their high fiber, anti-inflammatory properties, and protein content. Fiber helps promote satiety and reduce inflammatory molecules, while protein aids in maintaining muscle mass and boosting metabolism. Almonds are also packed with anti-inflammatory plant compounds called flavonoids, polyphenols and proanthocyanidins. Other nuts like cashews, walnuts, and pistachios can also support weight loss, offering various health benefits such as improved gut health and blood pressure levels. (not investment advice)</p>
