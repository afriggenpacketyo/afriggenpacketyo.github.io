          <p>A dramatic helicopter rescue was conducted at Point Reyes National Seashore after two hikers became stranded on a remote beach near Elephant Rock. The pair found their only exit route cut off by the rising tide and called for emergency services after being trapped for several hours. A Sonoma County Sheriff's Office helicopter crew was dispatched to perform a long-line rescue, hoisting both individuals to safety from the rocky shoreline. Officials noted that the area is known for its hazards and advised visitors to check tide charts and carry reliable communication devices, as many parts of the coastline lack cell service.</p>

          <p>Australia will acquire 11 advanced warships from Japan in a landmark defense agreement valued at approximately $6.5 billion. The deal will see Mitsubishi Heavy Industries supply its Mogami-class frigates, which are described as next-generation stealth vessels with long-range missile capabilities. This marks Japan's first major warship export since before World War II and signifies a tightening strategic partnership between the two nations in the Indo-Pacific. The acquisition is part of Australia's broader military restructuring aimed at enhancing long-range strike capabilities in response to China's military expansion in the region.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) will pay $1.7 million to settle a lawsuit from 45 California counties alleging the company improperly disposed of hazardous materials. The lawsuit, stemming from a multi-year investigation, claimed that UPS discarded corrosive, ignitable, and toxic waste into regular trash bins, which were then sent to landfills not equipped to handle such materials. As part of the settlement, UPS has implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs across its California facilities. The settlement includes civil penalties, cost reimbursement, and funding for environmental projects.</p>

          <p>It is currently peak mating season for tarantulas in California, leading to increased sightings of the large, fuzzy spiders as males leave their burrows in search of mates. Experts note that while tarantulas are often feared, the species native to the U.S. are generally harmless to humans unless provoked and possess a venom that is not considered a serious threat. The season, which can last from August to December, makes the spiders more visible in chaparral, deserts, and mountain areas, particularly at dusk. Officials recommend that people admire them from a distance and avoid handling them to prevent skin irritation from their defensive hairs.</p>

Cloobeck, a conservative Democrat and philanthropist, made his fortune in the real estate and hospitality industries.

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley has declined an invitation to serve on President Trump's revitalized council on sports, fitness, and nutrition. Barkley stated that due to his busy schedule, he and his family felt it was in his best interest not to accept the position on the council. The council was re-established as part of a recent executive order that also brought back the Presidential Fitness Test for American children. Barkley, who has previously golfed with both Trump and Barack Obama, emphasized that he respects the office of the presidency but was surprised to be considered for the role.</p>

          <p>The remains of an auroch, an extinct species of large wild cattle from the Bronze Age, have been discovered by archaeologists in a cave system near Ingleborough in the Yorkshire Dales. The discovery was part of a broader project surveying caves and sinkholes, which also uncovered evidence of the area being used for human burials during the Neolithic period. This project, a partnership between researchers and experienced local cavers, is shedding new light on the prehistoric farming and rituals of people who lived in the region. The findings highlight the long history of human interaction with the landscape.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged over 20% after President Trump praised the retailer's new advertising campaign starring actress Sydney Sweeney. In a social media post, Trump endorsed the ad, which had faced some online criticism, and called Sweeney a "registered Republican." The campaign's controversial wordplay on "genes" and "jeans" had sparked debate, but the president's endorsement appeared to trigger a rally in the company's stock. This event follows a period of financial difficulty for the retailer, which recently withdrew its full-year guidance due to slow sales and challenging market conditions.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society indicates that increased colorectal cancer screenings among people aged 45 to 49 are leading to more diagnoses at an earlier, more treatable stage. Following recommendations to lower the screening age from 50 to 45, screening rates in this age group rose by 62% from 2019 to 2023. This correlated with a significant jump in the detection of early-stage cancers. While researchers find the trend promising, they caution that screening rates for this younger demographic remain suboptimal and inequitable, highlighting the need for continued public health efforts.</p>

Cramer suggests that the financial strength, diverse revenue streams, and tight expense management of these tech giants make them resilient and a driving force in the current market.

Emma Ambler has campaigned for reform since her family was killed in 2020 by her sister's partner, who had lied on his shotgun application. The new rules, effective August 5th, increase the number of references required for an application and mandate that police investigate an applicant's domestic situation for signs of abuse. Ambler stated the changes are a meaningful step and show that the voices of victims' families have been heard.</p>

A significant portion of these savings came from a successful lawsuit that blocked an attempt to freeze trillions in federal funding.

The guidance emphasizes that weight management is a long-term process and suggests patients need a plan that includes healthy eating, physical activity, and behavioral support to maintain their weight loss.
