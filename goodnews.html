          <p>The United Arab Emirates National Guard rescued the crew of an oil tanker, Adalynn, after it collided with another ship, Front Eagle, in the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil gateway. British maritime security firm Ambrey reported that the collision was not security-related, and Frontline, the shipping company managing Front Eagle, described it as a navigational incident unrelated to the Israel-Iran conflict. Concerns have grown about potential disruptions to the Strait of Hormuz, a key passage for about a fifth of the world's oil, amid escalating regional hostilities. Frontline had previously declined new contracts to sail into the Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz due to the deteriorating situation.</p>

          <p>Bullet train services between Tokyo and northeastern Japan were suspended for several hours on Tuesday due to a non-operational train halting between stations. The train, which departed from Ueno Station in Tokyo, stopped in Tochigi Prefecture due to a malfunction. Passengers on one of the stopped trains were transferred to another train using a gangplank, while the other train returned to Utsunomiya Station. The incident caused delays and disruptions for travelers on the Tohoku Shinkansen Line.</p>
