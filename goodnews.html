          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details six exercises recommended by foot care experts to alleviate sore and achy feet, emphasizing that strengthening foot muscles can reduce pain and prevent injuries. The exercises include foot doming, wall stretches, toe spreads, toe yoga, calf raises, and a foot massage technique. Foot doming targets the "foot core" to stabilize the foot, while wall stretches increase blood flow and relieve pain, especially for plantar fasciitis. Toe spreads improve flexibility and motor control, toe yoga enhances balance, calf raises strengthen stabilizing muscles, and the foot massage helps loosen tension. These exercises, practiced regularly, can improve overall foot health and prevent future problems.</p>

          <p>Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka was excluded from England's squad for the World Cup qualifier against Andorra. Head coach Thomas Tuchel indicated that Saka had only participated in one full training session during the week, suggesting his absence is related to fitness concerns. Additionally, Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins was also left out and returned home due to a minor injury, while the reason for Conor Gallagher's omission remains unclear. Saka, who has 43 caps for England, missed three months of action earlier in the year due to a hamstring injury and his participation in the friendly against Senegal is uncertain.</p>

Postecoglou was dismissed shortly after winning the Europa League final, ending the club's 17-year trophy drought, despite finishing 17th in the Premier League. Son expressed gratitude for Postecoglou's belief in the team and his trust in him as captain, stating that he is a better player and person because of him. Other players, including Vicario, Micky van de Ven, and Dominic Solanke, also paid tribute to Postecoglou. The Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust acknowledged the vast majority of fans will "love Ange forever," while calling for his replacement to be fully supported by the board.</p>

          <p>Certain Wall Street analysts predict substantial gains for Amazon and Alphabet stocks in the next 12 months, potentially reaching a market value of $3 trillion or more. Amazon is seen as a triple threat with strong positions in e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing, while Alphabet leads in digital advertising and is gaining cloud service market share. However, Alphabet faces antitrust lawsuits that could force a breakup. Amazon is leveraging AI to improve productivity and efficiency across its retail business and Amazon Web Services (AWS) is well positioned to capitalize on growing demand for AI infrastructure (not investment advice).</p>

While a shift towards China is anticipated, continuity in trilateral military cooperation with the US and Japan is also expected.
