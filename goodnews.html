          <p>Following negotiations, Israel and Hamas have reportedly approved the initial phase of a U.S.-brokered peace plan to end the two-year conflict. This first stage involves an Israeli military withdrawal to an agreed-upon line, controlling about 53% of the Gaza Strip. In exchange, Hamas is set to release all 20 remaining living hostages, followed by the return of deceased hostages' bodies. The agreement also includes the release of numerous Palestinian prisoners and a significant increase in humanitarian aid to the famine-stricken region, monitored by a multinational force.</p>

          <p>As the Norwegian Nobel Committee prepares to announce the 2025 Peace Prize winner, Donald Trump is a significant contender due to his role in brokering the recent Gaza ceasefire agreement. Trump has publicly asserted that he deserves the award for resolving numerous global conflicts, with the Israel-Hamas deal being the most prominent. The Nobel committee maintains secrecy over its 338 nominations, but Trump's high-profile diplomatic efforts have fueled widespread speculation. The winner will be announced in Oslo, receiving a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney has responded to comments from his ex-teammate Steven Gerrard, who recently described their "golden generation" squad as being full of "egotistical losers." Speaking on his podcast, Rooney disagreed with the characterization, stating that while the team had big personalities, they worked hard and simply "didn't quite manage to get over the line" in major tournaments. He suggested that the current generation of players benefits from a different social dynamic and better media relations, rather than a superior attitude. Rooney emphasized that despite club rivalries, the players were united in their efforts for the national team.</p>

This move positions Plaid Cymru as a primary contender in the next Senedd election, aiming to capture votes from those seeking change. The party is also framing itself as the main alternative to the rising popularity of Nigel Farage's Reform UK party in the region.</p>

          <p>Amid a growing crisis where one in 50 Londoners is homeless, councils across the city will receive a £36.5 million funding boost to support prevention and relief efforts this winter. This allocation is the largest share of an £84 million national fund and will target rough sleeping, support for families in temporary accommodation, and drug and alcohol treatment programs. London Councils and Mayor Sadiq Khan have welcomed the investment as critical, though homelessness charities emphasize the need for a long-term strategy. The funding announcement comes as new data reveals a record number of deaths among the UK's homeless population in 2024.</p>

          <p>A woman whose body was found on a beach in the Netherlands in 2004 has been identified as Eva Maria Pommer, a 35-year-old German citizen. Her identification is the fourth successful case solved through Operation Identify Me, an international police campaign using public appeals and data sharing to name unidentified deceased women. The breakthrough came after a tip was received following a television appeal in Germany. While the cause of death remains unexplained and under investigation, solving the mystery of her identity provides a crucial step forward after two decades.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of scientists from China and Spain has discovered a new method for generating electricity by adding salt to ice and then subjecting it to non-uniform strain, such as bending. This process, known as flexoelectricity, produces an electrical response comparable to that of specialized ceramic materials. The researchers have successfully fabricated devices using this saline ice, demonstrating its potential as a low-cost, clean energy source in cold environments. This finding builds upon the team's previous research, which first established the power-generating potential of pure ice through the same principle.</p>

          <p>A judge has dismissed a defamation lawsuit filed by Drake against Universal Music Group concerning the Kendrick Lamar diss track "Not Like Us." The judge ruled that Lamar's lyrics, which accused Drake of serious misconduct, constituted "nonactionable opinion" within the context of a highly publicized rap battle. The ruling noted that a reasonable listener would not interpret the incendiary language as verifiable facts. Drake had sued the record label, which represents both artists, for allowing the song's publication, but his spokesperson has indicated plans to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>China's top economic planning agency and market regulator have jointly issued new guidelines to address "disorderly price competition" in key industries. The policy aims to prevent destructive price wars that can harm industry development, innovation, and product quality. Under the new measures, authorities will guide industry associations in evaluating average production costs to help companies set reasonable prices. Regulators are now empowered to issue warnings, conduct cost investigations, and intervene directly when they suspect harmful price-cutting practices are occurring.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have clinched their spot in the National League Championship Series after a dramatic 2-1 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies in an 11-inning game. The game-winning run was scored on a bizarre play where Phillies' reliever Orion Kerkering fumbled a ground ball and then made an errant throw home with the bases loaded. The tense game featured a strong pitching duel, with Dodgers' starter Tyler Glasnow throwing six scoreless innings. This victory in the best-of-five series allows the Dodgers to advance and continue their pursuit of a second consecutive World Series title.</p>
