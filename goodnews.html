        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a ruling in the landmark antitrust case against Google, allowing the company to retain ownership of its Chrome browser. However, the decision prohibits Google from entering into exclusive contracts that make its search engine the default choice on devices and browsers, a practice that has included multi-billion dollar payments to Apple. The ruling also mandates that Google share some of its search data with competitors, though it stops short of the full divestiture sought by the Department of Justice. Google has announced its intention to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin experienced a modest increase, reclaiming the $110,000 level, while the broader stock market faced a downturn and gold surged to a new record high above $3,500. The market divergence was influenced by concerns over President Trump's global tariffs and expectations of a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut. Analysts suggest that while both assets benefit from safe-haven demand, Bitcoin's performance has also been affected by a recent investor rotation into other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. The differing movements highlight a market seeking both safety in traditional assets and yield in digital ones. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Howard Webb, chief of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), has publicly acknowledged that the decision to disallow a goal by Fulham's Josh King during their match against Chelsea was incorrect. The goal was overturned after a lengthy VAR review identified a minor foul in the build-up, a decision Fulham's manager called "unbelievable." Webb stated that such interventions should only occur for clear and obvious errors, and this incident did not meet that high threshold. The official who acted as the VAR for the match was subsequently stood down from his next appointment.</p>

          <p>The rapper Drake has placed a $300,000 bet on world number one Jannik Sinner to win the US Open, a wager that would yield a return of $507,000. This move challenges the so-called "Drake Curse," a popular narrative suggesting that athletes and teams he supports often suffer unexpected losses. Drake's history of high-stakes sports betting has seen mixed results, including a previous loss when betting against Sinner in the 2024 US Open final. His wagers have become a recurring cultural subplot during major sporting events, drawing significant attention regardless of the outcome.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals facing significant credit card debt, such as a $20,000 balance, several strategic approaches can facilitate repayment. Options include working with a debt relief company for management or settlement programs, which can help negotiate lower interest rates. Another method is obtaining a debt consolidation loan to combine multiple balances into a single, often lower-interest payment. Additionally, disciplined payment strategies like the "debt avalanche" or "debt snowball" methods, alongside budget cuts and earning extra income through a side hustle, can accelerate the process of becoming debt-free.

          <p>Contrary to prevalent narratives of rampant gun violence, recent data indicates a significant decrease in violent crime in Chicago, with robberies down by a third compared to last year. The city is reportedly on track for its lowest murder rate in over a decade. While President Trump has characterized the city as a "killing field," the article suggests that violence is highly concentrated in specific neighborhoods, leaving tourist areas largely safe. The report notes that while crime remains a concern for visitors, the nature of it may be shifting from violent offenses to street theft.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from using military personnel for domestic law enforcement activities in California, ruling that the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act. The law restricts the use of the military for civilian law enforcement. The case specifically concerned the deployment of National Guard and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles earlier in the year. The judge noted that President Trump's stated desire to send troops to other cities supported the need for the injunction, which currently applies only to California. The White House criticized the ruling and is expected to appeal.</p>

          <p>A fact-check addresses several claims surrounding the trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is accused of attempting a coup d'état following his election loss. The analysis concludes it is misleading to claim the trial's purpose is to disqualify him from politics, as he is already barred from running in 2026 due to prior convictions. It also finds claims of judicial abuse by a Supreme Court justice to be misleading, noting that while some legal experts have raised procedural questions, the court has not been found to have exceeded its powers.

One approach is working with a tax debt relief service, which can negotiate a more manageable repayment plan on the taxpayer's behalf. Other avenues include applying for an "offer in compromise" to settle for less than the full amount owed in cases of financial hardship, or arranging an installment agreement for monthly payments. In certain circumstances, the IRS may also grant a temporary delay in collection or an abatement of penalties. (not investment advice)</p>
