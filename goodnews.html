Press, 36, shared the news, expressing a mix of relief, joy, and grief as she concludes a career marked by significant club play in the US and Sweden, and a stint with Manchester United. Her later career was affected by mental health breaks and an ACL injury requiring multiple surgeries, but her comeback with Angel City FC was widely seen as inspiring. The article notes her transition to off-field ventures, including a popular podcast with her wife and former teammate Tobin Heath.</p>

          <p>Jewish mourning rituals primarily focus on eternal memory among the living, with less emphasis on an afterlife. The article explains that burial, a mitzvah, must occur as quickly as possible, though not on the Sabbath or major holidays. Practices include a ritual bath (Taharah), burial in a simple wooden casket or shroud without worldly belongings, and no public viewing. Mourners observe K'riah, tearing clothing as an expression of pain, and a seven-day shiva period of intense mourning, refraining from work and grooming. The Mourner's Kaddish, an ancient Aramaic prayer, is recited communally to exalt God and honor the deceased's memory.</p>

          <p>Raila Odinga, former Kenyan Prime Minister and a towering figure in the nation's politics, has died at 80 in India following a cardiac arrest. President William Ruto honored Odinga as a "beacon of courage" and "father of our democracy," declaring a seven-day mourning period and a state funeral. Odinga, who ran unsuccessfully for president five times, was instrumental in Kenya's multi-party democracy, often reconciling with incumbent presidents after contentious elections, including a power-sharing agreement following the 2007 post-election violence. The article notes his legacy as a symbol of resistance and political reform, inspiring a passionate following.</p>

          <p>In the current elevated interest rate environment, home equity loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) offer homeowners an affordable borrowing option, with rates significantly lower than personal loans or credit cards. As of October 10, 2025, average home equity loan rates range from 8.15% to 8.30% for various terms, while HELOCs average 7.84%. These rates are poised to decline further with potential federal funds rate cuts in late 2025. Both options utilize home equity as collateral and may offer tax benefits for IRS-eligible home repairs. However, the article cautions that homeowners must carefully choose the right product due to the risk of foreclosure if payments are not met. (not investment advice)</p>
