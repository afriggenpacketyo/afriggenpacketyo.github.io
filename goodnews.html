          <p>Kohl's shares surged over 20% after the retailer significantly surpassed Wall Street's fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations, even as its overall sales experienced a decline. The company adjusted its full-year sales guidance to reflect the higher end of its previous range and revised its earnings per share outlook upwards, indicating progress on its 2025 strategic initiatives. Interim CEO Michael Bender attributed the positive results to reduced inventory, lowered expenses, and better customer engagement, while the company continues to implement strategies like expanding specific departments and integrating Sephora shops. This unexpected financial performance provides a much-needed boost amidst recent leadership turmoil and a period of declining annual revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As of August 26, 2025, the price of gold is $3,374.77 per ounce, a valuation that constantly fluctuates due to various market dynamics. This article highlights gold's long-standing appeal as both a currency and an investment, especially during times of economic or market uncertainty, serving as a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge. Numerous factors impact its spot price, including the fundamental principles of supply and demand, prevailing global economic conditions, and the rate of inflation. Additionally, interest rates, geopolitical instability, and the strength of the U.S. dollar significantly influence gold's value, alongside central bank policies and broader market sentiment.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With UK energy prices set to increase again in October, this article outlines four practical methods for households to manage rising bills. It advises considering fixed-rate energy deals, which could be significantly cheaper than variable rates, while also cautioning about potential exit fees. Other recommendations include paying by direct debit for better rates, checking eligibility for various financial support schemes like the Warm Home Discount, and actively reducing energy consumption through measures like turning down boiler flow rates or using energy-efficient appliances. These steps aim to mitigate the impact of the impending price cap increase and help consumers save money. </p>

          <p>Argentine police raided a villa in Mar del Plata following the discovery of a 17th-century Italian portrait, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Vittore Ghislandi, in a real estate advertisement. The painting is believed to have been looted 80 years ago from Dutch Jewish art dealer Jacques Goudstikker by Friedrich Kadgien, a Nazi officer who fled to Argentina after World War II. While the painting was not found during the raid, other potentially relevant items were seized, and an investigation into concealment and smuggling has begun. This incident reopens a painful chapter in Argentina's history of sheltering Nazis and highlights ongoing efforts for art restitution. </p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully completed a critical test flight of its Starship rocket, the world's largest and most powerful, marking a significant turnaround after a series of previous failures. The 60-minute flight from Texas saw all 33 booster engines ignite and the booster separate as planned, despite some fiery and erratic flap movements during descent. This achievement is a crucial step towards SpaceX's goal of a fully reusable transport system for Moon and Mars missions, and is vital for NASA's Artemis program, which plans to use Starship to send humans to the Moon by 2027.

          <h2>US and China Race to Develop Game-Changing Rotating Detonation Engine Technology</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Rotating Detonation Engine (RDE) program, a collaboration between RTX Technology Research Centre and Pratt & Whitney, has advanced into practical validation after a decade of development, aiming for future flight tests and integration into weapon systems. First proposed in the 1950s, RDEs achieve highly efficient energy conversion through a sustained, high-speed rotating detonation wave within their combustion chamber. This innovative design eliminates complex mechanical components, resulting in a more compact, lightweight, and efficient engine with higher peak pressure, making it a potentially "game-changing" technology in aerospace and defense, with both the US and China actively pursuing its development. </p>

          <p>After an exceptional rise earlier in the year, gold prices are currently in a holding pattern, trading between $3180 and $3440 per ounce, with experts predicting potential increases for fall 2025. This article suggests that a key catalyst for higher prices could be a Federal Reserve interest rate cut, as lower rates typically boost demand for gold. Geopolitical uncertainty and continued central bank buying are also cited as factors that could push gold towards a "bull case" of $4,000 per ounce by year-end, with J.P. Morgan Research anticipating $3,675. Conversely, a strengthening economy, cooling inflation, or a stronger dollar could lead to a "bear case" of $3,200. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel faced significant public backlash and a nearly $100 million dip in market value after unveiling a new logo that removed the iconic "Uncle Herschel" figure and the namesake barrel. Following widespread criticism, including a public appeal from President Trump, the company quickly decided to scrap the redesign and revert to its original, beloved "Old Timer" logo. Branding experts criticized the initial move for severing the company's design from its folksy, "homestyle country cooking" roots, which resonated deeply with loyal customers. This incident highlights the perils of rebranding for legacy companies, especially when it disregards strong emotional connections to existing brand identity. </p>

          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch experienced a slowdown in sales growth for its namesake brand, which fell 5% in the fiscal second quarter, but its teen-focused Hollister brand surged with 19% growth, leading to an overall 7% increase in company sales. The retailer narrowly beat Wall Street's expectations and raised its full-year revenue outlook, anticipating 5% to 7% growth. However, the company also tightened its full-year earnings outlook due to a nearly doubled estimate for net tariff costs, now at $90 million, primarily from key manufacturing regions in Asia. Despite the slowdown at Abercrombie, the company is pursuing growth through new categories and partnerships, including becoming the NFL's first "official fashion partner." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pop superstar Taylor Swift and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce have officially announced their engagement, sharing photos of the ring and a romantic garden photoshoot. The couple, who began dating in 2023 after Kelce's public attempt to meet Swift at her Eras Tour, confirmed the news via a joint Instagram post, playfully captioned, "Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married." Kelce's father revealed the proposal occurred about two weeks prior. This announcement follows Swift's recent revelation of her upcoming 12th studio album, "The Life of a Showgirl," which she discussed on Kelce's podcast, attributing their relationship to his initial public overture. </p>

          <p>Mortgage demand remained largely unchanged last week, with total application volume falling slightly by 0.5%, as interest rates also held steady. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages saw a minimal increase to 6.69%. While applications to refinance home loans decreased, purchase applications rose by 2%, marking the strongest week for purchase demand in a month, albeit from a low base. This small gain suggests prospective buyers are becoming less sensitive to current rates, bolstered by more inventory and cooling home-price growth. Mortgage rates have not reacted to President Trump's recent firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, indicating market stability despite political turmoil. (not investment advice)</p>

Bain Capital is reportedly awaiting further offers before making a decision. This development, if successful, would represent a significant return for Bain Capital, which took control in 2013, despite the company's current valuation being well below its 2018 peak.

The index, which measures bidding dynamics, showed stabilization as property fundamentals hold up and asset valuations remain firm. Institutional investors are returning to the market with increased capital and appetite, particularly in the "living" sector (multifamily, senior living, student housing), and retail. While industrial lags, office bid dynamics are improving. This suggests investors are adapting to current uncertainties, accepting higher risk, and anticipating gradual recovery and growth in capital flows through the second half of the year.
