          <p>Anduril, a defense technology company, has topped the 2025 CNBC Disruptor 50 list, reflecting a surge in interest and investment in the defense tech sector. This marks the first time a defense tech company has led the list, with other companies like Flock Safety, Saronic Technologies, and Shield AI also featured. These four companies have a combined value exceeding $45 billion and have raised nearly $10 billion from investors, indicating significant growth and diversification in the sector. The rise in defense tech is fueled by increased defense spending and a focus on modernizing military capabilities, with companies also exploring dual-use technologies. </p>

          <p>A federal judge in California ruled that the Trump administration cannot enforce executive orders requiring groups to halt diversity, equity, and inclusion programs or acknowledge transgender people to receive grant funding. Judge Jon Tigar stated that pro-LGBTQ nonprofits demonstrated a likelihood of success in challenging the executive orders, arguing they violate the Constitution. The judge emphasized that the executive branch cannot weaponize Congressionally appropriated funds to single out protected communities or suppress disfavored ideas. This ruling will remain in effect during the legal case, though government lawyers are expected to appeal.</p>

          <p>Wildlife experts are warning that dirty hummingbird feeders can be harmful or even deadly to hummingbirds, turning a lifeline into a trap. If sugar water is left out too long, it spoils and attracts harmful microbes that can cause infections, including candida, leading to swollen tongues and starvation. The solution is to regularly clean feeders every two to three days with hot water or a vinegar and water mixture. By maintaining clean feeders and using the right sugar-water recipe, people can provide a valuable food source for hummingbirds.</p>

Miliband stated the change would cost a relatively small amount and be accounted for in the Budget.
