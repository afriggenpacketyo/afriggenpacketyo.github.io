The technology giant also issued an optimistic forecast for the upcoming fiscal year, projecting revenue to land between $59 billion and $60 billion. Despite operating within a complex global economic environment, Cisco reported particularly strong performance in its core networking division. Furthermore, the company noted substantial growth in its AI infrastructure orders, which have already totaled over $2 billion for the fiscal year, reinforcing management's confidence that artificial intelligence is a durable, long-term trend.

This move comes amid increased pressure from the Trump administration for Mexico to crack down on the powerful criminal networks responsible for smuggling fentanyl and other illicit drugs into America.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Rams are now valued at an estimated $10.43 billion, making them the second most valuable franchise in the National Football League, behind only the Dallas Cowboys. This marks a dramatic financial turnaround from a decade ago when the team, then based in St. Louis, was ranked last in the league with a valuation of just $930 million. The incredible surge in value is largely attributed to the team's strategic move back to Los Angeles and the construction of the multi-billion dollar, state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium in Inglewood. The valuation reflects the successful monetization of the venue and the team's strong fan base.</p>

          <p>Juneau, Alaska, has been hit with record-breaking flooding after a glacial dam outburst from the nearby Mendenhall Glacier released a massive surge of water. The Mendenhall River crested at an unprecedented 16.65 feet, surpassing last year's record and causing authorities to issue evacuation warnings for low-lying areas. The flooding is an annual event caused by the climate-change-driven retreat of a smaller glacier, which leaves a basin that fills with meltwater and eventually bursts. This year, officials closed the Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area and delayed the start of public school, though newly installed temporary barriers helped prevent widespread home damage.</p>

          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining approximately 2%, even as some of the market's largest technology companies saw declines. This market rotation appears to be driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates at its September policy meeting. Lower interest rates are particularly beneficial for smaller companies, as they reduce borrowing costs and can potentially stimulate broader consumer spending. Despite the strong daily performance, small-cap stocks have still significantly underperformed their large-cap counterparts since the AI-driven market boom began in late 2022.

          <p>This personal essay reflects on the emotional experience of a pet owner whose dog, Odie, required urgent emergency surgery after swallowing an object that caused a gastric obstruction. The author, who is an oncologist, praises the entire veterinary staff for their professionalism, clear communication, and deep compassion regarding both the complex medical options and the significant financial costs involved. The article highlights how the staff skillfully treated both the anxious owner and the sick pet with tailored empathy, a quality the author feels is sometimes lacking in human medicine. The experience reinforces the view that veterinarians are unsung heroes of healthcare.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has revealed for the first time that he was diagnosed with Stage 4 melanoma in 2010 and subsequently overcame the advanced cancer. Jones, now 82, stated that he was "saved by a fabulous treatment" which involved an experimental trial drug known as PD-1 inhibitor therapy, a treatment that helps the body's own immune system attack cancer cells. Over the following decade, he underwent multiple surgeries on his lungs and lymph nodes as part of his comprehensive treatment. He now reports that he is free of tumors, sharing his personal story of survival.</p>
