        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from China and Britain has discovered that the far side of the moon may be colder than its near side. This finding is based on the analysis of the first-ever rock samples returned from the lunar far side by China's Chang'e-6 mission. The research, published in Nature Geoscience, indicates that minerals from the far side formed in interior lava temperatures approximately 100 degrees Celsius lower than those on the near side, providing new insights into the moon's asymmetrical evolution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by Italian researchers proposes a surprising origin for one of Venice's most famous symbols, the bronze statue of the winged Lion of St. Mark. The research suggests the statue may have begun as a mythical tomb guardian beast, known as a zhenmushou, during China's Tang dynasty over a thousand years ago. The theory is supported by stylistic comparisons and lead isotope analysis that traces the statue's copper to ore sources in China, with researchers even positing it was transported by Marco Polo's family.</p>

          <p>The turbulent life of pioneering mixed martial arts champion Mark Kerr is the focus of a new biographical film, "The Smashing Machine," with Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson portraying the fighter.

          <p>Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi as its new leader, positioning her to become the country's first female prime minister. Takaichi, a staunch conservative and a protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, is known for her hawkish security policies and her support for his "Abenomics" fiscal strategy. While her election marks a historic milestone for gender representation in Japanese politics, her conservative social stances, such as opposing same-sex marriage, have alienated some voters, particularly women.</p>
