          <p>Nine veterans with PTSD traveled to Mexico for a psychedelic retreat organized by the Heroic Hearts Project, seeking relief from their invisible wounds. The retreat involved ceremonies with psilocybin and 5-MeO-DMT, led by traditional healers, to help the veterans revisit traumatic moments. While one veteran experienced a decline in mental health, eight others reported improved symptoms and called the experience "life-changing". The Veterans Administration is now conducting clinical trials using MDMA and psilocybin to treat PTSD, depression, and addiction, with promising early results.
