          <p>Nine Democratic candidates for New York City mayor engaged in their first debate, addressing key issues such as housing affordability, crime, and their approach to the Trump administration if elected. Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Queens Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani clashed over their records and campaign funding, with Cuomo defending his handling of nursing home deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic. Candidates also criticized current Mayor Eric Adams, and the debate highlighted the use of ranked-choice voting in the upcoming primary election. The optimism score is based on the democratic process and the candidates' engagement with important issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Washington Department of Natural Resources used a firefighting helicopter to remove abandoned boats from an uninhabited island in Puget Sound, hauling them to the mainland for deconstruction. This was the agency's largest operation of its kind, with 14 vessels removed, and the use of a helicopter was chosen to minimize disruption to the marine environment. The boat removal program has hauled out over 1,200 derelict vessels since 2002, addressing the challenge of people dumping old boats into the water. The optimism score is based on the positive environmental impact of the boat removal.</p>

          <p>Palisades Charter High School held its graduation ceremony at the Hollywood Bowl after a fire damaged their high school earlier in the year.

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found in Burmese amber has provided new insights into the evolution of flight feathers, which were essential for early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. The researchers conducted a detailed structural study of feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period, and the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift was a critical feature of bird evolution. Scientists believe that most feathered dinosaurs did not have the same ability to fly, though some species could glide or have powered flight. The optimism score is based on the scientific advancement and understanding of evolution.</p>

          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria our bodies encounter after birth may protect against dangerous infections, with Bifidobacterium longum showing a protective effect against lung infections in young children. The study, which analyzed stool samples from over 1,000 newborns, found that babies with this species were less likely to be hospitalized with lung infections. Researchers believe this early encounter with microbes is crucial for immune system development and are exploring therapies to boost good bacteria in babies. The optimism score reflects the potential for new therapies and improved health outcomes for children.</p>

          <p>A judge has granted a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp., halting restart efforts on an offshore oil operation along Santa Barbara County‚Äôs coastline due to environmental concerns. The operation's onshore pipeline system suffered a major rupture and spill in 2015, and the court's order will remain in effect through at least July 18. Environmental groups and plaintiffs argued that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without environmental review or public process.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review the latest data on mifepristone, a drug commonly used for medication abortions. The review aims to closely monitor the drug's safety, but experts say concerns about its safety are misguided and fueled by a report from an advocacy group. Mifepristone was first approved by the FDA in 2000 after a thorough review determined it was safe and effective, and periodic reviews since its approval have not found new safety concerns. The optimism score is based on the fact that the FDA has previously determined the drug to be safe and effective.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drug safety experts are advising women using weight-loss jabs to stop if they are trying for a baby, have fallen pregnant, or are breastfeeding, due to unknown risks to unborn babies. The advice already appears in patient information leaflets, but there are concerns that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using the drugs safely or getting the right advice. The UK drugs regulator is worried that popular GLP-1 medicines are not being used safely, and these prescription medicines are only available on the NHS to people with a very high BMI. The optimism score reflects the importance of safety precautions and responsible use of medication.</p>
