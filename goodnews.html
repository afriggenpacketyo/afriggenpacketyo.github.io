The deal retains a 10% tariff, generating $6 billion for the U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick highlighted the deal's benefits, while U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized its role in boosting trade and creating jobs. Britain reported the deal will cut tariffs on U.K. cars from 27.5% to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum, setting a quota of 100,000 U.K. vehicles imported to the U.S. at a 10% tariff.

          <p>President Trump appointed Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, replacing Ed Martin, whose nomination was dropped due to criticism over his support for Jan. 6 Capitol riot defendants. Trump praised Pirro as highly qualified and one of the top District Attorneys in New York's history. Pirro, a staunch Trump supporter, was previously the district attorney for Westchester County, New York, and her ex-husband received a pardon from Trump during his first term. The appointment follows Senator Thom Tillis's opposition to Martin's nomination, leading Trump to seek an alternative candidate.</p>

          <p>Federal judges ruled that Alabama intentionally diluted the voting strength of Black residents by drawing congressional lines that flouted previous court directives. The state must continue using a court-ordered map that led to the election of Alabama's second Black congressman. The judges found that the 2023 map violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by consigning Black voting strength to a single majority-Black district. This decision follows a February trial and previous rulings against the state's maps. The plaintiffs celebrated the decision as a victory for Black voters, while Alabama is expected to appeal.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer can claim a limited win with the new trade deal with America, although it primarily mitigates recent tariff increases rather than establishing a deep free trade agreement. The deal addresses tariffs imposed on the British car industry, providing relief for companies like Jaguar Land Rover. While opponents criticize the deal as overclaimed, it avoids diluting the UK's Digital Services Tax and sensitive issues like the NHS or food standards. The agreement was expedited by American power under President Trump, and ongoing discussions aim to further reduce tariffs. Industries will analyze the specifics to determine the deal's implications, but Starmer views it as positive news amidst international and domestic challenges.</p>
