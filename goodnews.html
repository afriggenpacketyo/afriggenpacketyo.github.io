          <p>The UK government has announced new plans to encourage savers to move money from low-interest accounts into stocks and shares. Under the proposal, banks would proactively send investment offers to customers, supported by a government advertising campaign. The "Leeds Reforms," championed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, also include making a low-deposit mortgage scheme for first-time buyers permanent. While aimed at boosting the UK economy and providing better returns for savers, concerns have been raised about potential risks for inexperienced investors and the possibility of increased fraud.

          <p>Alphabet's Google has announced a significant $25 billion investment over the next two years in data centers and artificial intelligence infrastructure. The investment will span states covered by the PJM Interconnection, the largest electric grid in the United States. As part of this initiative, Google will also invest $3 billion to modernize two hydropower plants in Pennsylvania to support the increasing energy demands of AI and data centers. This move comes as the PJM grid, which includes the world's largest data center market in northern Virginia, faces challenges in meeting rising electricity consumption.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to encourage marriage and address declining birth rates, the central Chinese province of Hubei has increased its paid marriage leave to 15 days. This policy is the latest among various local government incentives designed to foster a more "family-friendly society." The move comes as China faces a steep decline in marriage registrations, which have fallen to their lowest level since record-keeping began in 1978. Despite such initiatives, many young couples still view the high costs associated with weddings and bride prices as a significant barrier to marriage.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 2018, the total distance driven by cars in Germany has increased, rising by 3 billion kilometers in 2024 to a total of 594 billion. This reversal of a five-year downward trend is attributed to a higher number of registered vehicles, as the average distance driven per car actually continued its decade-long decline. The vast majority of kilometers were covered by gasoline and diesel vehicles. In separate news, Germany's Constitutional Court dismissed a lawsuit concerning the use of the Ramstein Air Base for U.S. drone missions, ruling Germany has no clear duty of care.</p>

Although the risk is currently low in southeastern Colorado, the app provides crucial, real-time safety information for those traveling to other parts of the state, especially drought-stricken areas on the Western Slope. The app consolidates data from 236 land managers, covering over 45,000 miles of trails, and includes alerts from trusted sources like the National Interagency Fire Center.

          <p>New government guidance for schools in England will require that sex and relationships education includes lessons on identifying and acting against misogyny. The updated curriculum aims to teach pupils how to recognize positive male role models and resist harmful online influences, such as those from "incel" culture or certain influencers. While previous plans for strict age limits on topics have been dropped, the guidance will outline what is appropriate for primary versus secondary students. The changes, which also emphasize proactive engagement with parents, will be fully implemented by September 2026 to address contemporary issues like AI-generated imagery and online safety.</p>

          <p>A nine-year-old boy in Minnesota has made a remarkable recovery after a freak accident sent an arrow through his brain, nearly exiting the back of his skull. The boy, Gus, was helping his father pack for a hunting trip when he slipped on ice and fell face-first onto the arrow. After he pulled it out himself, scans revealed the arrow had passed through the middle of his brain, an injury doctors considered would typically be fatal. The medical director at Children's Minnesota hospital described the case as unprecedented in his 28-year career, with the boy showing no ill effects months later.</p>

          <p>Amid new geopolitical realities, including the war in Ukraine and a potential shift in U.S. foreign policy, France is positioned to play a pivotal role in Europe's push for defense autonomy. French President Emmanuel Macron has long advocated for "strategic autonomy" and plans to double the country's defense budget between 2017 and 2027. With a robust defense industry and a maintained "war culture," France has expertise across all sectors, but faces hurdles like raw material sourcing and a need for more skilled engineers. Experts suggest that for Europe's rearmament to succeed, France must cooperate diplomatically with partners and not act alone.</p>

Dawson's selection comes as a reward for outstanding domestic form, having been named the Professional Cricketers' Association player of the year for the last two seasons. His inclusion provides a direct replacement for Bashir and also strengthens England's lower-order batting, offering an unexpected opportunity to press his claim for a regular spot.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing a new grant scheme to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) by offering discounts of up to £3,750 on new cars. The discounts, funded by a £650 million program, will apply to eligible vehicles costing up to £37,000 and are intended to help phase out new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. While the automotive industry has welcomed the move, it also emphasizes the critical need for more public charging infrastructure, as 40% of UK households lack driveways for home charging. The opposition Labour party criticized the plan as forcing families into more expensive vehicles.</p>
