          <p>Following their match at the Bad Homberg Open, tennis players Maria Sakkari and Yulia Putintseva engaged in a heated exchange. After Sakkari defeated Putintseva, Putintseva gave a cursory handshake and avoided eye contact, leading to an argument where Sakkari was heard saying, "Nobody likes you." Sakkari addressed the incident in a post-match interview, stating she doesn't expect a dinner invitation from Putintseva and emphasizing her respect for Putintseva as a player, but nothing more, as she advances to the next round with Wimbledon on her mind.</p>

In South Korea, all able-bodied men between 18 and 28 are required to perform 18 to 21 months of military service to deter aggression from North Korea.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on China to intervene and prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial global oil trade route. This appeal follows Iran's warning that it reserves the right to defend its sovereignty after U.S. airstrikes on its nuclear facilities. The potential closure of the Strait, through which 20% of global oil consumption passes, could severely impact the global economy. Rubio stated that it would be "economic suicide" for Iran and would warrant a strong response from the international community, including the U.S., which has a naval presence in the region.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the U.S. is ready to meet with Iran to pursue diplomacy after the U.S. bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites. Rubio warned Iran that closing the Strait of Hormuz would be a "suicidal" move, as it would prompt a global response. He also clarified that the U.S. mission was not an attack on Iran or its people, but rather a targeted effort to degrade nuclear weaponization ambitions. Rubio emphasized that President Trump prefers the path of diplomacy but is prepared for further action if Iran chooses another route.</p>

          <p>England captain Ben Stokes made a crucial breakthrough after Harry Brook's impressive 99 on the third day of the first Test at Headingley, claiming a wicket to leave India at 90-2 with a 96-run lead. Brook's innings, marked by outrageous strokes and dropped catches, ended when he top-edged a hook. Despite a rapid stand between Chris Woakes and Brydon Carse, England were eventually bowled out for 465, trailing by six runs. Stokes' late wicket and Carse's earlier dismissal of Yashasvi Jaiswal shifted the momentum, leaving the match finely balanced.</p>
