          <p>During his commencement address at West Point, President Trump told graduating cadets they were entering a defining moment in the Army's history, criticizing past U.S. political leaders for involving the military in questionable missions. Trump advocated for a policy of "peace through strength," asserting that adversaries would back down without the need for direct conflict. He also criticized diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, emphasizing a focus on border defense and curbing illegal immigration, while reiterating claims about stolen hypersonic missile technology and facing protests outside the academy gates.

          <p>A power outage in Cannes, France, suspected to be caused by sabotage, disrupted screenings on the final day of the Cannes Film Festival.

Despite the disruption, festival organizers ensured that the closing ceremony would proceed as planned using an alternative power supply. French authorities are investigating the incident, reminiscent of past attacks targeting moments of national pride, such as the Paris Summer Olympics.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter as it approached for landing, leading to two commercial jets aborting their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The incident occurred due to a temporary antenna placement that disrupted contact for about 20 seconds. Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers directed the "go-arounds" out of caution, as they lacked a confident fix on the helicopter's location. The Army has paused all flights into and out of the Pentagon while addressing safety concerns with the FAA.</p>

Washington demands that Iran halt all uranium enrichment and dismantle its centrifuges, while Iran insists on its right to enrich uranium at lower levels, as guaranteed by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Despite the deadlock, both sides have agreed to meet again in the near future, seeking to reshape regional and global security.</p>
