          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addressed the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, warning that China poses an "imminent" threat to Taiwan and is actively preparing for military action by 2027. He urged Asian nations to increase their defense spending and collaborate with the US to deter war, emphasizing that the US does not seek conflict but will defend its allies. China responded by accusing the US of being the "biggest troublemaker" in the region, citing US military activities in the South China Sea. Hegseth also cautioned against economic ties with China, stating Beijing would use them for leverage, and promoted a new Indo-Pacific partnership for defense industrial resilience, noting that deterrence comes at a price. The US hopes for a strong shield of deterrence forged with allies to prevent war with China.</p>

Cheaper, government-stockpiled rice is now available in Japanese stores to combat soaring prices, and the opposition chief apologized for calling the government's reserve rice "animal feed." In Seoul, a man started a fire on a subway train, leading to the evacuation of 400 passengers, and a new museum featuring Asian art has opened on Naoshima Island. The digest also notes a shift in Chinese tourism towards immersive experiences and a warning about rice scam websites targeting consumers facing high prices.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to invest ¬£1.5 billion in six new munitions and explosives factories to enhance its defense capabilities and deter adversaries. This investment, part of the government's strategic defense review, aims to support the production of 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons and create approximately 1,800 new jobs. Ministers emphasize that the increased defense spending, reaching 3% of GDP by 2034, will strengthen the armed forces and boost economic growth. The move comes in response to lessons learned from the war in Ukraine, which highlighted deficiencies in Western weapons and munitions production. </p>

          <p>Paris St-Germain achieved a historic 5-0 victory over Inter Milan to win the Champions League for the first time, marking a night of emotional significance for coach Luis Enrique. Enrique, who previously won the tournament with Barcelona in 2015, became only the sixth coach to win the Champions League with two different clubs. The match highlighted the brilliance of teenager Desire Doue, who confirmed his status as a rising superstar. The win was especially poignant for Enrique, who honored his late daughter Xana by wearing a t-shirt with her image and watching PSG's Ultras unfurl a banner depicting him and his daughter planting a PSG flag.</p>

Ministers anticipate a significant impact on youth vaping, as disposable vapes are considered a key factor in its rise. Health experts emphasize the need for further regulation to fully address youth vaping, despite vaping being substantially less harmful than smoking.

This decision, reflecting skepticism from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other Trump officials, marks a departure from previous broad vaccine recommendations. Moderna's existing vaccine remains available for anyone aged 6 months and older. The approval was based on a study comparing mNexspike to Moderna's original vaccine, which showed it to be safe and at least as effective.
