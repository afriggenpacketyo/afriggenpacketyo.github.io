          <p>Yale University is accelerating its sale of billions of dollars in private equity investments. This move comes as the private equity industry faces headwinds and increased scrutiny, especially as President Trump targets Ivy League institutions. Yale's decision to divest from private equity reflects a broader trend of institutional investors reevaluating their asset allocations in response to market conditions and regulatory pressures. This action could influence other endowments and investment firms to reassess their private equity holdings. </p>
