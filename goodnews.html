        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 4-4 deadlock due to Justice Amy Coney Barrett's recusal, upheld a lower court ruling preventing Oklahoma from establishing the nation's first taxpayer-funded religious charter school. The proposed St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School aimed to integrate Catholic teachings into its curriculum. This decision affirms that taxpayer funds cannot directly support religious schools, maintaining the separation of church and state under the First Amendment, as interpreted by the Oklahoma Supreme Court. The outcome underscores the ongoing legal and constitutional debates surrounding religious freedom and public education, particularly concerning the use of public funds for religious instruction. The court's decision leaves in place lower court rulings that said the arrangement would have violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment.</p>

          <p>The British government has accepted recommendations from pay review bodies, offering most teachers and doctors in England a 4% pay raise, which is higher than the initially budgeted 2.8%. Education unions have responded positively but cautioned that the raise may lead to budget cuts in schools unless additional funding is provided. Health unions, however, expressed anger over a smaller 3.6% rise for NHS staff, excluding doctors, with the British Medical Association planning to ballot members for possible strike action, deeming the rise "woefully inadequate". While the education department announced ¬£615m to help cover the raises, it expects schools to contribute through improved productivity and smarter spending.</p>
