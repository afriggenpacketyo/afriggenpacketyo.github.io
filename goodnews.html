          <p>The Group of Seven (G7) leaders have agreed to an action plan aimed at minimizing risks to their countries' supply chains for critical minerals, essential for modern technologies. This initiative comes at a time when China dominates the global supply of rare earth minerals, prompting the G7 to step up cooperation within the group and with like-minded countries. The plan includes monitoring for shortages, coordinating responses to market disruptions, and diversifying mining, processing, manufacturing, and recycling efforts. Six of the G7 leaders also rallied around Ukraine, emphasizing the need for maximum pressure against Russia to achieve a ceasefire. The G7 also urged China to refrain from distorting the market.</p>

          <p>California farmers and workers are experiencing confusion and uncertainty as the summer harvest season begins, due to contradictory signals from the Trump administration regarding immigration enforcement. While some federal agents have conducted raids on farms, detaining workers, there have also been reports of directives to lay off farms, hotels, and restaurants. This fluctuation has left farmers unsure of how to proceed, with many seeking guidance on protecting their workers. The agriculture industry relies heavily on undocumented labor, making the enforcement of immigration laws a significant concern for the state's economy.</p>

          <p>China is leading the world in converting decommissioned coal-mining sites into solar power projects, a trend that promises to advance the clean energy transition and potentially reduce a surplus of solar panels. According to Global Energy Monitor (GEM), 90 former coal mines in mainland China are operating as solar-power facilities, with an additional 46 projects in the planning stages. These projects could help address land-utilization issues, as the world has closed more than 6,000 coal mines since 2010, most of which were in China and the US.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met to discuss renewing cooperation after nearly two years of dispute over New Delhi's alleged involvement in the killing of a Sikh separatist.
