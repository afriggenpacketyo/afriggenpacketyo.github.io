His performance significantly altered the general classification, positioning him second overall.

          <p>With federal student loan payments resuming and significant legislative changes looming, borrowers are facing a new financial landscape. A new law is set to phase out popular income-driven repayment (IDR) plans and tighten borrowing limits, potentially making repayment more challenging. This article outlines several strategies for borrowers to make their payments more affordable now, including switching to an existing IDR plan before they are eliminated and exploring employer assistance programs. Acting proactively can provide crucial financial breathing room before the stricter rules take full effect. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AI search startup Perplexity has launched a new web browser called Comet, marking its latest move to compete with tech giants like Google. The browser, initially available to a select group of its $200-per-month "Max" subscribers, aims to integrate AI more deeply into the web browsing experience. Features include the ability to ask complex questions via voice and text and connect with enterprise applications like Slack.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has corrected a significant data error, revealing that international student enrollment actually increased by 6.5% last year, contrary to previously released figures that showed a decline. The initial data underreported the number of students by over 200,000. The revised numbers, tracked by the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), now align with other reports showing robust growth in the number of students from abroad. The correction provides a more accurate picture of the state of international education in the U.S. at a time of heightened attention on the issue.</p>

          <p>The first 24 hours of Amazon's Prime Day event saw U.S. online sales jump nearly 10% year-over-year to $7.9 billion, making it the largest single day for e-commerce this year. The sales event, which now extends over four days, has prompted rival retailers like Walmart and Target to launch their own competing promotions. According to Adobe Analytics, total online spending across all retailers is projected to reach nearly $24 billion during the event. The strong start comes amid consumer uncertainty due to inflation and unpredictable tariff policies, demonstrating the continued draw of major sales events. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>McDonald's is refreshing its menu by bringing back the fan-favorite Snack Wrap after a nine-year absence and introducing a new, limited-time Spicy Egg McMuffin. This move is part of a broader strategy to attract inflation-weary customers and boost sales, which saw a significant decline in the first quarter. The company is also emphasizing its value offerings, like the $5 meal deal, to appeal to budget-conscious consumers. Analysts see the strategy as a way for the fast-food giant to stay relevant and regain trust among its core customer base amid economic pressures.</p>

This remarkable growth is fueled by the explosive demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs), which are essential hardware for the booming generative artificial intelligence industry. The company's value has soared despite geopolitical tensions and U.S. export restrictions on chip sales to China, demonstrating its dominant market position. (not investment advice)</p>
