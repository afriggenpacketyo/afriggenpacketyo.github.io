The profit drop was attributed to a ¬£29 million fine from the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority for financial crime prevention failings, as well as issues with the Bounce Back Loan Scheme related to Covid-era business loan fraud.

          <h2>Met Police Chief Cautions Anti-Crime Pledges Require Funding</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 06:59:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The head of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Mark Rowley, has warned that more funding is necessary to meet the government's anti-crime pledges, including halving knife crime and violence against women. He emphasized that police forces are carrying the "scar tissue" of austerity cuts and are smaller relative to the population they police. The government's plan involves increasing neighborhood policing, but Sir Mark stressed that ambition and money must go together. He also suggested radical reforms in policing, including fewer policing organizations and a proper national police agency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk has voiced his disappointment with President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill, despite being a close ally of the president. Musk stated that the bill "increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it," undermining the work done by the Department of Government Efficiency. He also questioned whether a bill could be both "big" and "beautiful," referencing Trump's description of the legislation. Musk previously served as Trump's cost-cutting tsar before stepping back from the role.</p>

          <h2>GE Vernova Leads AI Industrial Trade</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 06:48:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The AI industrial trade is regaining momentum, with GE Vernova outperforming its peers. GE Vernova's shares have reached an all-time high, surpassing pre-DeepSeek levels, while other data center-linked stocks like Eaton and Vertiv have not fully recovered. Analysts attribute GE Vernova's success to being earlier in a potential revenue upcycle and having a larger backlog of customer orders. Recent deals, such as the $14.2 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia and Trump's executive order supporting the U.S. nuclear power industry, have also contributed to the stock's surge.

          <h2>Thousands to Receive Payouts Over Forced Prepayment Meter Installations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 06:46:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tens of thousands of energy customers in the UK will receive payouts up to ¬£1,000 each, with some debts written off, due to the scandal involving forced prepayment meter installations. Energy companies are disbursing over ¬£70 million in compensation and support following a review by Ofgem, the energy regulator. The review found that suppliers fell short of required standards in how they switched vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without their agreement. The scandal emerged during the peak of the cost of living crisis, with energy firms switching customers struggling to pay their bills onto prepayment methods.</p>
