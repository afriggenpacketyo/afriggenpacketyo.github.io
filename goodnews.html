          <p>The U.S. has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, establishing reciprocal 15% tariffs on Japanese exports, including a reduction for automobiles from 25%. President Trump hailed the agreement, claiming it would involve a $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S. and create numerous jobs. The deal, which also includes provisions for U.S. agricultural products, provided a political boost for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and caused a surge in Japanese auto stocks.

          <p>The International Court of Justice is set to deliver a historic advisory opinion on the legal obligations countries have to protect the climate from greenhouse gas emissions. The case was brought forward by vulnerable island nations, like Vanuatu, that face existential threats from rising sea levels. While the court's opinion is non-binding, it is expected to establish a significant legal benchmark that could influence domestic climate lawsuits and international agreements worldwide. The decision will address both what nations must do to prevent harm and the legal consequences for failing to act.</p>

South Korean carmakers Hyundai and Kia also saw their stocks jump on the announcement. The reduction is a key component of a larger trade agreement President Trump touted as a massive deal.

          <p>Scientists analyzing a 13-million-year-old fossil have discovered evidence of a dramatic prehistoric battle between two apex predators. Teeth marks on the leg bone of a fearsome, human-sized "terror bird" found in Colombia match those of a massive, five-meter-long crocodilian species known as Purussaurus. The analysis, using 3D digital scans, suggests the caiman-like reptile either killed the powerful bird in an ambush or scavenged its remains. This rare finding provides new insight into the ancient ecosystem, revealing that even formidable terror birds were vulnerable to other large predators.</p>

Originally the HMS Hind, a Royal Navy frigate that fought in the American War of Independence, the ship was later sold and repurposed for whaling in the Arctic. The identification was made through a combination of dendrochronology, archival research, and a dedicated effort by the local community, who recovered the timbers after a storm exposed them.
