          <p>The U.S. Consumer Price Index increased by 2.7% year-over-year in July, a slightly cooler rate than the 2.8% economists had anticipated. On a monthly basis, the index rose 0.2%, driven largely by shelter costs while energy prices fell. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy, increased 3.1% annually, indicating persistent underlying price pressures. The report comes as the Federal Reserve weighs future interest rate decisions, with many economists suggesting that the modest impact of tariffs so far might not deter a potential rate cut in September.

          <h2>Analysis Explores Reasons for Trump's Shift Towards a More Lenient Stance on China Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 08:36:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has recently adopted a more lenient trade policy towards China, extending a tariff pause and softening his rhetoric, a stark contrast to his earlier aggressive stance. This shift is attributed to several factors, including a desire to avoid price hikes for US consumers during the holiday season and China's strategic leverage, particularly its dominance over rare earth minerals vital to US industries. With other geopolitical challenges, such as peace talks with Russia, Trump may be seeking to de-escalate one front. Analysts suggest this strategy buys time for broader negotiations on technology and energy. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article challenges the prevalent nostalgia for the 1990s, arguing that by many objective measures, the present day is significantly better. It points to data showing that the 1990s had far higher rates of violent crime and murder in the U.S. compared to today. Globally, extreme poverty was rampant, with nearly 40% of the world's population affected, a figure that has since plummeted. Furthermore, the HIV/AIDS pandemic was at its peak with limited treatment, and social tolerance on issues like same-sex marriage and interracial relationships was considerably lower, highlighting substantial progress in health and social attitudes.</p>

          <p>Swiss sneaker company On reported a 32% increase in second-quarter sales, prompting it to raise its full-year revenue and gross margin guidance. The strong performance comes despite the company sourcing about 90% of its goods from Vietnam and facing new tariffs, which it offset by raising prices on its lifestyle products. The company beat Wall Street expectations, with significant growth in both its direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels across all major global regions. On's success highlights its growing market share in the competitive sportswear industry, particularly against legacy brands like Nike. (not investment advice)</p>

Aniston described their bond as one of "girls" who can't avoid the topic, though she noted they trade more wellness advice than gossip. She also reflected on the death of her "Friends" co-star Matthew Perry, stating that his friends and family had been mourning his struggle with addiction for a long time and expressing relief that he is now free from pain.</p>

          <p>Circle Internet Group, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, saw its shares rise after reporting a 53% year-over-year revenue increase in its first quarterly earnings as a public company. The growth was driven by a 90% surge in the circulation of its USDC stablecoin, reaching $61.3 billion. Despite posting a net loss due to one-time IPO-related charges, the strong revenue and positive market sentiment reflect growing institutional interest in stablecoins, bolstered by recent supportive crypto legislation in the U.S. The company also announced plans for a new blockchain network called Arc.

          <p>Alibaba's instant commerce platform, Taobao Shangou, has reportedly overtaken its primary competitor, Meituan, in daily orders within China's on-demand delivery market. The shift occurred after Meituan ended a promotional period, highlighting the significant impact of subsidies in the country's fiercely competitive market. According to a Morgan Stanley analysis, this signals a move from a near-monopoly for Meituan to a "near-duopoly." The bank projects that by 2030, Alibaba and Meituan will likely hold nearly equal shares of the overall instant commerce industry, a major change in the landscape.</p>

The acquisition marks a major expansion for E.l.f., which has seen 26 consecutive quarters of net sales growth, driven by its affordable products and strong social media marketing. Despite a recent dip in net income attributed to tariffs on Chinese imports, CEO Tarang Amin remains confident in the company's long-term strategy. The Rhode deal, financed partly by debt, will bring E.l.f. products into Sephora stores and is seen by analysts as a potentially accretive move.</p>

          <p>With rising temperatures, animal welfare charities are reminding pet owners of the dangers of heatstroke in dogs. The RSPCA advises against walking dogs during the hottest parts of the day, recommending a "pavement test": if the ground is too hot for a hand for five seconds, it's too hot for paws. Signs of heatstroke include excessive panting, confusion, and collapse, and require immediate action to cool the animal down. Owners are encouraged to provide ample shade and water, use cooling mats, and never leave a pet in a locked vehicle, conservatory, or shed.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce by another 90 days, postponing the threat of escalating tariffs until November 10. The move keeps the US levy on Chinese imports at 30% and China's tariff on American goods at 10%, avoiding a potential spike to triple-digit rates. The White House stated the extension allows more time for negotiations on trade imbalances, market access, and national security issues. While the pause averts immediate economic turmoil, some US business owners express frustration over the prolonged uncertainty, which makes future planning difficult. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite endorsing the exhibition, Whyte also emphasized that he still has "unfinished business" with Joshua, whom he lost to in a 2015 grudge match, and would love a chance to "right my wrong."</p>

          <p>Former Las Vegas Raiders coach Jon Gruden achieved a significant legal victory as the Nevada Supreme Court ruled that his lawsuit against the NFL can proceed in civil court. The 5-2 decision rejected the NFL's attempt to move the case to arbitration, where the league commissioner could have designated the arbitrator. Gruden is suing the NFL, alleging the league maliciously leaked racist, homophobic, and sexist emails he wrote years ago while working as an analyst, leading to his resignation in 2021. His attorneys praised the decision as a vindication that clears the way for him to seek justice.</p>
