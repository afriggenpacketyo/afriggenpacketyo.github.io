          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng has successfully navigated an intense domestic price war, reporting its eighth consecutive month of over 30,000 vehicle deliveries in June. This performance stands out as competitors like Nio and Li Auto show more modest or declining sales momentum. The fierce competition, described by the government as "disorderly," has put pressure on all players, including market giant BYD and international competitor Tesla. Xpeng's steady results highlight its resilience in a volatile and highly competitive market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that Israel has agreed to the "necessary conditions" for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza. In a social media post, Trump urged Hamas to accept the proposal, which was mediated by Qatar and Egypt, stating that the terms would only get worse for the group if they refuse. The proposed truce would provide a window to work with all parties to negotiate a permanent end to the war. The announcement comes ahead of a scheduled meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

          <p>Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is reportedly exploring a significant strategic pivot for the company's contract chip manufacturing business. The potential change would involve ceasing to market the 18A process technology to external customers and instead focusing resources on the next-generation 14A process. This move is intended to make Intel more competitive against rival TSMC and to attract major clients like Apple and Nvidia, though it could result in a substantial short-term financial write-off for the company.
