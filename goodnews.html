After building a small taxi fleet, he pivoted to entrepreneurship by opening Dandies Barbershop, which, along with his marketing agency, has become highly successful. Singh overcame significant challenges, including accumulating debt to keep his barbershop afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic by drawing on savings, loans, and credit.

          <p>Maia Kobabe’s award-winning graphic memoir, “Gender Queer,” one of the most banned books in the U.S., will be released in a new annotated edition next year. The book chronicles Kobabe's journey of self-discovery with gender and sexuality, and has been a frequent target of conservative-led book challenges. This special hardcover edition will include new commentary from Kobabe, as well as contributions from other comic creators and scholars, offering deeper context on its themes. The author hopes the new edition provides a richer text for readers in a political climate increasingly hostile to LGBTQ+ rights.</p>

          <p>Wall Street is intensely focused on the upcoming September consumer price index (CPI) report, as the ongoing government shutdown has halted the release of most other official economic data. Economists expect the headline inflation rate to be around 3.1%, a slight increase from the previous month. Because of the lack of other economic indicators, any significant deviation from this forecast could cause an outsized market reaction. The report is also critical for the Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to approve another interest rate cut at its next policy meeting.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News poll reveals California voters' opinions on potential 2028 presidential runs for Governor Gavin Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris. While a large number of California Democrats support a Newsom candidacy, the state's overall electorate is more divided. Newsom receives more support for a potential run than Harris among state voters, including independents. The poll also found that while Californians see the state as a leader in technology and culture, they view its housing, tax, and economic policies as poor examples for the nation.</p>

          <p>Average 30-year mortgage rates have fallen for the second consecutive week, now approaching 6%, providing a potential opening for prospective homebuyers. Rates are currently just above the three-year low reached in September, creating a more favorable borrowing environment than seen earlier in the year. However, experts advise caution, as rates could reverse course due to various economic factors, and competition among buyers may intensify again in the spring. Buyers are encouraged to weigh the current opportunity against the possibility of future market shifts and increased competition.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have experienced significant fluctuations, dropping sharply before rebounding, creating a volatile market for investors. This instability is driven by competing economic factors, including the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts weakening the dollar and a strong stock market pulling investors toward riskier assets. The article suggests several ways to approach this market, such as trading gold mining stocks, using ETFs for short-term plays, or strategically buying physical gold during price dips as a long-term hedge against economic uncertainty.

          <p>In Yorgos Lanthimos's new film "Bugonia," Emma Stone stars as a pharmaceutical CEO held captive by two conspiracy theorists, played by Jesse Plemons and Aidan Delbis, who believe she is an alien. The film is a dark comedy that explores themes of online radicalization and the desperate need for purpose in a desolate, working-class town. Stone's performance is highlighted as a masterful portrayal of corporate composure under extreme duress, while Plemons plays his captor with a compelling mix of menace and pathos.

          <p>Parenting toddlers often involves navigating a series of confusing behaviors, such as constant defiance, possessiveness, and a desire to explore everything physically. According to pediatric psychologists, these actions are developmentally appropriate ways for young children to establish their identity and understand their environment. Saying "no" to everything, for instance, is a method of testing boundaries and asserting newfound independence. Experts advise parents to reframe this behavior as a learning process and respond with calm, firm guidance rather than frustration, offering choices to give toddlers a sense of agency.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reversed his plan to deploy federal agents to San Francisco following conversations with tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. In a social media post, Trump stated that he was convinced to hold off after being told the city was making "substantial progress" on crime under Mayor Daniel Lurie. This marks a significant political victory for Lurie, who has adopted a non-confrontational approach with the Trump administration. The potential deployment had become a point of contention, especially after Benioff initially voiced support before backtracking.</p>

The album channels her emotional state during this period of reckoning through a blend of synth-powered, dark ambient, and vigorous dance beats.

Taxpayers have only 60 days to respond before the IRS's proposed changes become final.
