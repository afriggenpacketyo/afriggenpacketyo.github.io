          <p>A dog named Petunia has won the coveted title at this year's "World's Ugliest Dog Contest" held at the Sonoma County Fair in California. The annual event, which has been running for nearly 50 years, celebrates unique canine beauty and promotes adoption, as many contestants are rescued from shelters and puppy mills. Petunia and her owner, Shannon Nyman, received a $5,000 prize for the victory. The contest serves as a testament that a dog's value is not defined by its pedigree.</p>

          <p>Facing vacancies from the decline of traditional anchor stores like Sears, American shopping malls are undergoing a significant transformation to survive. Mall owners are subdividing large, empty spaces for unconventional tenants such as churches, entertainment venues like bowling alleys, and even large bookstores like Barnes & Noble. This strategy aims to create "cross-shopping" opportunities, turning malls into community hubs that draw visitors for reasons beyond traditional retail. Recent data suggests this pivot is working, with mall traffic showing signs of a rebound.</p>

          <p>A preseason NFL game between the Detroit Lions and the Atlanta Falcons was suspended and ended early on Friday night after a serious injury to Lions safety Morice Norris. After attempting a tackle, Norris remained on the field and was attended to by medical staff for about 20 minutes before being taken to a hospital by ambulance. The Lions later announced that Norris was in stable condition with feeling and movement in all his extremities. The decision to end the game was made jointly by both head coaches out of respect for the player's well-being.</p>

          <p>After a helmet-to-helmet football injury, a New Jersey teenager named Logan Coleridge experienced months of debilitating symptoms that went beyond a typical concussion. When physical therapy and medication failed, a concussion specialist ordered an MRI, which revealed the true cause: an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), a dangerous and abnormal tangle of blood vessels in his brain. The concussion inadvertently led to the life-saving diagnosis, and Logan successfully underwent surgery to remove the AVM. He is now recovering well and preparing to return to the football field.</p>

          <p>As concert ticket prices surge, a growing number of consumers, particularly from younger generations, are using "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) loans to afford live events. A recent LendingTree survey found that 37% of Gen Z and 35% of millennials have used these services for concert costs. While BNPL offers the convenience of installment payments, analysts caution that some plans carry high interest rates and fees. Instead, they recommend proactive financial planning, such as creating a dedicated savings fund for entertainment expenses to avoid potential debt. (not investment advice)</p>

In 1991, Grimes agreed to help investigate why the agency's Soviet informants were being compromised and executed. Through meticulous analysis of financial records and activity logs, she identified tell-tale signs that pointed to her colleague, Aldrich Ames. Her work was instrumental in the 1994 arrest of Ames, who had been paid millions by the Soviet Union for his espionage.</p>

          <h2>Startup Proposes Manufacturing Gold as a Byproduct of Nuclear Fusion to Subsidize Clean Energy</h2>

          <p>A San Francisco startup, Marathon Fusion, has proposed a modern form of alchemy: manufacturing gold by repurposing neutrons produced during the nuclear fusion process. The theory, which has intrigued some physicists, suggests that this could create a valuable revenue stream to offset the high costs of developing commercial fusion energy. While the idea is currently speculative and relies on the future viability of commercial fusion reactors, it represents a novel approach to making clean energy more economically feasible. The concept revives a centuries-old dream with a modern, scientific twist.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Carronade Capital Management is pushing satellite communications company Viasat to spin off its Defense and Advanced Technologies (DAT) division. In a letter to the board, Carronade argues that Viasat is "materially misunderstood" and undervalued by the market, which wrongly focuses on its legacy broadband business's competition with Starlink. The firm believes the high-growth, high-margin DAT business is a "hidden gem" that, if separated, could unlock significant shareholder value and trade at a much higher multiple, reflecting its true potential.

          <p>OpenAI's latest model, GPT-5, touted as its "smartest, fastest, most useful model yet," has garnered mixed reviews from experts and users in China. While OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described the new system as a "PhD-level expert," some Chinese AI industry insiders have expressed disappointment, suggesting it offers incremental improvements rather than revolutionary breakthroughs. This lukewarm reception comes amid heightened global AI competition, where Chinese tech firms are racing to develop their own advanced large language models to rival those from the United States.</p>

          <p>A group of volunteers, including teachers and retirees, has established a "Community Defense Corner" outside a Home Depot in Pasadena, California. They stand watch daily, patrol the parking lot, and hand out literature to warn day laborers of potential raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The activists say they are motivated by the "inhumane" nature of the immigration crackdown and its impact on families. Their presence is a direct response to recent federal raids and represents a grassroots effort to show solidarity and provide protection for immigrant workers.</p>
