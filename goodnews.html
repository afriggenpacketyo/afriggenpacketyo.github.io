The Boeing 737, carrying 134 passengers and six crew members, landed safely without any injuries. United Airlines arranged for another aircraft to transport the passengers to their final destination. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the incident and will examine the damaged multilayer windshield to determine the cause of the crack, including whether it was struck by an object mid-flight.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa midfielder Emiliano Buendia scored a superb winning goal in a 2-1 victory over Tottenham, marking a significant moment in his return from a major injury. After being sidelined for a year with an ACL injury, the club's former record signing has been in excellent form, contributing three goals and an assist in his last four games. Buendia, who was almost transferred over the summer, chose to stay and fight for his place in the team. His recent performances have been crucial in Villa's resurgence, helping the team secure three consecutive league wins after a difficult start to the season.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter, serving as both host and musical guest on "Saturday Night Live," used the platform to cleverly address criticism of her provocative public image. Through sketches, including one about a suggestive neck pillow and another playing a "girlboss" confidence coach, she satirized the controversy surrounding her album art and live performances. The episode seemed to be a direct response to those who have characterized her persona as subservient or overly sexualized. Carpenter's comedic performance consistently played with the idea of innocence versus intent, effectively asking critics why they are so concerned with her sexuality.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team clinched a place in the World Cup semi-finals after a tense four-run victory against co-hosts India. England set a target of 289, largely thanks to a masterful century from Heather Knight. India appeared to be cruising towards victory, but the dismissal of opener Smriti Mandhana for 88 triggered a middle-order collapse under pressure. Despite a late effort from Deepti Sharma, India fell just short, finishing on 284-6. The win marks a crucial step for England as they advance to the knockout stages of the tournament.</p>

          <p>According to a new World Health Organization report, tobacco consumption has significantly decreased in Southeast Asia over the last two decades, with smoking prevalence falling from 54% to 23%. This success is attributed to strong public health initiatives, including higher taxes, advertising bans, and smoke-free public spaces. However, the report notes that the absolute number of smokers has risen due to population growth. Furthermore, the region faces new challenges from the tobacco industry's influence in countries like Indonesia and the rapid rise of e-cigarettes, particularly among adolescents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to resume processing student loan forgiveness for millions of borrowers under two specific income-driven repayment plans. This decision is the result of a legal agreement with the American Federation of Teachers, which had sued the administration for blocking access to the programs. The Department of Education will once again process debt cancellation for eligible borrowers in the Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) and Pay as You Earn (PAYE) plans. The agreement marks a significant victory for borrowers and advocates who argued the administration was unlawfully withholding congressionally mandated debt relief.</p>

          <h2>UK Energy Secretary Hints at Potential VAT Cut on Energy Bills</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-19 12:38:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has suggested that the government is considering cutting the 5% VAT rate on household energy bills to address the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. While he declined to speculate ahead of the November Budget, Miliband acknowledged the affordability crisis and stated that officials are "looking at all of these issues." The potential move comes as the government faces pressure to lower energy costs, which remain high by historical standards. Scrapping the VAT could save the average household around £86 per year, but the long-term solution, Miliband argued, is a transition to home-grown clean energy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zack Polanski, the leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, has defended his party's proposal for a wealth tax, framing it as a necessary measure to tackle "deep inequality." The plan involves an annual tax of 1% on assets over £10 million and 2% on those over £1 billion. Speaking to the BBC, Polanski argued that while the tax would not be a panacea, its primary goal is to reduce the gap between the super-wealthy and the rest of society. He also advocated for aligning capital gains tax with income tax, stating that unearned wealth should be taxed as much as earned income.</p>
