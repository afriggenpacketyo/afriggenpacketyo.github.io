          <p>A Harris's hawk, nicknamed "Bomber Harris," that attacked around 50 people in a Hertfordshire village has found a permanent home with a local falconer. The hawk, which caused injuries requiring hospital treatment, was captured after disrupting postal deliveries and terrorizing residents for over a month. Falconer Wayne Housden has trained the bird and built an aviary for it, planning to eventually let it fly free. Housden believes the hawk was a captive-bred bird that had been lost by its owner and aims to provide it with a stable environment.</p>

          <p>A new report from WWF highlights the vital role of UK saltmarshes as carbon sinks, locking away greenhouse gases in layers of mud. The charity is advocating for the inclusion of these habitats in the official UK inventory of carbon emissions and removals. The UK has lost a significant portion of its saltmarshes to agriculture, but they are crucial in the fight against climate change. WWF's research shows that saltmarshes capture carbon in the soil, making them as important as trees for climate mitigation.</p>

The debate focuses on revising the Civil Code to enable couples to choose separate family names after marriage, a change supported by a majority of the public.</p>
