          <p>Ecuador has extradited José Adolfo Macías Villamar, the infamous leader of the "Los Choneros" drug gang known as "Fito," to the United States. Macías, who had previously escaped prison, faces federal charges in New York for importing thousands of pounds of cocaine. His gang is accused of using hitmen, bribery, and military-grade weapons to control trafficking routes, targeting officials and civilians. The extradition proceeded after the U.S. provided guarantees for his rights, marking a significant step in bilateral efforts to combat transnational organized crime.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative team from China and Singapore has developed an innovative nanovaccine that successfully suppressed cancer recurrence and metastasis in animal studies. The bio-inspired approach targets cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are responsible for tumor self-renewal and proliferation, a key challenge in cancer treatment. Detailed in the journal Nature Nanotechnology, this research presents a promising new avenue for developing personalized cancer vaccines. The findings could potentially lead to more effective therapies that prevent cancer from returning after initial treatment.</p>

          <h2>Venture Capitalists Rely on "Power Law" to Identify High-Return Investments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 03:48:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Venture capitalists often use the "power law" principle to guide their investment decisions, focusing on startups with the potential for massive, outlier returns. This strategy accepts that most startups in a portfolio may fail, as the immense success of one or two "massive winners" like Spotify or Klarna can outweigh all other losses combined. According to Peter Specht of Creandum, VCs seek founders who can pitch a compelling vision for why their company can become a category-defining entity with "outsized-outcome potential." This approach emphasizes visionary storytelling and ambition, a trait some experts believe U.S. founders exhibit more strongly than their European counterparts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. imports of rare-earth magnets from China surged by 660% in June compared to the previous month, following a preliminary trade deal that eased some restrictions. These magnets are critical components for high-tech industries, including electric vehicles, wind turbines, and robotics. The increase in exports comes after Beijing required licenses for these materials in April, a move seen as retaliation against U.S. tariffs. The development highlights America's heavy reliance on China, which controls about 90% of the global market, and underscores the strategic leverage these materials hold in ongoing trade negotiations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive review of the water industry in England and Wales has proposed 88 recommendations, constituting the most significant reform since privatization 30 years ago. Authored by Sir Jon Cunliffe, the proposals include abolishing the current regulator, Ofwat, and implementing stronger environmental regulations to tackle issues like sewage spills and leaks. The report acknowledges that decades of underinvestment must be rectified through massive capital expenditure, which will inevitably lead to higher consumer bills. The goal is to create a more resilient system focused on long-term infrastructure investment, similar to the model used by the telecoms regulator Ofcom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British government has announced a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent clashes of the 1980s miners' strike. The event, which occurred on June 18, 1984, involved a violent confrontation between striking miners and thousands of police officers outside a coking plant in Rotherham. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry will examine the events of the day and their aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of 95 miners amid allegations of falsified police evidence. Campaigners, who have sought an inquiry for over a decade, expressed cautious elation at the news.</p>
