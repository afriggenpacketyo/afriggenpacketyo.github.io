          <p>A new study challenges the theory that dark streaks on Mars are evidence of flowing water, suggesting instead that they are likely caused by dry processes such as wind and dust deposition. Researchers used machine learning to analyze over 86,000 satellite images of slope streaks and recurring slope lineae, finding that they were more often associated with high wind speeds and dust deposition. The findings cast doubt on claims that these areas could be habitable, allowing for safer exploration without contamination concerns.</p>
