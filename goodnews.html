          <h2>UK Government Toughens Migration Rules Amid Political Pressure</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is introducing stricter migration rules, including English language tests for adult dependents of foreign workers and restrictions on care homes recruiting staff from abroad. This move is seen as a response to pressure from Reform UK and an attempt to seize the narrative on immigration. The new regulations also prioritize residency rights for migrants who pay taxes on time, work in the public sector, or volunteer. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to hold direct negotiations with Vladimir Putin, and research suggests weight-loss jabs may reduce cancer risk.</p>

          <p>The US and China have reported making substantial progress in trade talks held in Geneva, signaling a potential de-escalation of the trade war. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the discussions as "productive and constructive," while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng noted they were "in-depth" and "candid". A joint statement detailing the agreements is expected soon. The talks are the first face-to-face meetings since the US imposed steep tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting retaliatory measures from Beijing. The announcement has boosted financial markets, with stocks in China and Hong Kong rising, and the establishment of an economic and trade consultation mechanism between the two nations has been agreed upon.</p>

The government aims to ensure that defense investments create domestic jobs and generate local prosperity. The initiative includes funding for infrastructure, healthcare, and education to attract and retain workers.
