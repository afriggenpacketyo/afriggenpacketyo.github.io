          <p>China is rapidly advancing its deep space exploration ambitions, aiming to land astronauts on the moon by 2030 and retrieve samples from Mars. Key hardware, including the Mengzhou crew capsule and the Long March-10 rocket, is now in advanced development and testing stages. While NASA's Artemis program officially has an earlier target for a crewed lunar landing, it faces significant technical challenges, such as the need for unproven in-orbit refueling for its Starship lander. This progress positions China as a serious competitor to the United States' long-held dominance in space exploration.</p>

          <p>A growing number of singles, particularly from Gen Z, are using artificial intelligence applications to improve their online dating conversations. Apps like Rizz and Keepler analyze chat screenshots and suggest witty or appropriate replies, acting as a "wingman" for users who struggle with writing or conversation. While some users find it a useful tool for breaking the ice, the trend raises questions about authenticity in digital communication. Experts suggest that while AI can be a helpful supplement for building confidence, it becomes problematic if it replaces genuine human connection and self-expression.</p>

          <p>According to sex therapist Chamin Ajjan, intimacy is a vital component of a healthy relationship that many couples neglect. In a recent article, she identifies four common "intimacy blockers" that are often overlooked: excessive phone use, unresolved feelings about an ex, a persistent negativity bias, and unmanaged stress. Ajjan suggests that these factors can create emotional distance and prevent genuine connection. She recommends couples establish screen-free zones, process past relationships, challenge negative thought patterns, and communicate openly about how stress affects their desire for connection.</p>

          <p>Asking for a raise is rarely a single conversation and is more likely a process that unfolds over several weeks, according to negotiation expert Kathryn Valentine. She advises that the goal of the initial meeting should be to start the dialogue, not to secure an immediate agreement. Employees should be prepared for their manager to need time to consult with others and review budgets. Valentine recommends initiating these talks during mid-year check-ins rather than annual reviews and ensuring a follow-up meeting is scheduled to maintain momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has acquired a 9.01% stake in Tripadvisor, signaling its intent to influence the company's strategy and boost its lagging stock value. Despite owning valuable assets like Viator and TheFork, Tripadvisor's market valuation has been hampered by past governance issues and a decline in its core business. Starboard, known for improving operational efficiency, could pursue several strategies, including focusing on profitability, selling off a segment like TheFork, or leveraging the company's vast data for AI applications. This move could also attract potential acquisition offers for the entire company. (not investment advice)</p>

Winger Duhan van der Merwe was a standout, scoring a hat-trick as the Lions ran in a total of eight tries in Adelaide. The decisive victory provided a strong platform for the team, though it was marred by a head injury to center Garry Ringrose, ruling him out of the upcoming Test, and a knee-to-head collision that saw hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie stretchered off the field.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering authorizing new funding for Ukraine, a potential policy shift that could be a message to Russia following its recent wave of intense aerial attacks. Despite past criticism of U.S. spending on the war, Trump recently expressed disappointment with Vladimir Putin and hinted at sending more defensive weapons. The administration has access to nearly $4 billion in presidential drawdown authority and the power to seize Russian assets to aid Ukraine. This comes as Trump has also been pushing NATO allies to increase their financial support for Ukraine's defense.</p>

          <p>Josh Earnest, who served as Barack Obama's press secretary, recently described the day after Donald Trump's 2016 election win as his hardest on the job.

Earnest shared that the mood in the White House was "emotional" and visibly demoralized. He recounted how President Obama gathered communications staff in the Oval Office to deliver an early, poignant version of his public speech urging national unity and patriotism.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay argues that modern children are increasingly deprived of free, unstructured physical play, which is crucial for their development. The author notes that, like young animals, children have a natural inclination to move wildly, but societal norms, safety fears, and lack of access to open spaces have led to more sedentary lifestyles. This inactivity has dire consequences for physical and mental health. The article cites experts who state that restricting risky play deprives children of developing "movement quality," which is essential for long-term athletic robustness and injury prevention.</p>

          <p>Financial author Katie Gatti Tassin argues that the high cost of beauty maintenance is an "insidious force" in women's financial lives, dubbing it the "hot girl hamster wheel." She points out that spending on aesthetic enhancements like hair, nails, and skincare are recurring expenses that function as a depreciating asset, requiring ever-increasing investment. Tassin suggests women conduct a "hot girl detox" by annualizing these costs to see their true financial impact and then experiment with cutting back. The saved money can then be used more productively to pay down debt, build savings, or invest for the future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a personal essay reflecting on the Camp Mystic tragedy, the author, who grew up at a Girl Scout camp, contemplates the role of camp in teaching bravery and resilience. The piece acknowledges the horror of the event but argues that camp provides a unique, safe-but-challenging environment where children can grow, free from outside judgment. The author hopes the tragedy will not lead parents to "bubble-wrap" their children, thereby denying them life-changing experiences. The essay emphasizes that while safety is paramount, calculated risks and overcoming discomfort are essential parts of a child's development.</p>
