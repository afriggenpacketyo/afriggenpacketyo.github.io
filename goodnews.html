          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced plans to weaken limits on certain PFAS "forever chemicals" in drinking water, while maintaining standards for PFOA and PFOS. Limits on three types of PFAS, including GenX substances, will be scrapped and reconsidered. The EPA will grant utilities two extra years, until 2031, to comply with standards for PFOA and PFOS. This decision has sparked controversy, with health advocates criticizing the move as illegal and utilities arguing that treatment systems are expensive to install, potentially raising water bills for customers.</p>

          <p>State Farm customers in California will face a 17% increase in homeowners insurance premiums following a judge's ruling that grants the company a $400 million cash infusion to address financial distress after the Los Angeles-area wildfires. The increase, lower than the initially proposed 21.8%, will take effect on June 1. The decision has faced criticism from fire survivors and state senators, who argue it disregards the hardships faced by victims. The insurance commissioner assured residents that he considered all options and is focused on ensuring State Farm pays claims fully and fairly.</p>
