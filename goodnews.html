          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix after a highly unusual qualifying session that was interrupted by a record six red flags. The session, which lasted two hours, saw multiple drivers crash, including championship contender Oscar Piastri and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, in challenging, lightly rainy conditions. Williams' Carlos Sainz will start second, with Liam Lawson of Racing Bulls in a surprising third. The numerous stoppages and changing weather created an unpredictable and dramatic shootout for the top spot on the starting grid.</p>

          <p>A year after Hurricane Helene devastated parts of the Appalachian Mountains, Leicester, North Carolina resident John Saunby is building a unique home from the storm's debris. Instead of letting salvaged materials go to a landfill, Saunby is using items like porch posts and old mill floorboards to construct his personal "last hurrah" of home-building. The project features creative elements like Black Locust bark siding and tree trunk roof supports, turning wreckage into a testament to resilience and resourcefulness. His partner, an Appalachian recording artist, provides a musical backdrop to the creative and restorative construction process.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, has advanced to its seventh consecutive World Cup final after a hard-fought 35-17 victory over France. Full-back Ellie Kildunne, returning from a concussion, was instrumental in the win, scoring two crucial tries that showcased her speed and agility. Despite a spirited performance from the French side that kept the contest close, England's power and depth, particularly in their driving maul, proved decisive in the second half. The Red Roses will now face Canada in the final at a sold-out Twickenham's Allianz Stadium next weekend.</p>

          <p>Several German cities, including Berlin and Cologne, saw large demonstrations on Saturday addressing contentious social and political issues. Climate activists from the Fridays for Future movement protested the government's new energy policy, which includes building more gas-fired power plants. Simultaneously, thousands participated in rival marches concerning abortion rights, with both pro-choice and anti-abortion groups holding significant rallies. In contrast to the protests, the city of Munich kicked off its 190th Oktoberfest, the world-famous beer festival expected to draw millions of visitors from around the globe.</p>

          <p>Lexi Smith, a 24-year-old from Atlanta, moved to the Chiba Prefecture in Japan to teach English and found a remarkably affordable living situation. Her one-bedroom apartment, secured by her employer, costs only 35,000 yen, or about $238 a month, in the Japanese countryside where life is cheaper and more traditional than in Tokyo. Smith decided to teach abroad to experience a new culture and escape the financial pressures and administrative burdens she faced as a teacher in the U.S. She is documenting her experience on social media to show a different side of life in Japan.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several appliance brands, including Haier, Hisense, and Xiaomi, are introducing a new washing machine design featuring three separate drums to allow for multiple, simultaneous laundry cycles. This innovation aims to solve the common problem of having to run numerous consecutive loads for different types of clothing, such as colors, delicates, or baby clothes. The design typically includes one large central drum and two smaller drums above it, enabling users to wash different items with different settings at the same time. While not yet widely available, these machines signal a potential future for more efficient home laundry.</p>

          <p>U.S. stock markets, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, reached new all-time highs this week following the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates by a quarter-point. This was the first rate reduction since last December, with central bankers signaling that two more cuts could occur in 2025, bringing the benchmark rate to a range of 4% to 4.25%. The highly anticipated move boosted investor confidence and propelled major indices upward. The market is now looking ahead to the next employment report and the beginning of the upcoming earnings season for further direction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released and returned to the United Kingdom after being detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for almost eight months. The couple, aged 80 and 76, had lived in Afghanistan for nearly two decades, running a charitable training program. They were detained in February for allegedly breaking Afghan laws, though the specific reasons were never disclosed by the Taliban. Their release was brokered by Qatar, and they were reunited with their daughter in Doha before flying to London, expressing a desire to eventually return to Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Monica Lewinsky reflected on her journey from being a subject of international scorn in the 1990s to becoming an anti-bullying activist and producer. She explained that a pivotal moment came after the death of Tyler Clementi, which inspired her to become a "poster child for having survived shame." Lewinsky discussed how younger generations have re-evaluated her story with a better understanding of power dynamics, and how the #MeToo movement provided a new context for her experiences. She emphasized the importance of telling one's own story, finding humor in hardship, and insisting on a different ending.</p>

          <p>A nearly two-hour phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump has sparked hopes for increased stability in the bilateral relationship. Both leaders described the conversation as productive and constructive, covering topics from trade to the control of TikTok. Trump announced plans for the two to meet at the upcoming APEC summit and for him to visit China early next year, signaling a potential de-escalation of tensions. However, analysts remain cautious, pointing to ongoing friction over Taiwan, the South China Sea, and potential U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>The United States has become less public about its naval warship transits through the sensitive Taiwan Strait since President Trump returned to office. Under the previous administration, these freedom-of-navigation operations were regularly announced as a clear signal to Beijing, but there have only been three known transits this year, which were confirmed only after media inquiries. Beijing has long criticized the "public hype" around these operations. While some observers see this shift as a tactical move to reduce direct confrontation, it does not necessarily represent a substantive change in U.S. policy.</p>

For many, the lower tuition fees in countries like the Netherlands or the Czech Republic are a primary motivator.

The company, which started as an at-home service, now has 90 studios across the U.S., employs over 500 nurses, and generated $70 million in revenue last year.

          <p>A leading dermatologist is highlighting the often-overlooked risk of sun exposure while indoors, explaining that harmful UVA rays can penetrate window glass. While UVB rays, which cause sunburn, are mostly filtered by windows, UVA rays are not and can contribute to accelerated skin aging and skin cancer. This "silent" exposure can occur without any visible sign like a burn, making it particularly insidious. To stay protected, it is recommended to use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher, which shields against both UVA and UVB rays.</p>
