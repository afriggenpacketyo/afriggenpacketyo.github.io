          <h2>Newly Discovered Interstellar Object May Be the Oldest Known Comet</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 07:06:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Astronomers have identified a new interstellar object, named 3I/Atlas, which may be the oldest comet ever observed. A team from Oxford University suggests it could be over seven billion years old, originating from a group of ancient stars in the Milky Way's "thick disk." This makes it potentially three billion years older than our own solar system, offering an unprecedented glimpse into a previously unobserved part of the galaxy. The object, currently near Jupiter's distance from Earth, is expected to become visible with amateur telescopes later this year as it approaches the sun.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has established the "Make America Beautiful Again Commission" through an executive order aimed at restoring the nation's natural resources and outdoor heritage. The initiative seeks to address issues like the National Park System's $23 billion debt, poor forest management, and deteriorating water infrastructure by fostering bipartisan collaboration. The commission will bring together federal and state officials, private sector leaders, and tribal governments to develop a comprehensive strategy for long-term conservation success. Proponents argue this will depoliticize environmental issues and unite Americans around shared conservation goals.</p>

          <p>Iconiq Capital, an investment firm with prominent Silicon Valley clients like Mark Zuckerberg, is innovating in philanthropy with its "co-lab" funds. These funds pool capital from multiple wealthy families to make significant, multiyear grants to nonprofits addressing issues such as youth mental health and climate equity. The model aims to make giving more efficient and impactful, especially for busy tech founders, by fostering peer learning and moving money to charities faster than traditional foundations. Amid concerns about reduced federal funding and tax incentives, this approach seeks to increase accountability and accelerate the deployment of philanthropic dollars.</p>

          <p>A recent study underscores the vital role scavengers, particularly vultures, play in maintaining public health by efficiently disposing of animal carcasses. The decline of vulture populations in India, caused by the livestock painkiller diclofenac, led to an estimated 100,000 additional human deaths annually from diseases like rabies, as feral dog populations boomed. Researchers warn that about one-third of all scavenger species are threatened, which could increase human exposure to pathogens from rotting carrion. The findings emphasize the interconnectedness of ecosystem stability and human well-being, showing how wildlife conservation directly impacts public health.</p>

          <p>In a significant step towards ending its 40-year conflict with Turkey, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) held a ceremony to begin disarming. About 30 fighters symbolically burned their weapons in Iraqi Kurdistan, following a call from their imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, to transition from armed struggle to democratic politics. The Turkish government has hailed the event as a "critical threshold" in the peace process. The conflict has claimed an estimated 40,000 lives, and the PKK is designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, and the EU.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi held their first in-person meeting since the new Trump administration took office. The talks, described as "constructive and positive" by Rubio, took place on the sidelines of an ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting in Kuala Lumpur. Tensions between the two nations remain high over issues including trade tariffs, technology, and Taiwan. Rubio indicated a high probability of a future meeting between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping to address these complex issues directly.</p>

          <p>China has showcased a new magnetic levitation (maglev) train with a top speed of 600 km/h (373 mph), developed by the China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation (CRRC). The train, unveiled at a recent exhibition, aims to bridge the speed gap between existing high-speed rail and air travel for distances under 2,000 km. Once operational, it could reduce the travel time between Beijing and Shanghai from over five hours to just two and a half. The project has completed its initial engineering phase and will now undergo further testing before being deployed for commercial service.</p>

          <p>Three devout Muslim sisters, Jamilah, Zaynah, and Latifah McBryde, have been instrumental in changing the rules of American women's wrestling to allow for modest uniforms. Initially unable to compete in standard singlets due to their faith, their perseverance, with support from coaches at Life University, led to rule changes at both the collegiate (NAIA) and national (USA Wrestling) levels. The sisters now compete in full-body uniforms, paving the way for other Muslim women in the sport. Despite facing challenges, their success has had a lasting impact, with Zaynah and Latifah recently winning national championships.</p>

          <p>On its 40th anniversary, the 1985 Live Aid concert is remembered as a landmark event that united billions globally and raised millions for famine relief in Ethiopia. Conceived by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, it set a template for large-scale benefit concerts and successfully placed humanitarian issues on the political agenda. However, retrospective analysis highlights significant flaws, including a lack of African performers and female representation, which critics argue reinforced a "white savior" narrative. While its impact on debt relief and aid is acknowledged, Live Aid's legacy remains complex, embodying both the power of collective action and the pitfalls of its execution.</p>

          <p>A San Diego chef has filed a class-action lawsuit against foam foodware manufacturer WinCup, alleging the company continues to sell and deceptively label polystyrene foam products in California despite a state ban that took effect January 1. The lawsuit seeks an injunction to stop sales and accuses the company of "greenwashing" by falsely labeling the non-recyclable products with a recycling symbol. The suit highlights the lack of enforcement by the state agency CalRecycle, which is responsible for implementing the ban on the environmentally harmful plastic material. The law allows for fines of up to $50,000 per day for violations.</p>

          <p>Laurie Gwen Shapiro's new book, "The Aviator and the Showman," offers a vibrant look at the relationship between famed pilot Amelia Earhart and her publisher husband, George Palmer Putnam. The review praises the book's layered narrative, which details how Putnam, a master of mass-market promotion, packaged Earhart into an American icon and a lucrative brand. The book explores their shared ambitions and entwined passions, while also suggesting that Putnam's intrusive management and focus on profit may have contributed to the tragic end of her final flight.

          <p>The touring jukebox musical "A Beautiful Noise," now playing at the Hollywood Pantages Theatre, is celebrated in this review as a successful tribute to Neil Diamond's songbook. The show frames his hits within a therapy session, where an older Neil reflects on his life and career. The reviewer praises the lead performance by Nick Fradiani as the younger Diamond, capturing the excitement and melancholy of his music. While the therapy framework can be heavy-handed, the production succeeds by keeping the focus on the powerful songs, delivering an energetic and emotionally resonant experience for fans.</p>
