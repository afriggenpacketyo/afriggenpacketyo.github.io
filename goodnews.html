          <p>Singapore's Changi Airport has commenced construction on its fifth terminal, expected to be operational by the mid-2030s, as Asia prepares for a travel boom. The new terminal will nearly double the airport's existing area, increasing its capacity to handle 140 million passengers annually. This expansion is part of a broader trend in the Asia-Pacific and Middle East regions, where airports are undergoing extensive development with combined investments of $240 billion. Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong highlighted that with Terminal 5, Changi aims to connect with 200 cities, further boosting the nation's aviation ecosystem, which contributes 5% of Singapore's GDP.</p>

          <p>A manuscript once dismissed as an unofficial copy of the Magna Carta is now believed to be a genuine version, potentially worth millions, according to UK academics. Harvard Law School acquired the document for just $27.50 in 1946, and it remained largely unnoticed in its library for decades. Professors David Carpenter and Nicholas Vincent have concluded that it is an extraordinarily rare and lost original Magna Carta from 1300, issued during the reign of King Edward I. The article notes that there are only 25 surviving originals from the various editions between 1215 and 1300, with most residing in the UK.</p>

The law, set to fully take effect in December, seeks to promote competition from smaller firms and address the dominance of the tech giants. It will also prohibit the companies from using data obtained from the operation of their app stores or operating systems in their own products or services.

          <p>CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure provider, reported better-than-expected revenue in its first earnings release since going public, with revenue soaring 420% to $981.6 million. The company also projected faster growth for the year, with revenue expected to reach $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. The company's net loss widened to $314.6 million, partly due to stock-based compensation costs tied to the IPO. CoreWeave secured a five-year deal with OpenAI worth up to $11.9 billion, in addition to OpenAI's existing reliance on Microsoft. Shares initially rose but ended down 5% in extended trading, as investors sought clarity on company metrics.</p>

          <h2>Venus May Be More Earth-Like Than Previously Believed</h2>

          <p>A new study suggests that Venus may be more similar to Earth than previously thought, with ongoing tectonic-like processes deforming its surface and recycling its crust. The large, round features on Venus's surface called coronae may hold the key to understanding the planet's interior processes. Researchers compared models of coronae formation against gravity and topography observations from NASA's Magellan probe, finding that 52 of the coronae cap hot, buoyant plumes of molten material. This suggests that processes similar to subduction and lithospheric dripping on Earth may be occurring on Venus.</p>

          <h2>China-Philippine Ties Face Uncertainty After Marcos' Setback</h2>

          <p>China-Philippine relations face a period of uncertainty after President Marcos' efforts to undermine the Duterte camp were unsuccessful. Sara Duterte is poised to become a formidable candidate in the country‚Äôs 2028 presidential election, and her "pragmatic" stance on China could usher in better China-Philippines ties if she succeeds in the race. Marcos failed to eliminate the Duterte political dynasty‚Äôs grip on power, and the vice-president is likely to receive enough backing to avoid impeachment. Candidates aligned with Marcos were on track to secure six seats, falling below expectations.</p>

          <h2>Menendez Brothers Eligible for Parole After Resentencing</h2>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after spending over three decades behind bars. The brothers, who were convicted of killing their parents in 1989, claimed they acted in self-defense after years of alleged abuse. A judge struck the special circumstance that had previously made them ineligible for parole. After 35 years behind bars, the Menendez brothers' relatives rejoiced after the judge's decision. The case will now go to the California Board of Parole Hearings before it is sent to the governor's office.</p>
