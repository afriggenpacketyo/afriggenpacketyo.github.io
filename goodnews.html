          <p>Prince Harry met with his father, King Charles, for a private, 50-minute meeting at Clarence House, marking their first face-to-face interaction since February 2024. The meeting is viewed as a significant step toward reconciliation amid a well-publicized family rift, following Harry's previous public statements expressing a desire to rebuild family relationships. This brief reunion occurred while Harry was in the UK for charity events, though there were no indications of a meeting with his brother, Prince William.</p>

The deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter, values Potbelly shares at $17.12 each, a significant premium that caused the company's stock to surge over 30%. This acquisition aligns with Potbelly's goal of expanding its franchise-led growth, with RaceTrac's backing expected to fortify its expansion plans from its current 445 stores toward a target of 2,000 locations.</p>

While the investigation is currently focused on the Palisades fire, officials indicated it could expand to other destructive fires in Los Angeles County.</p>

          <p>Larry Ellison, the co-founder of software company Oracle, has surpassed Elon Musk to become the world's wealthiest person, with a net worth of $393 billion. This shift in wealth follows a massive 40% surge in Oracle's stock, driven by a highly optimistic outlook for its cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence (AI) businesses. While Ellison's fortune grew, Musk's has been impacted by a decline in Tesla's stock value this year amid investor concerns. Ellison, a known ally of President Trump, has also been positioning Oracle in other strategic areas, including a potential acquisition of TikTok. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has formally requested that Congress grant Washington D.C. the authority to spend its own locally-raised tax revenue, aiming to fix a major budgetary issue. An inadvertent omission in a March spending bill reverted the city's spending cap to 2024 levels, creating a $1.1 billion funding shortfall for its 2025 fiscal year. This move to correct the error comes as President Trump and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser have established a more cooperative relationship on crime, and as Congress negotiates a stopgap bill to prevent a government shutdown.</p>

          <p>With the World Cup approaching, an analysis of England's football team under manager Thomas Tuchel reveals a shift towards a more aggressive, risk-taking attacking style. In just six games, Tuchel has implemented principles emphasizing direct passes, off-the-ball runs to create space, and empowering wingers in one-on-one situations. While the team has a strong defensive record in qualifiers, questions remain about their vulnerability against teams that can maintain sustained possession. The manager's focus on player suitability and chemistry, such as pairing club teammates, is seen as a positive foundation for the upcoming tournament.</p>

Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi sought a retrial, and the court has now ruled that her actions constituted justifiable self-defense against an unjust infringement on her bodily integrity and sexual self-determination.</p>

Researchers emphasize that this is not definitive proof of life and that non-biological processes could be responsible.
