        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS app will become the primary communication method for millions more patients in England, aiming to save the health service ¬£200m over three years. A ¬£50m investment will enable the app to send test results, screening invitations, and appointment reminders directly to smartphones, reducing reliance on traditional letters. Patients without app access will receive text messages and letters as a last resort, freeing up NHS phone lines. This move aims to improve patient access to healthcare management and informed decision-making, with over 11 million people using the app monthly.</p>

          <p>Significant progress has been made in the fight against cancer, with age-adjusted death rates declining by about a third since 1991 due to advances in treatment and prevention. The decline in smoking has contributed to this trend, but breakthroughs in treatments like stem-cell harvesting and CAR-T therapy have also played a crucial role. Childhood cancer death rates have fallen dramatically since 1950, and five-year survival rates for all cancers have risen. These advancements have transformed cancer from a death sentence to a more manageable condition for many, offering new hope and extended lives.</p>

Drones have become critical for Ukraine's defense, helping to offset Russia's troop advantage and inflict significant casualties.

          <h2>Fact Check: Debunking False Claims About Wind Energy</h2>

          <p>This article debunks false claims made by Donald Trump and others about wind energy, addressing assertions that windmills drive whales crazy, kill droves of birds, are not properly recycled, and are inefficient. Scientific evidence shows no link between wind turbine noise and whale deaths, and while wind turbines do kill birds, they account for a small fraction of bird mortality compared to other factors. While some wind turbine blades end up in landfills, efforts are underway to improve recycling and repurposing. Wind turbines are also highly efficient and downtime is often necessary due to wind conditions or maintenance.</p>

          <p>The Belmont Stakes will feature a rematch of the top three finishers from the Kentucky Derby, including Sovereignty, Journalism, and Baeza. Journalism is the morning-line favorite, but Sovereignty, who skipped the Preakness, will also be competing. The race will be held at Saratoga Race Course this year due to renovations at Belmont Park, shortening the distance to 1 1/4 miles. Notable trainers and jockeys are participating, and the race is expected to be competitive.</p>

          <h2>Federal Rental Aid and Time Limits: A Closer Look at Delaware's Program</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 07:01:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the debate around federal rental aid time limits, focusing on Delaware's program that combines rental assistance with work requirements and savings incentives. The Delaware program allows tenants to save money while receiving aid, but housing experts caution that time limits alone are not effective without additional support. Other states, like Washington, have abandoned time limits due to the lack of affordable housing and the difficulty for people to save money. The success of the program hinges on factors such as savings accounts, budgeting assistance, and support for childcare and health insurance.</p>
