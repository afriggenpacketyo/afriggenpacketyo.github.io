          <p>Icelandic singer and cellist Laufey has gained a significant following by blending modern pop sensibilities with classical and jazz influences, creating a whimsical and romantic sound. The 26-year-old artist, who recently won a Grammy Award, attributes her unique musical style to her childhood exposure to both classical violin from her mother and jazz from her father. In a recent interview, she reflected on her journey from feeling like an outsider in her youth to selling out concerts and collaborating with legends like Barbra Streisand. Her third album, "A Matter of Time," continues to explore this distinctive fusion of genres.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan described the recent summit between U.S. and Russian leaders in his state as a crucial preliminary step toward peace in Ukraine. He argued that a successful outcome would be securing a ceasefire, which would then allow for more complex negotiations involving Ukraine and European allies. Sullivan defended holding the meeting on American soil, stating that Alaska's significant military presence projects the strength necessary when dealing with Vladimir Putin. He also emphasized Alaska's strategic importance in the Arctic and discussed his efforts to advance local energy projects like the Alaska LNG Project.</p>

          <p>For over four decades, glaciologist Mauri Pelto has been documenting the rapid decline of glaciers in Washington State's North Cascade Mountains, a project driven by the stark impacts of climate change. He is joined by his daughter, Jill Pelto, an artist who translates the scientific data they collect into compelling watercolor paintings. Her work visually represents the alarming trends, such as glacier retreat and temperature rise, making the scientific findings accessible to a broader audience. Their collaborative effort highlights the dramatic environmental changes, with Mauri Pelto noting that 12 of the 47 glaciers he has studied have completely disappeared.</p>

          <p>Ronnie Rondell Jr., the veteran Hollywood stuntman famously set on fire for the cover of Pink Floyd's "Wish You Were Here" album, has passed away at the age of 88. His extensive career spanned decades and included stunt work in iconic films and TV shows such as "Lethal Weapon," "Spartacus," and "Star Trek: First Contact." The iconic 1975 album cover photograph required 15 takes, with the final one resulting in Rondell's mustache and an eyebrow being singed by the flames. He was a co-founder of the professional organization Stunts Unlimited and received a lifetime achievement award for his contributions to the industry.</p>

          <p>A derelict Napoleonic-era fortress on Thorne Island, off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been transformed into a luxury party destination and is now on the market for £3 million. The new owner purchased the historic, off-grid property in 2017 for £555,000 and undertook a challenging five-year renovation to make it habitable after 17 years of abandonment. The project involved overcoming significant logistical hurdles, such as installing running water by cutting through 16 feet of rock. The restored fort now features 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and its own nightclub, reviving its past reputation as a unique party venue.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Sparks forward Cameron Brink has revealed that creating vision boards was a key mental tool during her 13-month recovery from a torn ACL. The practice, suggested by veteran teammate Dearica Hamby, helped the former Stanford star stay positive and focused on her long-term goals during the arduous rehabilitation process. Brink's boards include aspirations like making the Olympic and WNBA All-Star teams, alongside personal goals, helping her visualize success and maintain a positive mindset.

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in California's Tulare County. The man, an experienced climber, was rappelling down the Seven Teacups waterfalls when the extreme force of the water pushed him off his lines and into a cave behind the cascade. After he was reported missing, search teams used a drone to locate him, finding him alive and conscious. A California Highway Patrol helicopter crew then performed a hoist rescue, lifting him to safety where he was treated for dehydration and minor injuries.</p>

          <p>Amid rising concerns over the affordability of higher education, a report highlights nine U.S. schools that charge no tuition for admitted students. These institutions, which include Berea College, College of the Ozarks, and all five U.S. military service academies, typically have highly selective admissions standards. In exchange for a free education, which often includes room and board, students are usually required to participate in comprehensive work programs or commit to several years of military service after graduation.

          <p>UCLA football coach DeShaun Foster implemented a series of "brotherhood meetings" during training camp to help bond a team with 55 new players and a largely new coaching staff. In these sessions, coaches and players shared personal and vulnerable stories about their lives and careers, leading to what Foster described as many emotional moments. The goal was to build trust and unity by encouraging players to lower their guards after seeing the coaching staff do the same. This focus on connection has resulted in a new team motto for the upcoming season: "We over me."</p>
