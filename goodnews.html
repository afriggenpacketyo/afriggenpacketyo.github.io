          <p>GE Appliances is investing $490 million to move its washer and dryer production from China to a new plant in Kentucky, a decision that will create 800 American jobs. An executive stated that while reshoring aligns with the company's long-term strategy of manufacturing products closer to their consumers, recent U.S. trade policies and tariffs on Chinese imports accelerated the move. The new facility is expected to be operational by early 2027, at which point the corresponding factory in China will cease production. The company is now hiring for various roles, including engineering and supply chain positions.</p>

          <p>The Privy Council in London, the highest court of appeal for the Cayman Islands, has upheld a 2020 law that legalized same-sex civil partnerships in the British overseas territory. The ruling rejected a legal challenge that argued the island's governor overstepped his authority by enacting the law after the local parliament had voted it down. This decision provides legal certainty for same-sex couples and is being hailed as a significant victory for LGBTQ+ rights advocates. Campaigners believe the judgment could positively influence similar legal battles for marriage equality in other British overseas territories.</p>

          <p>The Writers Guild of America (WGA) has removed producer Randall Emmett from its "strike list" after he paid a $630,000 debt. The payment resolves a five-year-old dispute stemming from his former company's failure to pay compensation and benefits to four writers for a proposed TV series. This resolution now allows WGA members to work with Emmett and his current production company, Convergence Entertainment Group. The move clears a significant hurdle for Emmett, who is trying to develop a new film project titled "Wall of White" in collaboration with director Martin Scorsese.</p>

          <p>The United States is developing a multibillion-dollar missile defense system, dubbed the "Golden Dome," intended to protect the nation from long-range missile threats and enhance deterrence against China. The project, initiated by an executive order from President Trump, would utilize a network of satellites and space-based sensors for missile interception. Analysts believe that if successfully implemented, the system could significantly bolster U.S. defensive capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly in a potential conflict scenario involving Taiwan. However, significant questions about the project's feasibility and cost remain subjects of debate and analysis.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explains Why Widespread Tariffs Have Not Yet Caused Major Price Spikes</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns that new tariffs would fuel inflation, U.S. prices have remained relatively stable, with key inflation gauges showing only modest increases. Economists suggest this is due to several short-term strategies employed by businesses to absorb the initial shock. Companies have been front-loading inventory, absorbing some costs to protect consumers, and using legal loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay duty payments. While these tactics have buffered the immediate impact, experts caution that prices are still likely to rise in the latter half of the year if the tariffs remain in place. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to lift some U.S. financial sanctions against Syria, a move the White House says is intended to help stabilize the country following the ousting of Bashar al-Assad. The order cancels a 2004 declaration that froze Syrian government assets but leaves other sanctions in place, including those under the Caesar Act. The directive instructs the Secretary of State to evaluate further sanctions relief, which could provide leverage in diplomatic talks. Syria's new government welcomed the decision, stating it opens the door for reconstruction and the return of displaced Syrians.</p>

          <p>Circle Internet Group, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, has applied for a national trust bank charter with the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). If approved, Circle would establish the First National Digital Currency Bank, allowing it to operate under federal regulation and potentially offer custody services for digital assets to institutional clients. This move follows Circle's successful IPO and aligns with its goal of integrating stablecoins into the traditional financial system.

Lee stated he could not secure enforceable safeguards to ensure the lands would only be sold to American families and not to corporate or foreign interests. The proposal faced bipartisan opposition from lawmakers in several Western states, who raised concerns about losing public access to land used for recreation and the potential for irreversible transfer of federal lands.

This article compares the potential interest earned on a $10,000 deposit in each.

However, CD rates are fixed, providing a guaranteed return, whereas money market rates are variable and could fall if the Federal Reserve cuts rates later this year as expected.
