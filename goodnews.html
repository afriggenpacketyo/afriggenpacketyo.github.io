          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to pardon reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who are currently serving prison sentences for bank fraud and tax evasion. The couple was sentenced in 2022, with Todd receiving 12 years and Julie receiving seven years. The Justice Department stated that the Chrisleys submitted false financial statements to obtain over $30 million in loans for luxury expenses and concealed income from the IRS to avoid paying nearly $500,000 in taxes. Trump stated that the couple received "pretty harsh treatment, based on what I'm hearing."</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's IPO is notable for its high proportion of shares being sold by existing shareholders rather than the company itself, a characteristic reminiscent of Facebook's 2012 IPO. In Circle's updated prospectus, 60% of the shares are being sold by existing shareholders, compared to 57% in Facebook's case. Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, is profitable and has significant cash reserves, but the high insider sales likely reflect venture capital firms' need for liquidity after a period of meager returns. This IPO offers a much-needed exit opportunity for private investors.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor is targeting significant growth in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) amid regulatory uncertainty and slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles. The company plans to increase PHEVs from 2.4% of its U.S. sales volume last year to roughly 20% by 2030. David Christ, head of the Toyota brand in North America, stated the company is working to increase the electric-only range of PHEVs. The planned expansion aligns with the California Air Resources Board's Advanced Clean Cars II rule, which requires automakers to exclusively sell zero-emission vehicles in the state by 2035.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has expressed his desire for Canada to join ReArm Europe, a major European plan to bolster defenses, by July 1. Carney aims to reduce Canada's reliance on the U.S. for defense, noting that 75% of Canadian defense capital spending goes to the U.S. This comes amid tensions with the U.S. and threats from President Trump. Canada's defense minister emphasized the need to boost defense capacity due to growing global threats and a focus on the Arctic, while the King's throne speech committed to "rebuilding, rearming, and reinvesting" in Canada's military.</p>

          <p>Medications and supplements can expire, becoming less potent or contaminated, so it's important to check expiration dates. Pharmacist Stacia Woodcock recommends against taking expired medication, as expiration dates ensure safety and effectiveness. Expired medications can be dangerous, especially in emergencies, like asthma attacks. For safe disposal, Woodcock suggests using medication take-back locations or mixing the medication with coffee grounds or kitty litter before throwing it away. Properly storing medication in a cool, dry place like a kitchen cabinet is also crucial.</p>

Separately, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and other nations are trimming production by 1.66 million barrels per day until the end of next year. A further production increase in July is likely, pending weekend discussions, as concerns grow that some members are not respecting quotas. (not investment advice)</p>
