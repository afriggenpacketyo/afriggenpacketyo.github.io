          <p>HSBC has announced a plan to take its subsidiary, Hang Seng Bank, private, leading to a nearly 30% surge in the Hong Kong-based lender's shares. This proposed deal values Hang Seng Bank at over $37 billion, offering shareholders HK$155 per share, which represents a significant 33% premium over its recent average price. HSBC, holding about 63% of Hang Seng, aims to strengthen its overall banking presence in Hong Kong and address inherent governance issues linked to parent-subsidiary double listings. Group Chief Executive Georges Elhedery stated the deal would preserve Hang Seng's brand while investing to enhance its products, services, and technology. This strategic move also reflects HSBC's confidence in Hong Kong as a leading global financial center. The article highlights Hang Seng Bank's recent increase in bad loans due to its concentration in the embattled real estate sectors of Hong Kong and mainland China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have reached an agreement on the "first phase" of a peace deal, which includes the release of all remaining hostages and a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops. The agreement, brokered with the help of regional sources and mediators, is expected to see hostages released, potentially by Monday, and will also include the return of deceased hostages' bodies. While procedural issues remain, the deal is slated for approval by Israel's cabinet, after which Israeli forces would withdraw to an agreed-upon line in Gaza. This initial phase aims to end the two-year conflict, with further negotiations expected on complex issues like Gaza's governance and Hamas's disarmament.</p>

          <p>SoftBank's shares surged by 13% after the Japanese conglomerate announced its agreement to acquire the robotics division of Swiss engineering firm ABB for $5.4 billion. This strategic acquisition is set to significantly advance SoftBank's footprint in Artificial Intelligence, particularly in its vision for "Physical AI" and "Artificial Super Intelligence." SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son aims to fuse ASI and robotics to drive groundbreaking evolution. This deal, subject to regulatory approval, also means ABB will no longer pursue a separate listing for its robotics business. The article highlights SoftBank's continued investments in AI-related technologies, including its ownership of Arm and a stake in OpenAI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A potential peace deal or durable ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could mark President Trump's most significant diplomatic achievement, yet the details and implementation remain complex. The "first phase" involves hostage returns and Israeli troop withdrawal, but previous attempts at ceasefires have faltered, and critical issues like Hamas's future and Gaza's governance are still unresolved. The article highlights Trump's personal motivation, including a desire for a Nobel Peace Prize, influencing the rapid push for a deal. Both Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and Hamas face political pressures, raising concerns about the deal's longevity and whether Israel might resume its offensive once hostages are returned.</p>

          <p>Derrick Groves, the last of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in May, has been captured in Atlanta following a multi-agency manhunt and brief standoff. Groves was found in a crawl space after a SWAT team deployed gas canisters at a residence on Honeysuckle Lane. His arrest concludes a months-long search that began after a jailbreak where inmates fled through a hole behind a toilet, attributed partly to prison staffing and design flaws. Groves, a convicted violent offender facing life imprisonment for multiple killings, will be extradited to Louisiana, with authorities also investigating those who aided his escape.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the Greater Bay Area, encompassing Hong Kong, Macau, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou, should pursue hosting the Olympic Games. The author contends that such a bid offers a unique opportunity to foster community integration, inspire youth, champion health initiatives, and instill regional pride, ultimately redefining the area's global standing. Beyond infrastructure and commerce, hosting the Olympics could enhance social cohesion, allowing residents to move more freely and collaborate, strengthening their sense of connection. The article suggests that sports possess a unique ability to unite people from diverse backgrounds, catalyzing cross-boundary integration through shared training and competition.</p>

          <p>Eight people sustained injuries when a Metrolink train arriving at Los Angeles' Union Station collided with a stationary, empty train on Wednesday morning. The incident, occurring around 7:30 a.m., led to one passenger being hospitalized and six others, along with the train conductor, suffering minor injuries. Ventura County Line Train 104, carrying 85 passengers, struck an unoccupied Metrolink train at the platform, leading to the cancellation of two subsequent San Bernardino Line trains. The cause of this collision is currently under investigation by Metrolink's safety, security, and compliance department. Fortunately, the operational impact was not severe due to the frequent schedule of San Bernardino Line trains.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed 20-point plan for peace in Gaza, backed by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, outlines an immediate ceasefire, hostage release, and phased Israeli troop withdrawal. The plan calls for Hamas to free all remaining Israeli hostages within 72 hours, in exchange for Israel releasing 250 Palestinian life-sentence prisoners and 1,700 other detainees. Gaza would be demilitarized under international supervision and governed by a "technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee" overseen by a "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump. While the plan offers a "credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood," it avoids explicit details on an independent Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>Principal Benjamin Honoroff transformed Middle School 50 in Brooklyn, New York, from a "persistently dangerous" and under-enrolled institution into a thriving academic environment by integrating debate into every class. A former high school debate coach, Honoroff expanded the debate team, leading to a third of students enrolling and participating in tournaments. This innovative approach significantly improved academic performance, with proficiency scores in English and math jumping from single digits to 60% and 70% respectively.

          <p>Supreme Court justices, both conservative and liberal, expressed skepticism during arguments in a case challenging Illinois' voting regulation allowing mail-in ballots to be counted up to 14 days post-election. Republican Rep. Michael Bost sued, claiming harm despite winning, arguing the rule lowered his victory margin and incurred staff costs. Justices questioned the standing of candidates who win or have no chance of winning to challenge election rules. They criticized Bost's complaint for lacking specific facts and Illinois' argument for potentially creating a "disaster" by limiting who can sue. The session highlighted the complex legal interpretations of election regulations and candidate standing.</p>

          <p>Terri Lesley, a former library director in Wyoming's Campbell County, has won a $700,000 settlement after being fired amid a dispute over books with sexual and LGBTQ+ themes. Lesley, who sued over her termination, felt "vindicated" by the settlement, asserting she stood up for the First Amendment. She had been dismissed in 2023, two years into the controversy, where public officials in the conservative area sided with objectors seeking to remove the books from youth shelves. Lesley's attorney hopes the outcome sends a message to other library districts about constitutional obligations against discrimination. A separate lawsuit against individuals who contested the books will continue.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled for a "routine yearly checkup" at Walter Reed national military medical center, his second since returning to the White House in January. The White House press secretary stated that Trump will also meet with troops and make remarks during his visit. This follows an April examination that included cognitive and cardiology tests, after which his physician declared him "fully fit" for the presidency. Concerns about the president's health, including a recent diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency and bruising on his hand, have fueled online speculation, which Trump has publicly dismissed. The article notes Trump is also considering a trip to the Middle East shortly after his checkup.</p>
