        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts warn against the risky credit card behavior known as 'credit cycling,' where users repeatedly max out their credit limit and pay it down to free up more credit. While occasional credit cycling might seem harmless, consistently doing so can lead to card issuers canceling the user's card and revoking reward points, potentially harming their credit score. Credit card companies view this behavior as a red flag, possibly indicating financial difficulty or even illegal activities like money laundering. To avoid these risks, consumers should seek alternative financial solutions instead of relying on credit cycling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is commemorating its 250th anniversary with a large-scale military parade in Washington, D.C., coinciding with President Trump's 79th birthday.
