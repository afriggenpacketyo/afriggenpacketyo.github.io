          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is set to announce an update to its Graviton4 chip, featuring 600 gigabits per second of network bandwidth, positioning it as the highest offering in the public cloud. This CPU is a product of Amazon's Annapurna Labs and showcases the company's successful custom chip strategy, challenging traditional semiconductor players like Intel and AMD. AWS is also investing heavily in AI infrastructure, including Project Rainier, an AI supercomputer built for startup Anthropic, aiming to reduce AI training costs and provide an alternative to Nvidia's expensive GPUs. Anthropic's Claude Opus 4 AI model launched on Trainium2 GPUs, with Project Rainier powered by over half a million of these chips.</p>

          <p>The Senate has passed the GENIUS Act, a landmark bill to regulate crypto, with bipartisan support, establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The bill passed with a 68 to 30 vote, with Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty emphasizing its potential to usher in a new era of faster and cheaper payments. Concerns about President Trump's involvement in the crypto sphere led to stronger provisions safeguarding against corruption while protecting consumers, the financial system, and national security. The changes include requiring members of Congress and Executive Branch officials to disclose stablecoin holdings over $5,000, stronger bankruptcy protections for bank depositors, and directing the Treasury to issue formal rules for monitoring suspicious transactions.

Starmer emphasized the importance of the US-UK trade deal for protecting jobs at Jaguar Land Rover and in the firm's supply chain. The new arrangement removes tariffs on the aerospace sector and reduces the levy on cars exported from the UK to the US to 10%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament (MPs) have voted to decriminalize abortion for women in England and Wales, marking the most significant change to abortion laws in nearly 60 years. The amendment, passed by a majority of 242 votes, ensures that women who terminate their pregnancy outside the current legal framework will no longer face criminal investigation. The law will still penalize anyone who assists a woman in getting an abortion outside the current legal framework, including medical professionals. Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, who put forward the amendment, highlighted cases where women had been arrested for illegal abortion offences.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik, convicted of murdering her husband in 2001, had her conviction overturned after spending two decades in prison, thanks to new evidence and re-examination of old evidence. Working with Loyola Project for the Innocent, new DNA testing revealed foreign male DNA on items like the rope found around her husband's neck. The prosecution's case relied heavily on blood evidence in the bedroom, but it was found that not all stains were tested and some were not blood. Dorotik has filed a civil suit against the County of San Diego.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik, whose murder conviction was overturned after nearly two decades, maintains her innocence and questions the validity of the evidence used against her, especially the claim that her bedroom was the crime scene. Despite her conviction, new evidence revealed that several blood-like stains in the bedroom were not blood, and the prosecution's narrative of a violent assault in the bedroom is questioned. Her appellate team says that several blood-like stains on items including a pillow sham, the nightstand and a lampshade turned out not to be blood. In May 2022, just as jury selection was about to begin, the prosecutors dropped the charges.</p>

The baby, weighing 1lb 13oz, is currently in the neonatal intensive care unit and is expected to be OK. Smith is set to be taken off of life support, following controversy over Georgia's abortion ban, which initially required her to be kept on life support. Georgia‚Äôs ban contains provisions that strengthen the concept of ‚Äúfetal personhood‚Äù, a legal doctrine that holds that embryos and fetuses should be entitled to full legal rights and protections.</p>
