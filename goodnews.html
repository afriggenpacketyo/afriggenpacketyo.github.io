          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates at its upcoming meeting, financial experts are advising savers to consider opening Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts to lock in currently favorable rates. Although top CD rates have fallen from their recent peaks, they still offer significantly higher returns than traditional savings accounts. The article suggests specific strategies, such as using a 6-month CD for short-term gains or a longer-term 3-year CD for a more substantial, guaranteed return. Acting before the expected rate cut is crucial, as banks may lower their offered CD rates in anticipation of the Fed's decision. (not investment advice)</p>

This strategic push comes as China imposes export restrictions on these essential minerals, which are vital for technology, defense, and electric vehicles.

          <p>The new U.S.-Australia agreement on rare earths is a strategic move setting the stage for President Trump's upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit. The pact aims to create a secure mineral supply chain, thereby reducing what top economic adviser Kevin Hassett called exposure to "rare earth extortion" from China. While President Trump has expressed optimism about reaching a "good deal" with China, he has not ruled out imposing 100% tariffs if tensions escalate. Analysts suggest the administration views the tariffs as leverage and is unlikely to abandon them unilaterally, indicating a complex negotiation ahead.</p>

          <p>As Spain's La Liga and Italy's Serie A plan to host regular-season games abroad, they may look to the NFL's highly successful international model for guidance. Since 2005, the NFL has grown its global presence by staging games in iconic stadiums, ensuring a seamless experience for teams, and investing in grassroots programs like flag football years before a game arrives. This long-term strategy has proven profitable, with the league's shared income nearly tripling since 2010. The NFL's approach of building fandom and community engagement in international markets provides a valuable case study for other sports leagues seeking to expand their global footprint.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve beginning to lower its benchmark rate, retirees are questioning the best time to purchase annuities, as their payouts are closely tied to prevailing interest rates. Generally, it is more advantageous to buy fixed annuities when interest rates are high, because insurance companies can generate greater returns on the premiums invested, leading to higher guaranteed income streams for the buyer. While rates are still relatively high, trying to perfectly time the market peak is risky. The article suggests that the current environment presents a favorable opportunity for those seeking to secure a stable, lifelong income for retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

The holiday is marked by lighting oil lamps, exchanging sweets, and gathering with family and friends. However, the tradition of setting off firecrackers has become a point of contention due to severe air pollution, particularly in Delhi, leading India's Supreme Court to permit only the sale of less-polluting "green" firecrackers. As part of the celebrations, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited navy personnel aboard the INS Vikrant, hailing the country's military strength in his Diwali address.</p>
