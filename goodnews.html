          <p>As the September 11th attacks move further into the past, educators are developing new strategies to ensure the event's significance is understood by students with no memory of it. Teachers are participating in programs, such as those hosted by the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, to learn directly from survivors and first responders. This allows them to convey the human impact and historical context of the attacks, focusing on themes of trauma, unity, and resilience. By incorporating firsthand accounts and exploring the subsequent global war on terror, these educators aim to make the lessons of 9/11 a critical and mandatory part of the history curriculum nationwide.</p>

          <p>In an article on managing stress, Dr. Xand van Tulleken offers five science-backed tips to help individuals regain control when feeling overwhelmed. He advises against stressing about stress itself, emphasizing that it is a normal part of life. The key recommendations include engaging in physical exercise to help the body manage cortisol spikes, prioritizing a consistent sleep schedule, and focusing on self-care through good nutrition and dedicated alone time. Finally, he suggests practicing mindfulness not as formal meditation, but as an intentional approach to planning and pacing oneself through daily challenges to mitigate their stressful impact.</p>

          <p>China is adopting a more targeted and practical approach to artificial intelligence development, contrasting with the massive investment strategy seen in the United States. Instead of chasing human-level artificial general intelligence, Beijing is focusing on integrating AI into key sectors of its economy like the power grid and coal industry through its "AI+" initiative. This strategy is supported by a discreet national AI fund of over $8 billion, aiming to leverage existing resources and talent to overcome hardware limitations imposed by U.S. restrictions. Experts note this resourceful approach has already allowed Chinese companies to produce competitive and cost-effective AI models, challenging U.S. dominance in the field.</p>

          <p>China's domestically produced C919 passenger jet may secure its first major international airline deal, as Capital A, the parent company of AirAsia, has confirmed it is in active discussions to purchase the aircraft. CEO Tony Fernandes announced the negotiations, highlighting the growing interest in the single-aisle jet, which is designed to compete with the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. A sale to a prominent carrier like AirAsia would represent a significant breakthrough for the state-owned manufacturer Comac and China's ambitions in the global aviation market. The move reflects strengthening economic ties and flight connections between China and Southeast Asian nations.</p>

          <p>Following a successful initial public offering where its shares climbed significantly, financial analyst Jim Cramer has suggested that Klarna's stock remains a potential purchase at its current valuation. The Swedish "buy now, pay later" company saw its shares rise over 14% on its first day of trading. Cramer noted the company's solid growth, improving fundamentals, and strong underwriting standards, even while acknowledging it is not yet profitable. He compared its potential favorably to peers like Affirm, suggesting its current market valuation of over $17 billion has room to grow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>California Lawmakers Propose Overhaul of Los Angeles 'Mansion Tax' to Boost Housing</h2>

          <p>State lawmakers in California have introduced a bill to significantly reform Measure ULA, the controversial "mansion tax" in Los Angeles, in an effort to stimulate housing construction. The proposal, negotiated with Mayor Karen Bass, would reduce the tax rate on sales of recently built apartment buildings and commercial properties, which critics argue has chilled development. The legislation is also part of a broader political strategy to counter a statewide ballot initiative that seeks to nullify Measure ULA entirely. While supporters of the original measure are concerned about lost revenue for homeless programs, proponents of the reform argue it is a necessary fix.</p>

          <h2>The Decline of Traditional TV Cooking Shows Amidst the Rise of Online Food Content</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 19:17:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Traditional "stand and stir" television cooking shows are experiencing a dramatic decline in viewership and new commissions, with broadcasters like the BBC producing far fewer programs than in previous years. This shift is attributed to the explosive growth of food content on platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok, where creators can respond to trends almost instantly. Online food influencers offer a more authentic, less polished style that resonates with younger audiences, who often perceive traditional TV as overly produced. While cooking competition shows like 'The Great British Bake Off' remain popular, the broader genre is struggling to compete with the speed and cultural relevance of digital media.</p>

          <p>On the 30th anniversary of CNBC's "Squawk Box," host Jim Cramer reflected on the changes in market sentiment over the past three decades. He recalled the early days of the show in the 1990s, when there was widespread optimism and excitement among individual investors, a spirit he feels is returning to the market today. Cramer noted that after the dot-com bubble burst, many investors shifted to index funds out of fear, but now sees a renewed interest in single-stock opportunities. He believes the current market, with significant gains in large individual stocks like Nvidia and Oracle, is reawakening awareness about potential rewards. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Online real estate company Opendoor announced a major leadership shake-up, naming former Shopify executive Kaz Nejatian as its new CEO and appointing co-founder Keith Rabois as chairman of the board. The news was met with strong investor approval, causing the company's stock to surge by 30% in extended trading. These changes follow a period of pressure from investors, including Rabois, who had called for the resignation of the previous CEO. The move signals a new strategic direction for the tech-based home-buying platform, which has seen a dramatic fifteenfold increase in its stock value since hitting a low in June.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are studying Australia's peacock spiders to understand their extraordinary diversity, with over 100 known species. The key may lie in what is known as 'dark DNA'—the non-gene portions of the genetic code whose functions are largely unknown. Scientists hypothesize that this dark DNA, which is three times more abundant in these spiders than in humans, could be enabling their rapid evolution and adaptation into new species. By analyzing the DNA of every known species, the research team hopes to unlock the mechanisms behind their varied colors and mating dances, potentially providing broader insights into biodiversity and evolution.</p>

          <p>For the first time since the pandemic began, COVID-19 is no longer one of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States, according to preliminary data from the CDC. After peaking as the third leading cause of death in 2021, its ranking has steadily declined, though it remains a significant cause of mortality. The overall death rate in the U.S. also decreased by 4% in 2024, marking the third consecutive year of decline. Heart disease and cancer continue to be the top two causes of death, responsible for over 40% of all fatalities in the country.</p>
