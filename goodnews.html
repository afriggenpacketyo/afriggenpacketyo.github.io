        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Nations' International Court of Justice is set to deliver a historic advisory opinion on the legal obligations countries have to protect the climate from greenhouse gas emissions. Prompted by lobbying from vulnerable island nations like Vanuatu, the court will address what actions are required under international law and the legal consequences for states that cause significant environmental harm. Although the opinion is non-binding, it is expected to establish a crucial legal benchmark that could influence future climate-related lawsuits and international agreements. The decision represents a significant moment for climate justice, potentially defining the legal responsibilities of nations in the global climate crisis.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 01:01:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major international luxury brands are increasingly incorporating cafes and coffee shops into their retail stores across China to attract consumers and enhance their brand experience. Companies like LVMH, Celine, and Giorgio Armani have recently opened in-store dining spaces in major cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, and Beijing. This strategy leverages the high profit margins of beverages and the relatively low operating costs of cafes compared to expensive marketing campaigns like celebrity endorsements. In a time of subdued consumer spending in China, this model offers a cost-effective way for brands to increase foot traffic and market themselves to a wider audience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams, at 45 years old, became the second-oldest woman in the professional era to win a tour-level singles match by defeating 23-year-old Peyton Stearns at the DC Open. This victory marks her first singles win in nearly two years, following a significant layoff for surgery to remove uterine fibroids. The only player to win a match at an older age was Martina Navratilova, who was 47. Williams, a former world No. 1, showcased glimpses of her classic power, delivering serves faster than 110 mph and demonstrating her enduring talent and determination to compete at a high level after overcoming health challenges.</p>

          <p>Kendrick Lamar and SZA's co-headlining "Grand National" tour received high praise for its London performance, where the two artists seamlessly blended their distinct styles into a cohesive two-and-a-half-hour show. The concert at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium celebrated Lamar's album "GNX" and SZA's "SOS," stripping back elaborate gimmicks to focus on their extensive musical catalogs. Despite their different artistic approaches—Lamar's intense social commentary versus SZA's melodic explorations of relationships—the show was praised for its seamless transitions and high energy. The performance of Lamar's diss track "Not Like Us" was a major highlight, creating an electric atmosphere and showcasing both artists at the peak of their careers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new trade framework with Japan, which includes a 15% tariff on imported Japanese goods, a reduction from a previously threatened 25% rate. As part of the agreement, President Trump stated that Japan will invest $550 billion into the United States and open its markets to American automobiles and agricultural products. This deal is part of a broader strategy to use tariffs as leverage in international trade negotiations, with similar agreements announced for the Philippines and Indonesia. While the administration touts these deals as beneficial for American jobs and manufacturing, concerns remain about their potential to increase consumer prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of major Japanese automakers, including Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, experienced a significant surge after reports that the United States would lower its auto tariffs to 15% from a threatened 25%. Toyota's stock jumped over 15%, while Honda and Nissan also saw substantial gains, reflecting the auto industry's critical importance to Japan's economy. The auto sector, which accounts for nearly a third of all Japanese exports to the U.S., had seen a sharp decline in shipments since higher tariffs were imposed. The announcement provides short-term relief and renewed confidence for the industry, though long-term challenges from international competitors remain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 13-million-year-old fossilized leg bone of a "terror bird," a large, flightless predator, shows distinct teeth marks that scientists believe were made by an even larger reptile. Researchers in Colombia used 3D scans to match the puncture marks to Purussaurus neivensis, an extinct caiman species that could grow up to five meters long. The terror bird, which stood about 2.5 meters tall, was a top predator of its time, making this discovery rare evidence of a battle between two apex predators. Since the bone shows no signs of healing, scientists conclude the bird either died in the attack or was scavenged shortly after, offering new insights into the ancient ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Economic experts are urging Chinese companies to more deeply integrate with local economies in Southeast Asia rather than simply using the region for transshipments to evade US tariffs. The advice comes after the U.S. announced steep tariffs on goods suspected of being rerouted through countries like Vietnam to circumvent duties on Chinese products. An economist from the Asean+3 Macroeconomic Research Office suggested that by becoming more ingrained in local supply chains, Chinese firms can create more sustainable, long-term business models. This strategy would not only benefit local Asean economies but also shield businesses from the unpredictability of US tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

The identification was made through a combination of scientific analysis, including dendrochronology on its timbers, and historical research by the local community. Originally named HMS Hind, the ship was built in 1749 and had a storied career before it was wrecked in a storm in 1788, with all crew members surviving. The discovery highlights the rich maritime history of the Orkney Islands and showcases a successful model of community-driven archaeology.</p>
