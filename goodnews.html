          <p>Asian stock markets, including China and Hong Kong, surged significantly on Monday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled potential monetary policy easing next month. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed over 2%, nearing a four-year peak, driven by strong performances in the tech sector, including companies like Baidu and Nio. Mainland China's CSI 300 also extended its gains for a fourth consecutive session, reaching a 37-month high. Analysts at Goldman Sachs suggest that maturing time deposits could shift into equities, sustaining market momentum, especially if Fed rate cuts trigger capital rotation from the U.S. to China.

          <p>Chinese electric carmaker Nio's Hong Kong-listed shares surged by more than 14% on Monday, extending a remarkable seven-session rally. This impressive gain follows the company's recent unveiling of its latest ES8 SUV model on August 21, priced at a more accessible 308,800 yuan ($43,000) under a battery subscription plan. This strategic move aims to boost Nio's market share amidst mounting pressure and intense competition within China's electric vehicle sector. The company is also expanding its reach by launching two new, more affordable brands, Onvo and Firefly, to capture a broader range of customers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singapore's inflation rate cooled to a lower-than-expected 0.6% in July, reaching its lowest point since January 2021, as the city-state anticipates slower economic growth later this year. Core inflation, which excludes private transport and accommodation costs, also dipped to 0.5%, driven by a fall in retail and other goods prices, alongside lower electricity and gas inflation. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) projects inflation to remain "moderate" in the near term, citing easing global crude oil prices and contained food commodity hikes. This article suggests that the latest inflation reading could strengthen the case for the MAS to consider loosening its monetary policy during its upcoming October meeting.

          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper announced an agreement to acquire Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's in a substantial $18 billion deal, a strategic move aimed at revitalizing the U.S. giant's struggling coffee business. The transaction involves a cash payment of 31.85 euros ($37.3) per share to JDE Peet's shareholders, representing a significant 33% premium. This acquisition is projected to generate $400 million in cost synergies over the next three years. Following the completion of the deal, Keurig Dr Pepper intends to separate its beverage and coffee units into two distinct, U.S.-listed companies, effectively reversing its 2018 merger.
