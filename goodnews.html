        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate slowed to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, aligning with economists' expectations. The easing was partly attributed to a drop in rice prices after the government released stockpiles, though inflation remains above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for the 39th consecutive month. Despite this, economists express concern over persistent inflationary pressures and the potential impact of U.S. tariffs, which could hinder economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz admitted that European nations have historically "been free-riders" on U.S. defense spending but stated they are now committed to increasing their own contributions. In a BBC interview, Merz emphasized that Russia poses a significant threat to European peace and that Germany is undergoing a major increase in its defense budget. He also highlighted efforts to strengthen a "triangular alliance" with the UK and France to bolster European security, foreign policy, and economic growth, independent of American defense.</p>

Protesters' demands included an end to the administration's crackdowns on civil rights, the targeting of minority groups, and cuts to social programs.</p>

          <p>During the first round of The Open Championship, golfer Jon Rahm verbally confronted a spectator after his tee shot on the 10th hole went into the rough. Rahm claimed a fan whistled during his backswing, causing a distraction at a critical moment on a difficult hole. The two-time major champion appeared visibly upset, questioning the timing of the noise. He later downplayed the incident to the media, acknowledging it was likely unintentional but noting the bad timing, and admitted he also had a bad swing.</p>

          <h2>China Reveals New Military Drone with Vertical Take-Off and Landing Capability</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 22:00:14 EDT</div>

          <p>China has unveiled a new military drone that takes off and lands vertically on its tail, similar to a rocket, before transitioning to horizontal flight. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which resembles the U.S. military's MQ-35 V-BAT, demonstrated its reconnaissance and autonomous operational capabilities in a recent drill. Developed by state-owned Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, the drone's design allows for rapid deployment and retrieval from rugged terrain without needing a runway, enhancing its operational flexibility for potential drone swarm applications.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on social media that Coca-Cola has agreed to begin producing its signature soda with cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup, a move he championed for its superior taste. The announcement, which Coca-Cola has not yet fully confirmed, aligns with health narratives promoted by figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has criticized corn syrup. However, public health experts note that cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup are metabolically almost identical, making the health benefits of such a switch negligible compared to reducing overall soda consumption.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is reviewing its long-standing restrictions on liquids in carry-on bags. Speaking at a conference, Noem said she is questioning "everything TSA does" and that the size limits for liquids "may be the next big announcement." This follows the recent immediate removal of the requirement for passengers to take off their shoes during security screening. Any change would be enabled by new CT scanning technology being deployed at airports, which provides more detailed imaging of baggage contents.</p>

          <p>Members of Congress from both parties joined together as a single team to compete against a team of journalists in the annual Congressional Women's Softball Game. The event sets aside partisan politics to raise money and awareness for the Young Survival Coalition, a charity that supports young adults diagnosed with breast cancer. Co-founded in 2009 by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a breast cancer survivor herself, the game has raised nearly $5 million for the cause and serves as a rare display of unity and common purpose on Capitol Hill.</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old from Colchester, Essex, has fully immersed himself in the culture and style of the 1940s, an era he fell in love with after learning about the World Wars.

His passion extends to his job at a 1940s-themed tea room and his desire to remember the sacrifices of the wartime generation, expressing a belief that people today should show more care for that history.</p>

          <p>An ice core, potentially the oldest ever recovered at 1.5 million years old, has been transported from Antarctica to a specialized lab in the UK. Scientists at the British Antarctic Survey will melt the ice to analyze its contents, including trapped dust, ash, and ancient air bubbles. This research aims to unlock crucial information about Earth's climate history from a previously unknown period, particularly a mysterious shift in glacial cycles. The findings could revolutionize our understanding of climate change and help predict how the planet will respond to current warming.</p>

          <p>New UK regulations coming into force next July will require "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) providers like Klarna and Clearpay to conduct stricter affordability checks on shoppers. The move, overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority, aims to protect consumers from accumulating excessive debt and will bring the largely unregulated sector in line with other forms of credit. As a result, some shoppers may be refused credit, and users will gain rights to complain to the Financial Ombudsman and receive clearer information on terms and fees.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common vein condition, following speculation over photographs showing bruising on his hand and swelling in his legs. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the condition is benign and common in individuals over 70, causing blood to pool in the lower limbs. A physician's note confirmed the diagnosis, adding there was no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis, and reiterated that the 79-year-old president remains in "excellent health."</p>
