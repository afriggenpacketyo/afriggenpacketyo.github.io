          <p>Energy management company Schneider Electric is partnering with Nvidia to address the increasing energy demands of artificial intelligence infrastructure. The collaboration focuses on creating blueprints for AI-ready data centers, integrating advanced power management and liquid cooling systems specifically for Nvidia's high-consumption chips, including the new Blackwell series. Schneider Electric's chairman, Jean-Pascal Tricoire, highlights that AI can improve energy efficiency by a factor of four to nine times more than it consumes. This partnership positions Schneider to capitalize on the explosive growth of AI data centers driven by companies like Nvidia and OpenAI.</p>

          <p>Arianna Huffington is advocating against the cultural belief that overwork is necessary for success, labeling it a "collective delusion." Recounting her own collapse from exhaustion and sleep deprivation in 2007, she emphasizes that scientific data shows people are more effective when they allow time to recharge. As CEO of Thrive Global, she promotes the concept of "micro steps"—small, incremental changes—to build healthier habits rather than relying on drastic resolutions. Huffington notes that while some cultural shifts are happening, many younger professionals still fear falling behind if they prioritize self-care.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced an agreement with Pfizer to voluntarily lower the prices of some of its most popular medications for American consumers. Under the deal, Pfizer will sell drugs to Medicaid patients at the lowest price offered in other developed nations and will offer similar pricing for new drugs across various markets. In exchange, Pfizer will receive a three-year exemption from potential pharmaceutical tariffs, contingent on its planned $70 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing. The White House is also launching a website, TrumpRx.gov, for consumers to purchase these discounted drugs directly.</p>

          <p>Jamie Siminoff, founder of the video doorbell company Ring, has returned as its CEO after a brief departure, reaffirming the company's mission to "make neighborhoods safer." He highlighted the role of artificial intelligence, such as the new "Search Party" feature, in enhancing security and aiding in tasks like finding lost pets. Siminoff addressed past controversies regarding police partnerships, stating that while he "backs the blue," Ring's role is to facilitate privacy-centric footage requests through partners like Axon, not to provide direct access. His return signals a renewed focus on the company's core security-oriented goals under its parent company, Amazon.</p>

          <p>In his "Dear James" column, writer James Parker responds to a reader struggling with maintaining the creative drive for a weekly writing project. The reader, who had been composing odes to local food and drink, finds their initial fire has dwindled. Parker relates his own experience of losing his connection to "the odeness"—the essential quality of a subject—after publishing a book of his own odes. He advises the reader to broaden their range to more abstract topics and notes that odes need not always be rapturous, but simply true to their form, suggesting that the ability to connect with inspiration can return.</p>

          <p>A new Hulu documentary, "Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery," examines the legacy of the all-female touring music festival from the late 1990s, aiming to correct caricatured myths and highlight its significance. The film explores how co-founder Sarah McLachlan created the festival in response to a male-dominated industry that limited opportunities for women artists. It showcases the rare sense of community, safety, and collective power the event fostered among performers and audiences alike. The documentary reflects on what has been lost since, contrasting the festival's sincere, purpose-driven atmosphere with today's more ironic and detached cultural landscape.</p>

          <p>Despite recent Federal Reserve rate cuts, savers can still strategically use certificates of deposit (CDs) to earn significant interest. The article outlines several methods to earn approximately $1,000, such as depositing $24,000 into a one-year CD with a 4.20% rate or $8,200 into a three-year CD at 3.95%. It emphasizes the importance of acting promptly to lock in current high rates before they decline further. The piece also suggests CD laddering—opening multiple CDs with staggered maturity dates—as a timely strategy to maintain flexibility while capitalizing on the current interest rate environment.

Howe stated that the criticism is "irrelevant" and that transfer fees are dictated by market forces, not by any single club's opinion. He defended the acquisition, praising Woltemade's strong start with two goals in three games despite having little training time. Howe emphasized that the player's performance on the field is what matters, not the price tag, and urged his team to use a recent loss as motivation.</p>

This mirrors the Soviet era, when the state banned Western and homegrown rock bands, which only increased their popularity.

Separately, the agency granted approval for traditional mutual fund companies to offer their portfolios as an ETF share class, with dozens of firms already having applications pending.

An event called Baptize America recently saw approximately 30,000 people baptized nationwide, reflecting a broader trend of young people turning to Christianity, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic. Research indicates that belief in Jesus among this demographic is growing, and for the first time, Gen Z men are more likely to attend church than their female counterparts.
