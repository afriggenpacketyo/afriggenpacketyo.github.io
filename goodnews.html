          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust has exited its position in Abbott Laboratories, selling 250 shares for an average gain of approximately 24% on stock purchased in April and May 2024. The decision follows Abbott's recent mixed quarterly results, where strength in medical devices was offset by softness in nutrition and diagnostics, and a lack of positive earnings revisions for the second consecutive quarter. The Trust aims to free up this capital for better opportunities and increase its cash position to around 7.5% of the portfolio, providing flexibility should market volatility arise from U.S.-China trade relations.

          <p>Tobacco consumption in Southeast Asia has significantly decreased over the past two decades, with smoking prevalence falling from 54% to 23% between 2000 and 2020, according to a WHO report. This progress is attributed to strengthened policies on taxation, packaging, advertising bans, and public smoking restrictions across most countries. However, despite per capita declines, the absolute number of smokers has risen due to population growth. The region now faces the new challenge of rising e-cigarette use, with several countries banning vaping outright, while others like Malaysia struggle with political resistance to regulation, highlighting ongoing public health battles.</p>
