In New York, the theme was "Rise Up: Pride in Protest," commemorating the 1969 Stonewall Riots. Simultaneously, a massive Pride march in Budapest, Hungary, defied a government ban, highlighting the global nature of the struggle for LGBTQ+ rights against conservative political movements that have been cracking down on public expression and legal recognition.</p>

          <p>A young male mountain lion cub, found with a fractured skull and other severe injuries after being struck by a vehicle, has been successfully rehabilitated and released back into the wild. The San Diego Humane Society's Ramona Wildlife Center cared for the cub for nearly five months, focusing on medical treatment while ensuring it did not become habituated to humans. After gaining sufficient weight and demonstrating natural survival instincts, the cub was released in a remote area of the Santa Ana Mountains. The center is currently caring for two other orphaned mountain lion cubs with the same goal of eventual release.</p>

          <p>Despite being declared extinct nearly 40 years ago, the search for the thylacine, or Tasmanian tiger, remains a passionate obsession for many in Australia. Enthusiasts spend significant time and money setting up trail cameras and searching for evidence, fueled by thousands of reported sightings and a deep-seated hope. This quest has also entered the scientific realm, with a de-extinction project at the University of Melbourne aiming to resurrect the species. Researchers are working to engineer the genome of the thylacine's closest living relative, the dunnart, to bring back the iconic marsupial predator, though some experts remain skeptical about the project's feasibility.</p>

          <p>Renowned German director Werner Herzog, now 82, is known for his extensive and unusual body of work, comprising over 70 films that explore the extremes of nature and human sanity. In a recent interview, he reflected on his career, from the grueling production of "Fitzcarraldo," where he famously had a real 340-ton steamship hauled over a mountain, to his unromantic view of nature as depicted in "Grizzly Man." Herzog, who never had formal film training, emphasizes the need for "good criminal energy" and real-life experience for aspiring filmmakers, even teaching unconventional skills like forging permits and lock-picking in his workshops.</p>

          <p>Sealand, a World War II-era anti-aircraft platform in the North Sea, continues to assert its status as the world's smallest sovereign state, complete with its own royal family, currency, and constitution. Originally established in 1967 by pirate radio broadcaster Roy Bates, the micronation has a history of fending off invasions and even a coup attempt, which led to de facto recognition from a German diplomat. Today, Sealand is maintained by a single full-time resident and is led by Prince Michael Bates. The nation primarily sustains itself by selling noble titles online, embracing its unique mythology of defiance and freedom from the sea.</p>

          <p>China has lifted its comprehensive ban on Japanese seafood imports, which was imposed in August 2023 after Japan began releasing treated radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear plant. The decision appears to be a move to improve diplomatic ties with Japan amid ongoing trade tensions with the United States. Chinese customs authorities stated that long-term monitoring and independent sampling showed no abnormalities in the discharged water. While the blanket ban is lifted, restrictions will remain on food imports from 10 Japanese prefectures, including Fukushima, and procedural steps must be completed before shipments can fully resume.</p>

          <p>Japan's Fair Trade Commission is set to fine Harley-Davidson's Japanese unit approximately 200 million yen ($1.4 million) for violating antimonopoly laws. The company is accused of imposing excessive sales quotas on its dealers and pressuring them by suggesting their contracts might not be renewed if targets were not met. This pressure allegedly led some dealers to purchase unsold motorcycles themselves to fulfill the quotas. The antitrust watchdog will also issue a cease and desist order to the company, which has since discontinued the practice following the investigation.</p>
