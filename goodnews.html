        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's Women's Rugby World Cup team faces a crucial decision for their quarter-final against Scotland, as star full-back Ellie Kildunne is sidelined with concussion symptoms. Head coach John Mitchell must choose between the inexperienced Emma Sing, known for her kicking, and the more seasoned utility back Helena Rowland, who previously started at full-back in the 2022 World Cup. Experts like Ugo Monye and Katy Daley-McLean favor Rowland for her polished performance and defensive strengths in knockout rugby. Kildunne could return for a potential semi-final if she clears the concussion protocol.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party's National Executive Committee has launched a rapid contest to replace Angela Rayner as deputy leader, with nominations opening soon and a winner expected by October 25. Former deputy leader Harriet Harman advocates for a woman from outside London to fill the role, emphasizing the need for a complementary figure to broaden the party's reach. Candidates must secure significant backing from MPs and party affiliates. This unexpected election follows Rayner's departure from government, prompting calls for a balanced leadership and a focus on government priorities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While artificial intelligence has caused some turbulence, labor economists suggest its overall impact on the workforce remains relatively small, with broader economic uncertainty being a more significant factor in recent job market declines. Experts from Indeed and career coaches note that AI's effects are largely concentrated in the tech industry and on early-career workers in roles prone to automation. However, there's a growing demand for AI skills, indicating a shift towards augmentation rather than wholesale replacement of human labor. Businesses are increasingly using AI for various HR functions, prompting workers to adapt by acquiring new skills.</p>

          <p>India is actively rebalancing its relationships with major global powers, including China and Russia, amidst strained ties with the United States due to recent tariffs. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's engagement with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin at the SCO summit symbolizes India's pursuit of multi-alignment and strategic autonomy. While New Delhi seeks to mend relations with Beijing and maintain energy and defense partnerships with Moscow, it emphasizes that this is not a turn away from Washington. Experts suggest India is leveraging its position to navigate an unstable world, aiming for self-sufficiency rather than rigid alliances.</p>

          <p>Analysts predict that the long-delayed Power of Siberia 2 pipeline, connecting Russia and China, could create a "structural shock" in the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade. The project, which has gained renewed urgency for Russia since its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, would provide China with cheaper and more secure overland gas supplies, helping it bypass maritime chokepoints and insulate from price swings. This development poses "strategic and market challenges" for the United States, currently the largest LNG exporter. Unresolved issues like pricing and the route, however, suggest prolonged negotiations before operations begin.</p>
