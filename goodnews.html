        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, President Trump's readiness to shut down TikTok in the U.S. was the crucial factor that compelled its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to negotiate a deal. Bessent stated that the administration prioritized national security over the commercial agreement, a stance that effectively broke the deadlock. With a September 17 deadline approaching for ByteDance to divest the app's U.S. operations, the commercial terms have largely been settled since spring. A final agreement is anticipated following a discussion between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has ordered a new investigation into the UK's security service, MI5, for submitting false evidence to three separate courts. The case revolves around a neo-Nazi informant, known as Agent X, who was handled by MI5 and used his position to coerce his girlfriend. After courts rejected MI5's internal explanations as having "serious procedural deficiencies," Starmer directed the Investigatory Powers Commissioner to conduct an immediate and independent inquiry. The security service's director general has previously apologized for the serious failing after evidence proved it had been untruthful.</p>

          <p>Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk has reported positive late-stage trial results for its new obesity treatment, Cagrilinitide. The drug, a long-acting amylin analogue, helped patients achieve an average weight loss of 11.8% over 68 weeks and was described as well-tolerated with mainly mild side effects. This development is significant as Novo Nordisk seeks a successor to its highly successful but supply-constrained weight-loss drug, Wegovy. Cagrilinitide works differently from existing GLP-1 treatments, potentially offering a valuable alternative for patients in the booming obesity drug market.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce the long-awaited "Hillsborough Law," which will legally require public officials to be truthful during investigations into major disasters. The legislation includes a "duty of candour," making it a criminal offense for officials to fail to cooperate or be dishonest, aiming to end the culture of cover-ups seen in tragedies like the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, fulfilling a long-standing pledge to the victims' families, stated the law will ensure that no one else suffers the same injustices faced by those affected by Hillsborough and other state-related scandals.</p>

          <h2>Discovery of Smoke-Dried Human Remains in Asia May Represent World's Oldest Mummies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 07:00:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered what may be the world's oldest known mummies, dating back up to 12,000 years, across several archaeological sites in Southeast Asia. A new study suggests that hunter-gatherer communities in the region practiced a form of mummification by smoke-drying bodies over a fire. This finding pushes back the timeline of intentional mummification, previously attributed to the Chinchorro people of South America around 7,000 years ago. The practice likely allowed ancient peoples to maintain physical and spiritual connections with their deceased ancestors, a tradition that continues in some Indigenous communities today.</p>

          <p>Meta is set to introduce its most advanced smart glasses, codenamed Hypernova, at its annual Connect event, signaling a strategic shift from virtual reality to a more accessible consumer product. The new device, expected to cost $800, will feature a display and can be controlled with hand gestures via a neural wristband. This launch is critical for Meta as investors scrutinize the massive financial losses from its Reality Labs division, which have totaled nearly $70 billion since late 2020. The success of the glasses could determine the future of Meta's hardware ambitions.</p>

          <p>Fifty years later, the third and final fight between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, known as the "Thrilla in Manila," remains a pinnacle of boxing history. Held on October 1, 1975, the brutal 14-round contest was the culmination of a bitter rivalry that had soured from friendship into deep-seated animosity. Staged by the autocratic Marcos regime in the Philippines, the event was a global spectacle that tested the limits of human endurance. The fight's legacy is defined not just by the in-ring action but by the complex personal and political narratives surrounding the two iconic heavyweights.</p>

          <p>A High Court in Kenya has issued an arrest warrant for a British national suspected of murdering 21-year-old Agnes Wanjiru in 2012. Wanjiru's body was discovered in a hotel's septic tank nearly three months after she was last seen with British soldiers in the town of Nanyuki. The court's decision, based on evidence provided by prosecutors, now opens the door for extradition proceedings to bring the suspect from the UK to Kenya to stand trial. The ruling marks a significant step forward in the long fight for justice by Wanjiru's family.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled 2-1 to block President Donald Trump from removing Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook from her position. The decision is a setback for Trump and ensures Cook can participate in this week's pivotal policy meeting where an interest rate cut is expected. Trump had attempted to fire Cook, a Biden appointee, over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. The ruling upholds the Federal Reserve's traditional independence from political interference, a principle established to allow the central bank to set monetary policy without presidential pressure.

          <p>Newly released official figures show that the number of people receiving winter fuel payments fell dramatically to 1.3 million last year, down from approximately 11 million previously. The sharp decline was the result of a government decision to means-test the payment, limiting it to pensioners on low-income benefits. Following a significant public and political backlash, the chancellor reversed the policy in June. This winter, the payment will once again be available to the vast majority of pensioners, specifically those with an annual income of £35,000 or less.</p>

          <p>A long-standing mystery about a vibrant blue color in Jackson Pollock's iconic painting "Number 1A, 1948" has been solved by scientists. Through chemical analysis of paint scrapings, researchers have confirmed for the first time that the abstract expressionist used a synthetic pigment known as manganese blue. This specific pigment, once also used for coloring swimming pools, was phased out by the 1990s due to environmental concerns. The discovery provides new insights into Pollock's materials and techniques, aiding in the conservation and authentication of his work.</p>

          <p>The UK state pension is projected to rise by 4.7% next April, based on the latest average earnings growth data. Under the government's "triple lock" policy, the annual increase is determined by the highest of inflation, earnings growth, or 2.5%. This increase would add over £500 a year to the new flat-rate pension, pushing the total annual amount closer to the frozen personal tax allowance of £12,570. Experts predict that this trend will result in many pensioners paying income tax on their state pension for the first time by 2027. (not investment advice)</p>

The numbers 9, 16, and 25 are consecutive perfect squares (3², 4², and 5²). Furthermore, these base numbers form a Pythagorean triple, where 3² + 4² equals 5² (9 + 16 = 25), the foundation of the famous Pythagorean Theorem. This rare alignment of numbers is being hailed as a moment of "hidden mathematical poetry," offering a sense of order and elegance in a chaotic world, with enthusiasts celebrating with right-triangle-shaped cakes.</p>

While online services are effective for simple issues like prescription renewals for erectile dysfunction or hair loss, they are unsuitable for conditions requiring a physical exam. A key factor is the patient-doctor relationship; a virtual visit with a new doctor may lead to more cautious, and potentially costly, referrals to an emergency room. Experts suggest the ideal approach is often to use telehealth options provided by a patient's established primary care physician, who better understands their health history.</p>

The author contrasts the vitriolic, partisan reactions online—where both sides blame each other and predict further violence—with the simple, human sadness of ordinary people who are weary of the political divide. Instead of using the tragedy as fuel for the culture war, the article calls for an effort to understand one another's perspectives.
