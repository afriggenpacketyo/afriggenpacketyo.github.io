          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, along with other prominent American business leaders like Larry Ellison and Michael Dell, are likely to be part of the investment group for the U.S. operations of TikTok. The deal aims to address national security concerns by transferring control from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to American entities. According to the White House, the new structure would feature a seven-member board with six Americans and place U.S. data and privacy under Oracle's management. Negotiations between the U.S. and China are ongoing, with both sides releasing statements that suggest key details are still being finalized.</p>

          <p>England defeated Ireland by six wickets in the third T20 match to clinch the series 2-0, thanks to a decisive half-century from Jordan Cox. After being put into bat, Ireland set a target of 155, constrained by a disciplined English bowling attack led by Adil Rashid's three wickets. In response, England chased down the total with 17 balls to spare, with Cox's crucial 55 runs anchoring the innings after an unsteady start. Cox, who was a late addition to the squad, demonstrated his value after overcoming a minor injury scare earlier in the match, guiding his team to a comfortable victory in the first-ever T20 series between the two nations.</p>

          <p>London's Mayor, Sadiq Khan, initiated a one-day trial banning traffic from a section of Oxford Street, heralding it as the start of a fight to "rescue this street." The event, which prohibited vehicles on a half-mile stretch, offers a glimpse into the mayor's larger plan to permanently pedestrianize the area between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch. While many pedestrians welcomed the safer, more pleasant atmosphere, some local councillors and residents have raised concerns about the potential for traffic congestion on smaller side streets and accessibility issues for those with mobility challenges. The mayor's office plans to consult on detailed proposals later this year, aiming to return the famous shopping street to its former glory.</p>

The video captures the immense power and ferocity of the animals as they snarl, bite, and swat at their cage doors just before being set free. Amur tigers, also known as Siberian tigers, are the largest tiger subspecies and are critically endangered due to poaching and habitat loss, with only 500 to 600 estimated to be left in the wild. Conservation groups highlight the footage as a powerful reminder of the importance of protecting these majestic predators and their ecosystems.</p>

          <p>U.S. athlete Cole Hocker claimed the gold medal in the men's 5,000m at the World Championships in Tokyo with a stunning final lap performance. Hocker was in 11th place at the bell but unleashed a devastating kick to surge past his rivals, finishing in 12 minutes and 58.30 seconds. The victory was a moment of vindication for Hocker, who was controversially disqualified from the 1,500m semifinals earlier in the competition for jostling. He expressed that he felt "robbed" in the earlier race and was determined to end the championships on his own terms, perfectly executing his strategy to secure the world title.</p>

          <p>Luke Donald, the captain of Europe's Ryder Cup team, has suggested that the U.S. team could face negative pressure from the home crowd at Bethpage Black due to their decision to accept payment for participating. For the first time, U.S. players will each receive $500,000, while the European team continues to play for free, a tradition they overwhelmingly supported. Donald theorized that if the highly-paid American players underperform, the New York audience, who are paying high ticket prices, might turn on them. He emphasized that for Team Europe, the purpose and honor of representing their continent are motivation enough, and the money raised goes toward developing future golf talent.</p>

          <p>China's first domestically developed large passenger jet, the C919, is being built on a futuristic assembly line designed to prevent production quality issues that have affected other manufacturers. The smart factory utilizes an integrated network of 5G, sensors, robots, and connected tools to create a unified system for data collection, communication, and control. This advanced approach, detailed in a recent academic journal, aims to eliminate oversights like missing bolts or tools left inside aircraft by creating an intelligent feedback loop across the entire final assembly process. The system represents a significant step in ensuring the safety and reliability of China's growing presence in the commercial aviation market.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 1927, hundreds of swimmers participated in an organized swim in the Chicago River, marking a major milestone in the waterway's transformation from a polluted sewer to a recreational asset. The event was the culmination of decades of environmental work, spurred by the 1972 Clean Water Act, which helped restore the river's health and bring back dozens of fish species and other wildlife. Once known as "the stinking river," it is now a central part of Chicago's civic life, with riverside paths, restaurants, and booming recreational use. Organizers hope the swim becomes an annual event, symbolizing the remarkable progress in urban river revitalization.</p>

          <p>UCLA's interim football coach, Tim Skipper, is bringing in veteran assistant Kevin Coyle to join the defensive staff for the remainder of the season. The move is intended to stabilize the defense following the departure of coordinator Ikaika Malloe and a difficult 0-3 start to the season. Coyle, 69, has extensive experience as a defensive coordinator in both college football and the NFL, including a recent successful stint at Fresno State working alongside Skipper. The Bruins' defense has struggled, ranking among the worst in major college football, and the team hopes Coyle's expertise will help turn their performance around as they head into conference play.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut, which pushed stocks to new record highs, some Wall Street strategists believe the market may have further room to grow. Analysts argue that the current S&P 500 is fundamentally different from historical benchmarks due to the dominance of high-growth technology and communication services companies. They suggest that productivity gains from the artificial intelligence boom and strong corporate earnings prospects justify higher valuations. However, some experts caution that easier monetary policy could fuel a speculative "melt-up" rally driven by investor fear of missing out rather than solid fundamentals, potentially leading to a sharp correction later.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to aging and well-being expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can accelerate the aging process at a cellular level by shortening telomeres, the protective caps on our chromosomes. While telomeres naturally shrink with age, prolonged stress quickens this process, which can lead to various health problems. However, Epel emphasizes that this damage is not irreversible. She recommends simple, sustainable daily practices to manage stress and promote cellular restoration. These include eating more fruits and vegetables, incorporating short meditative breaks, increasing Omega-3 intake, and prioritizing deep rest through activities like yoga or breathwork to create an anti-inflammatory lifestyle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A child psychologist who has studied numerous parent-child relationships suggests that children with exceptional social skills often have parents who model key behaviors from an early age. These practices focus on creating an environment of emotional safety and authentic connection rather than just memorizing polite phrases. Key behaviors include talking openly about feelings, modeling empathy in daily life, fostering genuine confidence by allowing children to try and fail, and teaching them how to repair relationships after conflict. By validating their child's feelings and listening more than they lecture, parents teach the foundational skills for building strong, healthy relationships later in life.</p>

The memoir details their unusually close relationship post-divorce, her business ventures, her acting career in shows like "Dallas," and the profound grief of losing their only daughter, Lisa Marie Presley.
