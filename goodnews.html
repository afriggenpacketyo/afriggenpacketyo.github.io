          <p>Britain is increasing its defense spending with a focus on creating domestic jobs and fostering local prosperity, with Barrow-in-Furness serving as a potential model for this strategy. This New York Times article examines how BAE Systems, a major employer in Barrow, is expanding due to increased military spending and collaborating with local and national governments to rejuvenate the town. The goal is to address infrastructure problems, attract workers, and improve the overall quality of life in the area, ensuring that the economic benefits of defense spending are distributed more widely and contribute to the revitalization of struggling towns.</p>

          <p>This BBC article discusses the trend of rising legal migration into the UK over the last 30 years. The number of people migrating to the UK has consistently exceeded those emigrating, marking a significant demographic shift. Despite political promises to reduce net migration, figures have remained historically high, becoming a key issue in the EU referendum. Brexit aimed to give the government control over immigration, but net migration figures have continued to fluctuate, prompting ongoing debate and policy adjustments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Nations is utilizing water-based cooling systems in its headquarters to combat rising global temperatures, drawing water from the East River to cool its New York complex, a system that has been in place since the 1950s. This energy-efficient mechanism is being highlighted by energy experts as a viable alternative to conventional air conditioning. The UN also employs similar systems in Geneva and Copenhagen, using water from Lake Geneva and seawater, respectively, to reduce electricity consumption for cooling. Despite the benefits, such systems are not widely adopted due to coordination challenges and the need for market aggregation.</p>

          <p>India is experiencing a surge in air conditioning demand as temperatures rise, with a record 14 million AC units sold last year. While this provides relief from extreme heat, it also raises concerns about increased electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Despite only 7% of households owning ACs, India is the world's fastest-growing AC market, potentially tripling electricity production to meet demand. The reliance on coal-generated electricity exacerbates climate change, even as individuals prioritize immediate comfort and productivity amidst brutal summer conditions.</p>
