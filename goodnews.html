          <p>A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction halting the Trump administration's plans to cut jobs and reorganize major federal agencies under the DOGE initiative led by Elon Musk. The order pauses further reductions in force and reorganization of the executive branch while the lawsuit proceeds. Judge Illston emphasized that Congress creates and funds federal agencies, and agencies cannot disregard Congress's mandates through large-scale reorganizations without congressional partnership. The Trump administration has appealed the decision.</p>

          <p>Faced with President Trump's demand for NATO allies to spend 5% of their national income on defense, European countries are exploring a new plan to broaden the definition of defense spending. The proposed plan includes a target of 3.5% of GDP for traditional military spending, plus another 1.5% for nontraditional "defense-related" spending, such as infrastructure improvements and cybersecurity. This approach aims to satisfy Trump's demands while addressing logistical and technological needs highlighted by the war in Ukraine. NATO spending is expected to be a key focus at the upcoming summit in The Hague.</p>

          <p>Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) offer flexibility but carry risks, as they use your home as collateral. Experts advise using HELOCs to take advantage of falling rates, consolidate credit card debt, and tackle home repairs, but not for vacations or pools. HELOCs can also be considered for college costs or buying a new house, but careful planning is essential. It is important to ensure payments fit your budget and understand the variable interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

Researchers reported that the fish got shorter in response to the heat wave, and those that shrank had a higher chance of survival. This study adds complexity to the understanding of how marine life is adapting to climate change, though overall, heat waves are devastating to coral reefs and marine ecosystems.</p>

The article mentions that what was most entertaining about Mission: Impossible was never the overarching plot; Hunt‚Äôs heroism was more a dazzling bout of flamboyance from one of Hollywood‚Äôs last stars than the result of some meaningful backstory.</p>
