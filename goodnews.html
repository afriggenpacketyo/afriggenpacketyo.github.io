        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Crime statistics for Memphis from federal agencies like the FBI and local police department show conflicting trends, with the White House citing a rise in violent crime while MPD reports a decline. These differences stem from varying geographical scopes, as the FBI includes a wider metro area, and distinct counting methods, where the FBI tallies each victim while MPD counts incidents. Experts advise scrutinizing definitions, counting methods, and timeframes when interpreting crime data. The nuanced reporting highlights the complexity of accurately assessing crime trends and avoiding public misperception.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's decision to relinquish its "developing country" status at the WTO is viewed as a tactical retreat, aligning with Mao Zedong's protracted war theory of strategic defensive. By shedding this label, China removes a key talking point used by the U.S. and EU to criticize its economic power while retaining minimal substantive loss of benefits. This move allows Beijing to reposition itself as a peer and advocate for the Global South, reframing the global trade battlefield to favor its long-term strategic position. The article argues that this maneuver demonstrates China's sophisticated approach to international trade politics.</p>

          <p>Avi Schiffmann, the 22-year-old founder of Friend, a wearable AI companion, has intentionally provoked public backlash with his New York City subway ad campaign. The ads, which imply AI is superior to human friends, have been heavily vandalized, a reaction Schiffmann views as effective PR, stating "the picture of the billboard is the billboard." He denies instigating the vandalism, seeing the campaign as performance art designed to prod public attitudes toward AI. Despite criticism and the product's flaws, Schiffmann prioritizes "mindshare" to establish the controversial notion of AI as a friend.</p>

          <p>London police have dismantled an international gang suspected of smuggling up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones from the UK to China in the past year, in the largest operation of its kind. The investigation began after a victim traced a stolen iPhone to a warehouse, leading to the interception of shipments and identification of key suspects. Police believe the gang exported up to 40% of all phones stolen in London, where thefts have nearly tripled in four years. Authorities are now urging phone manufacturers to implement features that disable stolen devices to disincentivize such crimes.</p>

Celebrations throughout October will honor the Tongva, Tataviam, Serrano, Kizh, and Chumash tribes, recognizing their historical presence and vibrant contemporary communities. Events range from cultural gatherings with music and art to educational talks and fashion galas, reflecting diverse Indigenous perspectives. However, some groups, like Indigenous Pride L.A., have scaled down public events due to ongoing ICE raids, prioritizing community safety.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates, savers are advised to strategically compare Certificate of Deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts for optimal returns on a $10,000 deposit. While current rates for both are similar over short terms, CDs offer guaranteed fixed rates, whereas high-yield savings account rates are variable and likely to decline further. The article suggests a blended approach, utilizing both account types to secure today's higher rates with CDs while maintaining flexibility with high-yield savings. Avoiding traditional savings accounts, which offer minimal interest, remains crucial for maximizing earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

OpenAI President Greg Brockman emphasized the deal's importance for scaling AI capabilities, citing current compute limitations. This agreement positions AMD as a core strategic partner and diversifies OpenAI's hardware supply, though Nvidia's stock saw a slight dip.</p>

Current monthly payments for a $150,000 HELOC range from $1,424 to $1,811, significantly lower than last year.

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying any National Guard units to Oregon, after previously denying the use of Oregon's own Guard. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, questioned the administration's attempt to circumvent her initial ruling by reassigning California and Texas troops. She stated that small protests did not justify federalized forces, which could harm state sovereignty and inflame tensions. The ruling is a significant legal setback for the administration's efforts to use the military in cities without state consent.</p>
