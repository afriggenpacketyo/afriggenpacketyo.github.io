          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul is spearheading a statewide initiative to restrict cellphone use in K-12 schools throughout the school day, citing concerns over student mental health and academic focus. Hochul, drawing from conversations with parents, teachers, and students, emphasizes the detrimental effects of constant notifications and social media pressures on children's well-being and classroom engagement. The new policy aims to foster a learning environment where students can concentrate, interact face-to-face, and experience a more carefree childhood. Hochul asserts that this measure is essential to combat the addictive nature of social media and restore a sense of normalcy and joy in schools.</p>

          <p>Keen, a U.S.-based footwear company, is committed to maintaining steady prices for its customers this year despite the impact of new U.S. tariffs on imports. The company has proactively diversified its supply chain over the past decade to reduce dependence on any single country, particularly China, where many footwear companies manufacture their products. Keen operates plants in the U.S., Dominican Republic, and Thailand, and partners with manufacturers in other countries, enabling them to distribute costs and avoid significant price increases. This strategy allows Keen to remain competitive and shield consumers from tariff-related price hikes, unlike some competitors who are already warning of potential price increases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration faces a critical decision regarding whether to defend Biden-era regulations enforcing mental health parity, which mandates that insurers cover mental health and addiction treatment comparably to physical health care. A trade association representing large employers has sued the federal government, arguing that the regulations are overreaching and would increase costs, potentially reducing the quality of care. Mental health advocates urge the administration to uphold the regulations, emphasizing the importance of making mental health care accessible and affordable, as cost remains a significant barrier to treatment for many Americans. The debate centers on whether access issues stem from insurance policies or a shortage of mental health care providers, with differing viewpoints on how to best address the nation's mental health crisis.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is undertaking a tour of European capitals, including Brussels, to meet with NATO and EU leaders, signaling a renewed commitment to active German engagement in European policy. Merz, a critic of his predecessor Olaf Scholz, intends to end Germany's perceived "speechlessness" on key European issues and strengthen the country's contribution to the European project. He plans to collaborate closely with France and Poland to bolster European sovereignty, particularly in response to shifts in U.S. foreign policy under President Trump. Merz's initiative addresses past criticisms of Germany's slow positioning on crucial projects, such as the reform of the European asylum system.</p>

          <p>A rediscovered and restored pilot episode of Thomas & Friends, narrated by Ringo Starr, is set to be released online for the first time since 1983, coinciding with the franchise's 80th anniversary. The episode, titled "Down The Mine," was found in storage and digitally treated, offering a glimpse into the early stages of the beloved children's series. The show's producer, Ian McCue, noted the pilot reveals teething problems the team addressed before the official series launch in 1984. Despite these challenges, the pilot retains the charm and timeless storytelling that has contributed to the show's enduring popularity, which is based on themes of friendship, teamwork, and communication.</p>

          <p>The recent trade deal between the UK and the U.S. indicates that a 10% baseline tariff is likely to remain in place for other trading partners, with limited exceptions, under President Trump's trade policies. While the UK secured tariff reductions for its auto, steel, and aluminum sectors, all other goods imported to the U.S. from the UK will still be subject to a 10% tariff. Analysts suggest that this deal sets a precedent for future trade agreements, with Trump indicating that higher tariffs may be imposed on countries with larger trade surpluses. Some analysts also point out that the deal could negatively impact U.S. economic growth due to the high average tariff rate.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow for Russia's Victory Day parade underscores the deepening economic and political ties between China and Russia, particularly as both nations face trade pressures from the U.S. China has become Russia's top economic partner, increasing its imports of Russian energy and providing access to manufactured goods and technologies. As the U.S. imposes high tariffs on Chinese imports, China is positioning itself as a counterweight to the U.S.'s protectionist policies, with its alliance with Russia serving as a foundation for global stability. However, U.S. secondary sanctions on Moscow may impede further expansion of Sino-Russian trade, despite workarounds involving alternative vessels and payment systems.</p>

          <p>Recent Chinese government data indicates a significant shift in trade patterns, with exports to Southeast Asian countries surging as shipments to the United States plummet due to increased tariffs. Overall shipments from China jumped by 8.1 percent in April compared to the previous year, driven by increased trade with countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). This redirection of trade suggests that Chinese factories are taking advantage of tariff pauses in the region to complete orders destined for the U.S., while domestic producers halt production targeting the U.S. market. Chinese financial regulators are prepared to boost domestic demand to mitigate the trade war's impact, and U.S. and Chinese officials are set to meet in Geneva to discuss trade issues.</p>

Artificial. Collective," emphasizes the need for architects and urban planners to rethink the built environment by harnessing various forms of intelligence and pooling knowledge from different disciplines. Concerns center on the overheating of urban areas due to sealed surfaces and lack of greenery, leading to heat islands. The exhibition showcases solutions such as implementing climate-adapted designs, reducing traffic, and transforming cities into flood-resistant "sponge cities.</p>

          <p>Japan will continue to demand the full removal of new tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, after a U.S.-Britain trade agreement left some levies in place. Tokyo has set the full removal of "reciprocal" tariffs, an additional 25 percent levy for cars and a 25 percent duty for steel and aluminum as the condition for reaching an agreement with Washington. The government plans to hold a third round of talks in mid-May or later.</p>

          <h2>Nvidia to Release Modified H20 Chip for China Amid U.S. Export Controls</h2>

          <p>Nvidia plans to release a modified version of its H20 chip for the Chinese market in July to comply with U.S. export controls. The downgraded H20 chip, designed to maintain Nvidia's presence in China, will have significantly reduced memory capacity compared to the original version. This move comes after U.S. officials informed Nvidia that the H20 would require an export license, effectively blocking it from the Chinese market. The company has formulated new technical thresholds to guide the development of the modified chip design, which will result in substantial downgrades.</p>

          <p>Shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China's largest contract chip maker, fell nearly 7% after its first-quarter earnings missed estimates. The company reported a first-quarter revenue of $2.24 billion and a profit attributable to shareholders of $188 million, both below LSEG estimates. The earnings missed original guidance due to "production fluctuations" which sent blended average selling prices falling. However, SMIC's wafer shipments increased by 15% from the previous quarter and by about 28% year-on-year.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that U.S. tariffs on goods from China may be reduced as top trade officials prepare for talks. The meeting in Switzerland this weekend is the strongest signal yet that the two sides are ready to deescalate a trade war that has sent shockwaves through financial markets. Trump made the comments during an event to unveil a tariffs deal with the UK - the first such agreement since he hit countries around the world with steep levies in April. China's Vice Foreign Minister Hua Chunying also struck a confident note ahead of the talks, saying Beijing has "full confidence" in its ability to manage trade issues with the US.</p>
