          <p>A Chinese study examining dinosaur feathers preserved in Burmese amber has provided insights into the evolution of flight feathers, a key development that allowed birds to excel over their dinosaur relatives in aerial dominance. Researchers analyzed the structure of 99-million-year-old feathers from the Cretaceous period, discovering details about feather evolution during this time. The development of feathers capable of generating thrust and lift was critical for the advancement of birds. While modern birds descended from dinosaurs, most feathered dinosaurs lacked the ability to fly in the same manner, although some could glide or achieve powered flight.</p>

          <p>Marissa Rothenberger, a transgender pitcher, propelled the Champlin Park Rebels to the Minnesota High School Girls' Softball State Championship after a dramatic semifinal victory. Rothenberger pitched a complete game and contributed two doubles, sparking the team's comeback. While the team celebrated, some parents from the opposing team expressed frustration with the Minnesota State High School League's policy allowing student-athletes to compete based on their gender identity, regardless of biological sex. The MSHSL's eligibility criteria for transgender athletes are based on state law, specifically the Minnesota Human Rights Act and the Minnesota Constitution.</p>

          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria to colonize a newborn's body may offer protection against dangerous infections, specifically reducing the risk of young children being hospitalized with lung infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute analyzed stool samples from over 1,000 newborns in their first week of life, tracking their health for the subsequent two years. They found that the presence of Bifidobacterium longum in early infancy appeared to have a protective effect. Babies with this species were significantly less likely to require hospitalization for lung infections, suggesting a crucial role for early microbial encounters in immune system development.</p>

          <p>A judge has sided with environmental groups by granting a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp., delaying the restart of an offshore oil operation along Santa Barbara County's coastline. The order halts efforts to reactivate the Santa Ynez Unit's onshore pipeline system, which experienced a major rupture and spill in 2015. Sable officials stated the decision would force them to push back their restart timeline to August 1, 2025. Environmental groups celebrated the ruling, arguing that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without conducting required environmental reviews or public processes.</p>

          <p>Drug safety experts are advising women using weight-loss injections to stop if they are trying for a baby, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding, due to unknown risks to unborn babies. The UK drugs regulator and medical professionals are concerned about the unsafe use of popular GLP-1 medicines like Wegovy and Mounjaro. These prescription medicines, licensed to treat obesity, are being obtained from unregulated sources without medical advice. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommends using contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward before trying to conceive.</p>

The meeting comes after Trump doubled import taxes on steel and aluminum, prompting concerns about EU countermeasures. Merz, a supporter of transatlantic relations, is expected to address Trump's demands for NATO allies to increase defense spending to 5% of their GDP. The Chancellor's forthright style could add an interesting dimension to the discussions, as he aims to balance German interests with maintaining a strong relationship with the U.S.</p>
