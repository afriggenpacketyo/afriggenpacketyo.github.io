          <p>SpaceX's Starship successfully reached orbit during its ninth test flight, marking progress toward sending humans to Mars, but experienced a propellant leak that led to loss of control. The spacecraft re-entered Earth's atmosphere at an uncontrolled angle and mostly burned up, with remaining debris expected to fall into the Indian Ocean. SpaceX plans to review data from the flight test to improve Starship's reliability, and this test included modifications based on previous flight failures. The company aims for Starship to be fully reusable, capable of launching, landing, and flying again with minimal maintenance.</p>

          <p>The Defense Department has ceased requiring civilian employees to submit weekly reports detailing their accomplishments, a practice initiated by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Instead, employees are now asked to contribute at least one idea to enhance efficiency or eliminate waste within the department. Other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, have also discontinued the weekly reports. The initial requirement, influenced by Elon Musk and DOGE, aimed to eliminate waste by having employees justify their employment with a list of five weekly achievements.</p>

          <p>Former Governor Andrew M. Cuomo, a leading candidate in the New York City mayoral race, has proposed raising the city's minimum wage to $20 an hour by 2027. The plan would need support from the governor and state lawmakers, as the current minimum wage is $16.50 an hour in New York City, Westchester, and Long Island. Cuomo's proposal aims to raise wages for roughly 800,000 workers and combat assertions that he is more attuned to business interests than those of the working class. He also suggested creating a tax credit for small businesses to help them adjust to the higher wage.</p>

The daguerreotypes were commissioned by Louis Agassiz, a Harvard professor who used them to support racist theories.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the evolution of the word "pride" from its early association with arrogance and sin to its current use as a symbol of LGBTQ empowerment. The shift began in the 14th century, and the concept of gay pride emerged before the Stonewall Uprising in 1969. The late organizer L. Craig Schoonmaker advocated for "pride" as a unifying slogan for the movement, emphasizing self-esteem rather than power. Despite progress, the LGBTQ community faces ongoing challenges, including anti-LGBTQ legislation and corporate backlash, making the word's meaning more relevant than ever.</p>
