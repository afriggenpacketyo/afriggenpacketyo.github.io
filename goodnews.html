          <p>President Trump commuted the 12-year sentence of Imaad Zuberi, a major political donor, who was serving time for obstructing an investigation into Trump‚Äôs 2017 inaugural committee. Zuberi, who previously supported Democrats, donated over $1.1 million to committees associated with Trump and the Republican Party after the 2016 election. He pleaded guilty in 2020 to obstructing a federal investigation and falsifying records to conceal his lobbying work on behalf of Sri Lanka. Trump also commuted the sentence of Larry Hoover, the co-founder of the Gangster Disciples, and pardoned former Connecticut Gov. John Rowland.</p>

Musk, who led the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), thanked Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending.

Musk's time in government overlapped with a decline in sales at his electric car company, and he had clashed with some cabinet-level officials.</p>

The court found that Trump's tariffs exceeded the authority granted by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.
