          <h2>Mortgage Rates Experience Largest Single-Day Decline in Over a Year</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 15:25:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage saw its most significant one-day drop in over a year, falling to 6.29% after a weaker-than-expected August jobs report. This decline offers potential relief for homebuyers facing high housing prices, as it could lower monthly payments by a noticeable amount. For example, the monthly payment on a $450,000 home would decrease by approximately $169. However, it remains uncertain whether this drop is substantial enough to reinvigorate the housing market, as mortgage demand has remained low and some analysts believe rates need to fall into the 5% range to make a significant impact.</p>

          <p>In response to the resignation of his deputy, Angela Rayner, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has executed a wide-ranging cabinet reshuffle in an effort to assert authority and refocus his government. Instead of a simple replacement, Starmer has recast his top team, appointing new home and foreign secretaries. This decisive action is seen as an attempt to seize momentum after a difficult first year in office marked by declining approval ratings. The move is a high-stakes gamble to re-energize the government and demonstrate a commitment to delivery ahead of looming political battles.</p>

          <p>An off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot who allegedly tried to cut the engines of a passenger flight in 2023 is set to enter guilty and no-contest pleas as part of an agreement with prosecutors. The pilot, Joseph Emerson, told police he was suffering from depression, had taken psychedelic mushrooms, and believed he was in a dream when he grabbed handles to activate the plane's fire suppression system. The flight was safely diverted, and no one was injured. Under the agreement, Emerson faces probation, community service, and restitution, with his attorneys asking that he serve no additional prison time.</p>

          <p>Following his passing, industry experts are reflecting on Giorgio Armani's legacy not just as a designer but as a visionary business leader who built a global empire. He revolutionized office attire with the softly tailored power suit for both men and women, tapping into the cultural moment of the 1970s and 80s. Armani was also a pioneer in leveraging celebrity power, dressing stars in films and on the red carpet to elevate his brand's prestige. Crucially, by never selling his company, he maintained complete creative and financial control, ensuring a consistent and sophisticated vision across his vast portfolio of products.</p>

          <h2>UK Judge Rules Personal Online Shopping at Work is Not a Fireable Offense if Not Excessive</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An employment tribunal in the UK has ruled that an accountancy administrator was unfairly dismissed for using her work computer for personal online browsing. The judge determined that spending less than an hour over two days on sites like Amazon and Rightmove was not "excessive" and did not constitute a sackable offense. The ruling noted that the company had no clear policy prohibiting such use and that the business owner herself used her work computer for personal reasons. The judge concluded the dismissal was likely motivated by the owner's desire to hire her sister and remove the employee before she reached two years of service.</p>

          <p>A significant portion of the 405 Freeway in Los Angeles will be partially closed this weekend, marking the start of a multi-year repaving project through the heavily trafficked Sepulveda Pass. The freeway will be reduced to three lanes in each direction between Van Nuys and Westwood, and transportation officials are urging motorists to find alternate routes. The $143.7-million project is scheduled for completion in late 2028 or early 2029 and will ultimately restore 92 miles of lanes. This is the first of up to 25 weekend closures required to complete the extensive infrastructure upgrades.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) face the challenge of reinvesting their funds at lower returns. Financial experts suggest several options to navigate this environment. High-yield savings and money market accounts currently offer competitive rates with the added benefit of liquidity, though their rates are variable and will fall with the market. Alternatively, savers could opt for a new long-term CD to lock in a fixed interest rate for several years, providing security against further rate declines. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite Broadcom's stock surging to an all-time high, its valuation has remained relatively stable due to a rapid increase in Wall Street's earnings forecasts. The optimism is fueled by the company securing a fourth major customer, believed to be OpenAI, for its custom AI chips and amassing an order backlog of over $110 billion. This dynamic, where earnings estimates rise in tandem with the stock price, suggests the rally is fundamentally justified and not just speculative. CEO Hock Tan's contract extension through 2030 has further bolstered investor confidence in the company's long-term growth trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

Norris commented that the competition was "a bit close for my liking" and acknowledged that the low-downforce nature of the Monza track does not play to McLaren's strengths as much as other circuits.
