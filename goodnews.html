          <p>California State Senators Scott Wiener and Jesse Arreguin have introduced legislation to ban law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings during public interactions. The proposed "No Secret Police Act" aims to ensure transparency and accountability, requiring officers to wear identifying information. Exemptions would be made for SWAT teams and officers wearing medical masks during natural disasters, with clear riot gear also permitted. The legislation is a response to protests in Los Angeles and concerns about the Trump administration's immigration policies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report by Lazard indicates that renewable power sources like solar and onshore wind are the least expensive and quickest to deploy in the United States, even without government subsidies. The cost to build new gas-fired power plants has reached a 10-year high due to record electricity use and equipment backlogs. This is significant as U.S. electricity demand increases, raising questions about the sources that will meet this growing need. Different power-producing sources have varying implications for the reliability of the electric grid and for climate change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A temporary restraining order on President Trump's ban prohibiting foreign Harvard University students from entering the U.S. has been extended while a judge considers arguments for a preliminary injunction. Harvard's lawyers argue that Trump's proclamation violates its First Amendment rights and is outside the authority of the executive branch. The government contends that it does not "trust" Harvard to monitor foreign students and raised concerns about the university's "foreign entanglements." The judge questioned the government's concerns, asking why the ban doesn't apply to other institutions.</p>
