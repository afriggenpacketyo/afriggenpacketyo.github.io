          <p>A viral social media claim that "The Simpsons" predicted a kiss cam incident at a Coldplay concert has been determined to be false. DW Fact Check found that the image circulating online, allegedly from a 2015 episode, does not appear in the show and was likely generated by AI. The article notes this is one of many fabricated or misattributed predictions credited to the long-running animated series. Show creator Matt Groening has stated that with thousands of jokes over the decades, some are bound to coincidentally resemble real events, but they are not intentional predictions.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Honeywell Stock is Undervalued Following Post-Earnings Price Drop</h2>

          <p>Industrial conglomerate Honeywell saw its share price fall despite reporting second-quarter revenue and earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations. The company's organic sales grew by 5%, and it raised its full-year outlook for sales, growth, and earnings per share. The stock decline is attributed to disappointing segment margin figures, partly due to increased R&D spending in its aerospace division. Analysts suggest the market reaction was overly negative, viewing the underlying results as strong and the company's planned three-part breakup as a positive future catalyst.

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has reached the quarter-finals of the Washington Open after a decisive 6-4 6-2 victory over four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka. This win follows her earlier upset over the tournament's seventh seed and ensures she will reclaim the British number one ranking. Raducanu is set to face Maria Sakkari in the next round. In the men's singles, however, Britain's Cameron Norrie and Dan Evans were both knocked out of the tournament in their respective last-16 matches, ending their campaigns in Washington D.C.</p>

          <p>Wisconsin's Democratic Governor, Tony Evers, has announced he will not run for a third term, setting up the first open gubernatorial race in the key battleground state in 16 years. Citing a desire to spend more time with his family after 50 years in public service, the 73-year-old's decision opens the field for the 2026 election. Evers' tenure was marked by frequent clashes with the Republican-controlled legislature, where he used his veto power extensively to block conservative priorities. His retirement comes as Democrats hope to gain control of the legislature under new, more favorable electoral maps.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has extended a temporary pause on an 8th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that would significantly weaken the Voting Rights Act (VRA). The lower court's decision struck down the ability of private individuals and groups to file lawsuits under Section 2 of the VRA, leaving enforcement solely to the Department of Justice. The case originated from a lawsuit by two tribal nations in North Dakota over redistricting maps that diluted Native American voting power. This temporary order keeps the private right of action intact for now, but the case could eventually lead to a full Supreme Court review.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly stated that he does not plan to "destroy" Elon Musk's companies by revoking their large-scale government subsidies. In a post on Truth Social, Trump declared he wants all U.S. businesses, including Musk's, to "THRIVE like never before." This statement comes amid a war of words between the two figures and follows reports that the administration had reviewed contracts for Musk's company SpaceX for potential cuts. Musk's companies, including Tesla and SpaceX, receive billions in federal subsidies, regulatory credits, and government contracts, making their relationship with the administration financially significant.

          <p>England took firm control of the fourth Test against India, thanks to a five-wicket haul from captain Ben Stokes and a rapid opening partnership. Stokes claimed 5-72, his first five-wicket performance in eight years, to help dismiss India for 358. In response, openers Zak Crawley (84) and Ben Duckett (94) scored at a blistering pace, putting on 166 runs. Despite both falling short of a century, they left England in a strong position at 225-2, trailing by just 133 runs at the close of day two at Old Trafford.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts has made it clear he is focused on the upcoming season and has "moved on" from last season's Super Bowl victory. Speaking to reporters at training camp, the Super Bowl LIX MVP stated that while he appreciated receiving his championship ring, the past is behind him. Hurts emphasized a "blank canvas" mentality, a sentiment echoed by his teammates and coach Nick Sirianni, who are determined to avoid complacency. The quarterback even noted that advice from Michael Jordan about winning consecutive titles centered on looking forward rather than trying to "repeat" past success.</p>

          <p>The demand for workers with artificial intelligence skills is increasing significantly, according to a new report from the Brookings Institution. Over the past 15 years, AI-related job postings have grown at an average annual rate of nearly 29%, far outpacing general job growth. This trend has accelerated as more companies integrate AI into their operations, with the number of firms using AI more than doubling since early 2023. While still a small fraction of the overall labor market, these jobs, which range from specialized AI engineers to AI-proficient software developers, typically offer higher salaries than comparable non-AI roles.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers deciding where to place a large sum like $25,000, the choice between a certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account involves a trade-off between rate security and liquidity. Based on current rates, a 6-month CD at 4.45% would earn slightly more than a high-yield savings account at 4.30%. The key advantage of the CD is that its rate is locked in, guaranteeing the return and protecting it from potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. A savings account's rate is variable and could decrease, but it offers the flexibility to withdraw funds at any time without penalty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has walked back its plan to eliminate paper checks and transition all beneficiaries to electronic payments by October. The reversal came after lawmakers, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, raised concerns that the move would harm the roughly 600,000 beneficiaries who rely on paper checks, many of whom are unbanked. The SSA confirmed it will continue issuing paper checks for those who need them but will still encourage recipients to switch to the more secure and cost-effective electronic deposit method. The decision reflects a renewed focus on customer service accessibility for all beneficiaries.</p>

This marks a significant fall from its top-ranked position in 2014. The index shows that a U.S. passport now provides visa-free entry to 182 destinations, compared to 193 for top-ranked Singapore. The report suggests that countries like the U.S. and U.K. are falling in the rankings due to implementing more restrictive entry policies for foreign nationals.

          <p>Erik and Karin Vonk, a Dutch couple, have turned a retirement hobby into Richland Rum, one of Georgia's most celebrated craft distilleries. Located on a 70-acre estate, they are among the small percentage of global producers who make rum directly from sugarcane juice rather than molasses, a practice they say is key to their quality. The business has grown significantly since a 2017 change in Georgia law allowed distilleries to sell products directly to consumers. Their process involves growing their own sugarcane, fermenting the juice, and aging the spirit for up to a decade in American white oak barrels.</p>
