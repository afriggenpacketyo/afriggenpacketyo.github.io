          <p>The U.S. and China have extended their trade truce for an additional 90 days, postponing the implementation of significant tariff hikes. Under the agreement, the U.S. will maintain its 30% tariffs on Chinese imports, while China will keep its 10% tariff on American goods. The extension provides more time for negotiations aimed at addressing trade imbalances and what the White House calls "unfair trade practices." Despite the temporary relief, some U.S. business owners express frustration over the prolonged uncertainty, which complicates long-term planning. (not investment advice)</p>

The RBA cited a substantial drop in inflation and weaker-than-expected public demand as key factors for the decision. While the bank noted that the risk of a major global trade war has diminished, it warned that the lower GDP outlook is primarily due to reduced productivity growth expectations.

While he expressed some regret over never playing in the Premier League, he stated he is very happy with his career path, which includes a Champions League title with Bayern Munich. The 37-year-old Polish international also discussed his role as a veteran player, his admiration for young talents like Lamine Yamal, and the profound influence former manager Jürgen Klopp had on his life and career.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Resorts World Sentosa in Singapore stated the company will "be ready" for its next casino license renewal after receiving a shorter-than-usual two-year extension due to "unsatisfactory" tourism performance. Despite the rebuke from Singapore's Gambling Regulatory Authority, CEO Lee Shi Ruh confirmed that the resort's SG$6.8 billion expansion plans remain on track. The focus is on transforming the property into a premium lifestyle destination with new attractions like Minion Land and the Singapore Oceanarium, shifting away from shopping and toward unique experiences to attract tourists.</p>

          <p>Thomas Dohmke, the CEO of Microsoft's GitHub, has announced he is leaving the company to "become a founder again." His departure comes as GitHub, a dominant platform for software developers, faces intensifying competition from a new wave of AI-powered coding tools. Dohmke has led the company since 2021, overseeing the launch of its popular AI coding assistant, Copilot. Microsoft has not yet named a successor, and GitHub's leadership team will now report to an executive within Microsoft's broader CoreAI group, signaling a deeper integration into the parent company's AI strategy.</p>

          <p>A prominent Chinese economist and central bank adviser, Wang Yiming, has called for government guidance to steer the country's "quick commerce" sector towards healthier development. He argued that instead of simply trying to curb intense competition, known as 'neijuan', the focus should be on preventing excessive cash burn and destructive price wars. Wang emphasized that the goal should be to elevate competition through innovation, quality improvements, and a better industrial ecosystem. This approach could help the rapid delivery sector become a sustainable new driver for consumer spending and economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an effort to promote tourism in its more remote regions, Nepal has announced it will waive climbing permit fees for 97 Himalayan peaks for the next two years. The fee-free mountains are located in the country's less-developed western provinces. This initiative contrasts with a recent decision to increase the permit fee for Mount Everest to $15,000 during peak season, the first hike in nearly a decade. Officials hope the move will attract more mountaineers to unexplored areas, creating jobs and strengthening local economies, though questions about infrastructure in these regions remain.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement sources have confirmed the arrest of four individuals suspected in a series of burglaries across Los Angeles, which included a break-in at the home of actor Brad Pitt. The burglary at Pitt's Los Feliz residence occurred in June while the actor was out of the country. Suspects allegedly scaled a security fence, smashed a window to enter the house, and stole several items. The arrests were made in South Los Angeles, marking a significant development in the investigation into a string of property crimes that have targeted several high-profile residents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has rejected a request from the U.S. Attorney's office to dismiss all charges against a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy already convicted by a jury for using excessive force. The judge called the government's effort to overturn the conviction "contrary to the public interest" and ordered the deputy, Trevor Kirk, to begin his four-month prison sentence. The unusual move to dismiss the case post-conviction was initiated after a new U.S. Attorney was appointed and had previously triggered the resignation of several prosecutors in protest of the office's handling of the case.</p>
