          <p>Liu Qian, founder of Wusawa Advisory and former managing director of The Economist Group in Greater China, offered insights into Chinese innovation, the US-China rivalry, and the role of women in leadership. She contended that the economic impact of rising global trade protectionism, particularly US tariffs, on China is often overstated, as exports to the US now represent only a small fraction of China's GDP. Qian highlighted that the broader US-China rivalry encompasses technology, ideologies, and global collaboration, warning of its potential harm if unhealthy competition persists. She also stressed the critical importance of women's voices in policymaking, advocating for greater gender equality and diverse perspectives.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article posits that in the emerging multipolar world, great powers must prioritize managed accommodation over rigid alliances and confrontation, drawing lessons from the statecraft of Richard Nixon and Zhou Enlai. It argues that economic fundamentals have already ushered in a multipolar order, and the critical challenge is to navigate this transition without catastrophic miscalculation. The article identifies nuclear deterrence and unprecedented technological interdependence as key factors fundamentally altering today's great power competition, making total war irrational and systemic rupture immensely costly. It emphasizes that powerful domestic constituencies in major economies have a strong interest in avoiding breakdown, necessitating patient diplomacy.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered a performance for the ages, described as perhaps the greatest individual game in baseball history, leading the Dodgers to a World Series berth. Facing the Milwaukee Brewers, Ohtani pitched a two-hit, ten-strikeout gem over six scoreless innings while simultaneously hitting three monstrous home runs, including one that cleared Dodger Stadium. This unprecedented feat makes him the only player in history, regular or post-season, to achieve a ten-strikeout, three-home-run game. The article celebrates Ohtani's unparalleled two-way talent, impeccable manners, and inspiring display of athletic and moral excellence. His achievement embodies human flourishing and arete, offering a powerful example of discipline, determination, and grace.</p>

          <p>Longtime Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga was buried in a state funeral, an unprecedented honor for a non-president, capping days of national memorials. Odinga, who died in India at 80, was revered for his fight against autocratic rule, which included imprisonment and exile. Thousands gathered at his rural home for the ceremony, which passed peacefully after earlier memorial events saw five deaths due to a stampede and police gunfire. Kenyan President William Ruto vowed to honor a political pact signed with Odinga in March, which Ruto credited with helping "steady the country." Uncertainty remains, however, if Odinga's party will uphold the agreement.</p>

A QVC sketch featuring an ergonomic neck pillow resembling female genitalia, and her opening monologue, playfully referenced public reactions to her album cover, "Man’s Best Friend," and her bawdy live act. Carpenter, a former Disney star, used humor and coy innocence to dismiss the idea that she's deferential to misogynist fantasies, instead suggesting the problem lies in how people interpret her work. The article highlights her self-awareness and ability to be "in on the joke" regarding her sexuality and evolution from a child star.</p>
