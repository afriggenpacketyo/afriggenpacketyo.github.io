          <p>Two-time NBA champion Kevin Durant will join the Houston Rockets in a blockbuster move from the Phoenix Suns. The 36-year-old forward will join the Rockets at the start of July in a deal involving eight other players. In exchange, guard Jalen Green and small forward Dillon Brooks will move to Phoenix - who will also gain the 10th pick in Wednesday's NBA Draft and five future second-round picks. Durant expressed his excitement about joining the Rockets, praising their leadership and his potential contribution to the team.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday called for China to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, one of the most important trade routes for crude oil in the world. Rubio said it would be "economic suicide" for Iran to close the strait because the Islamic Republic's oil also passes through the waterway. An attempt to block the narrow waterway between Iran and Oman could have profound consequences for the global economy, as some 20 million barrels per day of crude oil flowed through the strait in 2024. The U.S. Fifth Fleet is stationed in Bahrain and tasked with protecting maritime trade in the Persian Gulf.</p>

          <p>U.S. pilots dropped 30,000-pound bombs early Sunday on two key underground uranium enrichment plants in Iran, delivering what American military leaders believe is a knockout blow to a nuclear program. Dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, U.S. officials say the plan was characterized by a ‚Äúprecision strike‚Äù that ‚Äúdevastated the Iranian nuclear program,‚Äù even as they acknowledged an assessment was ongoing. The operation relied on a series of deceptive tactics and decoys to maintain the secrecy, U.S. officials said hours after the attack, which was preceded by nine days of Israeli attacks that debilitated Iran's military leadership and air defenses. The mission included 75 precision-guided weapons and 125 aircraft.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. is ready to meet with Iran following the U.S. bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites, while warning Iran that closing the crucial Strait of Hormuz would be a "suicidal" move for the regime. Rubio said the U.S. has no current plans for further attacks on Iran unless "they mess around." President Trump continues to prefer the path of diplomacy, Rubio said, noting that the U.S. pushed Iran to make a deal to give up its nuclear weapons ambitions before the strikes. The question of how Iran will respond has raised fears that the regime could seek to block ships from traveling through the Strait of Hormuz.</p>

Ten minutes later, Yildiz unleashed a spectacular strike from the edge of the box into the top-right corner to give Juventus a 2-0 lead.
