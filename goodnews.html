        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced a new partnership with supermarkets and food manufacturers in England to encourage healthier food choices among consumers. The voluntary plan aims to tackle rising obesity rates by having retailers promote healthier items through discounts, loyalty point incentives, or store layout changes. While the initiative does not impose specific targets, it will require major retailers to report on their healthy food sales to increase accountability. The move is part of a broader government strategy to improve national health and reduce strain on the NHS.</p>

          <p>U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts issued a warning about the potential dangers of inflammatory rhetoric from politicians directed at judges. Speaking at a judicial conference, Roberts noted that such language can lead to serious threats of violence, referencing past instances involving both Democratic and Republican leaders without naming them directly. He emphasized that while criticism is part of the job, threatening statements from high levels of government are inappropriate and dangerous. His remarks underscore growing concerns about judicial security and the politicization of the courts.</p>

          <p>A new pilot program in Kent, England, is teaching primary school children as young as five about sun safety to help reduce future cases of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer. The initiative, planned for a nationwide rollout in 2026, educates students on checking UV levels and applying sunscreen correctly. Health experts emphasize that sunburn in childhood significantly increases later-life cancer risk, and the program aims to instill lifelong healthy habits. The effort comes as projections show melanoma diagnoses in the UK are expected to continue rising in the coming years.</p>

The rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, lifted off from Tanegashima Island, deploying a government satellite to monitor greenhouse gases. The H2A series, which had a 98 percent success rate over its lifetime, is now being succeeded by the more cost-effective H3 rocket.

          <p>An estimated crowd of over 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a large-scale demonstration for human rights and a clear message to Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The march proceeded despite a government ban, which was justified under a controversial 2021 law equating homosexuality with pedophilia. Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, supported the event, framing it as a peaceful show of freedom against a "hateful power." The large turnout, significantly higher than in previous years, was seen by many as a direct response to the government's attempt at suppression.</p>
