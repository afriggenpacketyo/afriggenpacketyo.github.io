          <p>Two families in western North Carolina, who lost their homes to Hurricane Helene, received brand-new homes donated by Samaritan's Purse. Rev. Franklin Graham dedicated the mobile homes, emphasizing the organization's mission to restore hope to families devastated by the storm. The new homes are built with reinforced walls and weather-resistant features, fully furnished and move-in ready, and each family received a Bible. Samaritan's Purse is building dozens of new homes across the region and has provided extensive aid, including clearing debris and delivering essential supplies.</p>

          <p>Erling Haaland's struggles at Wembley Stadium persisted during Manchester City's FA Cup final loss against Crystal Palace. Despite having the chance to equalize from the penalty spot, Haaland surprised spectators by handing the ball to Omar Marmoush, who then missed the penalty. Manager Pep Guardiola indicated the decision was based on the players' feelings, while former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney suggested the pressure of taking a penalty at Wembley might have been a factor for Haaland.</p>

          <p>Federal courts are increasingly pushing back against the Trump administration‚Äôs aggressive deportation policies, insisting on due process for immigrants. The Supreme Court recently rebuked the administration for providing only a day‚Äôs warning to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation, emphasizing the importance of allowing individuals to challenge their removal. This decision aligns with a broader legal trend of courts upholding the right to due process for immigrants, even as the Trump administration seeks to expedite deportations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that the secret to happiness may depend upon individual differences rather than broad, population-level factors. Researchers found that socioeconomic factors, such as health, wealth, and social connections, significantly influence happiness, but individual perspectives also play a crucial role. The study measured associations between life and domain satisfaction at the population and individual level, using data from over 40,000 subjects. The findings highlight possible limitations of population-level happiness research and suggest that a more personalized approach may be more effective in promoting happiness.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement to lift all sanctions on Syria took U.S. sanctions officials by surprise, lacking specifics on which measures would be rolled back and at what pace. The decision came after months of lobbying from Syria's transitional government, which blames sanctions for its economic struggles. While some work was underway at Treasury for an incremental lifting of sanctions, the broad announcement caught many officials off guard. Relief may come in the form of waivers, allowing foreign partners to provide aid without facing penalties.</p>

          <p>As the United States and China reduce their investment and presence in Africa, the United Arab Emirates is expanding its influence through significant economic and strategic investments.

With investments totaling $110 billion since 2019, the UAE aims to diversify its economy away from fossil fuels and establish itself as a key player in global supply chains. This shift contrasts with the Trump administration's efforts to reduce America‚Äôs involvement in Africa.</p>
