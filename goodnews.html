          <p>A massive 54-pound meteorite, confirmed to be the largest piece of Mars ever discovered on Earth, is set for auction at Sotheby's in New York. The rock, believed to have been ejected from Mars by an asteroid impact, was found in Niger in late 2023. It represents nearly 7% of all known Martian material on our planet and is expected to fetch between $2 million and $4 million. The auction also features a juvenile Ceratosaurus dinosaur skeleton, highlighting a major event for natural history collectors.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has declared an end to its armed struggle against the Turkish state, beginning a disarmament process after more than four decades of conflict. The move follows a call for peace from imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, with fighters ceremonially destroying weapons in Iraqi Kurdistan. For the process to succeed, the PKK is demanding concessions from Turkey, including Ocalan's release and legal reforms for other political prisoners. This development could significantly enhance Turkey's stability and regional standing if a sustainable peace agreement is achieved.</p>

          <p>While installing a water pipeline in the historic Old Town harbor of Dubrovnik, Croatia, workers made a remarkable archaeological find: the remains of an 18th-century wooden boat. The vessel was discovered embedded in the seabed and has been dated to the late 1700s based on radiocarbon analysis. Marine archaeologists are now working to protect and further examine the wreck, which was found in a city famously used as a filming location for "Game of Thrones." This discovery adds to a series of significant shipwreck findings across Europe this year.</p>

          <p>On the 40th anniversary of Live Aid, the monumental 1985 benefit concert is remembered for its global reach and fundraising success for Ethiopian famine relief, but also faces modern scrutiny. Organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, the event united nearly 2 billion viewers and featured iconic performances, setting a template for future benefit concerts. However, critics now highlight the lack of African performers and its reinforcement of a "white savior" narrative. Despite these criticisms, the event's organizers maintain it successfully placed a critical issue on the global political agenda.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A campaign in the UK is calling for cosmetic and skincare companies to list ingredients in English rather than the standard Latin-based nomenclature, arguing the current system puts people with allergies at risk. Proponents, including an MP with a severe nut allergy, state that consumers cannot be expected to recognize allergens listed in Latin. Personal stories highlight instances of severe allergic reactions from products whose ingredient lists were not easily understood. While the industry association defends the Latin system for global harmonization, advocates argue for clearer, more accessible labeling similar to food products.</p>

          <p>A new study offers insights into the potential impact of China's planned mega-dam in Tibet on water flow to downstream countries like India. Contrary to fears that the dam could cause droughts, data from two existing upstream dams on the Brahmaputra River shows a significant increase in water levels during the dry season. The study, which analyzed hydrological data since 2014, found that low flows in February increased by over 50%. This suggests that the dam's water regulation could actually alleviate dry-season water scarcity in India, rather than exacerbating it.</p>
