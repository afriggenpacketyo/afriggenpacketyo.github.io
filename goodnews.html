        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans have proposed an amendment to President Trump's domestic policy bill to create "Trump accounts" for newborns, providing $1,000 to every eligible child's account, which would be invested in the stock market. Families could contribute up to $5,000 annually to the accounts, which could be used for expenses such as a down payment on a home, education, or starting a small business. While similar to existing state programs, experts note that the initial contribution may not be sufficient to cover significant expenses, and tax penalties could disproportionately affect lower-income families. Some experts question the tax benefits of the proposed accounts, suggesting they may function similarly to taxable brokerage accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has ceded sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, a move driven by legal challenges and security considerations. The government feared that without ceding sovereignty, the joint UK-US military base on Diego Garcia would become unworkable due to rulings from UN bodies asserting Mauritius's claim to the islands. Additionally, the agreement aims to prevent China from establishing a military presence in the islands, as the UK can now effectively veto any foreign power's presence. The deal has faced criticism from those who believe the UK is weakening its security and submitting to international lawyers.</p>

          <p>OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is acquiring io, a device startup launched by former Apple designer Jony Ive, for nearly $6.5 billion. The collaboration aims to create a new family of devices optimized for artificial intelligence, as current devices like laptops and phones are considered outdated for this purpose. Ive and his design firm LoveFrom will oversee design and creative responsibilities across OpenAI and io. Analysts suggest this move positions OpenAI to shape the user experience for physical AI, which involves integrating AI into tangible objects like robots and wearable technologies.</p>

          <p>Home equity loan interest rates have fallen to a new low in 2025, averaging 8.23%, making it an opportune time for homeowners to consider this financing option. Unlike HELOCs, home equity loans offer fixed rates, protecting borrowers from potential future rate hikes. With HELOC rates increasing and other financing options like personal loans and credit cards carrying higher interest rates, securing a home equity loan now could be advantageous. Homeowners should carefully calculate repayment costs, as their home serves as collateral.</p>
