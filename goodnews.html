          <p>China's ambassador, Xiao Qian, stated that China and Australia are prepared to move beyond stabilizing their relationship towards more productive economic cooperation. He highlighted the potential for closer alignment between Australia's mining sector and China's manufacturing, envisioning joint exploration, technology sharing, and enhanced capacity. Xiao emphasized the "highly compatible" development strategies of both nations, suggesting they can complement each other to build green, secure, and sustainable industrial chains. This marks a positive shift after a period of strained ties and export curbs that began in 2019-2020.</p>

          <p>China has introduced its first domestically developed e-beam lithography tool, named Xizhi, marking a significant milestone in its chipmaking capabilities. Developed by Zhejiang University, this machine uses a focused electron beam to create chip circuits on silicon wafers. This advancement is crucial for China's national push for technological self-reliance, especially in response to US export restrictions on high-tech equipment. The delivery of Xizhi is expected to help overcome current impasses in advanced chip manufacturing, bolstering China's research and development efforts in this critical sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sky Sports is reportedly close to securing a new six-year deal for exclusive UK live broadcasting rights for golf's US Open, fending off competition from Netflix. This extension would solidify Sky's dominant position in UK televised golf, as it already holds rights for major men's and women's tournaments, the Ryder Cup, PGA Tour, and DP World Tour. Netflix, despite making a credible offer, appears to be focusing on standalone events that attract new subscribers, rather than year-round content. This reflects Netflix's growing interest in sports content, following successful ventures like the Mike Tyson-Jake Paul fight.</p>

          <p>A leading US medical journal, the Annals of Internal Medicine, has rejected Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s demand to retract a Danish study on vaccine safety. The study, which analyzed over 1.2 million children, found no evidence that aluminum in vaccines increases health risks for autoimmune or neurodevelopmental disorders. Editor-in-chief Dr. Christine Laine affirmed the study's validity, despite Kennedy's claims of it being "deceitful propaganda" and "meticulously designed not to find harm." The journal plans to address criticisms on its website, maintaining confidence in the research's integrity.</p>

          <p>Former BBC Radio 1 DJ Clara Amfo disclosed that her struggles with deep depression contributed to her decision to leave the station last year. She explained on Fearne Cotton's Happy Place podcast that she felt "burnt out" and in a "negative headspace" in mid-2023, prompting a break and ultimately the choice to exit her show. While also feeling "completely satiated" by the job and wanting to avoid it becoming a chore, her mental health struggles were a significant factor. Amfo emphasized her desire to remain a music fan and engage with people authentically, rather than solely for professional gain.</p>

          <p>The Milwaukee Brewers' recent 12-5 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates carried an unusual stakes: free hamburgers for the entire city of Milwaukee. Pitcher Brandon Woodruff admitted feeling extra pressure due to the long-standing local promotion by George Webb restaurants, which promises free burgers if the Brewers achieve a 12-game winning streak. This feat, accomplished for only the second time since 1987, when over 170,000 burgers were given away, brings a unique celebration to the city. The win not only extended Milwaukee's winning streak to 12 games but also delivered on a beloved local tradition.</p>

          <p>The article explores the enduring appeal and various interpretations of the "Amelia Bedelia" children's book series. It delves into the character of Amelia, a maid who comically misinterprets instructions literally, leading to household chaos. Beyond the common explanation of literal interpretation, the article discusses theories of Amelia as an autistic character or even a "class warrior" subverting her wealthy employers' expectations. The author suggests children enjoy Amelia because she is an adult who acts silly and challenges authority, making commands look absurd. The series' continued popularity underscores its unique charm and relatable themes for young readers.</p>

This acquisition would transfer ownership from Allen's sister, Jody Allen, who has managed the team since his passing in 2018, marking a significant change in the NBA franchise's ownership.

          <p>The plant-based meat industry is undergoing strategic shifts to counter criticisms of being overly processed and unhealthy, which have stalled sales. Beyond Meat, for instance, is rebranding to "Beyond" and launching "Beyond Ground," a neutral-flavored, simpler-ingredient product. In contrast, Impossible Foods emphasizes a "meatier brand identity" and taste, maintaining its heme-replicating ingredient. Both companies are betting on different approaches to attract consumers. Despite scientific backing for plant-based meats' health and environmental benefits, consumer perception remains a challenge, often influenced by familiarity and social norms. The industry's success hinges on overcoming these complex "food fights."</p>
