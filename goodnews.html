          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced the signing of a historic peace agreement, declaring an end to two years of fighting in Gaza. Speaking from Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, he described the achievement as "peace in the Middle East," a goal long sought but previously considered unattainable. The deal's finalization followed Hamas's release of the last 20 living hostages and Israel's withdrawal of troops from frontline positions. According to Trump, mediators will now proceed to "Phase Two" of the comprehensive 20-point peace plan to ensure lasting stability.</p>

          <p>As part of a new ceasefire agreement, Hamas has released 20 hostages, bringing a measure of relief amid a conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. The article provides detailed profiles of the released individuals, including fraternal twins Gali and Ziv Berman, Nova music festival security guard Eitan Mor, and others who endured over two years in captivity. Their release was secured in exchange for approximately 2,000 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The deal marks a significant step in the peace process, though one female hostage is believed to remain in captivity, presumed deceased.</p>

          <p>A reverse mortgage allows homeowners aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash without monthly payments, offering a way to manage retirement finances. Homeowners can typically remain in their home for life, provided they use it as their primary residence and fulfill all loan obligations. These responsibilities include paying property taxes, maintaining homeowners insurance, and keeping the property in good condition. The loan becomes due upon the homeowner's death, moving out, or failing to meet these terms, at which point their heirs have several options for repayment.</p>

          <p>Actors Julia Roberts and Ayo Edebiri star in the new psychological thriller "After the Hunt," which explores themes of power and morality within an academic setting. Directed by Luca Guadagnino, the film centers on a college professor (Roberts) whose world is disrupted when her protégé (Edebiri) accuses a close colleague of misconduct. In an interview, the actors emphasized that the film is designed to provoke conversation and debate about its ambiguous truths. Roberts noted that both she and the director specifically sought out Edebiri for the critical role in the film.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, the next phase of the Gaza peace plan faces significant hurdles, including the disarmament of Hamas and establishing post-war governance. Key components of the plan involve a surge in humanitarian aid and the formation of a new Palestinian security force overseen by international partners. However, disagreements persist, with Israel demanding Hamas's complete disarmament and rejecting Palestinian statehood, while Hamas refuses to disarm. The long-term success of the fragile truce will depend on resolving these complex and contentious issues through ongoing negotiations.</p>

          <p>Despite Meta Platforms' stock being stuck in a trading range recently, analysts at Citi have placed a 90-day positive catalyst watch on the company. The firm sees promising signs for Meta's core advertising business, including ad load growth and an increasing share of ad budgets. This optimism comes as the stock has faced pressure from competitors like OpenAI's new video generation tool, Sora. Citi maintains that Meta is its top pick in the sector, setting a price target of $915, suggesting confidence that upcoming catalysts could drive the share price higher. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New guidance from researchers at King's College London suggests that consuming several kiwi fruits per day can be an effective remedy for constipation. The research, which reviewed existing evidence, also found that drinking mineral-rich water and taking magnesium oxide supplements can improve symptoms. This advice offers alternatives to the standard recommendation of simply increasing dietary fiber. According to the study's lead author, focusing on specific fruits and drinks is often a more effective initial step for the one in ten people affected by chronic constipation.</p>

          <h2>Debunking Three Common Myths About Managing Credit Card Debt</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-13 12:13:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising interest rates, many consumers are impacted by common myths about managing credit card debt that can worsen their financial situation. One prevalent misconception is that carrying a balance helps improve a credit score, which is false and only results in paying unnecessary interest. Another harmful belief is that making only minimum payments is a sufficient debt management strategy, when in reality it can prolong debt for decades. Additionally, closing old credit cards can negatively affect a credit score by increasing credit utilization and shortening credit history, contrary to popular belief.</p>

          <p>The finalization of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage exchange has fostered a sense of "paradoxical optimism" despite the immense devastation of the past two years. The article suggests that the sheer scale of the catastrophe may force both sides to consider new possibilities for peace that were previously unimaginable. This shift is partly credited to the unconventional diplomacy of President Trump, whose plan calls for an international security force and a technocratic Palestinian committee to govern Gaza. While significant challenges remain, the end of the conflict has created a rare moment where a different future seems possible.</p>
