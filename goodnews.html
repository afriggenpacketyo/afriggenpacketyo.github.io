          <p>The England women's national football team, the Lionesses, delivered a dominant performance against Portugal, winning 6-0 in the Women's Nations League. Aggie Beever-Jones was the standout player, scoring her first England hat-trick in just 33 minutes, marking a scintillating performance from her. The match served as a strong statement ahead of Euro 2025, where the Lionesses will defend their European title, showcasing their attacking prowess and ability to overcome off-pitch distractions. Goalkeeper Hannah Hampton barely had to move a muscle due to England's control of the game.</p>

          <p>A clinical trial suggests that an immunotherapy drug, pembrolizumab, could significantly extend the lives of individuals with advanced head and neck cancer, potentially preventing cancer recurrence. The trial demonstrated that the drug doubled the time patients remained cancer-free, increasing it from an average of 2.5 years to five years, and also reduced the risk of cancer returning elsewhere in the body. Patients received pembrolizumab before and after surgery, which researchers believe helped the body develop immunity to attack the cancer if it were to return. This new approach marks a significant advancement in treating these difficult cancers, offering hope for improved survival rates and quality of life.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will double tariffs on steel imports to 50% during a speech at U.S. Steel's Irvin Works in Pennsylvania. Trump stated that this increase would further protect the steel industry, making it more difficult for foreign steel to compete in the American market. He also addressed the proposed merger with Japan's Nippon, stating that Nippon has committed to maintaining U.S. Steel's blast furnaces at full capacity for at least a decade, with no layoffs or outsourcing, and U.S. Steel workers will receive a $5,000 bonus. The president framed the deal as a "partnership" controlled by the USA, despite U.S. Steel describing it as a merger.</p>

          <p>Loretta Swit, best known for her role as Major Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan on the TV series M*A*S*H, has died at the age of 87. Swit, who won two Emmy awards for her performance on the show, passed away at her home in New York, with the cause of death believed to be natural causes. M*A*S*H, which aired for 11 seasons, remains one of the most successful and acclaimed series in US television history, and Swit's portrayal of a tough but vulnerable Army nurse earned her widespread recognition. Beyond M*A*S*H, Swit also appeared in numerous other TV shows, movies, and stage productions, and was an advocate for animal rights.</p>

          <p>Loretta Swit, renowned for her role as Maj. Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan in the TV series "M*A*S*H," has died at 87 in her New York City home. She was known for her portrayal of the head nurse who often clashed with Alan Alda's Capt. Benjamin Franklin "Hawkeye" Pierce. The show addressed various issues like racism, sexism, and PTSD among service members, using comedy to tackle these tough subjects during the Vietnam War era. Swit aimed to portray Houlihan as a complex character, evolving beyond the "Hot Lips" nickname, and she received letters from women who were inspired to become nurses because of her role.</p>

          <p>China is scaling up the use of AI in urban management through its "smart cities" initiative, utilizing technologies like drones for nightly patrols in cities like Nanjing. These AI-driven systems aim to improve urban management and governance by focusing on areas often overlooked by human patrols. However, China's AI governance faces challenges similar to those in other parts of the world, including privacy protection and limited community involvement. Despite the rapid progress, analysts caution that addressing these challenges is crucial for the responsible and effective implementation of AI in urban environments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key U.S. inflation gauge slowed in April, with consumer prices rising just 2.1% compared to a year earlier, indicating that President Trump's tariffs have yet to significantly push up prices. Despite rising incomes, spending by Americans slowed, potentially reflecting an early reaction to higher prices on some imported goods. The report showed that overall prices and core prices both increased just 0.1% from March to April. Economists and business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect, although the timing and impact of those duties are now uncertain due to recent court rulings.</p>
