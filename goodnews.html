          <p>President Trump stated that China has "agreed to open up" following an agreement between the two countries to temporarily reduce tariffs on each other's goods. Trump said the purported commitments have not been finalized, but that China would suspend or remove non-tariff countermeasures imposed on the U.S. since April 2. The U.S. agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs on China to 30%, while Beijing said it would lower tariffs on U.S. goods to 10%.

A dedicated visa for social care workers will be scrapped, and stricter rules will be imposed on overseas students.

          <p>Freddie Freeman of the Los Angeles Dodgers credits a single off a pitch from Paul Skenes as the turning point for his recent hot streak at the plate. After struggling with his mechanics for over a year, Freeman felt his swing was back in sync during that at-bat. Since then, he has been batting .475 with multiple home runs and RBIs, making it one of the most productive stretches of his career. Despite dealing with an ankle injury, Freeman has continued to excel, attributing his success to seeing strikes and hitting them.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that tirzepatide, sold as Zepbound and Mounjaro, leads to more weight loss than semaglutide, known as Ozempic and Wegovy. Tirzepatide users lost about 20% of their body weight, while semaglutide users lost about 14% over a 72-week period. The study, funded by Lilly, also noted additional health benefits, such as improved blood pressure and cholesterol levels. However, the drugs remain expensive, often costing over $1,000 out of pocket, and insurance coverage is limited. (not investment advice)</p>

Mr. Alexander's release came on the eve of a visit by President Trump to the Middle East, and was portrayed by Hamas officials as an attempt to secure U.S. support for a wider deal to end the war. Unlike most other hostages, Mr. Alexander was released without a formally announced cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, highlighting the failure of efforts to secure a broader truce between the two sides.</p>

          <p>Credit counseling can assist with debt management, but it's important to understand the associated costs. Most nonprofit agencies offer free initial consultations, while debt management plans involve setup and monthly maintenance fees, typically ranging from $25 to $75 per month. Compared to debt settlement, consolidation, or bankruptcy, credit counseling is often more cost-effective and less damaging to credit scores. Credit counseling offers expert guidance, reduced interest rates, and a structured repayment plan, making it a smart approach to debt management. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has acknowledged Qatar's offer to provide the U.S. with a 747 jet for use as Air Force One, citing Boeing's delays in producing a new presidential aircraft. Trump expressed disappointment over the lengthy timeline for Boeing to build the new Air Force One, noting that the current aircraft is 40 years old. A White House official clarified that no aircraft "gift" will be presented or accepted during Trump's visit to Qatar this week, while Qatar said the "transfer of an aircraft for temporary use" to the U.S. Department of Defense was under consideration.</p>

          <p>Kosmos 482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972, reentered Earth's atmosphere after more than 50 years in orbit. The probe, originally intended to reach Venus, crashed into the Indian Ocean west of Jakarta, Indonesia. NASA and Roscosmos confirmed the reentry, with the European Space Agency estimating it occurred slightly earlier. Due to its design for Venus's harsh atmosphere, some astronomers predicted Kosmos 482 would survive reentry, potentially offering valuable insights for future spacecraft design.</p>
