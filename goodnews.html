        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Novo Nordisk announced a better-than-expected first-quarter net profit but revised its full-year sales growth expectations downward due to the impact of copycat drug compounders affecting Wegovy sales. Despite an 83% increase in Wegovy sales, the figure fell slightly short of analyst projections. The company now anticipates sales growth of 13% to 21% for 2025, down from the initial forecast of 16% to 24%. The article highlights the competitive pressures and market dynamics influencing the pharmaceutical giant's performance.</p>
