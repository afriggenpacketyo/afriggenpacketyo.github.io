          <p>Boeing has named Landon Loomis, a Mandarin-speaking former U.S. trade attaché and White House advisor, as the new president of its China division. The appointment comes as the American planemaker navigates renewed geopolitical and trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, which have previously impacted its aircraft sales and deliveries. Loomis's extensive experience in Beijing is seen as a strategic move to stabilize Boeing's position in the critical Chinese aviation market. The company faces challenges including potential export controls and increased competition from its European rival, Airbus, which recently expanded its manufacturing presence in China.</p>

          <p>Financial advisors are recommending that high-earning individuals increase their charitable giving before the end of 2025 to capitalize on existing tax benefits. New provisions in a tax bill signed by President Trump, which take effect in 2026, will reduce the tax advantages of donations for top earners. The changes introduce a floor, making contributions deductible only after they exceed 0.5% of adjusted gross income, and a ceiling that lowers the effective tax benefit. Wealth strategists suggest 'bunching' several years' worth of donations into 2025 or using donor-advised funds to maximize deductions before the new rules apply. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American Airlines reported a smaller-than-expected third-quarter loss and provided a strong profit forecast for the remainder of the year, exceeding Wall Street expectations and boosting its stock price. The carrier anticipates earning between 45 and 75 cents per share in the fourth quarter, significantly higher than analysts' projections. This positive outlook follows a challenging period for the airline industry, which has contended with shifting travel demands and economic uncertainty. The forecast suggests a potential recovery and stabilization for the airline as it adjusts its flight capacity to meet current market conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Sweden's Volvo Cars surged by as much as 41%, marking a potential best-ever trading day, after the company announced third-quarter profits that significantly beat analyst expectations. The automaker, owned by China's Geely Holding, attributed the strong performance to its ongoing cost-saving initiatives and some one-off items. The operating income for the July-September period was 6.4 billion Swedish kronor, a notable increase from the previous year. Despite the positive results, the company cautioned that the short-term market outlook remains challenging due to macroeconomic pressures and price competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A strike that would have shut down nearly two dozen Broadway musicals was averted as the musicians' union, AFM Local 802, reached a tentative three-year labor deal with producers. The agreement includes important wage increases and higher contributions to the musicians' health fund, addressing key concerns for the union. This resolution follows a similar deal struck by the actors' union, Actors’ Equity, easing labor tensions in an industry that has seen a strong financial recovery since the pandemic. The successful negotiations prevent a major disruption to New York's tourism and entertainment sectors, which rely heavily on Broadway's economic contributions.</p>

          <p>Despite Lionel Messi winning the MLS Golden Boot with 29 goals, his season with Inter Miami will be widely considered a failure if the team does not win the MLS Cup. The club, co-owned by David Beckham, enters the playoffs as a top contender but has yet to secure the league's main championship trophy during Messi's tenure. His arrival has transformed the franchise, attracting top talent and boosting its global profile, but expectations are now centered on achieving playoff success. The team begins its best-of-three first-round series against Nashville SC, with immense pressure to deliver the coveted title.</p>

Wembanyama, returning from an injury that shortened his previous season, reminded the league of his formidable talent by outplaying veteran defenders. Flagg, one of the youngest players to ever start in a debut, acknowledged his performance was 'not great' amid first-game jitters.</p>

A victory would make him the youngest player to ever top the PDC rankings, surpassing Michael van Gerwen, who achieved the feat at age 24. Depending on the tournament's results, Littler could also overtake current number one Luke Humphries even without winning the title outright.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly in discussions to take equity stakes in several quantum computing companies, including IonQ and Rigetti Computing, in exchange for federal funding. This move aligns with a recent strategy of securing government ownership in industries deemed vital to national security, following similar investments in rare earths and semiconductors. The policy reflects a greater willingness in Washington to intervene in strategic sectors to bolster domestic capabilities and compete with China. Quantum computing is viewed as a critical future technology with vast economic and security implications, prompting this proactive government investment approach. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ethiopia is pursuing a currency swap to convert its dollar-denominated loans from China into yuan, a move that could significantly reduce its debt-servicing costs and support Beijing's goal of internationalizing its currency. This follows a similar action by Kenya and comes as Ethiopia is restructuring about $15 billion in external debt. By switching to yuan, Ethiopia could see its interest rate drop from 7.25% to 3%, providing critical financial relief. This trend, also seen in countries like Sri Lanka and Hungary, highlights a growing willingness among borrowing nations to use the yuan for more favorable financing terms.</p>
