          <p>A coalition of civil rights groups, led by the African American Policy Forum (AAPF), launched a week-long initiative to protest Donald Trump's attacks on Black history and DEI efforts, including executive orders targeting the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC). The Freedom to Learn campaign aims to "flood the zone with Black history" in response to what they see as an attempt to erase difficult chapters of American history. The campaign included educational sessions, meetups, and a "Black history challenge" to promote awareness and preservation of Black history. Trump's administration has threatened to withhold federal funding from schools with DEI programs and has ordered an overhaul of the Smithsonian Institution to remove "divisive or anti-American ideology".</p>

          <p>Harvard University President Alan Garber is facing a unique challenge as he defends the institution against the Trump administration's attempts to cut federal funding and strip its tax-exempt status, while simultaneously addressing concerns about campus culture. Garber agrees with some of the Trump administration's criticisms, acknowledging that Harvard has sometimes shut out dissenting voices and allowed antisemitism to go unchecked. He has taken steps to reform the university's policies on student discipline, protests, and diversity, which has sparked pushback from some students who feel he is prioritizing optics over values. Garber is determined to protect Harvard's academic independence and ensure that American research universities can continue to contribute to the nation's progress.</p>
