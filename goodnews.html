        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An ambitious operation to smuggle over 2.2 tonnes of cocaine into Europe was intercepted by Irish authorities, resulting in the conviction of eight individuals. The plan involved a "mother" ship, the MV Matthew, transferring the drugs to a smaller vessel in the Irish Sea, with coordination directed from Dubai. This successful bust highlights a growing trend of cartels using Ireland as a "back door" into the UK and Europe due to its extensive and less-policed coastline. Despite this victory, law enforcement agencies warn they lack the resources to intercept all suspected drug-trafficking ships crossing the Atlantic.</p>

The meeting follows a day that saw a near-record 1,097 people arrive in the UK via small boats, bringing this year's total to over 30,000. The talks will also cover other transnational threats, including online child sexual abuse and the spread of synthetic opioids.</p>

          <h2>Japanese Markets Surge Following Announcement of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Resignation</h2>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index rose sharply after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his intention to resign, following weeks of pressure stemming from his party's election defeat. The market's positive reaction is seen by some analysts as excitement over potential successors, such as Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae, who are perceived as pro-growth. Takaichi, in particular, is favored for her focus on deregulation and opposition to interest rate hikes. The political uncertainty, however, has led to a weakening of the yen and a continued sell-off of Japanese government bonds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After defeating rival Jannik Sinner to claim his second US Open title, Carlos Alcaraz described the performance as the most consistent and best of his career. The 22-year-old dropped only a single set throughout the entire tournament, showcasing a dominant run of form that also saw him win the French Open earlier in the year. This victory marks his sixth major trophy and will return him to the world No. 1 ranking, ending Sinner's 65-week reign at the top. Sinner acknowledged Alcaraz's superior play, admitting his own game was too predictable on the day.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A joint China-US research team has discovered that Mars has a solid inner core, a finding that challenges previous models of the planet's formation and thermal history. By analyzing seismic data from marsquakes recorded by NASA's InSight lander, scientists determined the solid core has a radius of about 600km. Previously, it was thought that Mars had not cooled fast enough to "freeze" its liquid metal center into a solid state. This discovery places Mars alongside Earth and the Moon as the only bodies in the solar system currently known to have a solid inner core.</p>

          <p>Glendale police have arrested two men for allegedly crashing a wedding and stealing a gift box containing an estimated $60,000 in cash and checks.

          <p>A 29-year-old woman in Lowestoft, UK, experienced what is known as a cryptic pregnancy, having no idea she was expecting until she gave birth to a baby boy in a toilet.

Family members and an off-duty paramedic assisted until an ambulance arrived. Experts note that such cases, while rare, affect about one in 2,500 births, often because symptoms like movement or missed periods are not present or are misinterpreted.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles has purchased the historic carousel in Griffith Park, an amusement ride famous for inspiring Walt Disney to create Disneyland. The merry-go-round, built in 1926, has been closed since 2022 following the death of its operator and legal disputes over its ownership. The city's Recreation and Parks Commission finalized a million-dollar deal to acquire the ride, with plans to repair and reopen it ahead of its centennial in 2026. The carousel is one of the few remaining four-across wooden carousels of its kind and is considered a "crown jewel" of the park.</p>
