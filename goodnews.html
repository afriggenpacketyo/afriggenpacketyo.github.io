          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to the Sizewell C nuclear plant project in Suffolk, aiming to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes.

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have dramatically decreased, with a 47% reduction in fatal overdoses among those aged 20 to 29. Provisional data from the CDC indicates that fatal overdoses in this age group fell from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 last year. Experts attribute this decline to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less potent fentanyl being sold, increased addiction healthcare access, and a shift towards less risky drug use among teens and young adults. While the trend is promising, challenges remain in addressing addiction among those already struggling with it.</p>
