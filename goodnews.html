          <p>Musician John Fogerty has released a new album featuring re-recordings of his iconic Creedence Clearwater Revival hits, a project undertaken after he finally regained the rights to his own songs. For decades, Fogerty had lost control over his compositions following the band's breakup, a painful experience that led him to stop performing his own music for a time. Encouraged by his wife, Julie, he bought back his catalog and recorded the new album with his sons, who are part of his touring band. The project represents a personal and professional victory for the 80-year-old artist, allowing him to reclaim his musical legacy.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has secured its largest-ever warship export deal by value, a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The Ministry of Defence announced that the deal will support approximately 4,000 jobs in the UK, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be constructed. This partnership is set to create a combined fleet of 13 British and Norwegian anti-submarine frigates, significantly reinforcing NATO's northern flank. The agreement marks a major success for the British defense industry, which was chosen over competitors from France, Germany, and the United States.</p>

          <p>During a college football game between the New Mexico Lobos and the Michigan Wolverines, a minor on-field altercation took an unusual turn. After a play in the third quarter, some pushing and shoving occurred between players from both teams. When Michigan linebacker Ernest Hausmann appeared to confront New Mexico guard Richard Pearce, Pearce chose to de-escalate the situation by quickly running away from the developing fracas. The moment was captured on replay as officials worked to separate the other players. Michigan ultimately won the game 34-17, but the lineman's evasive maneuver provided a memorable highlight.</p>

          <h2>Comedian Jim Gaffigan Laments the Overwhelming Bounty of His Summer Garden</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a humorous commentary, comedian Jim Gaffigan reflects on the perils of amateur gardening, specifically the overwhelming surplus of cucumbers he faces every August. He humorously details his annual cycle of optimism in May, followed by the dramatic consequences of his attempt at "succession planting" to ensure a steady harvest. This strategy resulted in an unmanageable deluge of cucumbers that overwhelmed his family's capacity to eat them fresh, in salads, or even as pickles. Gaffigan concludes by comically admitting his lack of gardening skill and desperation to give away the excess produce, a relatable problem for many home gardeners.</p>

          <h2>Germany Reflects on a Decade of Social and Political Change Since 2015 Refugee Influx</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A decade after then-Chancellor Angela Merkel's declaration of "wir schaffen das" ("we can do it"), Germany is assessing the long-term impacts of welcoming hundreds of thousands of refugees in 2015. The policy, prompted by wars in Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq, has profoundly reshaped German society, politics, and culture. While data shows that nearly two-thirds of refugees from that wave had found employment by 2022, challenges with integration and social cohesion persist. The period has also seen a surge in support for the far-right AfD party, fueled by concerns over crime and immigration, creating an ongoing national debate about the policy's legacy.</p>

          <h2>New Medical Research Explores the Brain's Role in Chronic Pain</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 09:56:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dr. Sanjay Gupta's new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," delves into the complex nature of chronic pain, highlighting recent research that identifies the brain as a primary source. The article discusses how the brain can memorize and amplify pain signals, sometimes creating sensations even without a physical injury, similar to phantom limb pain. It features the story of musician Ed Mowery, who suffered from a rare condition until a revolutionary clinical trial used deep brain stimulation to predict and interrupt his pain signals before he could consciously feel them. This breakthrough suggests a future where pain can be managed by targeting its neural circuitry directly.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed painter Alex Katz, known for his distinctive figurative art and landscapes over a seven-decade career, is now dedicating his efforts to promoting the work of other artists. At 98, Katz has gifted a collection of over one hundred paintings to the Portland Museum of Art in Maine, featuring pieces by both emerging and established artists he admires. The exhibition, titled "Painting Energy," reflects his desire to support artists who faced similar struggles as he did early in his career. Katz, who still paints daily, says he is drawn to art that has an immediate energetic impact, or a "pow."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, building long-term cooperation is more effective than demanding immediate obedience. The key is creating emotional safety, where children feel respected and heard. The article suggests using specific "magic phrases" that calm a child's nervous system, such as "I believe you" to defuse shame, and "Let's figure this out together" to encourage problem-solving instead of power struggles. Other phrases like "I'm listening" and "I'm on your side" shift the dynamic from adversarial to collaborative, making children more receptive to guidance and boundaries.</p>

The article posits that hunters are often among the most dedicated conservationists, funding wildlife management through license fees and taxes on firearms.

          <p>Psychotherapist Amy Morin recounts her journey of rebuilding her life after her husband died suddenly when she was 26, an event that she believed would preclude her from ever marrying again. A few years later, she reconnected with a high school acquaintance, Steve Hasty, who would become her second husband and, as she describes him, her "biggest cheerleader." Their relationship not only provided companionship but also inspired her to pursue a new, adventurous life she had never imagined. Encouraged by Hasty, she left her traditional therapy job to become a full-time author and now lives with him on a sailboat in the Florida Keys.</p>

          <p>Actor Jeremy Allen White reflects on the challenge of playing rock legend Bruce Springsteen in the new film "Deliver Me From Nowhere," which focuses on the creation of the stark 1982 album "Nebraska." White reveals his initial trepidation about the role, given his lack of musical experience and the intimate connection fans have with Springsteen. He found a point of connection in the feeling of being an impostor, which Springsteen was experiencing at that time in his personal life. White worked closely with Springsteen, who approved of the film, and found that singing the album's poignant songs helped him understand the artist's emotional state.</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, is shedding light on the origins of surfing in the mainland United States, which began in 1885. Three teenage Hawaiian princes, sent to a military school nearby, brought their royal sport to the local beaches, riding waves on massive boards fashioned from local redwood trees. Their aquatic feats were documented in a local newspaper at the time and left a lasting impression, with locals adopting the practice years later. This act of "surf diplomacy" by the princes was a crucial precursor to the sport's later popularization by surfing legend Duke Kahanamoku in the 20th century.</p>

These single-use plastic containers, an iconic staple in many Asian restaurants, are being targeted because their small size makes them difficult to recycle properly. The ban builds on previous legislation that outlawed items like plastic straws and carrier bags. Officials state the policy is designed to reduce waste, cut carbon emissions, and protect marine life, noting that without action, the flow of plastic into the ocean is projected to triple by 2040.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece explores the common modern dilemma of feeling guilty for personal happiness while the world is experiencing numerous humanitarian and political crises. The author references ancient religious and philosophical traditions that view humanity as a single body, where the suffering of one member is felt by all. However, these same traditions also advocate for feeling the joys of others, a concept known as "sympathetic joy." The article argues that to be fully connected humans, we must allow ourselves to experience both the world's pain and its delights, and that feeling good is a form of resistance against forces that seek to create misery.</p>
