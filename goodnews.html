          <p>Sony Group shares experienced a rise of over 2% amid volatile trading following the announcement of a 250 billion yen share buyback and better-than-expected operating income. The company's operating income for the last three months beat estimates, though it showed a decrease from the previous year. Sony also detailed a partial spinoff of its financial unit, planning to distribute over 80% of the shares to shareholders. However, Sony's outlook for the current financial year was lackluster, forecasting a slight rise in operating profit, impacted by trade war effects, though this estimate did not reflect the recent trade deal between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>Family offices are growing rapidly as the ultra-rich seek personalized wealth management services, but they face a talent crunch in finding qualified money managers. Trust is a critical factor, often outweighing other qualifications, leading to selectivity and difficulty in filling roles. Family offices struggle to compete with banks and private equity firms for top talent, particularly for combined roles like chief investment officer and CFO. Young employees are hesitant to join due to the lack of corporate structure and perceived "retirement job" status, while European family offices are raising compensation packages to attract and retain talent.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, a significant step towards their potential release after more than three decades for the 1989 killings of their parents. Judge Michael V. Jesic cited the brothers' rehabilitation and support from corrections officials as factors in his decision, emphasizing they have earned the chance for parole consideration. The brothers apologized for their crimes, acknowledging the pain they caused their family and the legal system, and spoke of their desire to help others if released. While the resentencing makes them immediately eligible for parole, the final decision rests with the state parole board and Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>

          <p>Iran has proposed a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington's demand to dismantle its nuclear program. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to American special envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman, though Mr. Witkoff's spokesman denied the proposal was discussed. The plan entails Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with representatives from other countries providing oversight. This venture would be permanent, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, potentially addressing concerns of both Iran and the United States.</p>

          <p>U.S. retail egg prices fell in April for the first time in months, decreasing to an average of $5.12 per dozen after reaching a record $6.23 in March, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Despite the decline, egg prices remain near historic highs due to a persistent outbreak of bird flu that has wiped out flocks of egg-laying hens. Experts anticipate further price drops in May and June due to decreased consumer demand after Easter and fewer bird flu outbreaks. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is investing $1 billion to help farmers improve biosecurity measures, and the U.S. has increased egg imports from various countries.</p>

However, both countries have retained a portion of the tariffs, which will be negotiated during the 90-day pause. China also agreed to suspend or remove non-tariff countermeasures, including export controls on rare-earth minerals. This agreement aims to improve the trade relationship between the world's two largest economies.</p>

Researchers filmed and recorded instances of chimpanzees applying plants to their wounds and tending to the wounds of other animals, suggesting a capacity for empathy.
