          <p>Two major convenience store chains in Japan, Family Mart and Lawson, have begun selling government-released stockpiled rice at select stores in Tokyo and Osaka. This move aims to increase the availability of rice for consumers struggling with soaring rice prices. The stores will sell rice from the 2021 harvest in small portions to make it more affordable, particularly for individuals living alone. This initiative joins major supermarkets and e-commerce platforms in addressing the economic strain on consumers.</p>

          <p>India is striving to create its own advanced AI engine, despite having numerous AI startups and a growing focus on AI education. The IndiaAI Mission has been launched with a substantial budget to develop indigenous Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for critical sectors. Challenges include a shortage of high-end AI hardware, limited access to advanced GPUs, and insufficient cloud computing resources. The diversity of languages in India also poses a challenge, but experts believe that with cohesive collaboration between government, industry, and academia, India can launch a world-class LLM in a few years.</p>

          <p>Louisiana's legislature has passed a new law outlawing attempts to gain children's trust with the intent to commit sexual assault. The law, championed by a survivor of Catholic clergy molestation, his wife, and her father, a state lawmaker, makes it illegal to pursue an intimate relationship with a minor through manipulation or coercion. Authorities can act even if no abuse has occurred, applying to offenders at least four years older than the child. The law goes into effect on August 1, aiming to protect children from the insidious threat of grooming.</p>
