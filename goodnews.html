        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy added 147,000 jobs in June, significantly surpassing economists' predictions and demonstrating continued resilience in the labor market. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, its lowest point since February, with major gains seen in the government and health care sectors. Despite this positive performance, economists remain cautious, anticipating a slowdown in the latter half of the year due to potential impacts from U.S. trade tariffs. The strong data makes it likely the Federal Reserve will delay interest rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comparison of current interest rates reveals that a high-yield savings account could generate slightly more earnings on a $10,000 deposit over 18-month to three-year terms compared to a long-term CD. However, this calculation assumes that the variable rate on the savings account remains constant, which is unlikely. With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates soon, locking in a fixed, high CD rate now might prove to be a more profitable long-term strategy. This article provides a detailed breakdown for savers considering their options. (not investment advice)</p>

Crypto company Circle's stock has surged over 500% since its June debut, and other tech firms like CoreWeave have also performed well, encouraging more companies to prepare for public offerings. While high-profile companies like SpaceX and Stripe remain private, the increase in IPO activity provides a much-needed path to liquidity for investors.

          <p>Researchers are launching a new expedition to the remote Pacific island of Nikumaroro, 88 years after aviator Amelia Earhart's disappearance. The project, a collaboration between the Perdue Research Foundation and the Archaeological Legacy Institute, will investigate a satellite anomaly known as the "Taraia Object." Scientists hope to determine if this object is the submerged wreckage of Earhart's Lockheed Electra plane, which vanished in 1937. The expedition represents what some involved are calling the greatest opportunity yet to finally solve one of aviation's most enduring mysteries.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has interpreted the strong June jobs report as a validation of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's cautious approach to interest rates, contrasting with President Trump's demands for immediate cuts. The better-than-expected payroll growth suggests the economy remains robust, justifying the Fed's decision to hold rates steady. Cramer also noted that the market is currently overbought, suggesting investors might consider trimming profits from high-performing stocks.

          <p>This article reflects on the long-standing tradition of older generations expressing concern and often condescension towards the youth, a practice seen in publications for over a century. From worries in 1925 about dancing and short skirts to critiques of 1970s hippies, adults have consistently scrutinized the habits and character of young people. The author, a Millennial now turning 30, contemplates the fine line between empathetic observation and judgmental criticism when writing about Gen Z. The piece concludes that the key is to approach the topic with humility and nuance.</p>

          <p>As homeowners face soaring insurance costs, certain strategic renovations can help reduce premiums by mitigating risks that insurers closely watch. Replacing an old roof, especially with impact-resistant materials, is a key upgrade that can lead to significant discounts. Similarly, modernizing outdated electrical and plumbing systems can prevent costly fire and water damage claims, earning favor with insurers. Other effective projects include installing monitored security systems and adding storm shutters in hurricane-prone areas. Cosmetic upgrades, however, are unlikely to lower costs.</p>
