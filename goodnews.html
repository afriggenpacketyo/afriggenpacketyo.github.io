          <p>This weekend's "CBS Sunday Morning" program, hosted by Mo Rocca, will explore a diverse range of cultural and historical topics. A cover story will examine the Statue of Liberty's evolution into a symbol for immigrants, while other segments delve into the making of the film classic "Jaws" on its 50th anniversary. The episode also features an interview with biographer Ron Chernow about his new book on Mark Twain, a look at the competitive world of Rubik's speed cubing, and several food-related histories on condiments like ketchup and mayonnaise.</p>

          <h2>New Biography Explores Mark Twain's Enduring Connection to the Mississippi River</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, "Mark Twain," recounts the author's 1882 return to the Mississippi River, the setting that profoundly shaped his early life and literary voice. Traveling incognito to gather material for "Life on the Mississippi," Samuel Clemens found a river transformed by time, yet he felt an immediate sense of belonging in the pilot house of a steamboat. This journey underscored his deep nostalgia for his youth as a river pilot, a time he considered one of true freedom. The experience crystallized the paradox of his life: the more famous he became, the more he yearned for his past.</p>

          <h2>China's Communist Party Introduces New Rules Potentially Signaling Increased Delegation by Xi Jinping</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 22:00:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Communist Party has revised its working regulations for key policy-making and coordination bodies, a move some analysts interpret as a sign that President Xi Jinping may be delegating more authority. The new rules apply to central commissions and party leading groups, many of which were established or empowered under Xi's leadership. According to state media, the changes are intended to standardize the top-level policy process, with these organs focusing on major strategic planning and oversight. This development could also provide insights into Xi's long-term succession plans by clarifying the roles of his deputies.</p>

          <p>Hamas has formally submitted a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated proposal for a temporary ceasefire and hostage exchange with Israel. The group stated it is prepared to immediately begin negotiations on the implementation of the framework, which reportedly includes a 60-day truce. Under the proposed deal, Hamas would release 10 living hostages and the remains of 15 others, with discussions for a permanent ceasefire to occur during this period. While this marks a significant step, key issues like the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released remain points for further discussion.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter performed for a crowd of 65,000 at London's BST Festival, showcasing a noticeably toned-down version of her typically racy stage show. While still delivering her signature brand of sassy, relatable pop, the singer adapted her performance for a more family-friendly audience, forgoing some suggestive choreography for a t-shirt cannon. The review praises her as an accomplished and professional performer who can seamlessly switch between upbeat dance numbers and vulnerable acoustic moments. The show concluded with her massive hit "Espresso," solidifying a major career moment for the 26-year-old artist.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 19:09:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Securing a first job can be a frustrating cycle for young people who are told they lack the necessary experience. Career experts advise that applicants can overcome this by highlighting skills learned through other activities, such as volunteering, sports, or even home responsibilities. Recommendations include keeping CVs simple and one page long, tailoring cover letters to the specific job, and preparing thoroughly for interviews. While online applications are common, experts also suggest that speculatively dropping off a CV in person at local businesses can still be an effective way to show initiative.</p>

          <p>The Lifetime ISA (LISA), a UK savings vehicle, is a source of divided opinion among savers. Designed to help those under 40 save for a first home or retirement, it offers a 25% government bonus on annual contributions up to £4,000. While some users praise it as an excellent tool, others criticize its strict rules. Key complaints include a penalty that claws back some of the saver's own capital upon early withdrawal and a property price cap of £450,000, which has not been updated since 2017 and is increasingly restrictive.

The route passed through significant neighborhoods like Koreatown, MacArthur Park, and Chinatown, ending near the Metropolitan Detention Center where immigration detainees are held. Participants expressed a mix of outrage and defiance, aiming to be visible against policies they feel have created a climate of fear.</p>
