          <p>A man in Norway was surprised to find a large container ship had run aground in his front garden, narrowly missing his house. Johan Helberg was alerted by his neighbor who saw the ship heading towards the shore in Byneset, near Trondheim, around 5:00 local time. The Cypriot-flagged cargo ship, NCL Salten, carrying 16 people, had gone off course while traveling through the Trondheim Fjord. No injuries were reported, and authorities are investigating the cause of the crash, while the head of NCL expressed gratitude that no one was hurt and stated that they are awaiting the conclusion of the ongoing investigation by the relevant authorities.</p>

          <p>Pop Mart, the maker of the popular Labubu dolls, has temporarily stopped selling them in all UK stores until June due to reports of customers fighting over the toys. The decision follows incidents of chaos and unsafe conditions witnessed by customers, driven by the dolls' viral popularity on TikTok. Retail experts warn that this stock suspension may further increase demand, as the company works on a fairer system for distribution when the dolls return to shelves. The Labubu dolls, created by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung, have become a sought-after fashion accessory, with prices ranging from ¬£13.50 to hundreds of pounds on resale sites.</p>

This accusation follows previous federal funding cuts of over $400 million to the university. The Trump administration has been targeting elite universities like Columbia and Harvard, alleging they have become havens for antisemitism and ideological indoctrination. Columbia has stated it will continue to work with the government to combat antisemitism, harassment, and discrimination, contrasting with Harvard's refusal to comply with certain demands.</p>

Sections of the 5,000-ton vessel's bottom were crushed during the launch ceremony at the Chongji shipyard due to a detached transport cradle. Kim criticized military officials and shipyard operators, while state media reported that an inspection revealed the damage was "not serious" and would take about 10 days to repair.

          <p>The US Mint is set to stop producing new pennies following a decree by President Donald Trump, who considers the coin "so wasteful." The US Mint has made its final order of penny blanks and expects to halt production once these are used. Trump claims the penny costs the country too much, with the Treasury expecting annual savings of $56 million in reduced material costs. While some argue for the penny's usefulness in charity drives, advocates for its abolishment cite its high production cost and limited utility. Jay Zagorsky, professor at Boston University, supports ending penny production but suggests Congress legislate the rounding of prices to eliminate demand.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reinstating in-person training at the National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg, Maryland, after initially pausing it in March due to cost concerns. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reversed its decision following a comprehensive review that determined certain courses provide effective training. This move marks a reprieve for Emmitsburg, where the academy is a key part of the town's identity and economy. The administration also restored training at other facilities, responding to criticism from Maryland's congressional delegation and firefighters.</p>

          <p>An investigation is underway into the collapse of a roof at the Fengyang Drum Tower, a tourist site in central China, following a major renovation project completed last year. Hundreds of tiles fell off the roof, prompting questions about the quality of the repair work. The local culture and tourism bureau is investigating the incident, and media reports allege that the contractor had a history of illegally subcontracting renovations to unqualified personnel. The tower, built in 1375, underwent extensive repairs in 1995, with the most recent project costing 2.9 million yuan (US$402,600).</p>
