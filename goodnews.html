          <p>Alphabet reported second-quarter revenue and earnings that exceeded analyst estimates, driven by strong performance in its search, advertising, and cloud divisions. Despite the positive results, the company announced it will increase its capital expenditure forecast for 2025 by $10 billion to a total of $85 billion, signaling a major ramp-up in AI-related investments. Google's AI Overviews now reach over 2 billion monthly users, and its Gemini app has 450 million active users, highlighting the company's significant expansion in artificial intelligence. The company's overall revenue grew by 14% year-over-year, although operating expenses also saw a substantial increase.</p>

          <p>IBM reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, with significant growth in its software and hybrid cloud segments. However, the company's stock fell in after-hours trading, a reaction attributed to a cautious outlook from CEO Arvind Krishna, who cited geopolitical tensions and constrained U.S. federal spending. Despite these headwinds, IBM reaffirmed its full-year forecast for revenue growth and free cash flow. The results showed a nearly 8% year-over-year increase in revenue, a notable acceleration from the previous quarter.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judges Issue Rulings Preventing Immediate Deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 16:58:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a pair of significant legal decisions, federal judges in Tennessee and Maryland have intervened in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national facing human smuggling charges. A Tennessee judge ruled he should be released from criminal custody while awaiting trial, while a Maryland judge barred immigration authorities from immediately detaining or deporting him upon release. The Maryland order requires the government to provide 72 hours' notice before any removal proceedings and mandates his return to supervised release in Maryland. These rulings are a rebuke to the Trump administration, which had unlawfully deported Abrego Garcia once before.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines posted second-quarter earnings and revenue that did not meet Wall Street's expectations, reflecting ongoing challenges in the airline industry. Despite the shortfall, the company provided a cautiously optimistic outlook, stating that travel demand in the U.S. has begun to stabilize. In a move to boost investor confidence, Southwest also announced a new $2 billion share buyback program. The carrier had previously withdrawn its 2025 guidance in April, citing economic uncertainty and plans to reduce flights during off-peak periods to manage costs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially unveiled its AI Action Plan, a comprehensive federal strategy designed to maintain America's leadership in artificial intelligence. The plan includes over 90 policy actions focused on accelerating AI innovation and infrastructure development. Key pillars of the initiative involve supporting the construction of data centers and semiconductor plants, creating rules to eliminate "ideological bias" in government-contracted chatbots, and compelling federal agencies to repeal regulations that obstruct AI development. The strategy also establishes a program to export American AI technology packages to U.S. allies to counter global competitors like China.</p>

          <p>Meta has rolled out new safety features on its platforms, including Instagram, to better protect teenage users from exploitative content and potential scammers. The updates provide teens with more information about who they are interacting with and simplify the process of blocking and reporting suspicious accounts. This initiative follows the company's removal of nearly 135,000 Instagram accounts for sexualizing children and another 500,000 linked accounts. The move comes as Meta faces increasing pressure from policymakers and state attorneys general over the platform's impact on the mental health and safety of young users.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the current economic climate, savers weighing their options between a 6-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account must consider the trade-off between guaranteed returns and liquidity. A CD offers a fixed interest rate but requires locking funds away, while a high-yield savings account provides access to money but has a variable rate that could decrease. Based on current rates, a $10,000 deposit in a 6-month CD could earn slightly more guaranteed interest than a high-yield savings account over the same period. This makes the CD a potentially better choice for those who can afford to set their money aside. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA successfully launched two identical TRACERS satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket to study the interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. This phenomenon, known as "space weather," can create spectacular auroras but also poses a significant threat to satellites, power grids, and GPS communications. The twin spacecraft will fly in tandem, allowing scientists to take precise, rapid measurements of how energy from the sun couples with our planet's magnetosphere. The mission aims to improve understanding and prediction of these events to better protect critical infrastructure on Earth and in space.</p>

          <p>Personal finance personality Dave Ramsey has voiced strong opinions on modern tipping culture, specifically criticizing the practice of flipping an iPad screen for a tip at counter-service establishments. He calls this a "manipulation" and a "guilt trip" rather than a genuine service exchange for which a tip is warranted, stating he feels no obligation to tip in these situations. Ramsey clarified that he is a generous tipper for traditional services like restaurant waitstaff and hairstylists, viewing it as an act of generosity. However, he draws a firm line at what he sees as passive, pressure-based attempts to extract extra money from consumers.</p>

          <p>The new movie "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" is reviewed as a refreshing departure from modern superhero epics, embracing a staid, retro sci-fi tone reminiscent of the 1950s. Directed by Matt Shakman, the film presents its heroes as settled-down adults, skipping the typical origin story to focus on a more deliberate, character-driven narrative. The plot centers on the team facing the world-devouring Galactus, but the conflict is framed as a lean showdown of self-control versus gluttony rather than a frantic action caper. The review praises the film's emotionally credible performances, sleek visuals, and respect for its "lame" but dignified source material.</p>

          <p>A revolution in sports nutrition is enabling cyclists in the Tour de France to perform at unprecedented levels by consuming massive amounts of carbohydrates during races. According to exercise metabolism researcher Tim Podlogar, elite riders are now ingesting up to 120 grams of carbs per hour, a significant increase from previous norms. This is made possible by new energy gels and drinks formulated with specific glucose and fructose ratios that allow the body to absorb more fuel without gastrointestinal distress. This advanced fueling strategy helps athletes maintain high-intensity output over the grueling, multi-week event, fundamentally changing the physical limits of the sport.</p>

Backed by tech leaders like David Sacks, the initiative is framed as a "pro-growth" approach necessary for the U.S. to win the global AI race against competitors like China.
