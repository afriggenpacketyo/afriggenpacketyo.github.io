The company announced it will maintain its pace of shareholder returns by initiating another $3.5 billion in share buybacks for the upcoming quarter. This strong performance follows a strategic update focused on cost savings, shareholder value, and simplification, which appears to be well-received by investors.

          <p>Following significant pressure from the Indian government and Buddhist leaders, auction house Sotheby's has facilitated the return of the sacred Piprahwa Gems to India. The jewels, believed to be linked to the Buddha's remains, were withdrawn from a planned auction in Hong Kong after sparking ethical debates about selling sacred artifacts. The Mumbai-based Godrej Industries Group acquired the gems and will place them on permanent public display in India. This move has been celebrated by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a major victory for the nation's cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>The crew of China's Shenzhou-19 mission revealed that their record-setting spacewalk included an unexpected and challenging repair task. Astronaut Cai Xuzhe explained that a payload adaptor, a key docking mechanism for external experiments, became jammed during an installation procedure outside the Tiangong space station. Lacking specialized tools for the unforeseen problem, the astronauts had to improvise a solution in real-time with support from the ground control team. This highlights the crew's resourcefulness and problem-solving skills in a high-stakes environment.</p>

Blair Kinghorn will start on the left wing, replacing James Lowe, while James Ryan comes into the second row for Ollie Chessum. With the series already secured, the selection reflects a focus on form and cohesion, with nine Irish players in the starting fifteen. The lineup means that eleven players will have started all three Test matches, underscoring the coach's consistent team-building strategy.</p>

          <p>Shares in South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean surged over 16% after the United States and South Korea announced a new trade deal setting a 15% tariff on Korean exports. The company is expected to benefit by expanding its Philly Shipyard in the U.S., contributing to American shipbuilding efforts. This market optimism is also fueled by Hanwha's strong second-quarter operating profits, which reversed a loss from the previous year, and several new strategic initiatives. The company's vice chairman was reportedly part of the delegation that lobbied for the trade deal in Washington. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Arsenal's 15-year-old academy player, Max Dowman, has been a standout performer during the club's pre-season tour in Asia, earning praise from manager Mikel Arteta. The attacking midfielder, who has already trained with the senior team, showed significant skill in friendlies against AC Milan and Newcastle. His performance against Newcastle was particularly notable, as he won a late penalty to secure a 3-2 victory for his team. Dowman's mature displays have led to speculation that he could make his Premier League debut this season.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made a minor move ahead of the MLB trade deadline, participating in a three-team deal with the Cincinnati Reds and Tampa Bay Rays. The Dodgers acquired pitching prospect Adam Serwinowski, reliever Paul Gervase, and catcher Ben Rortvedt, while sending minor league catcher Hunter Feduccia to the Rays. While Serwinowski is considered an intriguing prospect, the trade was not the major splash many fans anticipated. The team is reportedly still actively looking to make more significant upgrades, particularly to their bullpen and outfield, before the deadline passes.</p>

          <p>Artist Loribelle Spirovski has won the People's Choice Award at Australia's prestigious Archibald Prize for her portrait of musician William Barton. Spirovski created the work by painting with her fingers, as a nerve injury in her hand made using a brush difficult and painful. She described the experience of painting without a brush as a "beautiful reprieve and reward" during a difficult recovery period. The award, which is voted on by the public, celebrates a unique work born from personal adversity and artistic adaptation.</p>

While FBI staff have been present in the country since 2017, this establishes a formal, permanent presence.
