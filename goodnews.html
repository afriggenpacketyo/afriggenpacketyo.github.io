          <p>Nintendo shares have surged 46% this year, adding approximately $39 billion to the company's stock value, driven by the successful launch of the Switch 2 console. The Switch 2, the successor to the original Switch, was unveiled in January and released this month, leading to shortages and special opening hours in some markets. Nintendo reported selling 3.5 million units of the Switch 2 in the first four days after its launch and forecasts sales of 15 million units in its fiscal year ending March 2026. Investors hope the Switch 2 will replicate the success of its predecessor, and Nintendo's strategy of leveraging strong franchises like Super Mario, Zelda, and Pokemon has significantly boosted its market capitalization since the original Switch's release in 2017.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to reduce the impact of tariffs imposed by the U.S. government. Tariff engineering involves altering a product's materials, dimensions, or composition to fit into a different harmonized system code with lower duty rates. While most new tariffs are broad-based, exemptions exist, allowing companies to benefit from strategic design choices. For example, manufacturers bundled steel and aluminum into products to qualify for lower duties, but later removed them when tariffs on those materials increased. Experts say that tariff engineering is a legitimate strategy to reduce duty liability, as there are over 5,000 product classification codes used by U.S. customs authorities.</p>

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung met to enhance bilateral relations. The G7 launched an action plan to reduce critical mineral supply chain risks, particularly from China. Ishiba noted the impact of U.S. tariffs on Japanese firms, while China criticized the G7's market-distorting practices allegations. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian security official Sergey Shoigu discussed matters agreed upon with President Putin. Japan's May trade deficit reached 637.6 billion yen due to weak U.S. exports, potentially influenced by U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>China has successfully completed the first test flight of its next-generation Mengzhou crewed spacecraft, a crucial step for its lunar ambitions in 2030. The spacecraft, designed for both near-Earth and deep-space missions, underwent a zero-altitude escape trial at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre. During the test, the spacecraft's escape engines ignited, and the return capsule reached its designated altitude before separating and landing safely using parachutes and an airbag cushioning system. This test ensures crew safety in the event of a rocket failure during launch, and marks China's first test of this kind since 1998.</p>

Roberts was ejected after arguing the umpire's decision to issue warnings to both dugouts following Shohei Ohtani being hit by a pitch, which Roberts believed was intentional. Andy Pages had a standout performance with four hits, including two home runs, and Max Muncy responded to Padres manager Mike Shildt's comments from the previous game. There were more controversies with the umpires arising in the seventh inning, but the Dodgers ultimately held on for the win.</p>

Under the new rules, Lifeblood will no longer ask men if they have had sex with men in the previous three months, instead asking all donors if they have had anal sex with new or multiple partners.
