        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is capitalizing on a market pullback to increase its investment in GE Vernova (GEV). The trust purchased 35 shares of GEV, bringing its total holdings to 80 shares, representing 1.0% of the portfolio. The move follows a recent downgrade of the U.S. credit rating by Moody's, which triggered a market decline. GEV is positioned to benefit from increased investment in power and grid infrastructure, driven by data center expansion, manufacturing activity, and electric vehicle adoption. The company is also poised to gain from trade deals, including a $14 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia for gas turbines and energy solutions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is betting that the public is ready to move on from the divisive Brexit debates with a new UK-EU deal focused on pragmatic improvements. The agreement aims to smooth relations on issues like fishing rights and trade, but avoids reopening major questions like single market membership. Conservatives have criticized the deal as a 'surrender,' while the Liberal Democrats call for greater ambition. The deal's success hinges on whether the opposition parties choose to campaign heavily on Brexit or if the public embraces a less confrontational relationship with the EU.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have unearthed a 506-million-year-old fossil of a 'moth-like' predator named Mosura fentoni in British Columbia, Canada. This extinct arthropod possessed three eyes, spiny claws, a circular mouth with teeth, and swimming flaps. What sets this discovery apart is Mosura's abdomen-like body region with multiple segments, a feature previously unseen in radiodonts. This segmented structure, lined with gills, showcases an evolutionary convergence with modern creatures like horseshoe crabs and insects. The species, nicknamed the 'sea-moth,' offers unprecedented insights into the internal anatomy of ancient arthropods.</p>

          <p>President Trump's relationship with Qatar has undergone a significant transformation, shifting from condemnation to close alignment. Despite previously criticizing Qatar as a funder of terrorism, Trump now praises the emirate and has accepted a donation of a $400 million luxury jet. This change in stance is attributed to Qatar's role as a global mediator, particularly in negotiations between Israel and Hamas. Qatar's strategic importance as a supplier of liquified natural gas and its military alliance with the US also contribute to the strengthened relationship.</p>
