          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Nio experienced a significant surge in its Hong Kong-listed shares, extending gains for a seventh consecutive session. This rally follows the recent unveiling of its new ES8 SUV, priced at 308,800 yuan ($43,000) under a battery subscription plan, making it one of the company's most affordable models. This strategic shift aims to broaden Nio's customer base amidst mounting pressure and intense competition within China's electric vehicle sector, where the company traditionally targeted the high-end market. The introduction of more accessible models, including its new brands Onvo and Firefly, is crucial for Nio's growth, with ES8 deliveries set to begin in late September. (not investment advice)</p>
