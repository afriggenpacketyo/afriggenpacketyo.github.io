          <p>Gisele Pelicot, who became a symbol for women's rights in France, has been awarded the nation's highest civilian honor, the Legion of Honor. She gained international recognition for her public testimony against her ex-husband and 50 other men who sexually assaulted her over a decade. Her bravery during the landmark trial sparked a national debate on sexual violence and contributed to legal reforms, including a new bill that incorporates the lack of consent into the criminal definition of sexual assault in France.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. The growth, which surpassed analyst expectations, was primarily driven by a strong 5.5% expansion in the manufacturing sector. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry expressed caution, highlighting significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy for the latter half of the year, particularly concerning U.S. tariff policies.

          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has indicated a willingness to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK job market continues to slow. He stated a firm belief that the path for rates is downward, citing signs that businesses are adjusting employment and offering smaller pay rises. This follows two previous rate cuts this year, with the current rate at 4.25%, and comes as the UK economy shows signs of contraction, adding pressure on the government to stimulate growth.

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels selected UC Santa Barbara pitcher Tyler Bremner with the second overall pick in the MLB draft, prioritizing immediate pitching needs. Bremner, a right-hander with a strong fastball and changeup, has had an emotional year following the death of his mother in June, an event he says fueled his on-field performance. The Angels hope Bremner can quickly contribute to their major league roster, reflecting their strategy of fast-tracking top college talent to the majors to compete immediately.</p>
