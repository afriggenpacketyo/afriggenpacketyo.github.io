          <p>Max Verstappen has acknowledged that "frustration" led to his collision with George Russell during the Spanish Grand Prix, admitting that the move "was not right and shouldn't have happened." The incident resulted in a 10-second penalty for Verstappen, dropping him from fifth to tenth place in the race. Russell had criticized Verstappen's driving, suggesting he deliberately drove into the Mercedes car. Verstappen initially dismissed Russell's comments but later apologized for his actions, which also resulted in three penalty points on his license, bringing him close to a race ban.</p>

          <p>Vogue magazine has declared the word "chic" to be overused and lacking its original essence, prompting a discussion about rehabilitating alternative adjectives. The article suggests bringing back words like "snazzy," "trendy," and "swish" to add more linguistic variety. The author humorously reflects on their own frequent use of "chic" and proposes that influencers could adopt terms like "jazzy" to describe luxury items. Despite the call for change, the author acknowledges that "chic" is deeply ingrained and likely to persist in common usage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California is on the verge of implementing a statewide mandate for phonics-based reading instruction in schools, aiming to address persistently low test scores. The proposed law would require districts to adopt instructional materials aligned with the "science of reading," emphasizing phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. This shift marks a significant departure from the "whole language" approach, which has been prevalent in California for decades. Early results from districts that have already adopted phonics-based curricula show promising improvements in reading test scores, although the transition has faced resistance from some teachers and advocates for English-language learners.</p>
