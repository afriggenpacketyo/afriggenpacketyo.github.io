          <p>A security guard fatally shot a gunman who attempted to attack a church in Wayne, Michigan, preventing further casualties. The incident occurred at the CrossPointe Community Church during Sunday morning services, with the suspect driving his truck into the building and opening fire. One victim was shot in the leg, but the security guard's quick action neutralized the threat, and law enforcement sources have confirmed that no explosives were involved. The FBI is assisting in the investigation, which comes amid a heightened threat environment following recent U.S. military action in Iran, although it is not immediately known if the two events are connected.</p>

She explains that her husband was recently laid off and is excited about this new "business opportunity," but she is concerned about being a full-time working mother with an absentee partner and no nearby family support. Most commenters on the forum reassured her that her feelings are not unreasonable, suggesting her husband's timing may not be ideal.

          <p>The U.S. Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, has urged China to intervene and prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical global oil trade route. This appeal comes after Iran's foreign minister warned of potential actions to defend its sovereignty following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Rubio emphasized China's dependence on the Strait for its oil imports, highlighting the potential economic consequences of any disruption. While analysts view the risk of Iran closing the Strait as low due to potential U.S. intervention, concerns remain about the impact on global energy markets.</p>

Full battle damage assessment will reveal the complete picture - only then can the mission's success be measured in full, mindful that Iran had shifted at least some of its enriched uranium in the days before the strike. A consistent line was that the US wanted Iran to negotiate peace, coupled with the threat of further aggression if it doesn't. The Americans want this attack to have been a "one-and-done".</p>

          <p>In the hours after its military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, U.S. officials suggested Iran ought to embrace a diplomatic off-ramp rather than choosing to retaliate. Vance suggested the U.S. was not interested in a broader war or a conflict beyond its strikes on the Iranian nuclear program. At a Pentagon news conference, Hegseth said the nuclear program was ‚Äúthe line the president set‚Äù and that the ‚Äúoverwhelming‚Äù military action should invite peace. The defense secretary did not clarify any potential parameters for negotiations but said the U.S. was sending messages directly to Iran and ‚Äúgiving them every opportunity to come to the table.‚Äù</p>

Sources say he arrived at the White House for his previously scheduled lunch with Trump armed with specific talking points: Israeli intelligence can‚Äôt be trusted, he planned to say, and the bunker-buster bomb might not work as planned.
