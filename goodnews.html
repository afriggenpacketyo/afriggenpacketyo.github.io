          <p>The US Air Force is developing the F-47 sixth-generation fighter jet alongside collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) drones as part of the next-generation air dominance (NGAD) program, with full-scale models showcased at the Paris Air Show. Anduril Industries' YFQ-44 Fury drone is likely to be deployed in Indo-Pacific flashpoints, including the Taiwan Strait, according to a company official. Another full-scale model, General Atomics' YFQ-42A drone, is also part of the NGAD's Increment 1 package, indicating a significant investment in unmanned platforms for future air dominance.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>States are increasingly offering tax incentives to attract data centers, leading to a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue, benefiting tech giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google. A CNBC analysis found that 42 states provide full or partial sales tax exemptions to data centers, with 37 states granting nearly $6 billion in exemptions over the past five years. Watchdog groups argue that these incentives are questionable because data centers don't create many jobs, and they require immense amounts of electricity. While some states claim the exemptions drive economic growth, others acknowledge that the lost revenue does not pay for itself.</p>

          <p>Tokyo police and prosecutors have apologized to two men for their wrongful arrest and indictment in 2020 related to the unauthorized export of sensitive equipment. The apology follows a Tokyo High Court ruling ordering compensation for Masaaki Okawara and Junji Shimada, who were arrested on suspicion of exporting spray dryers that could be used in biological weapons production. The investigation was deemed illegal, and the metropolitan government and state were ordered to pay approximately 166 million yen in damages. The family of a third individual, Shizuo Aishima, who died after falling ill during detention, expressed dissatisfaction with the apology.</p>

          <p>A new PBS documentary, Caregiving, explores the challenges of family caregiving in America, highlighting the lack of resources and support for those caring for sick or elderly relatives. The film traces the history of care in the U.S., from early 20th-century almshouses to the creation of Social Security and Medicare, noting that domestic workers were excluded from early benefits. The documentary also examines the intentional decision to exclude long-term care from Medicare and the unintended consequences of Medicaid's support for nursing homes. The film calls for a new era of caregiving policy and highlights recent proposals for tax credits for family caregivers.</p>

          <p>Mar√≠a Corina Machado, a Venezuelan opposition leader, is seeking to attract international investment by highlighting the potential economic benefits of a democratic transition in Venezuela. At a presentation in Manhattan, Machado's team emphasized the "trillion-dollar opportunity" and the potential for high growth in sectors like tourism, real estate, and fossil fuels. While not directly addressing the challenge of ousting Nicol√°s Maduro's dictatorship, the message is aimed at persuading the Trump administration that supporting the opposition is not only a moral imperative but also a financially sound strategy.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article challenges the notion that Gen Z is becoming a conservative generation, arguing that the youth vote shift in the 2024 election was likely a one-off event. While young adults voted for Trump at a higher rate than in 2020, they have not become more likely to identify as conservative or hold broadly conservative political opinions. Instead, Gen Z is more liberal than previous generations on most issues, with the exception of border security. The author suggests that Gen Z's dissatisfaction with the economy and a generalized pessimism may drive their voting patterns, rather than a fundamental ideological shift.</p>
