          <p>Rolando 'Rolly' Romero defeated Ryan Garcia by unanimous decision in a boxing match held in Times Square. Garcia, who had previously defeated Devin Haney, struggled throughout the fight, with Romero landing a knockdown in the second round. Haney, in the co-main event, dominated Jos√© Ram√≠rez, marking his first win since his bout with Garcia was overturned due to a failed drug test. Te√≥fimo L√≥pez also retained his WBO junior welterweight title by defeating Arnold Barboza Jr. The event, funded by Saudi Arabia's General Entertainment Authority, marked the first major boxing card held in Times Square.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has made significant gains in the 2025 local elections across England, taking control of several councils and winning a parliamentary by-election. Both Labour and the Conservatives suffered major defeats, with the Liberal Democrats also picking up seats. Reform UK's success was particularly notable in former Conservative-controlled areas. The BBC's projected national share estimates show a decline in support for both Labour and the Conservatives, indicating a potential shift in voter allegiances. The elections also included mayoral races, with Reform winning two newly-created positions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional, calling it an attack on the American legal system. Judge Beryl Howell's ruling permanently blocks the order, which imposed punitive measures on the firm for representing clients or causes disliked by Trump. The judge framed the targeting of Perkins Coie as an attack on the independence of the legal profession. Perkins Coie welcomed the ruling, affirming core constitutional freedoms.</p>
