        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Walmart has announced a significant initiative to reformulate its private-label food products, planning to remove synthetic dyes and around 30 other ingredients, including certain preservatives and artificial sweeteners, by 2027. This change will affect approximately 1,000 items across popular store brands like Great Value, reflecting a strategic move to meet growing consumer demand for simpler and more familiar ingredients. The decision aligns with a broader industry trend toward cleaner labels and comes amid increased federal scrutiny on the potential health effects of artificial food additives, positioning Walmart to cater to more health-conscious shoppers.</p>

          <p>Amazon has launched a new private-label grocery brand named 'Amazon Grocery,' aimed at attracting shoppers with competitive pricing, as most of its products are priced under $5. The new line consolidates the company's existing Happy Belly and Amazon Fresh brands under a single label, offering over 1,000 items from fresh produce and meat to pantry staples. This move comes as Amazon continues to refine its grocery business strategy, including streamlining its physical stores while expanding same-day delivery services.

          <p>World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency company with ties to the Trump family, has announced plans to expand its product offerings, including a new debit card and the tokenization of real-world commodities like oil and gas. CEO Zach Witkoff and co-founder Donald Trump Jr. revealed the plans at a conference in Singapore, stating the debit card will launch in late 2025 or early 2026 to bridge crypto with daily spending. The firm, which launched the fifth-largest stablecoin USD1, is growing amid President Trump's broader embrace of the crypto industry, though it has faced accusations of conflicts of interest.</p>

His performance has set a new record, making him the fastest player this century to score 100 goals for a club in one of Europe's top five leagues, achieving the milestone in just 104 games. This remarkable scoring rate surpasses the early-season tallies of renowned strikers like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.

          <p>A British High Court has ordered the company PPE Medpro to repay the U.K. government more than £121 million ($163 million) for breaching a contract to supply sterile surgical gowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. The judge ruled that the gowns, which were never used by the National Health Service, were not contractually sterile and could not be used as such. The case has become symbolic of wasteful spending on hastily awarded contracts through a controversial "VIP lane" for companies with political connections. The firm is linked to Baroness Michelle Mone and her husband, who have denied wrongdoing but faced scrutiny for their involvement.</p>

          <p>A major retrospective at the Tate Britain museum is celebrating the life and work of trailblazing 20th-century photographer Lee Miller, tracing her remarkable career journey. The exhibition highlights her beginnings as a sought-after model in New York before she moved to Paris, where she became a collaborator and muse to surrealist artist Man Ray. It then follows her transition into a formidable artist in her own right, capturing surreal landscapes in Egypt. Finally, the collection showcases her powerful and empathetic work as a war correspondent for Vogue during World War II, where she documented the frontlines with a unique, artistic sensibility.</p>

          <p>A new government mandate requires every general practitioner practice in England to offer online appointment booking services throughout the workday, from 8:00 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. on weekdays. The policy is designed to eliminate the frustrating "8am scramble" where patients compete to get through on busy phone lines. In addition to booking non-urgent appointments, the online systems will allow patients to submit symptoms and request callbacks. Despite the rollout, some patients have reported difficulties accessing the new service, and the British Medical Association has raised concerns about a potential "online triage tsunami" overwhelming staff.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of current interest rates for certificates of deposit (CDs), highlighting them as a tool for savers to combat inflation. While national average yields for one-year CDs are around 1.99% APY, top online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some 6-month and 1-year CDs exceeding 4.25% APY. The piece explains the phenomenon of the inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently offer better returns than long-term ones. To secure the best rates, consumers are advised to explore online banks, consider short-term CDs, and potentially use a laddering strategy for long-term savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) represent affordable borrowing options in the current high-interest-rate environment. As of late September 2025, average interest rates for 10-year home equity loans are around 8.34%, while the average HELOC rate is approximately 7.88%. These rates are considerably lower than those for personal loans or credit cards. The article explains the differences between the two products, noting that home equity loans offer a fixed-rate lump sum, while HELOCs provide a variable-rate revolving line of credit, and advises homeowners to shop around for the best terms.

          <p>This article outlines the current landscape for mortgage and refinance interest rates, providing key data for prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing.

The report suggests that while rates are elevated compared to previous years, borrowers may see some relief if the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hikes.

          <p>President Trump's recent agreement with Pfizer may reduce the impact of his administration's threat to impose broad tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry. The deal, in which Pfizer voluntarily lowered some U.S. drug prices, includes a three-year exemption from any pharmaceutical-specific tariffs in exchange for a $70 billion investment in domestic manufacturing. This arrangement has provided clarity and relief to the industry, suggesting that other major drugmakers could negotiate similar pacts to gain immunity from the levies. The administration has indicated it will pursue these agreements before imposing tariffs, signaling a potential shift in its policy approach.</p>
