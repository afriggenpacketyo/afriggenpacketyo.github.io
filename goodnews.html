          <p>The White House asserted that Canada "caved" to pressure from President Trump by rescinding its planned digital services tax (DST). The move came after Trump threatened to terminate all trade negotiations if the tax, which would have primarily affected U.S. tech companies, was implemented. White House officials framed the reversal as a major victory for American businesses and workers. Canada stated it walked back the tax to advance broader trade talks, with both nations now aiming to secure a new trade agreement by late July, highlighting the administration's hardball negotiating tactics.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expected to lift some financial sanctions on Syria to help stabilize the country following the ousting of Bashar al-Assad's regime. The executive order will reportedly terminate a 2004 program that froze Syrian government assets but will maintain targeted sanctions against Assad, his associates, and groups involved in human rights abuses or terrorism. The move follows a meeting between President Trump and Syria's new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, who argued that the broad sanctions were hindering the transitional government's ability to function. This policy shift aims to support the new leadership while still punishing key figures from the former regime.</p>
