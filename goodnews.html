          <p>Jane Dorotik's 2001 conviction for the murder of her husband, Bob, has been overturned after she spent two decades in prison fighting for her freedom. New testing of evidence, including blood found in the couple's bedroom, revealed inconsistencies and previously untested spots. Working with the Loyola Project for the Innocent, the defense was able to prove that some of the blood spots were never tested and others were not blood at all, which caused the court to overturn the conviction. Dorotik expressed relief and determination to rebuild her life after her release, and is working with advocacy groups to help incarcerated women.</p>

          <p>Germany has seen a doubling in the number of Turkish citizens becoming German citizens in 2024, with a total of 22,525 Turkish citizens receiving German passports. This increase is attributed to several factors, including Germany's citizenship reforms allowing dual citizenship and the political and economic situation in Turkey. Many Turks seek German citizenship for practical reasons, such as easier bureaucracy and visa-free travel. Despite integration, many Turks still maintain strong ties to their culture and consider Turkey home.</p>
