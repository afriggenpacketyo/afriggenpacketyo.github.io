          <p>Pony.ai, a Chinese robotaxi company, is collaborating with Uber to introduce driverless taxis in the Middle East, marking a significant expansion into new international markets. The initial deployment will feature Pony.ai's robotaxis on Uber's platform in a key Middle Eastern market, with plans to expand further internationally. During the pilot phase, a safety operator will be present in the vehicles until full autonomous commercial service commences. This partnership is vital for Pony.ai's global strategy and enables Uber to integrate autonomous vehicles more efficiently, seeking growth in emerging markets.</p>

          <p>Wales' First Minister Eluned Morgan declared that she will challenge the UK Labour government if its decisions harm Welsh communities, emphasizing that her priority is the nation and people of Wales over party loyalty. She cited the need to rethink cuts to disability benefits and winter fuel allowance, and advocated for Wales to benefit more from wind power revenue via the Crown Estate. Morgan stressed that this approach is not a split but a form of "grown-up modern government," and will not hesitate to challenge from within, even if it means shaking things up. She also attacked Reform UK and Plaid Cymru, accusing them of focusing on slogans rather than solutions.</p>

          <p>Columbia student activist Mohsen Mahdawi, a green card holder, spoke out after being detained during a citizenship interview, stating that President Trump "will not silence me." Mahdawi, who led protests against the Israel-Hamas war, was detained under a law allowing visa revocations for individuals posing "adverse foreign policy consequences." He criticized the administration's rationale as "laughable" and emphasized his advocacy for justice and peace. Mahdawi's detention is part of a broader pattern of student activists facing similar actions, raising concerns about First Amendment rights and academic freedom.</p>

          <p>Brood XIV, a group of periodical cicadas, is set to emerge from underground after 17 years, impacting ecosystems across large portions of the eastern US. These insects will surface in billions around May and June, living only long enough to mate and lay eggs before dying. This event will provide a significant food source for various forest creatures, potentially increasing bird populations and altering hunting patterns. Eastern North America is the only place in the world where periodical cicadas exist, emerging every 13 or 17 years depending on the brood.</p>

          <p>Luxury carmaker Ferrari reported a significant increase in first-quarter profit, driven by strong demand for personalized vehicles, but cautioned that US tariffs on EU cars could negatively affect earnings this year.

Ferrari warned that the introduction of US tariffs could reduce profitability by 50 basis points. The automaker said it would raise prices by 10% on certain models in response to the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Former Governor Andrew Cuomo, in his mayoral bid, will release a plan to address public safety concerns by removing more mentally ill people from the streets. The plan includes expanding involuntary hospitalizations and requiring screening for mandatory outpatient treatment upon discharge from public hospitals and jails. Cuomo's proposals align with those of Mayor Eric Adams and Governor Kathy Hochul, who have also pushed for changes to force more people into treatment. The plan would allocate $2.6 billion over five years to build supportive housing units and psychiatric beds, while expanding the use of Kendra's Law.</p>
