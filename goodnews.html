          <p>President Trump has announced that gold will not be subjected to tariffs, reversing a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling. The initial ruling would have applied a 39% duty on certain gold bars imported from Switzerland and other countries, which caused concern in the precious metals market. Following the president's announcement on Truth Social, gold futures experienced a significant drop. This decision alleviates fears from organizations like the Swiss Precious Metal Association, which had warned of negative impacts on the international flow of physical gold.

          <p>Ford is investing $5 billion to pivot its electric vehicle strategy towards affordability, announcing plans for a new midsize electric pickup truck starting at around $30,000. The initiative involves retooling its Louisville, Kentucky plant and focusing on a simplified vehicle platform to reduce costs and complexity. This move comes as the U.S. EV market faces headwinds, and Ford aims to compete with lower-priced Chinese models by innovating its manufacturing process. The company's CEO, Jim Farley, framed the ambitious plan as a critical bet on making profitable, accessible EVs an existential priority.</p>

          <p>A recent report from Intercontinental Exchange reveals that U.S. homeowners' tappable equity has hit a new record of $11.6 trillion, with the average owner having access to $213,000. This surge presents homeowners with several options for borrowing against their property's value. Among the most effective methods are home equity loans, which offer a lump sum at a fixed rate, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which provide a flexible credit line. For seniors, a reverse mortgage can provide funds without requiring monthly repayments, making it another viable option in the current high-equity environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to delay the reimposition of high tariffs on Chinese imports for another 90 days, pushing the deadline to mid-November. This extension was an expected outcome following recent trade negotiations in Stockholm between U.S. and Chinese officials. Without the delay, U.S. duties on Chinese goods would have reverted to peak levels of 145%. The move continues a pattern of unpredictable trade policy adjustments, providing temporary relief for businesses but maintaining long-term uncertainty in the ongoing trade dispute between the two economic powers.

The move has already boosted season ticket sales, but experts like former player Jamie Noon warn that a return to a star-studded roster may be slow. Due to the timing of the recruitment cycle and salary cap constraints, the new owners will likely focus on a long-term project rather than immediate, high-profile signings.

The first step is to contact the bank to confirm the freeze and gather information about the court order. It is essential to review the judgment for errors and determine if any funds, such as Social Security benefits, are legally exempt from seizure. Other proactive steps include negotiating directly with the debt collector for a settlement or payment plan, and in severe cases, considering professional debt relief or bankruptcy to regain financial control.</p>
