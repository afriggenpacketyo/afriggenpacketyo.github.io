          <p>IBM reported second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations for both earnings and revenue, with total revenue growing nearly 8% year-over-year. Despite the positive results, the company's shares dropped by as much as 5% in extended trading. CEO Arvind Krishna noted that geopolitical tensions and constrained U.S. federal spending have caused some clients to act cautiously. The company's generative AI business has grown to $7.5 billion, and it maintained its full-year forecast for revenue growth and free cash flow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a new AI Action Plan to ensure U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence. The strategy includes over 90 federal actions, such as expediting data center construction, supporting semiconductor manufacturing, and modernizing the electrical grid. It also aims to eliminate perceived ideological bias in AI systems by setting new rules for government contractors and withholding funds from states with what it calls burdensome regulations. The plan emphasizes exporting AI technology to allies to compete with nations like China.</p>

          <p>Alphabet reported second-quarter results that surpassed analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings, driven by strong performance in its search and cloud divisions. Despite the positive report, the company announced it will increase its capital expenditure forecast for 2025 by $10 billion to a total of $85 billion, primarily to fund its AI development and infrastructure. The company's overall revenue grew 14% year-over-year, and its YouTube and Google Cloud segments both beat revenue estimates, signaling continued growth despite rising costs.

          <p>Spain's women's national football team has reached the UEFA Euro 2025 final after securing a 1-0 victory over Germany in a tense semifinal match. The decisive goal was scored by Aitana Bonmati with just five minutes remaining in extra time. Germany had several opportunities to score throughout the game but failed to convert their chances against the reigning world champions. Spain will now face England in the final, a rematch of the 2023 World Cup Final which Spain also won.</p>

          <h2>The Word "OK" Traces Its Origins to a 19th-Century Joke and a Presidential Campaign</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 17:27:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ubiquitous word "OK" originated as a joke in the 1830s, part of a trend of humorously misspelling phrases, with "OK" standing for "oll korrect." Its popularity was cemented during President Martin Van Buren's 1840 reelection campaign, as his supporters formed "O.K. Clubs," a nod to his nickname "Old Kinderhook." The term's simplicity and versatility allowed it to spread globally, becoming one of the most widely understood words. Its journey from a Boston newspaper gag to a universal term highlights its unique linguistic success.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that his administration is considering a proposal to eliminate capital gains taxes on the sale of primary residences. Currently, profits from home sales are taxed after exceeding a threshold of $250,000 for single filers or $500,000 for married couples. The idea, recently introduced in a House bill, is intended to boost the housing market and help homeowners, particularly seniors, access their equity without a tax penalty. However, experts note the proposal could be costly and its congressional support remains uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republican Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski have joined Democrats in supporting a bill to shield U.S. small businesses from President Trump's tariffs on Canadian goods. The legislation, named the CANADA Act, would exempt small business concerns from the duties as Trump threatens a blanket 35% tariff on Canadian imports. Proponents argue the tariffs harm small businesses, drive up costs, and damage the long-standing economic relationship between the two countries. The bill sends a message to the administration to alleviate the economic pressure on businesses that rely on cross-border trade. (not investment advice)</p>

Abrego Garcia, who was charged with human smuggling, was previously deported in what the administration called an "administrative error," despite a court order protecting him.

          <p>The 1979 disappearance of 6-year-old Etan Patz in New York City was a pivotal moment that fundamentally changed how the U.S. responds to missing children cases. The case led to the end of mandatory waiting periods for filing missing person reports and spurred the creation of national coordination systems and registries. It also marked a cultural shift, popularizing the concept of "stranger danger" and leading to the famous missing children milk carton campaigns of the 1980s. The case is back in the news as the man convicted of Patz's murder was granted a new trial.</p>

Meta is now automatically placing teen accounts into its strictest settings to filter offensive content and limit contact from unknown users.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes whether a 6-month certificate of deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account would generate more interest on a $10,000 deposit in the current economic climate. While a high-yield savings account offers flexibility, its variable interest rate is likely to decrease if the Fed cuts rates later in the year. A 6-month CD, however, provides a guaranteed fixed rate, which, based on current offerings, would likely earn slightly more interest over the term. The analysis concludes that for savers who can afford to lock away their funds, a CD offers a more predictable and potentially higher return. (not investment advice)</p>

He called the practice of flipping an iPad around for a tip a "manipulation" and a "guilt trip," not a genuine service exchange that warrants one. Ramsey and his co-host distinguished between tipping sit-down restaurant servers, which they support generously, and counter service or pickup orders, where they believe a tip is not required. Ramsey argued that these guilt-based tactics are "nickel-and-diming" consumers to death.</p>
