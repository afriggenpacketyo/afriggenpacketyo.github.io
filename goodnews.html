          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's plan to expand fast-track deportations, known as expedited removal, across the entire United States. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the expansion, which would apply to migrants anywhere in the country who cannot prove they have been present for over two years, likely violates due process rights. Previously, this policy was limited to migrants apprehended within 100 miles of a border and present for less than two weeks. The ruling is a significant setback for the administration's immigration enforcement strategy, though it is expected to be appealed.</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic has advanced to the fourth round of the US Open after defeating Britain's Cameron Norrie, the last remaining British singles player in the tournament. Despite struggling with a lower back injury that required two medical time-outs, the 24-time Grand Slam champion secured a 6-4 6-7 (3-7) 6-2 6-3 victory. This marks Norrie's seventh consecutive loss to Djokovic. The Serbian champion is competing in his first tournament since Wimbledon as he aims for a record 25th major title.</p>

          <p>Three brothers from Edinburgh, Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan MacLean, have set a new world record by rowing non-stop and unsupported across the Pacific Ocean in 140 days. Their 9,000-mile journey from Peru to Australia was fraught with challenges, including violent storms that swept one brother overboard temporarily. They beat the previous record of 162 days, completing the feat in their boat named "Rose Emily." The row has also served as a fundraiser, so far collecting over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar.</p>

          <p>A scenic 10-mile stretch of Angeles Crest Highway (Highway 2) has reopened ahead of Labor Day weekend after being closed for years due to extensive damage. The roadway, which provides access to popular hiking trails in the Angeles National Forest, was severely impacted by rock slides and pavement collapses from storms in 2022 and 2023, followed by damage from the 2024 Bridge fire. The $7.9 million repair project included new guardrails, retaining walls, and drainage systems. While the reopening is celebrated by the hiking community for improving access, it coincides with heightened fire danger warnings for the forest.</p>

          <h2>Analysts See Potential for Continued Rally in Chinese Equity Markets</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 21:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent surge in Chinese stocks to a 10-year high, some global asset managers are optimistic about the potential for a continued rally. This positive outlook is fueled by the return of overseas investors and the rotation of domestic savings, totaling around US$22 trillion, from low-yield fixed-income products into equities. Investment directors suggest that China's focus on "undervalued innovation" in sectors like advanced manufacturing, AI, and robotics presents a significant opportunity. After a long period of underperformance, both mainland A-shares and Hong Kong-listed H-shares are seen as having substantial room for growth compared to other global markets.

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 people from Venezuela currently living and working in the U.S. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel unanimously affirmed a lower court's ruling, stating that the administration likely overstepped its authority by trying to end the protections. The judges emphasized that Congress designed the TPS program to be insulated from electoral politics, providing stability for recipients. The Department of Homeland Security condemned the ruling, vowing to use every legal option to end what it calls an "abused" program.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B has been testifying in a Los Angeles civil trial where she is accused of assaulting a security guard, Emani Ellis, in 2018. The rapper denies claims that she cut and spat on Ellis, insisting their altercation outside a doctor's office was only verbal after she felt her privacy was invaded while pregnant. Her animated testimony and candid responses during cross-examination have gone viral on social media, with moments of courtroom humor and confusion over her wigs and fingernails capturing public attention. The trial is expected to conclude next week.</p>

          <p>A charity program in the UK is helping teenagers with anxiety and poor school attendance by pairing them as mentors for toddlers at local nurseries. The initiative, run by the charity Power2, aims to build confidence, communication skills, and a sense of responsibility in the older students. Participants like 13-year-old Siena have seen their school attendance more than double after engaging with the program. Research from the charity suggests that giving disengaged teens responsibility for a younger child has a positive impact on their own engagement with education, with 78% of participants showing an improved attitude toward learning.</p>

After a slow start, his father's social media post about the stand caused it to become a local hit, with people lining up for a kind word. Ethan's simple act of kindness has been a heartwarming reminder of the power of positive reinforcement.</p>

          <p>Following the engagement announcement of pop superstar Taylor Swift and NFL player Travis Kelce, experts are speculating on what their highly anticipated wedding might entail. Planners suggest the event will be a major cultural moment, likely held at a private, meaningful location rather than a typical venue, with extreme measures taken to ensure confidentiality. Given Swift's history of being deeply involved in her creative projects, she is expected to take a hands-on approach to the planning. Fashion experts predict her gown will be romantic and refined, possibly from an international design house, reflecting her established red-carpet style.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: How Traditional Coffee Chains Are Losing Ground to Newer, Trend-Focused Brands</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major coffee chains like Costa Coffee are reportedly struggling to keep up with changing consumer tastes, particularly among younger generations who are drawn to trendier alternatives like matcha. Newer chains such as Blank Street Coffee have gained a cult following through social media appeal and a diverse menu featuring colorful, non-traditional drinks. Analysts suggest that the rise of home coffee machines and a desire for unique, "treat" experiences have put pressure on mid-market brands. This market shift, combined with cost-of-living pressures, has led to reports that Costa's owner, Coca-Cola, is exploring a potential sale of the chain.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry is scheduled to return to the UK in early September, prompting speculation about a possible reconciliation meeting with his father, King Charles III. While the King will be at his Balmoral Estate in Scotland, his regular travel south for cancer treatment could create an opportunity to see his son. Recent signs, including a reported meeting between their respective communications teams, suggest a potential easing of tensions. However, trust remains a significant hurdle after years of public family disputes, and neither Buckingham Palace nor the Sussexes' team has officially commented on the possibility of a meeting.</p>
