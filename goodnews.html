          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) has announced that a recent cyberattack resulted in the theft of personal customer data, including names, addresses, telephone numbers, and order histories. The retailer emphasized that payment and card details, as well as account passwords, were not compromised. M&S is working to restore normal services and has advised customers to reset their passwords as a precaution. The cyberattack, linked to the DragonForce cybercrime service, also targeted Co-op and Harrods, employing a double extortion method where data is both stolen and scrambled.

          <p>A fossil discovered in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, has been identified as a new genus and species of pterosaur, named Nipponopterus mifunensis. This is the first pterosaur to be formally classified as a distinct species based on a Japanese fossil. The cervical vertebra, dating back to the Late Cretaceous Period, provides valuable insights into the evolutionary process of pterosaurs. Researchers from the Mifune Dinosaur Museum, Kumamoto University, and Hokkaido University collaborated on the study, which was published in an international scientific journal in March.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard is experiencing a surge in recruitment, allowing it to maximize its operational capabilities after facing challenges under the Biden administration. According to a DHS memo, the Coast Guard has recruited over 4,700 new members in FY 2025, exceeding last year's numbers. This increase in personnel has enabled the Coast Guard to deploy more assets to secure maritime borders, leading to significant seizures of illicit drugs and arrests of individuals involved in human smuggling. The agency has interdicted 148,000 pounds of cocaine and marijuana, valued at over $1.5 billion, and taken 870 illegal aliens into custody since January 20.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is selling 80 shares of Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) due to a slight overbought condition in the S&P and to fund a new position in GE Vernova. The stock has performed well recently, driven by strong comparable store sales and easing U.S.-China trade tensions. Despite lowering the price target to $195 due to margin pressures from rising beef prices, the trust is capitalizing on the stock's strength to lighten the position.

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.3% in April on an annual basis, slightly below economists' expectations. On a month-over-month basis, the CPI rose 0.2%. Housing costs were a major driver of inflation, with energy costs also increasing due to natural gas and electricity. Economists are closely monitoring the impact of President Trump's tariffs on consumer prices, though the April data is unlikely to reflect their full effect due to exemptions and front-loading of purchases. The Federal Reserve is adopting a wait-and-see approach regarding the tariffs' potential impact on inflation and economic growth.</p>

          <p>Peter Sullivan, a British man, had his 1986 murder conviction overturned by the UK Court of Appeal after serving 38 years in prison. New DNA evidence surfaced, indicating that the semen samples found on the victim's body did not match Sullivan's DNA. Sullivan was convicted in 1987 based on a retracted confession and discredited bite mark evidence. The Criminal Cases Review Commission referred the case back to the appeal court after the new DNA testing. Sullivan is believed to be the longest-serving victim of a miscarriage of justice involving a living prisoner in British legal history.</p>

          <p>Consumer prices increased by 2.3% in April compared to the previous year, slightly cooling from March and defying concerns about an inflation surge following President Trump's tariffs. The rate is the lowest since 2021. The data revealed a drop in egg and gasoline prices, providing some relief to consumers. Despite initial fears, the government data did not show sharp price increases, although some analysts anticipate a rise in the coming months as retailers replenish inventory. Trump has since rolled back some tariffs, including those on China, which is expected to reduce the average cost of tariffs per household.</p>

          <p>Inflation eased in April, with consumer prices up 2.3% from a year ago, marking the smallest annual increase since February 2021. Despite this, uncertainty remains about the outlook, as higher tariffs may become more visible in future months. An early sign of this was furniture costs, which rose 1.5% in April. Inflation was kept in check by a decline in both gasoline and grocery prices, with egg prices plunging 12.7%. However, analysts warn that the trade war ramped up at the beginning of April may have a limited effect on retail prices so far, but higher tariffs may become more visible in future months.</p>
