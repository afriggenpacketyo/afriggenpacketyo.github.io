          <p>Saudi boxing official Turki Alalshikh has hinted that former heavyweight champion Tyson Fury will return to the ring in 2026 for a fight in Riyadh, a claim Fury himself echoed on social media. However, Fury has also expressed a strong desire for a revenge match against Oleksandr Usyk to take place in England, stating he does not believe he received a fair outcome in their previous two bouts. A potential high-stakes fight against fellow British boxer Anthony Joshua is also being considered if Fury decides to officially come out of retirement.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has blocked President Trump's policy that bans migrants from seeking asylum if they cross the southern border illegally. In his ruling, Judge Randolph Moss stated that the president overstepped his authority by attempting to bypass existing immigration laws passed by Congress. The judge acknowledged the challenges at the border but affirmed that the executive branch cannot unilaterally create an alternative system for removing individuals without an opportunity to apply for asylum. The ruling is stayed for 14 days to allow for a government appeal.</p>

          <p>The Dalai Lama has confirmed that the centuries-old Tibetan Buddhist tradition of his reincarnation will continue after his death, ending years of speculation that he might be the last to hold the title. Speaking ahead of his 90th birthday, the spiritual leader stated that his successor should be found according to past traditions, a clear signal that China should not interfere in the process. The decision is highly consequential for Tibetans and is expected to anger Beijing, which insists it has the sole authority to approve the next religious leader.</p>

The book argues that Apple made a "calamitous mistake" by consolidating its supply chain within an authoritarian state. However, some experts counter that this deep integration was not a mistake but a necessity, arguing that Apple could not have become the company it is today without tapping into the massive wave of innovation and production that was occurring in China.</p>
