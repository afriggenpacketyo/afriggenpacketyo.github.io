The company now projects annual revenue expansion between 7% and 9%, up from a previous forecast of 3% to 4%. Dell attributes this optimistic revision to strong customer demand for its products, particularly in the rapidly expanding field of artificial intelligence, which is driving growth in compute, storage, and networking solutions.

          <p>The price of gold futures reached a historic milestone, hitting $4,000 per ounce for the first time ever as investors flock to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset. This significant rally, which represents a more than 50% increase in price this year, is attributed to global economic volatility and shifting trade policies. The surge is also reportedly fueled by strong purchasing from both central banks and individual retail investors seeking stability amid market uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The World Trade Organization has revised its forecast for global trade growth in 2025 upward to 2.4%, citing strong demand for AI-related goods and robust expansion in emerging markets. However, the organization significantly downgraded its outlook for 2026, predicting growth will slow to just 0.5% as the global economy cools and the full impact of higher trade tariffs is felt. The report highlighted that AI-related spending was a major driver of trade expansion, with Asia accounting for nearly two-thirds of this growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret, and John M. Martinis for their groundbreaking experiments in quantum mechanics. Their work in the 1980s on electrical circuits demonstrated macroscopic quantum phenomena, such as tunneling, which has become a fundamental principle for modern quantum technologies. This research has laid the essential groundwork for the development of superconducting qubits, a primary hardware technology used in the construction of powerful quantum computers.</p>

          <p>Shares of Canadian minerals explorer Trilogy Metals skyrocketed over 250% after the White House announced it was taking a 10% stake in the company through a $35.6 million investment. This partnership is part of a U.S. initiative to secure domestic supply chains for critical minerals like copper, cobalt, and zinc, located in Alaska's Ambler mining district. The move reverses a previous administration's decision to block the Ambler Road project, signaling a renewed federal commitment to domestic resource development despite environmental opposition.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in history, renewable energy sources generated more electricity globally than coal during the first six months of 2025, according to a report from the energy think tank Ember. This historic shift was primarily driven by the rapid expansion of solar and wind power, which are now growing fast enough to meet the world's increasing demand for electricity. While major economies like China and India saw renewables displace fossil fuels, the U.S. and EU experienced a temporary increase in fossil fuel use due to demand outpacing renewable growth and unfavorable weather conditions.</p>

          <p>A 37-year-old mother, Michaela Del Barrio, was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer after advocating for early screening due to her family history of the disease. Despite having no symptoms, a breast MRI ordered by a high-risk clinic revealed two suspicious masses, leading to a diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma. Her story highlights the importance of self-advocacy and understanding personal risk factors, as oncologists note that early detection significantly improves survival rates for this common form of breast cancer.</p>
