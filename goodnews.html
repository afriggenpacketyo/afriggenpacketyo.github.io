          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, cautioned that consumers may start seeing higher prices later this month due to tariffs, despite the company's better-than-expected quarterly earnings. Rainey noted that even with reduced duties on imports from China, tariffs remain "too high" for retailers to absorb, impacting consumer costs. Walmart reported its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business, driven by online advertising and its third-party marketplace. The company expects net sales to increase, but declined to provide EPS guidance due to fluctuating tariff policy.</p>

          <p>Dick's Sporting Goods is set to acquire Foot Locker for $2.4 billion, combining the largest sports retail chain in the U.S. with Foot Locker's extensive global presence.

The acquisition aims to broaden customer reach and elevate the omnichannel experience, though investors have expressed concerns about Foot Locker's declining sales and store closures. The deal is expected to close in the second half of the year, pending shareholder and regulatory approval.</p>

          <p>The full retirement age for Social Security benefits is increasing, meaning Americans born in 1960 will need to work until age 67 to receive their full benefits. This change, stemming from 1983 amendments to the Social Security Act, adjusts for longer life expectancies. While workers can still retire early at 62, they will face a reduction in their monthly benefit. Working past the full retirement age increases monthly payments. This increase to age 67 is the last scheduled increase under the 1983 amendments, though further changes could be made in the future.</p>
