          <h2>Chinese Exporters Use Letters of Credit to Navigate Trade War</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 02:00:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the United States' imposition of tariffs on imports from China, Beijing has been encouraging Chinese exporters to focus on the domestic market using letters of credit (L/Cs). Domestic L/Cs function similarly to international ones, ensuring payment security and enhancing credit for Chinese firms, with payment periods generally set at one year. Unlike international L/Cs, domestic L/Cs can also be used for trade in services, providing flexibility for businesses adapting to the trade war. This strategy reflects China's efforts to mitigate the impact of tariffs by boosting internal demand and supporting its export-oriented industries. The situation is a pragmatic response to economic pressures. </p>

          <p>"Mononoke the Movie: The Ashes of Rage" has been selected for screening at the Shanghai International Film Festival and the Fantasia International Film Festival, marking its debut in China. The Fantasia International Film Festival in Montreal is particularly noteworthy as the first chapter of the series previously won two awards there. Director Kenji Nakamura noted the film incorporates colors with a global audience in mind, increasing color saturation to appeal to non-Asian viewers. The movie is about the Medicine Seller who shows up in the Inner Chambers following a battle with the Mononoke Karakasa, and tries to fix things, diving into the darkness to uncover the three aspects [Form, Truth, and Reason]. The film's selection for international festivals indicates its broad appeal. </p>

          <p>India is planning to develop its domestic rare earth supplies to counter China's restrictions on rare earth exports, which have caused shortages affecting auto manufacturers globally. Indian officials are assessing how India Rare Earths, a government-owned company, can increase rare earth magnet production, with Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal calling China's export pause a "wake-up call." Experts suggest India could become an important alternative to China for partners like the U.S., but significant public and private investment is needed. China currently dominates rare earth production and processing, giving it leverage over minerals crucial for modern technologies. The initiative could reduce global reliance on China. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to John Reade, a market strategist with the World Gold Council, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and stablecoins do not pose a threat to gold's role as a safe-haven investment. He argues that cryptocurrencies tend to move in tandem with equities, unlike gold, which typically acts as a hedge during market volatility. Reade emphasizes that digital assets do not represent any risks or comparison to gold, dismissing the notion of them being "gold 2.0." His comments come amid growing market interest in stablecoins and other digital currencies, alongside a fresh rally in gold prices due to Middle East tensions. The analyst's comments highlight the stability of gold in uncertain times. </p>

Meta's investment and Wang's hiring align with CEO Mark Zuckerberg's plans to bolster the company's AI efforts amid competition from OpenAI and Google-parent Alphabet.
