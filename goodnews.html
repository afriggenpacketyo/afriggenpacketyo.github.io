        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Automotive research firm Edmunds suggests that this Labor Day presents a significant opportunity for consumers to find deals on electric vehicle leases. This is primarily due to a $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs and a $4,000 credit for used EVs, both of which are set to expire on September 30. Leasing has become the dominant method for acquiring EVs, accounting for 70% of transactions in July, as it allows consumers to avoid long-term commitment to rapidly evolving technology. The IRS has also clarified that a contract signed before the deadline makes a buyer eligible, even if delivery occurs later. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the dominant performance, the Italian player expressed a desire to improve his first-serve percentage, which was at 51% during the match.

          <p>Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), in collaboration with Metro Transit Police, successfully disrupted a potential school shooting plot in Washington D.C. The intervention led to the arrest of a minor on Wednesday night following an investigation into violent threats made on social media. A subsequent search warrant resulted in the discovery of seven firearms. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the juvenile posed a risk to the community and was removed due to the proactive efforts of law enforcement, which occurred the same day as a tragic school shooting in Minneapolis.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has blocked Trump administration official Kari Lake's attempt to fire Voice of America Director Michael Abramowitz, ruling the action illegal. U.S. Senior District Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth stated that by law, such a removal requires the backing of a congressionally mandated advisory panel, which is currently vacant as President Trump has not appointed new members. The ruling is part of a larger legal battle over Lake's efforts to significantly scale back the operations of Voice of America, a move the court has scrutinized. The judge rejected the administration's broad claims of executive power in this instance, upholding the legal firewall designed to protect the broadcaster from political interference.</p>

          <p>Naomi Osaka has advanced to the third round of the US Open with a confident 6-3, 6-1 victory over Hailey Baptiste. The win demonstrates her resilience following a difficult experience at a recent tournament in Montreal, where she reached her first major final since returning from maternity leave but was criticized for her runner-up speech. Osaka expressed that she felt shame after the incident but has since put it behind her, performing well in her first two matches in New York. She is now positioned for a potential deep run as she seeks to reach a Grand Slam fourth round for the first time since winning the Australian Open in 2021.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace has secured a spot in the UEFA Conference League league phase for the first time in the club's history. A goalless draw against Fredrikstad in the second leg of their play-off was enough for a 1-0 aggregate victory, marking another milestone in a successful year that also saw them win the FA Cup. Manager Oliver Glasner, who previously won the Europa League, expressed that reaching the group stage was a major achievement for the club. Despite their success, the team faces challenges with a thin squad and the potential departure of captain Marc Guehi before the transfer deadline.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has denied Saudi Arabia's motion to dismiss a long-running lawsuit filed by families of 9/11 victims, allowing the case to move forward. The lawsuit alleges that the Saudi government provided material support to some of the al Qaeda hijackers involved in the 2001 terrorist attacks. In his ruling, Judge George Daniels stated that the plaintiffs have provided reasonable evidence regarding the roles of certain individuals in assisting the hijackers, which the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia failed to sufficiently counter. The decision paves the way for a potential trial, ensuring the pursuit of what the families' lawyers call truth and justice.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China, as a major consumer of palm oil, can play a crucial role in promoting sustainable practices within Indonesia's palm oil industry. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has recently launched a campaign against illegal plantations that have led to widespread deforestation, highlighting the severe environmental cost of unchecked expansion. The author contends that global demand, particularly from markets like China, is intrinsically linked to this destruction. By leveraging its market power, China could help shift the industry towards more environmentally responsible methods, rewriting the future of a commodity that has had devastating ecological consequences.</p>

          <p>In a major NFL trade, the Dallas Cowboys have sent star edge rusher Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers following a prolonged and public contract dispute. As part of the deal, Parsons has agreed to a four-year, $188 million contract extension with the Packers, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in league history. The Cowboys will receive two first-round draft picks and veteran defensive tackle Kenny Clark in return. The trade came after Parsons grew frustrated with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who refused to negotiate with his agent, leading the two-time All-Pro to formally request a trade earlier in the month.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced an expansion of special California Highway Patrol (CHP) crime suppression teams to work with local law enforcement in major cities across the state. While touting that overall crime numbers are down, Newsom acknowledged that public perception is key and that more work is needed. The move comes amid frequent criticism of crime in California from President Trump, who has threatened to use military forces to address local crime. Newsom contrasted his collaborative approach with local leaders against what he called the president's strategy of "militarizing American cities" and doing things "to people, not with people."</p>

          <p>Amid reports that employee mentions of burnout are at their highest level since 2016, a lifestyle expert has offered practical advice for reducing stress at work. Maisha Wynn, a CBS News contributor, recommends that workers strategically manage their energy by tackling demanding tasks in the morning and saving simpler activities for later in the day. She also suggests building "micro routines," such as doodling or listening to music, to create moments of joy and relief at one's desk. A key strategy for avoiding burnout, Wynn notes, is learning to set boundaries and occasionally say "no" to preserve one's own well-being.</p>

He describes the songs as arriving unexpectedly, blooming from a process of surrender rather than intentional effort.

          <p>Mysterious, brain-like gelatinous blobs recently spotted in U.S. waterways have been identified by wildlife officials as magnificent bryozoans, which are harmless colonies of tiny aquatic invertebrates. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service explained that while they may look strange, these organisms are actually beneficial to their freshwater ecosystems. Each blob consists of thousands of individual creatures called zooids that work together to filter-feed on plankton, thereby cleaning the water. These ancient organisms have existed for hundreds of millions of years and are a natural, though seldom seen, part of many slow-moving rivers and lakes across the country.</p>
