          <p>Rod Stewart discusses his upcoming performance in the "legends" slot at Glastonbury, expressing his wish that it wasn't called the "tea time slot." Stewart reminisces about his past Glastonbury performance in 2002, which he barely remembers, and recalls a massive free concert on Copacabana Beach where he was violently ill beforehand. He also touches on his early days with the Jeff Beck Group and the Faces, his struggles with womanizing, and his current happy marriage to Penny Lancaster, and how family is now his priority. He also dismisses the rumor that he used mayonnaise in his hair, claiming he used sugared hot water before hair lacquer.</p>

          <p>A lightning strike at a South Carolina lake injured twenty people, including eight adults and twelve minors, prompting a response from multiple emergency agencies. Twelve of the patients were transported to local hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries, and all are expected to recover. The incident occurred at Dominion Beach Park at Dreher Dam, and the park is expected to reopen following safety assessments. This event follows a similar incident last week where a 15-year-old boy was struck by lightning in Manhattan but is also expected to recover.</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have discovered that stars nearing the end of their lives slow their spin, revealing insights into star formation. Analyzing data from the Gaia space telescope, researchers found that younger stars in the Milky Way spin up to 10 times faster than older stars. This increased spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, hindering the formation of massive stars. The study provides direct evidence that the galaxy‚Äôs star-forming clouds have become more turbulent over time.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer reports that AI stocks are rebounding as concerns about Chinese startup DeepSeek's competitive threat recede. The market is once again focused on the data center renaissance and the growth potential of companies like Nvidia and AMD. This rally is a refutation of the idea that China had beat the U.S. in the AI arms race. (not investment advice)</p>
