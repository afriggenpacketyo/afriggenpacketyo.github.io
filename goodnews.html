          <p>During a meeting in Scotland, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer presented a European-led peace plan for Gaza to U.S. President Donald Trump. The proposal was developed in coordination with France and Germany following the breakdown of previous U.S.-led negotiations. Details of the plan have not been released, but it aims to provide immediate humanitarian relief and establish a path toward a sustainable two-state solution. The diplomatic effort comes amid increasing international pressure and a call from over 250 UK MPs for the immediate recognition of a Palestinian state, a move the Starmer government has described as a matter of "when, not if."</p>

The conversational chatbot, developed by Paradox, interacts with job applicants, answers questions, and schedules interviews, significantly cutting down on administrative work for restaurant managers. This technology has led to a dramatic increase in applicants and an 85% application completion rate, helping the company manage its plan to open approximately 300 new restaurants annually.

          <h2>Shareholders of UK Fintech Firm Wise Approve Move of Main Stock Listing to US</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shareholders of the UK financial technology company Wise have voted to move its main stock market listing to the United States. The decision is intended to increase the company's visibility in the U.S., its largest market, and provide access to deeper capital markets. The vote was controversial because it also extended a dual-class share structure, which grants enhanced voting rights to co-founder and CEO Kristo Käärmann. Despite some opposition from co-founder Taavet Hinrikus, who argued the issues should have been voted on separately, the proposal passed with a strong majority, and the US listing is expected in 2026.

          <p>The United States is fundamentally remaking its approach to disaster relief in response to an increasing frequency of catastrophic events. An article from The Economist highlights the experience of Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, which endured four presidential disaster declarations in less than a year, including two major hurricanes. This intense series of events has exposed the limitations of the traditional, reactive model of federal aid. The piece suggests a systemic shift is underway, moving towards a more proactive and resilient framework for managing and recovering from natural disasters, driven by the immense costs and human impact of recent calamities.</p>

          <p>Orel Hershiser, the 1988 World Series MVP and current Dodgers broadcaster, is publicly seeking a specific, one-of-a-kind baseball card of himself. The Topps Chrome card, which Hershiser signed during spring training, is a unique "one-of-one" collectible that he wants for his personal collection. To acquire it, Hershiser has offered a "bounty" to whoever finds it, which includes round-trip airfare, a hotel stay, tickets to a Dodgers game, a visit to the broadcast booth, and an autographed jersey.

          <p>Tropical Storm Iona has rapidly intensified to become the first hurricane in the central Pacific Ocean this year, reaching Category 1 strength. The National Hurricane Center reported that the storm is located about 895 miles southeast of Honolulu but does not pose an immediate threat to the Hawaiian Islands. Forecasters expect Iona to strengthen into a Category 2 hurricane as it moves westward before gradually weakening later in the week. Confidence is high that the hurricane's path will remain well south of Hawaii, avoiding any direct impact on the state.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles luxury real estate market showed significant strength in June, with Paris Hilton and her husband Carter Reum purchasing a Beverly Hills mansion for $63.1 million. The property, previously owned by Mark Wahlberg, was the month's most expensive sale and demonstrates robust demand, partly driven by buyers displaced by recent wildfires and increasing interest from foreign investors. According to Redfin data, five of the top ten most expensive home sales in the U.S. for June were in California, with brokers reporting high activity and strong interest in other high-end listings in the area.

          <p>During a visit to the UK, U.S. President Donald Trump publicly acknowledged "real starvation" in Gaza, urging Israel to permit "every ounce of food" into the besieged territory. This statement directly contradicts recent claims by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that there is no starvation in the region. Trump's comments mark a significant shift in his public stance on the humanitarian crisis, indicating increased US pressure on Israel to change its approach to aid delivery. The remarks were made during meetings with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has also been pressing for urgent action to end the suffering.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Orders Trump Administration to Continue Medicaid Funding for Planned Parenthood</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 13:02:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration must continue reimbursing Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide for services funded by Medicaid. The order blocks a provision in a Trump tax bill that aimed to "defund" the organization by ending its Medicaid payments for one year. Judge Indira Talwani wrote that restricting the organization's ability to provide care would likely lead to adverse health consequences, such as an increase in unintended pregnancies and untreated STIs. Planned Parenthood had argued that losing Medicaid funds would risk the closure of nearly 200 clinics, affecting over a million patients.</p>
