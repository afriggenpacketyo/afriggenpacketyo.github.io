          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka appeared in federal court for a status conference after being arrested outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility. Baraka was taken into custody on trespassing charges while supporting members of New Jersey's congressional delegation who were touring the facility. The U.S. Attorney for New Jersey stated that Baraka ignored warnings to remove himself from the ICE detention center, but Baraka claims he was invited and stayed for over an hour. He was held in custody for four hours before being released, and the trespassing charge carries a maximum sentence of 30 days in prison.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher as the economy changes and policy is in flux, noting conditions have significantly shifted over the past five years. Despite longer-term inflation expectations remaining near the Fed's 2% target, Powell suggested the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon. He cautioned that the Fed faces a difficult balancing act between supporting employment and controlling inflation due to potential supply shocks. While not directly mentioning President Donald Trump's tariffs, Powell has acknowledged they could slow growth and boost inflation.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that the UK economy is "beginning to turn a corner" after it grew by 0.7% in the first three months of the year, exceeding forecasts. The growth was driven by increases in consumer spending and business investment, marking the period before US import tariffs and UK employer taxes increased in April. While the Labour government has prioritized boosting the economy, its decision to increase employers' National Insurance contributions has faced criticism from businesses. Analysts warn that the strong growth rate is unlikely to continue, with potential impacts from US tariffs and tax rises.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes winning acts since 2000 to determine the secrets of a perfect Eurovision song, suggesting that singing about personal liberation and empowerment is a good start. Most winners have sung in English, and it helps to allude to folk music without submitting an actual folk song. The article also advises to go all-out on the staging and set things on fire, but warns against dramatic key changes and sending a novelty act. Ultimately, the article suggests blending traditional music with an exhilarating pop chorus.</p>

          <p>Despite the recent fanfare over the United States and Britain agreeing to lower some tariffs and create a $5 billion export opportunity for American agricultural products, concerns remain among British consumers regarding American food production standards. The U.S. Secretary of Agriculture visited Britain to promote the agreement and counter the narrative that American meat is substandard. Key differences in food production, such as the use of growth hormones and chlorine-washed chicken, could hinder a more comprehensive trade agreement and limit the increase of American exports to Britain. British regulations emphasize animal welfare and environmental protections, creating resistance to changing these standards post-Brexit.</p>
