        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy expanded by 4.8% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2025, a figure that aligns closely with market expectations and significantly advances the nation toward its "around 5 percent" annual GDP growth target. This closely watched statistic, released by the National Bureau of Statistics, brings the overall economic growth for the first three quarters to 5.2%. The article emphasizes this steady performance, which occurred despite increasing external uncertainties influencing the global economic landscape, reflecting resilience in the face of challenges.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced a positive opening, with major indexes like Japan's Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rising, after China opted to keep its benchmark lending rates unchanged. The one-year loan prime rate remained at 3%, a decision consistent with market expectations. This stability in China's monetary policy, coupled with anticipation of its third-quarter GDP data, contributed to the regional market buoyancy. U.S. markets also closed higher, partly influenced by a more conciliatory tone in trade discussions with China, as this article highlights. (not investment advice)</p>

Both Paz and his conservative opponent pledged to stabilize the economy through various reforms, including addressing fuel subsidies.

          <p>Thirteen individuals were arrested during an operation in West Hollywood's Rainbow District, initially triggering widespread concerns on social media about a possible ICE raid due to the presence of unmarked vehicles. However, Los Angeles County Sheriff officials later clarified that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were not involved in the arrests. The operation was conducted by local law enforcement in direct response to multiple reports of pickpocketing, drug sales, and other criminal activities in the area. This article details how community anxieties were addressed by official clarification.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Steven Qiu, founder and chief scientist of leading Chinese LiDAR maker RoboSense, asserts that a multi-sensor system is fundamentally safer and more effective for self-driving vehicles than Elon Musk's vision-only approach. Qiu contends that vision-only systems cannot adequately account for numerous "corner cases," such as distinguishing objects in challenging lighting or weather conditions, essential for achieving Level 3 or 4 automation. Despite Musk's long-standing criticism of LiDAR as "expensive and unnecessary," its cost has significantly decreased, and other auto executives consider it "mission critical."
