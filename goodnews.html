          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed revenue expectations but fell short on earnings per share, causing its stock to decline in extended trading. The company's data center segment, which includes its AI chips, saw a 14% revenue increase, though sales to China were impacted by U.S. export controls. CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in the competitiveness of AMD's new AI chips against rivals like Nvidia and noted strong growth in the client and gaming segment. For the upcoming quarter, AMD projects sales of $8.7 billion, which is above analyst forecasts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion in FEMA funds intended for natural disaster mitigation. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued that the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The judge stated that the reallocation could cause "irreparable harm" to flood-prone areas and that he was unconvinced Congress intended for the funds to be repurposed. The administration had previously called the program "wasteful."</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy has opted to miss the FedEx St. Jude Championship, the first event of the PGA Tour playoffs, sparking concern among tour organizers. A player director on the PGA Tour Policy Board expressed he was "very concerned" by the decision. Due to the points system, top players like McIlroy and Scottie Scheffler can skip the initial event without jeopardizing their spot in the final Tour Championship. The move has prompted discussions among PGA Tour officials about potential rule changes to ensure top players participate in all playoff legs.</p>

The members, now in their 30s, discussed the importance of health and fitness, which is poignant as one member missed the event due to injury. Their return is significant as it marks their reunion after a two-year break for mandatory military service, a milestone that has historically been a challenge for K-pop groups.

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024, including violent crime and property crime. The murder rate fell for the second consecutive year, and motor vehicle thefts saw a record 18.6% one-year drop, though they remain above pre-pandemic levels. While the overall trend is positive, experts note that aggravated assaults are still high, and the report also shows a slight decrease in hate crime incidents. This data reflects a continuing downward trend in crime from the spike seen after the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has passed a new law requiring landlords in unincorporated areas to ensure their rental units do not exceed 82 degrees Fahrenheit. The measure is designed to protect vulnerable tenants from the health risks of extreme heat, which have become more frequent due to climate change. The law will take effect next month but won't be enforced until January 2027 to give landlords time to comply. Officials are encouraging the use of passive cooling methods like reflective roofing and blackout curtains over air conditioning.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles charter school has partnered with the nonprofit Trust for Public Land to replace its asphalt playground with grass and greenery, significantly improving the outdoor environment for students. The new green space has been shown to cool the playground by up to 40 degrees, as blacktops can reach dangerously high temperatures. This initiative addresses the fact that an estimated 28 million children in the U.S. lack easy access to parks. The project not only provides a safer, cooler play area but also helps mitigate pollution and supports children's emotional and developmental health.</p>

          <p>New research from Rwanda suggests that social relationships between female mountain gorillas are more significant than previously believed. A 20-year study revealed that when a female gorilla moves to a new social group, she will intentionally seek out and join other females she already knows, even if they have been apart for years. This behavior highlights the importance of these same-sex bonds, which can provide crucial social benefits and protection for new arrivals in a group's hierarchy. The findings offer new insights into the evolutionary roots of social movement and relationships.</p>

          <p>Despite significant technological advances, a notable portion of the public remains skeptical about the accuracy of weather forecasts. Meteorologists explain that challenges like "Chaos Theory," where tiny initial errors can lead to vastly different outcomes, make perfect prediction difficult, especially for small geographic areas. The communication of complex data into a simple forecast also creates perceived inaccuracies. The future of forecasting lies in AI, which can process historical data rapidly, and in providing "impact-based" forecasts that explain what the weather will mean for people's daily lives.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned two advertisements from the fashion brand Zara, ruling that they featured models who appeared "unhealthily thin" and were therefore irresponsible. The watchdog noted that styling, shadows, and poses made one model look "gaunt" and emphasized another's "protruding" collarbones. Zara, which has since removed the images, stated that both models had medical certificates confirming they were in good health. This ruling follows similar bans on ads from other major retailers like Marks & Spencer and Next.</p>

Unlike Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland where such support is standard, a study found only about one-fifth of English councils offer similar aid, creating a "postcode lottery." With uniform costs averaging over £340, many families struggle with the expense, turning to uniform banks for help. The charity argues that a consistent, national approach is needed to ensure no child is disadvantaged.</p>
