          <p>British supermarket group Sainsbury’s has ended talks with Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com regarding the sale of its general merchandise retailer, Argos. The company announced that the discussions were terminated after JD.com indicated it would only proceed on a "materially revised set of terms." Sainsbury's concluded that accepting these new terms would not be in the best interest of its shareholders. Despite the collapsed deal, the supermarket group reaffirmed its forecast to deliver an underlying operating profit of around £1 billion for the 2025-2026 financial year.</p>

          <p>Oblique Seville has been crowned the new men's 100m world champion, ushering in a new chapter for Jamaican sprinting nine years after Usain Bolt's last global title. The 24-year-old delivered a personal best time of 9.77 seconds to win gold in Tokyo, leading a Jamaican one-two finish. Seville's victory is seen as a fulfillment of long-held potential after he narrowly missed a medal two years ago and faced disappointment at the Paris Olympics. The win signals a potential shift in dominance back to Jamaica after four consecutive world titles for the United States.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley is building a significant investment portfolio with his NFL earnings. Following a strategy to live off endorsement deals, he has reportedly invested millions from his salary into various tech startups and venture capital funds, including AI firm Anthropic and Elon Musk's Neuralink. Barkley's approach shifted from traditional index funds to more high-risk, high-reward startup investing after reading Peter Thiel's book "Zero to One." He views these investments as a way to create generational wealth, conscious of the relatively short career span of an NFL running back.</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has officially launched her campaign for the Labour Party's deputy leadership, urging the party to remain united. In a speech, she warned against internal divisions, stating that they would only benefit political rivals like Nigel Farage. Phillipson paid tribute to her predecessor, Angela Rayner, and pledged to continue a strong campaigning role if elected. The contest is viewed by some as a reflection on the Prime Minister's leadership following recent high-profile resignations from his government.</p>

          <p>Actress Kathy Bates has pushed back against speculation that her 100-pound weight loss was solely due to the drug Ozempic. The 77-year-old Oscar winner stated that while the medication helped her lose the final 15 to 20 pounds, the majority of her weight loss was the result of years of hard work. Her motivation to get healthy came after a type 2 diabetes diagnosis, a condition that has seriously affected her family. Bates explained that she is still emotionally adjusting to her new body after shedding the weight she had carried for decades.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has maintained a perfect start to their Premier League title defense, thanks to a remarkable habit of scoring late winning goals, a phenomenon now being called "Arne Time." The team has won all four of its opening matches with decisive goals scored in the final minutes, including a 100th-minute winner against Newcastle. This trend of securing last-gasp victories has become a psychological weapon, creating anxiety for opponents as games enter stoppage time. While the need for late goals suggests the team is not yet at its peak, their resilience and winning mentality are proving formidable.</p>

          <p>Theme parks are pushing the boundaries of physics and design to create increasingly extreme and immersive experiences for visitors. In an effort to compete with the constant stimulation of smartphones and digital media, parks like Universal's new Epic Universe are engineering faster, taller roller coasters and meticulously detailed fantasy worlds. The goal is not just to entertain but to overwhelm the senses, from hyper-realistic re-creations of movie settings to rides that subject passengers to g-forces stronger than a space shuttle launch. This trend reflects a broader shift in how entertainment is designed to capture dwindling attention spans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While consumers are increasingly using "buy now, pay later" services like Affirm and Klarna, traditional banks and credit card companies are becoming more cautious. These services, which allow purchases to be split into interest-free installments, directly challenge the credit card industry's revenue from transaction fees and interest. Financial institutions are also concerned about the lack of visibility into this form of debt, as it is often not reported to credit bureaus. This creates what one expert called a "giant black hole" in their understanding of a consumer's overall credit risk.</p>

Also on the calendar are investor day events for cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike and industrial conglomerate DuPont, which is preparing to spin off its electronics business.
