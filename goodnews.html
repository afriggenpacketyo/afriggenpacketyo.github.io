          <p>Four prominent partners at Paul Weiss, including Karen Dunn, Bill Isaacson, Jeannie Rhee, and Jessica Phillips, have announced their departure to establish a new law firm. This follows Paul Weiss's controversial decision to strike a deal with President Trump to avoid an executive order restricting its business, a move that drew criticism from associates and other firms. Dunn, a prominent Democratic lawyer, was supportive of the deal and aided in gaining support from other partners. The partners did not address the deal in their departure email, instead expressing gratitude for their time at Paul Weiss and hoping for future collaboration. This article provides insight into the internal dynamics and fallout within a major law firm following a politically charged decision. </p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that the United States is increasingly recognizing Japan's economic importance following discussions with U.S. Cabinet members. Akazawa discussed trade, nontariff barriers, and economic security with U.S. officials and agreed on the need to conclude a trade deal as soon as possible. The talks occurred after Prime Minister Ishigeru Ishiba and President Trump spoke by phone and agreed that the discussions should be productive. Japan continues to urge the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, maintaining that an agreement must benefit both countries.</p>

          <p>President Trump has approved Nippon Steel Corp.'s plan to acquire United States Steel Corp., stating that the partnership will create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the American economy. This decision follows a review by a panel of federal agencies. Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel praised the decision, with U.S. Steel stating that it will remain in America and keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh. The acquisition plan had faced opposition from the Biden administration due to national security concerns and was a topic during last year's U.S. presidential election.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that the increasing prevalence of hummingbird feeders has influenced the size and shape of Anna's Hummingbirds' beaks in the western United States. The birds' beaks have become longer and more slender, allowing them to extract more nectar from feeders. Male hummingbirds' beaks have also grown pointier to fight off competition at the feeders. The hummingbirds have expanded their range northward due to the growing popularity of feeders. This study highlights how human influence can drive rapid evolution in species.</p>

The visit follows an election win by Mark Carney on a wave of anti-Trump sentiment. Experts expect the King's speech to affirm Canadian sovereignty, balancing solidarity with Canada without jeopardizing the UK's relationship with the US. The King's visit is seen as a symbolically important event in light of Trump's past comments about Canada.</p>
