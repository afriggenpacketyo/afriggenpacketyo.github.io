          <p>The Scottish Parliament is set to vote on a bill that would legalize assisted dying for terminally-ill adults, marking the third time such a proposal has been considered. The legislation would allow patients with a terminal illness and mental capacity, as determined by two doctors, to request medical assistance to end their lives. Supporters argue it is a progressive move to alleviate suffering, while opponents raise concerns about safeguarding vulnerable individuals. The vote is expected to be close, with MSPs casting a free vote on the bill's general principles.</p>

          <p>This week's inflation report is expected to provide an initial assessment of the impact of President Donald Trump's tariff policies on pricing in the United States. While economists initially feared a surge in inflation due to the tariffs, early data suggests a slight cooldown in price increases. However, analysts anticipate a potential resurgence of inflation as retailers restock inventory with goods imported after the tariffs took effect. Trump has since rolled back some levies, including those on China, which may mitigate the overall impact on inflation.</p>

          <p>French cinema icon G√©rard Depardieu was convicted of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in Paris in 2021, receiving an 18-month suspended sentence, according to this New York Times article. The women, a set decorator and an assistant director, accused Depardieu of groping them during filming. Depardieu denied the charges, but the court found him guilty, also ordering him to be put on a list of sex offenders. The article notes that the trial was part of a broader reckoning in France regarding the #MeToo movement and the country's treatment of its artists.</p>

          <p>Following the U.S.'s temporary reduction of tariffs on China, businesses are rushing to import goods before the lower rates expire in 90 days, causing potential congestion and freight rate increases. While the tariff cut provides short-term relief, it also creates uncertainty about future trade conditions. Companies are weighing the benefits of accelerating production and shipments against the risk of higher tariffs returning in the fall, or potential further reductions. Some businesses are also exploring alternative manufacturing locations to reduce their reliance on China.</p>
