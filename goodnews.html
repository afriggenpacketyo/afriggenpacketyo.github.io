          <p>The Trump administration has reached a preliminary trade agreement with the United Kingdom, reducing tariffs on British-made cars and eliminating duties on steel and aluminum. This deal opens the UK market to American farmers but maintains the UK's ban on chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef, addressing welfare and environmental concerns. The agreement also includes provisions for digital trade, facilitating smoother data flows and enhancing cybersecurity cooperation. While Trump touts billions in increased market access for American exports, US automakers express concerns about potential disadvantages compared to vehicles from Mexico and Canada.</p>

          <p>David H. Souter, a former Supreme Court Justice nominated by President George H.W. Bush, has died at the age of 85. Souter, a Republican appointee, surprised conservatives by becoming a key member of the court's liberal wing, often siding with liberal justices on critical issues. He retired at 69 to return to his home state of New Hampshire, and his replacement was Sonia Sotomayor. Souter's moderate stance and commitment to the Constitution's evolving interpretation marked him as a judicial figure who defied easy categorization.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to make an uncontrolled reentry into Earth's atmosphere. The spacecraft, intended for a Venus mission but failed to leave Earth's orbit, poses a small risk of impact on the surface. Experts predict it will likely land between 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south latitude, with a higher probability of landing in the ocean due to Earth's surface composition. While the risk of hitting someone is low, the spacecraft's durable construction for Venus's atmosphere raises concerns about its potential to survive reentry.</p>

          <p>Japan Rugby League One is planning to implement new rules to ensure more playing time for Japanese players starting from the 2026-27 season. The proposed change would require at least eight of the 15 players on the field to meet specific criteria, such as being Japanese-born. This initiative aims to promote domestic talent and potentially stir controversy among teams with a high number of international players. The new system divides players into categories A1 and A2, with A1 designating Japanese players and A2 including foreign players, even those who have played for the Japanese national team.</p>
