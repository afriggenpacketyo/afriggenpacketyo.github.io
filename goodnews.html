          <p>Steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs announced it is investigating the commercial viability of mining rare earths at two of its sites in Michigan and Minnesota, causing its shares to jump more than 20%. The move aligns with the U.S. government's strategy to reduce dependency on China, which currently dominates the global supply chain for these critical minerals. CEO Lourenco Goncalves stated the company aims to be part of the solution for American mineral independence, especially as rare earths are vital for defense, electric vehicles, and other high-tech applications.

          <p>The United States and Australia have signed a significant agreement to bolster the supply chain for critical minerals and rare earths, with a project pipeline valued at up to $8.5 billion. The deal aims to reduce Western dependence on China, which currently dominates the market and recently imposed strict export controls. The framework includes joint investments in mining and processing, with the Pentagon funding a gallium refinery in Western Australia. This strategic partnership is designed to ensure a stable supply of materials essential for defense, technology, and manufacturing.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police has announced it will no longer investigate non-crime hate incidents, aiming to redirect officer focus toward matters that meet the criminal threshold. The policy change was confirmed as the force dropped its probe into "Father Ted" creator Graham Linehan, who was arrested on suspicion of inciting violence in social media posts. A Met spokesperson stated the move will reduce ambiguity and prevent officers from policing "toxic culture war debates," a decision that follows public backlash and a call for clearer legal boundaries.</p>

Authorities took the suspect, a felon with known mental health challenges, into custody upon his arrival at a terminal. An AR-15 assault rifle with 27 rounds of ammunition was discovered in his truck parked outside. Atlanta's police chief credited the family's intervention and law enforcement collaboration with averting a potential tragedy.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, the pediatrician who helped expose the Flint water crisis, has launched a new program called Rx Kids to combat child poverty. The initiative provides unconditional cash payments to every expectant mother in Flint, offering $1,500 during pregnancy and $500 per month for the baby's first year. Funded primarily by private donations, the program is based on evidence that direct financial support helps families afford essentials like housing, food, and baby supplies.

          <p>With mortgage rates cooling after a period of highs, this article outlines three key mistakes for homebuyers and those looking to refinance. It cautions against waiting for even lower rates, as declines are not linear and can reverse unexpectedly.

Finally, it suggests that homeowners should not strictly adhere to the traditional "1% rule" for refinancing, as even a smaller rate reduction can yield significant savings in the current economic climate.

The article suggests these displays of "basic decency" are a necessary rebuke to the cynicism promoted by the current political leadership and offer a glimmer of hope for a revival of traditional American values.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The end of the year is a popular time for investors to execute Roth IRA conversions, a strategy that involves moving pre-tax retirement funds into a post-tax Roth account to allow for future tax-free growth. Financial experts note that waiting until the fourth quarter allows for a more accurate estimate of one's annual income, which is crucial for managing the immediate tax liability of the conversion. While some argue for earlier conversions to start tax-free growth sooner, the risk of miscalculating income and unintentionally moving into a higher tax bracket makes year-end planning a safer approach for many.
