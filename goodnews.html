          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that the country has secured funding for three Patriot air defense systems, with two from Germany and one from Norway. Ukraine is now working to find funding for an additional seven systems as part of a broader deal allowing European nations to purchase and transfer US weaponry to Kyiv. This arrangement follows a shift in US policy under President Trump, who has favored weapon sales via allies over direct aid. The article also notes ongoing discussions for a potential peace summit between Ukrainian and Russian leaders.</p>

          <p>The Lumberjack World Championships in Wisconsin are seeing a significant rise in female competitors, known as "lumberjills," who now make up nearly half of the athletes. This marks a major shift in a sport derived from the historically male-dominated logging industry. Women are competing and setting records in demanding events like the underhand chop and crosscut sawing, challenging misconceptions about the sport. Athletes describe a supportive but intensely competitive environment that is pushing the standards of women's timber sports higher, reflecting a broader growth in inclusivity.</p>

          <h2>Medical Experts Urge FDA to Remove 'Black Box' Warnings from Menopause Treatments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A panel of doctors has strongly urged the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to remove its most severe "black box" warning labels from low-dose estrogen treatments for menopause. They argue the warnings, which list risks of cancer and dementia, are not supported by current science for these specific therapies and unnecessarily scare women away from beneficial treatments for symptoms like vaginal dryness and UTIs. The debate reflects a significant shift from two decades ago when hormone therapy was widely linked to health risks. Critics, however, argue the panel's process was unconventional and lacked a full scientific evaluation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite its growing popularity, the Tour de France Femmes still faces significant disparities compared to the men's race, particularly in prize money and salaries. The female winner receives only €50,000, a fraction of the men's €500,000 prize, and top male cyclists earn millions more than their female counterparts. Race director Marion Rousse defends the progress made, noting the women's prize money is higher than in comparable men's stage races and that media viewership is increasing. While a minimum wage has been introduced, advocates and athletes agree that the fight for financial equality in professional women's cycling continues.</p>

          <p>The WNBA is experiencing a significant growth spurt, largely fueled by new talents like Caitlin Clark and league expansion, leading to record attendance projections. However, this growth has brought increased scrutiny and debate over various issues. The article explores whether the league is too dependent on Clark, noting that other stars like A'ja Wilson and newcomers like Paige Bueckers are also major factors. It also addresses criticisms of refereeing and the idea that a lack of dunking holds the league back, concluding that the WNBA's emphasis on fundamentals and team play is a strength appreciated by true basketball fans.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 03:55:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK retail sales volumes rose by 0.9% in June, rebounding from a significant drop in May, according to the Office for National Statistics. The increase was largely attributed to the month's hot weather, which boosted supermarket sales of drinks and summer clothing, as well as fuel sales as more people traveled. However, the rebound was smaller than some economists had forecast, and overall sales growth for the second quarter remained slow. This suggests that while weather provided a temporary lift, underlying consumer confidence and economic momentum may still be weak. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As England prepares to face Spain in the Euro 2025 final, this analysis identifies key tactical areas that could decide the match. England may look to exploit Spain's high defensive line with the hold-up play of Alessia Russo and the pace of its forwards, a strategy Germany used effectively in the semi-final. A crucial challenge for the Lionesses will be containing Spain's talented midfield, particularly by limiting service to pivot Patri Guijarro and closing down space for Aitana Bonmati and Alexia Putellas. The article suggests England may be more comfortable playing in transition rather than dominating possession.</p>

Washington is also pushing for the UK to scrap its digital services tax, which affects American tech companies. The meeting is seen as a chance to settle this unfinished business and solidify U.S.-UK relations ahead of a wider trade deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With an August 1 deadline approaching for a trade deal with the U.S., India appears unconcerned, according to analysts. India's leverage stems from its strategic importance to the U.S. as a counterbalance to China in the Indo-Pacific and a potential alternative for manufacturing supply chains. Furthermore, India has been actively pursuing a "multi-alignment" strategy, advancing trade agreements with other partners like the UK and the EU. This diversification provides India with a strong negotiating position, allowing it to protect sensitive sectors like agriculture while engaging with Washington. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Organizers of the Tour de France have rerouted and shortened Stage 19 of the race to avoid the Col des Saisies mountain pass. The decision was made after the discovery of contagious nodular dermatitis, a cattle disease, in a herd located along the original route, which necessitated the culling of the animals. To preserve the race's smooth running and out of respect for the affected farmers, the stage was cut from 130km to 95km. Riders will now skip the first two climbs and rejoin the planned route later in the day.</p>
