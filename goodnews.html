          <h2>Hawley Announces Inclusion of Nuclear Waste Compensation Expansion in Senate Bill</h2>

          <p>Senator Josh Hawley announced that his effort to expand the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) will be included in the Senate's version of the "One Big Beautiful Bill." The expansion would allow individuals in regions of Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alaska to be compensated for exposure to toxic waste, in addition to already-qualified "downwinders." The proposal also allows for claims to be used for increased levels of atmospheric testing and adds uranium mine workers who worked in the mines from 1971-1990 to be eligible for benefits. Hawley called the inclusion a "huge step forward" and hopes it shows that the country is standing beside those affected by nuclear exposure.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts blocked additional portions of President Trump's executive order seeking to overhaul U.S. elections, following a similar ruling by another judge in April. Judge Denise Casper's decision prevents the administration from requiring documentary proof of citizenship on the national voter registration form and barring states from counting mail ballots received after Election Day, citing that the Constitution grants states the power to set election rules, not the president. The judge also blocked provisions adding new requirements for U.S. citizens abroad to register and vote, deeming it contrary to the will of Congress.</p>

          <p>Contender, the largest male great white shark ever tagged by OCEARCH, is migrating north along the Atlantic coast, recently pinging off the coast of Cape Hatteras. The nearly 14-foot long shark was first tagged in January 2025 and has been tracked moving from Georgia to Florida and up the coasts of South and North Carolina. OCEARCH notes that the Outer Banks are a common rest stop for the species due to rich food resources. Tracking Contender's movements provides valuable data on the lives of white sharks in the Northwest Atlantic, aiding in their understanding and protection.</p>

          <p>Left-arm spinner Sophie Ecclestone has been recalled to the England squad for their five-match T20 series against India, reversing an earlier decision to take a break from domestic cricket to prioritize her wellbeing. Ecclestone, who missed England's recent series wins over West Indies due to a quad injury, replaces leg-spinner Sarah Glenn in the 14-player squad. This series will be Ecclestone's first appearance for England since January's Ashes defeat in Australia. The India series serves as England's last preparation before the 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.</p>

Mbeumo has scored 70 goals in 242 appearances for Brentford since joining the club in 2019.</p>
