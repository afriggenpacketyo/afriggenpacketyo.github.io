        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is expanding its free childcare scheme, offering 30 hours a week for working parents of children aged nine months to three years in England, starting in September. Eligibility generally requires parents to earn between £9,518 and £100,000 annually. While the initiative aims to ease childcare costs, concerns persist regarding the availability of staff and places, with estimates suggesting a need for an additional 35,000 staff and 70,000 places. This article provides essential information for parents seeking to access the funded hours, while also acknowledging the challenges in the childcare sector.</p>

          <p>The charity Greater Change is demonstrating success in tackling homelessness by providing direct cash payments to individuals at risk of losing their homes, enabling them to cover essential costs like rent deposits or energy debts. This approach, which prioritizes "dignity of choice," has helped 86% of recipients move into stable housing and nearly half find employment. Supported by international studies, the initiative challenges concerns about misuse of funds, with evidence suggesting recipients make responsible choices. This article highlights an innovative and effective strategy for early intervention in the homelessness crisis, potentially saving significant public funds in the long run.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's electric vehicle (EV) industry is rapidly dominating the global car market, driven by substantial government subsidies, tax incentives, and significant investment in development. Chinese manufacturers like BYD have surpassed Tesla in revenue, with the country becoming the world's largest vehicle exporter. This surge has led to regulatory scrutiny and tariffs from Western markets seeking to protect their own automotive brands. Experts predict China will further cement its dominance, manufacturing four out of ten cars globally by 2030, intensifying pressure on established international players and reshaping the future of the automotive industry.
