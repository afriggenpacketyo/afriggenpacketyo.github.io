          <h2>Tesla Sales Rebound in Norway Despite European Lag</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Norway surged by 213% in May compared to the previous year, contrasting with a decline in other European markets. The increase is largely attributed to strong sales of the revamped Model Y compact SUV, aligning with Norway's EV-friendly policies and incentives. Despite the sales boost, a recent survey indicates that political factors, particularly CEO Elon Musk's rhetoric and political activities, have negatively impacted Tesla's brand value among some consumers. Norway's robust EV incentives, including VAT exemptions and access to bus lanes, continue to drive EV adoption.</p>
