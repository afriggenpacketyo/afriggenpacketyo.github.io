          <p>Wall Street analysts are beginning to see early signs that Starbucks' turnaround strategy is gaining traction, despite the company reporting weaker-than-expected earnings for its fiscal third quarter and experiencing a sixth consecutive quarter of declining same-store sales. Key positive indicators include a sequential improvement in traffic each month of the quarter and notable growth from non-Starbucks Rewards members, a crucial segment previously identified as a primary reason for sluggish sales. CEO Brian Niccol's "Back to Starbucks" strategy, which involves an accelerated rollout of "Green Apron Service" and mobile app enhancements, is reportedly ahead of schedule. Analysts also express increased confidence in future sales improvements due to an "aggressive innovation agenda" including new menu items in fiscal 2026, though some investors remain skeptical about the overall pace of the comeback.

          <p>Palo Alto Networks shares experienced a significant decline following the announcement of its planned $25 billion acquisition of identity security provider CyberArk, yet Jim Cramer's Investing Club is upgrading its rating, viewing the market's reaction as a potential buying opportunity. The acquisition is considered strategically compelling, as CyberArk's identity security services will integrate a crucial missing piece into Palo Alto's vision of becoming a comprehensive, all-in-one cybersecurity platform. CEO Nikesh Arora emphasized CyberArk's unblemished security record, unlike some competitors, and the substantial potential for cross-selling solutions to Palo Alto's existing 70,000-plus customer base. This deal reflects a broader trend of consolidation within the cybersecurity industry, with expectations for immediate benefits to Palo Alto's revenue growth and gross margin upon its anticipated closing in fiscal 2026.

          <p>Tsunami warnings across Hawaii and the US West Coast have been significantly downgraded or entirely removed, following a powerful earthquake near Russia, as the immediate threat of catastrophic flooding and killer waves recedes. Although some Hawaiian locations recorded crests of nearly six feet, Governor Josh Green reported no "wave of consequence" in the state. Authorities continue to advise caution, urging people to avoid water due to the ongoing risk of strong currents that can persist for hours or days. Many Hawaiians, particularly those in Maui still recovering from wildfires, heeded evacuation orders to higher ground, demonstrating heightened preparedness. Smaller tsunami waves were observed along North America's Pacific coast, with advisories remaining in effect for certain areas.</p>

          <p>Mohammed Fahir Amaaz, 20, has been found guilty of assaulting two female police officers during a large, violent disturbance at Manchester Airport last year, an incident captured in widely shared mobile phone footage. Following a three-week trial, Amaaz was convicted of causing actual bodily harm to PC Lydia Ward, breaking her nose with a punch, and assaulting emergency worker PC Ellie Cook, knocking her to the ground. The jury, however, could not reach verdicts on charges related to a third officer, PC Zachary Marsden, prompting prosecutors to seek a retrial for those counts. Additionally, Amaaz was convicted of an earlier assault on a member of the public at a Starbucks cafe within the airport, underscoring the severity of the day's events.</p>

          <p>Amidst concerns about sticky inflation, rising healthcare costs, and the long-term sustainability of Social Security, many seniors are questioning if their existing benefits are adequate for a comfortable retirement. This article delves into whether purchasing an annuity is a beneficial strategy for those already receiving Social Security. Annuities offer the advantage of providing guaranteed income for life, thereby diversifying income sources and safeguarding against the risk of outliving one's savings. However, they typically require a significant lump sum payment, reduce financial liquidity, and can be intricate with various fees and restrictive terms. Ultimately, the decision hinges on an individual's specific financial goals, risk aversion, health prospects, and the presence of other reliable income streams or emergency savings.

However, the threat has shifted, with several South American countries, including Chile, Peru, and Colombia, issuing new tsunami warnings and evacuation orders, anticipating waves up to three feet.

Meta's significant spending includes a $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI and the establishment of Meta Superintelligence Labs, dedicated to advancing foundation models like the open-source Llama family. The article notes that Zuckerberg's previous expensive ventures, such as the metaverse, have accumulated over $60 billion in losses since late 2020, raising questions about the financial implications and success of this new, substantial AI focus.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a significant rebound in the second quarter, growing at an annual rate of 3% after contracting by 0.5% in the first three months of the year. This surge was largely influenced by a substantial decrease in imports, directly tied to President Trump's trade policies and the imposition of tariffs. While the headline GDP figure appears robust, economists caution that it "overstates the economy's underlying strength," as the growth primarily reflects a decline in goods purchased from overseas rather than a pure increase in domestic production. Consumer spending did show an increase, but other indicators, like "final sales to private domestic purchasers," suggest an underlying weakening of demand. The article concludes that despite the rebound, the economy is shifting to a lower gear, with inflationary pressures likely to continue. (not investment advice)</p>

FFR vice-president Abdelatif Benazzi expressed a desire to "build something for the long term," highlighting the robust strength of French club rugby and the significant appeal for Lions fans due to the relative ease of travel.

At these depths, temperatures can exceed 930 degrees Fahrenheit, allowing for the extraction of 5 to 10 times more power per well compared to conventional methods. Quaise plans to pilot its first superhot geothermal power plant near Bend, Oregon, by 2028, with the potential to also repurpose a substantial portion of the labor force currently in the oil and gas industry.</p>
