          <p>The article discusses the growing trend of using electric grills as a climate-friendly alternative to traditional fossil fuel grills. Many consumers are switching to electric grills due to their convenience and environmental benefits, especially as electricity grids become cleaner. While some chefs express skepticism about the flavor compared to charcoal or wood, electric grills offer precise temperature control and are suitable for cooking vegetables and other sensitive foods. Companies like Kenyon and Current Backyard are expanding their electric grill lines, appealing to younger consumers and those in apartments where gas grills may not be allowed. The couple in the article replaced their gas grill with an electric one after switching to electric cars, lawn mowers, trimmers, and a water heater.</p>

          <p>The article reports that the Senate is likely to make significant changes to the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" passed by the House, despite President Trump's push for swift action. Senate Republicans have raised concerns about the bill's impact on the national debt, with some calling for steeper spending cuts. While Senate Republicans aim to pass Trump's legislative agenda, they plan to modify the bill to reflect their priorities. The House-passed bill includes tax cuts, cuts to social safety net programs, and changes to SNAP, drawing criticism from Democrats who argue it favors the wealthy at the expense of the poor.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has suggested that President Trump possesses the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs, citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 and a precedent from a 1970s court case involving a Japanese zipper company. Despite this favorable view, the judge transferred the case to the Court of International Trade in New York. The lawsuit was filed by Emily Ley Paper, challenging the legality of Trump's tariffs. The judge's opinion offers a symbolic victory for the Trump administration, which faces multiple lawsuits questioning the tariffs' legitimacy.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times opinion piece, Harvard professor Steven Pinker argues against the extreme criticism aimed at Harvard, which he calls "Harvard Derangement Syndrome." He acknowledges Harvard's issues, including erosion of academic freedom and political narrowness, but criticizes the "black-and-white splitting" that paints the university as a "woke madrasa" or "anti-Semitic institution." Pinker defends the value of universities in discovering and transmitting knowledge, not social justice. He also notes that while there are valid concerns about antisemitism at Harvard, the situation is not as extreme as some critics claim, and punitive defunding from the Trump administration is not the solution.</p>

However, prices remain high, and many households are struggling with energy debts.

          <p>The U.S. Army will implement a new Army Fitness Test (AFT) on June 1, 2025, replacing the current Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) with updated scoring standards emphasizing readiness and combat effectiveness. The AFT comprises five events: the three-repetition maximum deadlift, hand-release push-ups, sprint-drag-carry, plank, and a two-mile run. Scoring requirements are more demanding, especially for soldiers in combat roles. Experts suggest that while challenging, the AFT is achievable for individuals with a basic fitness foundation, though some estimate less than 5% of civilians could pass it without proper preparation.</p>
