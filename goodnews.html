          <p>Shares of U.S.-listed minerals explorer Trilogy Metals experienced a dramatic increase, skyrocketing over 200% in premarket trade on Tuesday. This surge occurred shortly after the White House announced its acquisition of a 10% stake in the Canadian company. The U.S. government's investment signals a strategic interest in securing critical mineral resources, potentially impacting future supply chain stability. This significant development underscores the growing importance of government backing in the resource sector, leading to considerable market enthusiasm and investor optimism for Trilogy Metals' prospects.</p>

If confirmed, he would be the first from the Arab world to hold this prestigious position, a move celebrated by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi. El-Anani's appointment comes at a critical time as UNESCO faces significant budget challenges, particularly after the U.S. withdrew its funding. He has committed to addressing these financial issues and working towards the U.S. rejoining the organization, alongside continuing UNESCO's efforts against antisemitism and religious intolerance.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index reached a record high for the second consecutive day, initially paring gains before closing flat. The rally was primarily driven by a tech sector surge on Wall Street, spurred by a significant deal between OpenAI and AMD, which is seen as a direct challenge to Nvidia. While chip-related stocks on the Nikkei 225 experienced volatile trading, the broader market was also influenced by the election of a new conservative leader in Japan's ruling party. This market movement reflects a broader trend of investor enthusiasm for technology advancements, despite rising Japanese Government Bond yields. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is in Washington for talks with President Trump, aiming to get stalled trade negotiations back on track. Despite a missed August deadline, Canada is not rushing, benefiting from existing USMCA carve-outs. The meeting occurs amid renewed Trump rhetoric about Canada becoming the 51st state and domestic pressure on Carney to secure a favorable deal, particularly concerning U.S. tariffs on Canadian goods. While no major breakthroughs are expected, face-to-face dialogue is hoped to ease the trade stalemate and address broader economic and security issues, including an upcoming USMCA review.</p>

          <p>The World Bank has revised its 2025 growth forecast for China upwards to 4.8%, an increase from 4% previously, despite ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. The improved outlook is attributed to government support, though this stimulus is expected to taper next year. China's economy has been buoyed by rising exports to Southeast Asia and Europe, offsetting declines to the U.S. and domestic drags from a real estate slump and tepid consumer spending. However, challenges persist, including youth unemployment and an aging population, with growth projected to slow to 4.2% in 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD has seen its UK sales skyrocket by 880% in September compared to the previous year, making the UK its largest market outside China. This significant growth is attributed to the UK's lack of tariffs on Chinese EVs, unlike the EU and US, making it an attractive market for BYD's more affordable models. The company's market share in the UK jumped to 3.6%, with further expansion planned through new hybrid and electric car launches. Despite this success, BYD has criticized the UK government's decision to exclude Chinese-made vehicles from EV purchase subsidies. (not investment advice)</p>
