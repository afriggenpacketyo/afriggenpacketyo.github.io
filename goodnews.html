          <p>The Santa Ynez Reservoir in Pacific Palisades, which was controversially out of service for repairs during a major firestorm in January, is now operational again, according to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. The reservoir's floating cover required extensive repairs after multiple tears were discovered, delaying its return. While its restoration is a positive step for the area's water infrastructure, residents and officials continue to question why the critical resource was unavailable during the emergency, which may have contributed to firefighters' difficulties with dry hydrants.</p>

A local environmental group, GreenRoots, has transformed a single city block by planting over 100 trees, resurfacing the street with heat-reflecting colors, and painting rooftops white. This 'cool block' initiative serves as an urban laboratory and a potential template for other cities looking to mitigate the effects of extreme heat, which are intensifying due to climate change.</p>

He explains that the 1994 introduction of Asperger's disorder, a milder form of autism, dramatically broadened the diagnostic criteria. Frances argues that while this helped some who were previously missed, it also led to significant over-diagnosis, fueled by the internet and the association of the diagnosis with educational benefits.</p>
