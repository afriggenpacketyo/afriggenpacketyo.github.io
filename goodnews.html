          <p>WhatsApp is planning to roll out new features that will change how users interact with brands and provide companies with more opportunities to monetize user engagement. The new subscription model will allow channel admins to offer exclusive content for a monthly fee, enabling them to earn money from their most engaged followers. WhatsApp will also integrate ads into the "Updates" tab, allowing users to directly message brands if they see a product or service they want. Meta introduced the "Updates" tab on WhatsApp a year ago, and it is now visited by 1.5 billion people daily, with the "Chats" tab remaining end-to-end encrypted and ad-free.</p>

          <p>In the Sean "Diddy" Combs trial in New York City, a juror was dismissed due to inconsistencies in his statements about where he lived. The judge expressed concerns about the juror's candor and whether he shaded answers to get on and stay on the jury. The dismissed juror was a 41-year-old Black man who claimed to live in the Bronx, but there was debate about whether he actually lived there or in New Jersey. He was replaced with a 57-year-old white man from Westchester, and the trial resumed with a paralegal presenting charts and texts sent by Combs' staff. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With potential Federal Reserve rate cuts on the horizon, experts are weighing in on which certificate of deposit (CD) term is the most beneficial for savers. Short-term CDs are currently offering the highest interest rates, while long-term CDs provide longer-term security and predictability, though they may have lower rates. A CD ladder, which involves opening several CD accounts with varying term lengths, can provide the best of both worlds by offering flexibility and access to cash at regular intervals. Regardless of the chosen term, experts recommend doing research and shopping around to find the most competitive CD rates, as there can be significant differences depending on the bank or credit union.

          <p>The United States' year of hosting major soccer events, including the Club World Cup and Concacaf Gold Cup, has begun with underwhelming attendance figures. Despite enthusiasm from analysts, the spectacle felt flat, with attendances reflecting this sentiment, as evidenced by unsold tickets and price cuts. The United States men's national team's win against Trinidad and Tobago was satisfying, but only a small crowd turned up, and Mexico also failed to pack out SoFi Stadium. However, some exciting moments were salvaged from the proceedings, including Lionel Messi's performance and Al Ahly's challenge of Inter Miami, highlighting the enduring appeal of soccer despite the commercial aspects.</p>

The Red Sox traded Devers for Jordan Hicks, Jose Bello, James Tibbs III, and Kyle Harrison, a deal that has stunned the baseball world. Devers was hitting .272 with a .905 OPS and 15 home runs, leading the American League in walks. The Red Sox are operating with a completely different roster than the one they had when they won the World Series seven years ago.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home lending experts have outlined three possible mortgage rate scenarios for this summer, anticipating limited movement unless there's a clear break in labor or inflation unexpectedly cools. The most optimistic prediction sees a modest decline, with 30-year fixed mortgage rates potentially averaging around 6.6% by August. If inflation jumps above 3% or the economy grows too fast, mortgage interest rates could rise, while a cooling economy could lead to a decline in rates. However, experts caution against trying to time the market perfectly, and advise focusing on variables you can control and consulting a mortgage lender to lock in a rate soon.

The truck delivers 12,000 Newton-meter of wheel torque, uses an intelligent chassis system that scans the road 1,000 times per second, and allows the wheel to glide from right- to left-hand drive in seconds. The Pickup 01's torque tops the roughly 1,400 Nm listed for the tri-motor Cybertruck, and Tesla prices its entry-level Cybertruck at $62,490 on the official order page, giving GAC's sticker a 33% discount.</p>

The national security agreement includes a golden share for the U.S government, giving the U.S. president veto power over any decision to relocate U.S. Steel's headquarters, move the company outside the U.S., rename U.S. Steel, transfer production or jobs outside the U.S., and close or idle plants before certain time frames. U.S. Steel confirmed in a regulatory filing that the company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America.</p>
