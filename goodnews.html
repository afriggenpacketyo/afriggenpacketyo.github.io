          <p>Japan has requested that eight countries and regions block its residents from accessing licensed online casino websites. Gambling with overseas-based betting sites is illegal in Japan, prompting the government to address the issue by urging operators to cut off access to their sites. The move comes after media revelations that some professional athletes and celebrities have used online casinos, with a police survey estimating that over 3 million people in Japan have gambled online. The government plans to tighten regulations on illegal online gambling by prohibiting websites from directing traffic to casino sites.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump are expected to meet in Canada on the sidelines of the Group of Seven leaders' summit to discuss ongoing bilateral tariff talks. The leaders are expected to follow up on recent ministerial-level talks aimed at concluding a "mutually beneficial" deal following the imposition of higher import tariffs by the United States. Tokyo has been calling for Washington to shift its focus to boosting investment and jobs, rather than imposing tariffs to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. Both leaders are also likely to discuss the deepening of the countries' security alliance.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales in May grew at their fastest rate since late 2023, driven by the extended Labor Day and Dragon Boat holidays. Retail sales jumped 6.4% year-on-year, surpassing analysts' estimates and accelerating from the previous month. Growth in industrial output slowed slightly, while fixed-asset investment expanded at a slower pace. The urban survey-based unemployment rate eased to its lowest level since November last year, while new home prices continued to decline in major cities.</p>
