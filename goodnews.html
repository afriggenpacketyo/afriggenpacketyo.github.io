          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed a largely symbolic executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights amid reports of a potential deployment of federal agents to the city. The order seeks to bar federal agents from wearing masks and requires them to display identifying information, such as badges. This preemptive measure reflects growing tensions between the city's leadership and the Trump administration over the use of federal forces in urban areas, with the mayor stating the city did not request such an intervention.</p>

          <p>Medical and psychological experts are providing consensus-based recommendations on safe screen time for children, emphasizing different needs at various stages of development.

          <p>Footballer Jack Grealish, after a difficult period at Manchester City, is enjoying a remarkable return to form since joining Everton on a season-long loan. He has delivered man-of-the-match performances, registering multiple assists and becoming a key player for his new club. This resurgence has sparked debate about whether he can still earn a place in England's squad for the upcoming World Cup, a significant turnaround for a player who was often on the bench last season.</p>
