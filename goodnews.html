        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newcastle United has finalized a club-record signing of German striker Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart for a fee of up to £69 million on a six-year contract. The 23-year-old, noted for his technical skill despite his towering height, is seen as a key addition, especially with uncertainty surrounding the future of current striker Alexander Isak. Woltemade had a remarkable season with Stuttgart, scoring 17 goals and winning the German Cup. Head coach Eddie Howe praised the new signing as a great fit for the team's attacking profile, with significant potential for further development.</p>

          <p>Following the major trade of star pass rusher Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, Dallas Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer asserted that the team's objectives remain unchanged. Schottenheimer emphasized that football is the "ultimate team game" and that a championship cannot be won by a single individual, expressing confidence in the roster's depth. He acknowledged Parsons as an incredible player but stressed that the standard for the team has not been lowered by his departure. The trade is considered an NFL-altering move that has significantly boosted the Packers' championship odds.</p>

          <p>China is increasing its security footprint in Africa by providing military training to Somali forces as part of its Global Security Initiative (GSI). The program is designed to help Somalia develop a self-sufficient defense force to combat the extremist group al-Shabab, particularly as the African Union mission prepares to withdraw. This cooperation also extends to law enforcement training and anti-piracy efforts in the Gulf of Aden, aligning with China's broader strategic and economic interests on the continent. The initiative represents Beijing's efforts to offer an alternative model for international security cooperation.</p>

          <p>After the Trump administration effectively shut down the public climate science portal climate.gov, a team of former employees and experts is working to resurrect its content through a new non-profit organization called climate.us. The goal is to restore public access to taxpayer-funded climate information and continue the mission of promoting climate literacy. The new initiative plans to republish essential content and may expand to offer climate-related services, such as helping local governments map flood risks. This effort represents a direct response to what organizers call the administration's attempt to hide vital scientific data.</p>

          <p>Chelsea Football Club has continued its significant squad changes with two major departures from its attack. Striker Nicolas Jackson is set to join Bayern Munich on loan with an option to buy, while Christopher Nkunku has completed a permanent transfer to AC Milan for £36 million. These moves are crucial for Chelsea's financial standing, helping the club adhere to UEFA's financial regulations by balancing its transfer spending. The sales follow the arrival of new forwards this summer, which had limited the playing opportunities for both Jackson and Nkunku.</p>

          <p>Three brothers from Edinburgh have set a new world record for the fastest non-stop, unsupported row across the Pacific Ocean. Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan MacLean completed the 9,000-mile journey from Peru to Australia in 139 days, beating the previous record by more than three weeks. During their voyage, they endured severe tropical storms, with one incident washing a brother overboard before he was safely recovered. The remarkable feat of endurance has also served as a fundraiser, generating over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to the latest preliminary data from the CDC, fatal drug overdoses in the U.S. have fallen to their lowest point in five years. This steady decline since mid-2023 contrasts with President Trump's continued portrayal of the fentanyl crisis as a growing threat used to justify harsh policies, including mandatory minimum sentences and trade tariffs. While the administration focuses on punitive measures, public health experts attribute the positive trend to successful disruptions of fentanyl supply chains and improved access to addiction treatment, suggesting a different approach may be more effective.</p>

          <p>An advice column explores the delicate balance of financial obligations and personal boundaries within families. One query addresses the pressure to buy birthday gifts for 18 nieces and nephews, while another asks how to handle financially irresponsible parents who request bailouts. Experts suggest that these situations are often rooted in relationship dynamics rather than just money. They recommend establishing clear boundaries, exploring non-monetary ways to show care and connection, and prioritizing one's own financial well-being before providing assistance to relatives, especially when they are not managing their own resources effectively.</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian government has altered its border crossing regulations to permit men under the age of 22 to travel abroad freely. This policy change reverses a wartime rule that had banned men aged 18 to 60 from leaving the country due to potential military conscription, which currently begins at age 25. The government's stated goal is to provide young Ukrainians with opportunities for international education and work experience, hoping they will maintain strong ties and eventually contribute to the nation's development. However, some experts worry the move could inadvertently increase youth emigration.</p>
