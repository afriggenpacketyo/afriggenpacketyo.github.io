          <p>Autonomous driving company Pony.ai has announced a partnership with Singapore's largest taxi operator, ComfortDelGro, to launch a robotaxi service in the city-state in the coming months. The service will initially be deployed on fixed routes within the Punggol residential district, a newly developed area. This move marks the Guangzhou-based firm's third overseas expansion, following recent initiatives in Qatar and Dubai. Pony.ai is a leading robotaxi operator in China and aims to enhance urban mobility and advance Singapore's vision for a smart transportation network.</p>

          <p>At a major arms fair in Taipei, Taiwan has highlighted its progress in defense self-sufficiency and its growing cooperation with American firms amid increasing military pressure from Beijing. The exhibition featured two key projects: Taiwan's first locally developed anti-ballistic missile system, known as Chiang-Kong, and a cruise missile co-developed with a U.S. defense company. The Chiang-Kong system is designed to intercept ballistic missiles at altitudes up to 70km, significantly enhancing the island's layered defense capabilities. The event underscores Taiwan's dual strategy of building indigenous defense technology while strengthening international security partnerships.</p>

          <p>Early in-person voting has commenced in Virginia for the gubernatorial election, a key political contest viewed as a bellwether for the Trump administration's policies. The race features Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears against former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger. National issues, particularly the administration's cuts to the federal workforce, are playing a significant role in a state with a large number of federal employees. Spanberger is campaigning against these policies, while Earle-Sears is aligning herself with the economic record of the state's popular Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin. The election is also proceeding under heightened security concerns following the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.</p>

The couple, who had lived and worked on charitable projects in Afghanistan for decades, were detained on February 1. Their release was secured through Qatari mediation, and the family expressed immense relief and gratitude. The Taliban stated the couple had broken Afghan laws but never specified the charges, while the family had previously raised serious concerns about their deteriorating health in detention.</p>

This critical threshold means the treaty will take effect in January, enabling the creation of marine protected areas in international waters. The agreement, two decades in the making, aims to conserve marine biodiversity and reverse damage from overfishing, pollution, and climate change. Environmental groups have celebrated the milestone as a "monumental achievement" for ocean conservation and a significant step toward the goal of protecting 30% of the world's oceans by 2030.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal court has sentenced Qingzhou Wang, a principal executive of the Wuhan-based company Amarvel Biotech, to 25 years in prison for trafficking fentanyl precursor chemicals. Wang and a marketing manager, Yiyi Chen, who received a 15-year sentence, were convicted in New York of precursor importation and money laundering. The Drug Enforcement Administration stated the executives turned their company into a "pipeline of poison," shipping hundreds of kilograms of chemicals to the U.S. disguised as everyday goods. This case marked the first time the U.S. charged Chinese companies for trafficking these chemicals directly into the country, rather than through Mexico.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping have approved a deal regarding the future of TikTok's U.S. operations during a phone call. The reported deal would involve selling TikTok's U.S. business to a group of American investors, including Oracle, allowing the app to continue operating in the country under a licensing agreement for its algorithm technology. However, confirmation from Beijing was less clear, with state media quoting Xi as saying China "welcomes negotiations." A key point of contention remains the ownership of the powerful algorithm that serves content to TikTok's 170 million American users, a detail that continues to cause concern among some U.S. lawmakers.</p>

          <p>Facing saturated markets and slowing demand in Europe and the U.S., many Chinese companies are increasingly turning their focus to Southeast Asia. A major trade fair in Nanning, China, is serving as a key testing ground for these exporters to connect with buyers from the region. Companies are attracted to Southeast Asia's rapidly growing economies, large populations, and young consumer demographics, which they see as offering significant potential for expansion. This strategic shift reflects a broader trend of Chinese businesses diversifying their export markets to sustain growth amidst global economic uncertainties and geopolitical shifts.

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has dismissed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit filed by President Trump against The New York Times, criticizing the complaint as an improper political attack rather than a serious legal document. U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday ruled that the 85-page filing was excessively long and filled with language unsuited for a legal complaint, calling it a "megaphone for public relations." While the judge did not rule on the legal merits of the case, he gave Trump's lawyers 28 days to submit a revised, more professional complaint. The lawsuit alleged that several articles and a book by the newspaper's reporters were intended to undermine his presidential campaign.</p>
