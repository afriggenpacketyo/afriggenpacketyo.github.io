          <p>Tufan Erhurman, a moderate centre-left politician, won the Turkish Cypriot presidential elections with 62.8% of the vote, defeating hardliner Ersin Tatar. Erhurman's victory signals a major policy shift, as he advocates for a federal solution to reunify Cyprus, aligning with long-supported UN talks. This outcome contrasts with Tatar's and Turkey's two-state policy, which Greek Cypriots rejected. The election's result could help revive stalled peace negotiations for the island, divided since a 1974 Turkish invasion.</p>

          <p>Senator Katie Britt discussed President Trump's new policy aimed at expanding access to fertility treatments, including IVF, following a controversial Alabama court decision that ruled frozen embryos as children. Britt emphasized Trump's commitment to helping families struggling with infertility by making treatments more affordable and accessible to millions more. While acknowledging the high costs of IVF, the article highlights the administration's focus on driving down expenses and supporting families, rather than mandating federal or insurance coverage through existing programs like the Affordable Care Act.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter used her 'Saturday Night Live' hosting and musical guest appearance to subtly address criticism of her winking pop persona and suggestive album visuals. In a QVC sketch, she played a designer seemingly oblivious to the phallic resemblance of her product, mirroring real-life reactions to her work. Her opening monologue and other sketches directly referenced controversies, such as her 'Man’s Best Friend' album cover. The article suggests Carpenter is intentionally in on the joke, challenging those who overly scrutinize her sexuality.</p>

          <p>Former Republican US Representative George Santos, recently released from prison after his sentence for wire fraud and identity theft was commuted by President Trump, has announced a new mission: prison reform. Santos described his 84-day federal prison experience as 'dehumanizing' and 'humbling,' detailing poor conditions like mold and broken air conditioning. He informed Trump of his intention to assist the administration in this area. Santos, who is not seeking re-election for at least a decade, aims to improve the 'broken' prison system.</p>

          <p>Southeast Asia has seen a dramatic drop in tobacco consumption per capita over two decades, largely due to stronger policies on taxation, advertising bans, and public smoking restrictions. However, the absolute number of smokers has risen due to population growth, and the region faces new challenges like the rapid rise of e-cigarettes. While some countries have banned vaping, others, like Malaysia, face political resistance to stricter regulations. Indonesia remains a notable exception, not having ratified the WHO's tobacco control framework, and recently scrapped a planned tobacco tax hike.</p>

This agreement, reached with the American Federation of Teachers, will process forgiveness for eligible individuals in the original Income-Contingent Repayment and Pay As You Earn plans. These programs are set to phase out by July 1, 2028, under President Trump's 'big beautiful bill.' The administration also clarified that forgiveness granted in 2025 will be exempt from federal taxes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bolivia is ushering in a new political era with a presidential run-off election between two conservative capitalists, Jorge Quiroga and Rodrigo Paz, ending two decades of leftist rule. The country faces its worst economic crisis in decades, marked by a US dollar shortage, currency devaluation, and high inflation. Both candidates promise to stabilize the economy, fix the exchange rate, and attract foreign investment, differing on approaches to IMF loans and fuel subsidies. This election signals a significant shift in Bolivia's alliances, moving away from China and Russia towards stronger ties with the US. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is reportedly considering a cut to the 5% VAT rate on energy bills, as suggested by Energy Secretary Ed Miliband. This move is part of efforts to address the ongoing cost-of-living crisis, with the Chancellor expected to announce targeted actions in the November Budget. Scrapping VAT on domestic energy could save average households £86 annually but would cost the government an estimated £2.5 billion per year. Miliband emphasized that long-term bill reduction depends on transitioning to home-grown clean power.</p>

          <p>Green Party leader Zack Polanski defended his party's proposals for an annual wealth tax on assets above £10m and £1bn, asserting it aims to tackle 'deep inequality in our society.' Polanski suggested such a tax could raise £15bn to £25bn annually, although critics argue similar taxes in other countries yielded less and could deter investment. He also advocated aligning capital gains tax with income tax to tax 'unearned wealth' equally. Polanski emphasized that while public services require broad contributions, the immediate focus should be on the 'super wealthy.' (not investment advice)</p>
