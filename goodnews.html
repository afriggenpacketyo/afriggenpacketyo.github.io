          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis followed reports of urinary symptoms, leading to the discovery of a nodule on his prostate. The cancer is characterized by a high Gleason score, indicating its aggressive nature, but appears to be hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management. The article also notes that the diagnosis has resurfaced questions about Biden's health and fitness for office, particularly in light of a recently released audio recording revealing his fragile voice and difficulty recalling details.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick disclosed that he spent $5,000 on special milk to keep Tom Brady and Antonio Brown's relationship positive during Brown's brief tenure with the New England Patriots. Brown had ordered the expensive milk for Brady, who is very nutrition-oriented, but it spoiled due to a mix-up in the mailroom. Belichick approved the expense to avoid damaging the relationship between the two players, who later won a Super Bowl together with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Belichick is now head football coach at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>

          <p>Rafal Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of Warsaw, appeared to narrowly win the first round of Poland's presidential election, which is viewed as crucial for Prime Minister Donald Tusk's efforts to reverse hard-right policies implemented by the previous administration. Trzaskowski, a member of Tusk's Civic Platform, will face Karol Nowrocki, backed by the Law and Justice party, in a runoff election. While the Polish presidency is largely ceremonial, it holds veto powers that can significantly impact the government's agenda, making the election a key test of Tusk's ability to dismantle the legacy of the Law and Justice party.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers released Chris Taylor, marking the end of an era for the veteran player and continuing a recent shakeup of the team's roster. Taylor's release follows that of Austin Barnes, another longtime veteran, and comes as the team activates Tommy Edman from the injured list and adds pitcher Lou Trivino. The Dodgers made the move due to Taylor's declining production and the emergence of younger players. Taylor, once a key contributor to the team's success, had struggled in recent seasons after undergoing elbow surgery.</p>
