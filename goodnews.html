          <p>Pony.ai, a Chinese robotaxi company, is collaborating with Uber to introduce driverless taxis in the Middle East later this year, marking a significant step in the autonomous driving industry. The initial deployment will feature Pony.ai's robotaxis on Uber's platform in a key regional market, with plans for international expansion. During the pilot phase, a safety operator will be present in the vehicles until fully autonomous commercial service begins. This partnership aims to establish a new benchmark for commercializing driverless services and accelerating the integration of autonomous vehicles into Uber's offerings.</p>

          <p>Wales' First Minister Eluned Morgan has stated her intention to challenge the Labour Party in Westminster if its decisions negatively impact Welsh communities. She emphasized prioritizing Wales and its people over party loyalty, citing potential harm from UK government policies like disability benefit cuts and changes to the winter fuel allowance. Morgan called for Wales to benefit more from wind power revenues and advocated for a revised funding formula that reflects the country's needs. She also attacked Reform UK and Plaid Cymru while defending her government's "red Welsh Labour way" policies.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that disputed ballots in the unresolved 2024 North Carolina Supreme Court race must be included in the final count, potentially securing a victory for Democratic incumbent Allison Riggs. Judge Richard Myers determined that removing ballots six months after the election would violate the constitutional rights of affected voters. He ordered the state board of elections to certify Riggs as the winner, pending a potential appeal from Republican challenger Jefferson Griffin. The case involved challenges to ballots cast by overseas voters and military personnel who did not provide photo identification.</p>

          <p>Brood XIV, a group of periodical cicadas, is set to emerge from underground after 17 years, impacting ecosystems across large portions of the eastern US. These cicadas will surface around May and June, living only a few weeks to mate and lay eggs before dying. This insect explosion will provide a food source for various forest creatures, increasing bird populations and altering hunting patterns. Eastern North America is the only place in the world where periodical cicadas exist, with different broods emerging every 13 or 17 years.</p>

          <p>DoorDash announced it will acquire restaurant booking platform SevenRooms for $1.2 billion, while also reporting first-quarter revenue that fell short of expectations. The all-cash acquisition is expected to close in the second half of 2025 and aims to enhance DoorDash's ability to provide world-class services and support local commerce. The company also reported a total order increase of 18% for the quarter, but this was slightly below analyst expectations. The company expects second-quarter adjusted EBITDA of $600 million to $650 million, which is also below analyst projections.</p>

          <p>The Taiwan dollar experienced a pullback after a significant surge driven by speculation about pressure from Washington to strengthen the currency. The currency weakened over 3% against the U.S. dollar after a 9% rally in the previous days. The central bank Governor Yang Chin-long refuted claims that exchange rates were part of U.S. trade negotiations, but analysts remain skeptical. The pullback was attributed to returning dollar demand from importers, with some believing the central bank has not intervened aggressively.</p>

          <p>Former Governor Andrew Cuomo, seeking to become mayor, is proposing a plan to remove more mentally ill people from New York City streets to address public safety concerns. The plan includes expanding involuntary hospitalizations, requiring screening for mandatory outpatient treatment upon discharge from hospitals and jails, and increasing supportive housing units. Many of Cuomo's ideas align with those of Mayor Eric Adams and Governor Kathy Hochul, who have also sought to force more people into treatment. Critics argue that Cuomo oversaw a reduction in psychiatric beds as governor, worsening the mental health system.</p>

The author believes that since Liberty Media took over the sport they have leaned into this resource and F1 is an altogether more human affair for it.</p>
