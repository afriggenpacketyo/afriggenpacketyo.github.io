          <p>Eric Jackson, a hedge fund manager known for his role in the Opendoor trading surge, has publicly endorsed Better Home & Finance Holding Co., dubbing it the 'Shopify of mortgages.' Jackson highlighted the company's use of artificial intelligence to rebuild the $15 trillion mortgage industry. He noted Better Home's valuation at 1x 2026 sales, compared to a competitor's 19x, despite Better Home's faster growth. Jackson projects a potential 350-bagger return for Better Home within two years, emphasizing it is not a meme stock. (not investment advice)</p>

He is a voting member of the FOMC this year, and his remarks align with some officials who foresee limited further easing. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 'solopreneur' business model, comprising businesses with no paid employees, is booming across the US, contributing $1.7 trillion to the economy. This growth, particularly notable in states like California and Florida, is fueled by declining barriers to entry thanks to artificial intelligence and social media platforms. AI acts as a virtual assistant, while social media, like TikTok, enables solopreneurs to connect with global customer bases instantly and affordably. The trend reflects a broader shift towards flexibility, autonomy, and purpose, with many individuals, especially women under 30, prioritizing personal brands over traditional corporate paths. This article highlights how technology is empowering individuals to create and scale businesses more easily than ever before. </p>

          <h2>China's Crude Oil Imports from Russia Decline in August, Offset by Other Suppliers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 10:00:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's crude oil imports from Russia saw a 15.2% year-on-year decrease in August, totaling 7.94 million tonnes. This dip, however, was largely offset by significant increases from other partners, including a 50.4% jump from Brazil and a nearly 90-fold rise from Indonesia. Analysts suggest the decline from Russia might be a temporary fluctuation due to maintenance at key production sites like Sakhalin-1. China's overall crude oil imports remained steady, indicating a diversification of supply sources rather than a reduction in demand. This article provides an overview of recent shifts in China's energy procurement. </p>

          <p>As summer officially ends and fall begins on September 22, Indiana faces conflicting weather predictions for the upcoming season. The Old Farmer's Almanac forecasts a cooler, drier autumn for the Midwest, while the Farmer's Almanac anticipates a 'tug-of-war' between stormy and fair conditions, with potential for severe thunderstorms. In contrast, NOAA's Climate Prediction Center suggests a 33-40% chance of warmer-than-normal temperatures for Indiana from October through December, with equal chances for above or below normal rainfall. Historical data indicates average fall temperatures in Central Indiana are generally milder than last year. The article highlights the varying long-range predictions for the season. </p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point rate cut and signals for more reductions in 2025 are expected to diminish returns on savings accounts. Some online banks have already lowered rates, with further cuts anticipated. Certified financial planners advise savers to consider locking in higher rates now, particularly through Certificates of Deposit (CDs). While CD rates will also be affected, current offerings of 4% returns are still available for durations extending into next year. For emergency funds or near-term expenses, high-yield savings accounts remain suitable, but savers should monitor rate changes. (not investment advice)</p>

Abd el-Fattah, a key figure in Egypt's 2011 uprising, had spent much of the last decade imprisoned, most recently for 'spreading false news.'

          <p>Average mortgage interest rates have begun to fall, reaching a three-year low, with experts anticipating further declines this fall. The Federal Reserve's recent rate cut and potential future reductions are key factors influencing this trend, although mortgage rates are more closely tied to long-term bond markets. Economists predict rates could settle around 6.0-6.2% by year-end, which could make homes affordable for millions more households. Prospective homebuyers are advised to get pre-approved and consider rate locks with float-down options to capitalize on potential lower rates. (not investment advice)</p>

His victory, secured by a mere 20 points, was Germany's only gold medal at the championships. Neugebauer attributes his success partly to training at the University of Texas at Austin, which helped him develop athletically and mentally.
