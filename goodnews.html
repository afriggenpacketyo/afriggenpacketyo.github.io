          <p>The UK government announced securing £150 billion in US investment, projected to create 7,600 jobs, coinciding with President Donald Trump's state visit. Major firms like Blackstone, Microsoft, and Google are contributing significant capital, aiming to deepen US-UK economic ties. This initiative seeks to boost the UK economy, despite domestic businesses slowing investment due to rising costs and some pharmaceutical companies, like Merck and AstraZeneca, shifting investments away. Prime Minister Starmer praised the investments as a testament to Britain's economic strength, though critics, like former Deputy Prime Minister Sir Nick Clegg, called them "crumbs from the Silicon Valley table," questioning their overall impact.

          <p>Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei has announced new AI computing systems featuring its in-house Ascend chips, intensifying competition with US rival Nvidia.
