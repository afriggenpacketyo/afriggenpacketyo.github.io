          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally, reaching a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and institutional buyer interest. Despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, Bitcoin's price rose, possibly due to investors seeking alternative stores of value. Macro concerns, including Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, also contributed to Bitcoin's rise, with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon announcing that the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency.
