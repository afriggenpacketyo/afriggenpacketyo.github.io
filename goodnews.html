          <p>Japan's average unemployment rate fell to 2.5% in fiscal year 2024, a 0.1 percentage point decrease from the previous year, marking the first improvement in two years, driven by a persistent labor shortage. The number of unemployed individuals decreased by 30,000 to 1.75 million, while the number of employed people rose by 370,000 to a record high of 67.93 million. Despite a slight dip in the job availability ratio, economists suggest the labor market remains tight, with demand for workers continuing to outstrip supply, especially in sectors like information and communication.</p>

          <p>The National Portrait Gallery has launched an immersive exhibition in Salford, combining digital versions of portraits from its collection with animated graphics and voiceovers to tell the stories of 19 celebrities and historical figures. The exhibition features portraits of British icons from Winston Churchill to Amy Winehouse, Charles Darwin to Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa. The show is intended to take the collection to new audiences outside of London and to raise revenue for the gallery.</p>
