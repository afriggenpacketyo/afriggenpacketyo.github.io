          <p>With persistent inflation posing challenges to saving money, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a viable option for earning returns that outpace inflation. Today's leading CD accounts come with higher interest rates, providing a safe investment opportunity with FDIC or NCUA insurance. While national average CD rates vary by term, online banks often offer the most competitive rates. Investors can lock in these high rates for the term of the CD, ensuring a steady return on their savings (not investment advice).</p>
