          <p>Ninth-ranked LSU defeated fourth-ranked Clemson with a final score of 17-10 in a defensive battle held in South Carolina. The game saw multiple punts, a fumble, and two field goals early on, with Clemson scoring the first touchdown late in the second half. LSU responded, but fumbled near the end zone, failing to score before halftime. After Clemson missed a field goal, LSU tied the game and later took the lead, ultimately securing the win by preventing Clemson from converting on a crucial fourth down. The game highlighted LSU's defensive strength and offensive resilience under pressure, marking a significant road victory. The final score was hard-fought, showing the determination and skill of both teams, with LSU ultimately emerging victorious with a strong defensive showing. The game's intensity and strategic plays were key to the final outcome.</p>

          <p>Several UK news outlets are covering a range of stories, including allegations that Prince Andrew maintained contact with Jeffrey Epstein later than previously stated, based on newly surfaced emails. Also reported is scrutiny surrounding Angela Rayner's boyfriend's work for a lobbying group that received government funds. Kemi Badenoch's policy shift to maximize North Sea oil and gas extraction is drawing comparisons to Donald Trump's energy policies. Concerns about the black market for weight loss drugs due to rising costs, a poll indicating reluctance to fight for Britain, and Strictly Come Dancing judge Shirley Ballas's experience with a stalker are also highlighted. Lastly, the Royal Opera House is issuing trigger warnings for a loud curtain-up bell, raising eyebrows and being mocked by some news outlets.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Justin Sun, founder of Tron, envisions surpassing SWIFT in transaction volume within five years, estimating Tron's transaction volume to reach US$8 trillion this year. He anticipates scaling the volume to US$300-400 trillion, potentially exceeding SWIFT's capacity by tenfold. Sun highlights Tron's transaction speed, processing transactions in seconds compared to SWIFT's days. This confidence stems from Tron's growing influence in stablecoin transactions globally, as stablecoins maintain a fixed value by being pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. Tron is poised to become a major player in the virtual asset sector, challenging traditional financial systems with its speed and efficiency.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order to protect residents' rights amid concerns about a potential federal agent deployment for immigration enforcement. The order bars federal agents from wearing masks and requires them to display identifying information. Johnson emphasized that the city will not allow its police department to be deputized by the federal government and opposes the use of military force in Chicago. The order directs city departments to provide information on residents' rights and submit Freedom of Information Act requests to gather data on federal immigration enforcement activity. The White House responded by criticizing the mayor's actions as a publicity stunt.</p>

          <p>Kirk Ferentz tied Woody Hayes as the Big Ten's all-time winningest coach after Iowa's 34-7 victory over Albany, with Xavier Williams rushing for 122 yards and a touchdown. Ferentz, in his 27th season, secured his 205th win with the Hawkeyes, but downplayed the milestone in the post-game celebration. Iowa's offense, led by quarterback Mark Gronowski, controlled the game despite Gronowski's struggles and eventual exit due to cramping. Williams stepped up in place of the injured Kamari Moulton, becoming the first Iowa freshman to record a 100-yard game in his debut since 2005. The Hawkeyes dominated on the ground, outgaining Albany 310-43, showcasing a strong rushing attack.</p>

          <p>Beer sales in Germany are declining, but non-alcoholic beer is gaining popularity, with sales more than doubling since 2013. Overall beer sales have fallen to their lowest level in over 30 years, dropping 6.3% in the first half of 2025. Breweries like Erdinger are adapting by promoting non-alcoholic beer at sporting events as a healthy alternative to energy drinks. Consumers are becoming more health-conscious, opting for alcohol-free beverages in between alcoholic drinks. Despite this shift, traditional beer culture remains strong, especially in regions like Bavaria, where beer consumption remains a significant part of daily life.</p>

The Metal Gear series, known for its cinematic storytelling and tackling complex themes, faced uncertainty after Kojima's departure in 2015. The split between Kojima and Konami reportedly stemmed from the spiraling costs of Metal Gear Solid V. The remake aims to capture the essence of the original game with improved graphics and audio.

          <p>The BBC is launching a new dating reality show called 'Stranded on Honeymoon Island,' hosted by Davina McCall, combining elements of Love Island, Married at First Sight, and Survivor. Contestants meet for just five minutes before being matched by experts and embarking on a honeymoon on a remote island. The show aims to discover if love can thrive in isolation, stripping away the superficiality often found in other dating shows. Contestants emphasize the authenticity and challenge of the experience, focusing on genuine connections rather than seeking fame or brand deals. The show also features slightly older contestants, reflecting a trend of people settling down later in life.</p>

          <p>UK scientists are employing drones, sniffer dogs, and nuclear waste models to combat the spruce bark beetle, which poses a significant threat to the UK's forests. The beetle, which has devastated spruce trees across Europe, was initially thought to be contained by checking imported wood products. However, it was discovered that the beetles were being carried by winds across the English Channel. Scientists claim the UK has eradicated the beetle from at-risk areas in the east and southeast. Climate change, however, could make the job even harder in the future, requiring continued vigilance and innovative strategies.</p>
