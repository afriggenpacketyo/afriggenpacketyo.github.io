          <h2>Market Analyst Argues Strong Earnings and Economic Policies Support Stocks Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 20:14:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A market analyst challenges the notion that upcoming tariff deadlines will harm highly valued stocks, arguing that the market is buoyed by stronger fundamental factors. The article points to a strong earnings season, numerous consumer-friendly provisions in President Trump's proposed tax bill, and significant business tax relief as key drivers for economic optimism. Additional factors cited include massive infrastructure spending on data centers and the grid, relaxed bank lending rules, and a pro-business M&A environment, suggesting a potential boom despite trade tensions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shenzhen-based quantum computing company SpinQ, founded in 2018, anticipates that the technology will cross a critical threshold of practical usefulness within the next five years. The company currently produces both small-scale quantum computers for educational purposes and more powerful industrial-grade systems, which it sells to over 50 countries. SpinQ's founder, Xiang Jingen, tempers this optimism by comparing the current state of quantum technology to the semiconductor industry in the 1950s, highlighting that significant development is still required before it becomes broadly applicable and accessible.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American golfer Scottie Scheffler won his first British Open championship, finishing four strokes ahead of the competition at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland. The victory marks the 29-year-old's second major tournament win of 2025 and his fourth major overall, placing him in an elite group with Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, and Tiger Woods as the only players to achieve this before age 30. This win solidifies his position as the world's number one golfer and leaves him only needing a U.S. Open title to complete the career Grand Slam.</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly reduced the number of individuals listed as missing following devastating holiday weekend floods, from approximately 100 down to just three. This sharp decrease is attributed to extensive follow-up work by local, state, and federal agencies who verified that many people initially reported missing were safe. Recovery efforts are still ongoing along the Guadalupe River watershed, where the flash floods killed at least 135 people. The Texas Legislature is set to review the state's response and consider improving flood warning systems.</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed it will hold a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The clash, which occurred on June 18, 1984, involved thousands of police officers and striking miners outside a coking plant in Rotherham. The inquiry will examine the events of the day and their aftermath, including the failed prosecution of 95 miners amid allegations of falsified police evidence. Campaigners, who have sought an inquiry for over a decade, expressed cautious elation at the announcement.</p>

          <p>Once overshadowed by tequila, artisanal mezcal is experiencing a production boom, becoming a half-billion-dollar-a-year industry. The spirit, primarily produced in Oaxaca, Mexico, is crafted by family-owned distilleries using traditional, labor-intensive methods passed down through generations. This article highlights the story of the Hernandez brothers, fourth-generation mezcaleros who, after migrating to the U.S. for work, returned to Mexico to expand their family's distillery. Their success, in partnership with the brand Ilegal, reflects the spirit's journey from a local tradition to a premium global commodity.</p>

While its potential to personalize education is significant, the tool is still a work in progress. A unique safety feature can also flag conversations where students may be in emotional distress, alerting educators to intervene when necessary.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler's victory at The Open has solidified his status as the most dominant force in men's golf since the peak of Tiger Woods, drawing frequent comparisons from his peers. The 29-year-old has won four major championships and 13 PGA Tour titles in the last four seasons, showcasing a machine-like consistency. While his swing is unorthodox, his mental fortitude and ruthless ability to close out tournaments are reminiscent of Woods. A key turning point was improving his putting in late 2023 by adopting a claw grip, transforming a previous weakness into a strength.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert argues that the single most important skill to teach a child for lifelong success is "self-connection"—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and needs. The article suggests that common parenting phrases like "you're fine" can inadvertently teach children to distrust their feelings, leading to insecurity and anxiety. To foster this skill, parents are advised to validate their child's emotions, allow space for them to make choices, and model their own emotional regulation. This approach builds resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence from within.</p>

The new consumer champion will have legal powers to protect customers in disputes with water companies. This reform comes as the Environment Secretary described the current sector as "broken" and its regulator, Ofwat, as "clearly failing," vowing to halve sewage spills by 2030.</p>
