          <p>According to a new biography by Amy Odell, Gwyneth Paltrow had reservations about her relationship with Brad Pitt in the 1990s, believing she was more sophisticated and better educated. The book claims that despite her father and friends adoring Pitt, Paltrow expressed doubts, feeling his Missouri upbringing was a world apart from her own in Manhattan. The author cites Paltrow's own past comments about having to explain different types of caviar to Pitt as an example of their differing backgrounds.</p>

          <p>Following mounting public and political pressure, President Trump has requested the Department of Justice to seek the release of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein. Attorney General Pam Bondi subsequently filed a motion in federal court to unseal the transcripts, citing significant public interest. This move comes as Trump continues to distance himself from Epstein and has filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal over a report about a letter he allegedly sent to the financier.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced that Kyiv formally proposed a new round of peace talks with Moscow, suggesting they be held next week to increase momentum toward a ceasefire. This diplomatic initiative comes alongside other international developments, including Australia's delivery of M1A1 Abrams tanks to aid Ukraine's defense. Concurrently, Kyiv has accused Russia of "weaponizing" deportations by abandoning former Ukrainian prisoners in Georgia without proper identification after they served their sentences in Russia.</p>

          <p>A.P. Deauville has issued a voluntary recall for more than 67,000 cases of its Power Stick brand roll-on antiperspirant deodorant. The recall, posted by the FDA, affects three different scents sold at major retailers like Walmart, Amazon, and Dollar Tree. The reason cited is a deviation from the FDA's Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations. The company has provided specific lot numbers for consumers to identify the affected products, which should be discarded or returned.</p>

          <p>Major champions Bryson DeChambeau and Henrik Stenson have voiced criticism over the R&A's inconsistent enforcement of slow-play rules at the Open Championship. Both golfers were warned about their pace during the third round, despite play being significantly faster than in the opening rounds, which took nearly six hours. Stenson called the approach "inconsistent," while DeChambeau argued for a simpler, more transparent system that times every player for every shot. The complaints highlight ongoing frustrations among professional golfers regarding the management of pace of play in major tournaments.</p>

Instead, he advises people to find the intersection of what they are good at and what can be lucrative. Galloway emphasizes that success often comes from enduring rejection and being able to pivot, rather than blindly pursuing a passion. This sentiment is echoed by other leaders, who suggest a more practical approach of combining one's strengths with real-world opportunities to build a successful career.</p>
