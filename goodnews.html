          <p>The United States and China have announced a preliminary agreement to de-escalate trade tensions by cutting reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, effective Wednesday. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated the move was to avoid a decoupling of the two economies, with both sides agreeing to lower tariffs to 10%. The agreement also involves establishing a mechanism for continued discussions on economic and trade relations. The goal is to establish a more balanced trade relationship and increase access for U.S. goods in China, with future talks potentially occurring in China, the U.S., or a third country.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to a 90-day suspension of tariff increases, temporarily reducing tariffs while continuing negotiations to resolve their trade war. The agreement, announced after talks in Geneva, will see the U.S. reducing tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% and China lowering tariffs on American goods to 10%. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized the shared interest in avoiding economic decoupling. While this temporary reprieve is welcomed by businesses, lingering repercussions are expected, including potential surges in transport prices due to pent-up demand.</p>

          <p>Representative Ritchie Torres is calling for an ethics investigation into President Trump's potential acceptance of a $400 million jet from Qatar, which would be used temporarily as Air Force One and later donated to Trump's presidential library. Torres argues that this violates the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits public officials from accepting gifts from foreign states. Trump defended the deal, stating it would be a "gift" to the Defense Department, but the arrangement raises questions about maintenance costs and potential conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering accepting a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet from the Qatari royal family for use as Air Force One, potentially to be transferred to his presidential library upon leaving office.

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has expressed reservations about using deficit-covering government bonds to finance economic measures designed to mitigate the impact of U.S. tariffs and persistent inflation.

This statement reflects a cautious approach to fiscal policy amid global economic uncertainties and domestic monetary adjustments.

          <p>The contested North Carolina state supreme court race, which took nearly six months to resolve, has exposed a potential strategy for candidates to retroactively challenge election results, according to observers. Despite Democrat Allison Riggs winning by 734 votes, Republican Jefferson Griffin aggressively sought to invalidate 65,000 votes. Although a federal judge halted the effort, the state court's initial acceptance of the challenge could encourage similar attempts in future elections. While the federal court's intervention provided some reassurance, the episode has raised concerns about the vulnerability of elections to partisan challenges.</p>

          <p>Cognitive neuroscientist Leor Zmigrod, author of "The Ideological Brain," argues that political beliefs are not just abstract ideas but are also neurological signatures ingrained in our brains. Zmigrod's research suggests that ideology involves both a fixed doctrine resistant to evidence and a rigid identity that influences judgment. Cognitive rigidity, tested through unconscious assessments, can predict aversion to pluralism and debate. While extreme rigidity can be detrimental, principled thinking involves updating beliefs based on credible evidence, distinguishing it from dogmatic thinking.</p>

          <p>Studies of wild chimpanzees have uncovered rhythmic structures and call combinations in their communication, suggesting insights into the origins of human language. Researchers found that chimpanzee drumming patterns vary by population, similar to regional accents, and that call combinations can alter meaning. These findings support the idea that key elements of human language, such as rhythm and combined vocal sounds, may have evolved from primate communication strategies. This adds to the understanding of how early humans may have developed language.</p>
