          <p>Factorial Energy, a Massachusetts start-up led by Siyu Huang, is developing solid-state batteries that could make electric vehicles cheaper and more convenient than conventional cars. The company has partnered with Mercedes-Benz, which successfully tested Factorial's battery in a car, marking a significant milestone. Solid-state batteries promise faster charging times, longer ranges, and improved safety compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries. While many companies are working on this technology, Factorial's progress with Mercedes is a promising step towards commercial viability, though challenges remain in mass production and durability.</p>

          <p>Epic Games has resubmitted Fortnite to Apple's App Store following a court ruling that favored Epic in a contempt ruling. The game was removed in 2020 after Epic circumvented Apple's commission fees, leading to a lengthy legal battle. The recent ruling prevents Apple from charging commissions on link-outs, paving the way for Fortnite's potential return. Apple is appealing the ruling, and could still reject Fortnite's submission, continuing the ongoing dispute between the two companies.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved the first at-home cervical cancer screening test, developed by Teal Health, offering a more accessible alternative to traditional Pap smears. This test allows women to collect a vaginal sample at home and mail it in for HPV testing, potentially increasing screening rates, especially for those who face barriers to in-person appointments. If the test is positive, follow-up with a healthcare provider is necessary for further evaluation. The approval is expected to improve early detection and prevention of cervical cancer, a disease that is largely preventable through vaccination and screening.</p>

          <p>With gold prices soaring, investors may find it challenging to enter the market, but there are still options to consider. One-gram gold bars offer a lower entry point, while gold ETFs allow investment in fractions of an ounce. Fractional gold coins provide physical ownership at a more accessible price. While considering these options, it's important to remember traditional gold investing advice of limiting it to 10% or less of your portfolio. These strategies enable investors to benefit from gold's traditional hedges against inflation and portfolio diversification without paying today's high prices (not investment advice).</p>
