          <p>Shares of Ray-Ban manufacturer EssilorLuxottica jumped nearly 6% following reports that Meta has acquired a minority stake valued at approximately €3 billion. This move signals Meta's deepening commitment to AI-powered wearable technology, a key priority for CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The two companies previously partnered on Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which integrate Meta's AI assistant and have sold two million pairs since late 2023. The investment could pave the way for expanded production and the release of new AI-equipped glasses under the Oakley and Prada brands. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German police have detained a 27-year-old man and conducted raids across six properties in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia as part of an anti-terror operation. The investigation initially focused on organized commercial fraud but uncovered evidence that the proceeds were intended to finance an Islamist terrorist attack. The suspect, a Bosnian-Herzegovinian citizen, allegedly resold expensive electronics that he had ordered but not paid for to generate funds for the plot. Officials stated the raids were aimed at preventing the attack and clarifying the circumstances surrounding the plan.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is preparing for its third heatwave of the summer, with temperatures forecast to reach as high as 34°C (93°F) over the weekend. Yellow heat health alerts have been issued for central, southern, and eastern England, warning of potential impacts on vulnerable individuals and healthcare services. This spell of hot weather is expected to be the most widespread of the year, affecting all four nations. The heat is driven by an area of high pressure and will be accompanied by dry conditions, adding to concerns over water shortages and potential hosepipe bans.</p>

          <p>Tennis has experienced a significant surge in popularity, with participation reaching record highs in the United States. While modern tennis is a global professional sport, its origins trace back to a 12th-century French game played with the palm of the hand. The sport evolved into "lawn tennis" in 18th-century Britain, becoming a pastime for the privileged classes. The most significant transformation occurred in 1968 with the dawn of the "Open Era," which professionalized the sport, introduced prize money, and opened it up to a more diverse range of athletes, including women and racial minorities.</p>

          <h2>Minnesota United Finds Success with Aggressive and Unconventional Set Piece Tactics</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Minnesota United FC has become one of the most aggressive set piece teams in global soccer, finding a competitive edge through unconventional tactics. Under first-time head coach Eric Ramsay, the team frequently uses long throw-ins and deep free kicks to put the ball directly into the opponent's penalty area, bypassing traditional midfield play. This data-supported strategy, reminiscent of tactics used by teams like Brentford, has proven highly effective, with these plays contributing to nearly a third of the team's goals. The low-budget club's success with this approach demonstrates how analytical insights can help teams over-perform.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of Senate Democrats is introducing a bill to create a new, independent inspector general position specifically to oversee the Executive Office of the President. The legislation aims to establish a permanent watchdog to root out fraud, abuse, and misconduct within the White House, regardless of which party is in power. Proponents, including Senator Adam Schiff, argue that this check on executive power is long overdue and would ensure no administration is above the law. The move comes amid ongoing criticism of the Trump administration's alleged conflicts of interest and the recent firing of several federal inspectors general.</p>

          <p>Midfielder Diego Luna has emerged as a breakout star for the U.S. men's national soccer team, injecting new energy and spirit ahead of next year's World Cup. The 21-year-old's pivotal moment came during a friendly match in January when he insisted on playing after breaking his nose, demonstrating a grit that won praise from coach Mauricio Pochettino. His performance during the Gold Cup, where he scored three goals, has solidified his case for a spot on the World Cup roster. Luna's rise is seen as a key part of the team's effort to reignite its competitive fire.</p>

          <p>Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky has established himself as a prominent Republican rebel, frequently defying President Trump's agenda from a libertarian standpoint. Despite representing a staunchly pro-Trump district, Massie has opposed the president on issues like deficit spending and presidential power, drawing public condemnation from Trump. However, Massie remains confident, buoyed by a strong local following of "Liberty Republicans" and a successful online fundraising model that makes him less vulnerable to establishment pressure. His defiant stance offers a potential roadmap for other conservatives to challenge Trump's policies while retaining voter support.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has temporarily removed its online list of unclaimed estates, known as Bona Vacantia, from public view. This action follows a BBC investigation that uncovered evidence of a criminal gang allegedly using the list to commit fraud worth millions of pounds. The criminals were reportedly creating fake wills for deceased individuals on the list to fraudulently inherit their money and property. While lawyers have welcomed the removal of the list to prevent further fraud, they argue that more robust checks are needed to protect the probate system.</p>

          <p>Seven of Britain's largest housebuilding firms have agreed to pay £100 million towards affordable housing to resolve an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The regulator was investigating whether the companies had illegally shared commercially sensitive information, such as sales prices and buyer incentives, which could have inflated house prices. By accepting this settlement, the CMA will not have to make a final decision on whether the law was broken. The housebuilders maintain that the payment is not an admission of wrongdoing.

          <p>South Korea has repatriated six North Korean fishermen who were rescued after their boats drifted across the maritime border earlier this year. Seoul's Ministry of Unification confirmed that the men had repeatedly expressed a desire to return to North Korea and were sent back with their full consent. Four of the men were rescued in May, while the other two were found in March under similar circumstances. This event occurs as South Korean President Lee Jae Myung pursues a less hawkish approach and seeks dialogue with Pyongyang, in contrast to his predecessor.</p>
