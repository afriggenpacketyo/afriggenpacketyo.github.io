          <p>Nvidia's recent earnings report showcased strong performance, surpassing analyst expectations for both earnings per share and revenue. A key driver of this success was the company's data center business, which experienced substantial year-over-year growth. Despite anticipating $45 billion in sales for the current quarter, Nvidia acknowledged that sales would have been higher if not for export restrictions on China-bound H20 chips. Overall revenue increased significantly, fueled by the demand for AI chips used in applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT, while the gaming division also saw considerable growth, solidifying Nvidia's position as a leader in both AI and gaming technologies.

          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch's shares soared despite the retailer slashing its profit outlook due to expected tariff impacts of $50 million.

However, the stock closed significantly higher after Abercrombie reported fiscal first-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations for both earnings and revenue. The company is working to diversify its sourcing network and reduce expenses to offset the duties and maintain profits, while avoiding broad-based price increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Kseniia Petrova, a Russian scientist employed by Harvard University, in an immigration case related to her failure to declare scientific samples she was carrying into the country. The judge cited a lack of legal basis for the immigration officer's actions in revoking Petrova's visa and expressed concern for her safety if deported to Russia. Petrova's case has drawn attention from the Trump administration, which unsealed felony smuggling charges against her after the judge initially indicated plans to release her.

          <p>Experts suggest that June 2025 could be an opportune time to consolidate credit card debt due to several economic factors. With credit card interest rates expected to remain high and rates on alternative borrowing products potentially falling, consolidating debt could be advantageous. Additionally, the compounding nature of credit card interest makes timely action crucial to avoid a growing debt burden. Options such as home equity loans, HELOCs, and debt consolidation loans should be considered to reduce interest costs and accelerate principal payments. (not investment advice)</p>
