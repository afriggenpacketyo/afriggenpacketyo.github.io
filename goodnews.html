          <p>According to Bank of America, global investors are shifting capital away from U.S. equities for the first time in a decade, drawn by Asia's burgeoning artificial intelligence sector and the prospect of easier U.S. monetary policy. A weakening dollar is prompting diversification, with significant inflows now directed towards Asian equity and debt funds. The Asian AI market is projected to grow substantially, offering valuable opportunities and more attractive valuations compared to expensive U.S. stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a victory over the New York Jets, Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin used a bizarre metaphor to praise kicker Chris Boswell's clutch performance. Tomlin described Boswell as a "serial killer" due to his calm demeanor and low pulse rate under pressure, particularly after Boswell successfully kicked a 60-yard field goal. Boswell has been a consistently reliable kicker for the team, earning his first All-Pro selection last season.</p>

          <p>The California Republican Party has found a unifying cause in its opposition to Proposition 50, a special election ballot measure proposed by Democrats to redraw the state's congressional districts. At their fall convention, party members were energized by the fight against what they see as a Democratic power grab, which could cost the GOP up to five seats in the U.S. House. This issue has temporarily brought together fractious elements within the party, focusing their efforts on defeating the measure at the ballot box in November.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Ian Goldin, a professor of globalization at the University of Oxford, globalization is far from dead and is, in fact, "alive and well" in Asia. He argues that the region's rapid economic growth and poverty reduction are direct results of its integration into the global economy. While acknowledging that globalization is becoming more fragmented, Goldin notes its center of gravity is shifting towards Asia as the U.S. partially withdraws, emphasizing the importance of continued global integration for other continents.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Hong Kong is experiencing a significant resurgence, with tourism and business travel returning and its IPO market roaring back to life. The city appears to be benefiting from its unique "one country, two systems" status, allowing it to host events and embrace financial experiments like cryptocurrency that are not possible on the mainland. To capitalize on this momentum, the author suggests Beijing should encourage more international engagement and support the city's role as a base for multilateral institutions.</p>

The forecast calls for temperatures to be 5 to 15 degrees below normal, disappointing Bay Area residents who just endured their coldest summer in decades. This unusual weather pattern for September, typically one of the state's hottest months, is caused by a low-pressure system moving in from the Pacific Ocean.</p>
