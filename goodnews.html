          <p>Missouri Republican Representative Mark Alford is notably holding 15 town halls over four days, defying a trend of GOP lawmakers avoiding such public forums. A former journalist, Alford embraces these sessions as listening opportunities to connect with constituents and understand their concerns, even engaging in respectful debate. Attendees questioned him on issues like halted federal funding for solar projects and staffing shortages at VA hospitals, prompting Alford to promise direct assistance. This approach aims to demonstrate accountability and responsiveness, though the congressman also faces questions regarding his relationship with former President Trump and the potential impact of mid-decade redistricting on his district.</p>

          <p>Shares of Canada Goose, the luxury winter-clothing manufacturer, saw an over 7% rise in premarket trading following news that its controlling shareholder, Bain Capital, has received bids to take the company private. Private equity firms Boyu Capital and Advent International have reportedly submitted verbal offers, valuing the company at around $1.35 billion, calculated at eight times its 12-month average earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Bain Capital, advised by Goldman Sachs, is reportedly holding off on a decision to await more offers. This potential privatization could significantly alter the company's trajectory and valuation.

          <p>Grrlspot, a thriving monthly pop-up event for queer women in New Orleans, was established in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 to foster community and connection. Founder Jenna Jordan's initiative grew from modest gatherings into large dance parties, addressing the significant decline of lesbian bars across the United States, including the closure of New Orleans' last dedicated venue in 2012. These events, often likened to a "gay Mardi Gras," offer a vibrant and safe space for lesbians and trans women to celebrate. Grrlspot exemplifies community resilience and the persistent demand for inclusive queer spaces, particularly in a city impacted by displacement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage demand and interest rates have remained largely unchanged for the second consecutive week, with total application volume seeing a slight 0.5% dip. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages held steady at 6.69%. While refinance applications fell, purchase applications rose by 2%, marking the strongest week for purchase demand in a month, despite overall low levels. This indicates that prospective buyers are becoming less sensitive to current rates, bolstered by more inventory and cooling home-price growth. The market has shown a muted reaction to recent political developments, including former President Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Argentine police have raided a villa in Mar del Plata, searching for "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Vittore Ghislandi, a 17th-century Italian painting believed to have been looted by Nazis. The artwork, originally owned by a Dutch Jewish art dealer, was reportedly bought by Hermann Göring and later came into the possession of Friedrich Kadgien, a Nazi fugitive who settled in Argentina. The painting was recently spotted in an online real estate ad for a home linked to Kadgien's descendants. While the painting was not found during the raid, other items were seized, highlighting Argentina's complex history with Nazi fugitives and ongoing restitution efforts.</p>

          <p>Chinese semiconductor firm Cambricon has reported a record-breaking first half, with revenue surging over 4,000% year-on-year to 2.88 billion Chinese yuan ($402.7 million) and net profit reaching 1.04 billion yuan. This impressive growth underscores the company's emergence as a significant challenger to American giant Nvidia in providing chips for artificial intelligence applications, amidst Beijing's push for domestic industry and continuous threats of US tech restrictions. Despite the substantial growth, Cambricon's figures remain small compared to Nvidia's, and the Chinese firm faces ongoing obstacles in technology advancement due to export controls on advanced chipmaking techniques.

          <p>Crystal Palace has reportedly secured an agreement in principle with Villarreal for the transfer of Spanish winger Yeremy Pino, in a deal potentially worth up to £26 million. The 22-year-old is understood to be amenable to joining Selhurst Park and is anticipated to complete his medical in the coming days. Villarreal decided to accept Palace's offer given that Pino has under two years left on his current contract, despite his £69 million release clause. This move comes after Crystal Palace's talisman, Eberechi Eze, transferred to Arsenal for £60 million, signaling the club's intent to reinforce its squad before the transfer window closes.</p>

          <p>A Utah district court has ordered the state to redraw its congressional map by September 24, thrusting it into a national redistricting battle. The current map, adopted by the Republican-controlled legislature in 2021, divided Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County among all four districts, diluting Democratic votes. The ruling found the legislature circumvented a voter-approved independent redistricting commission, a practice known as gerrymandering. This decision could make one of Utah’s four congressional seats competitive for Democrats, challenging the Republican party’s slim House majority and countering former President Trump's push for GOP-favorable maps in other states.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study challenges decades of research by showing that the brain's representation of a lost limb remains intact, even years after amputation. Researchers used MRI scans on individuals before and after arm amputations, finding that the "phantom hand representation" in the somatosensory cortex was similar to the pre-amputated state. This finding contradicts earlier theories of significant brain reorganization post-amputation and offers hope for advancements in brain-computer interfaces, which rely on stable neural circuits. The article also suggests that phantom limb pain might stem from the brain's continued expectation of signals from the missing limb.</p>

          <p>Bill Anderson, a 95-year-old retired watchmaker, spent decades investigating whether a Chelsea Comet clock engraved with "J.F.K." once belonged to President John F. Kennedy. His extensive search involved consulting fellow collectors, the JFK Presidential Library, and ultimately led to a high-resolution photograph from a secure archive. The photo, taken in 1954, clearly showed a similar clock on Kennedy's desk, but the engraving was absent. Anderson expressed no disappointment, realizing the "hunt" itself had become profoundly meaningful, especially after his wife's passing, highlighting the intrinsic value of passion and pursuit beyond the outcome.</p>
