          <p>China is rapidly advancing its deep space exploration program, posing a significant challenge to the long-held leadership of the United States. With plans to land astronauts on the moon before 2030, China is developing key hardware like the Mengzhou crew capsule and the Long March-10 rocket. While NASA's Artemis program officially targets an earlier 2027 moon landing, it faces significant technical challenges, including the untested in-orbit refueling of its lunar lander. This escalating space race highlights the shifting dynamics of global technological and geopolitical power, with major implications for future lunar and Martian exploration.</p>

          <p>A transgender author reflects on the current paradoxical climate for trans people, where increased visibility coexists with a surge in hostile legislation and rhetoric. Recounting her own journey of coming to terms with her identity and transitioning later in life, she argues against the notion that delaying gender-affirming care is beneficial, framing it as survivorship bias. The writer compares skepticism towards trans care to the doubt-sowing tactics used against climate science. She posits that greater acceptance, particularly social transition for youth, allows for exploration and ultimately leads to more fulfilling lives for trans individuals.</p>

          <p>A growing number of singles, particularly from Gen Z, are using artificial intelligence dating assistants to improve their online dating experiences. Apps like Rizz and Keepler offer services that suggest replies, help write profiles, and even craft gentle rejection messages to avoid "ghosting." Proponents argue these tools boost confidence and provide objective advice for those who struggle with writing or initiating conversations. While the trend raises questions about authenticity, users often see it as a way to start a conversation before letting their own personality take over, supplementing rather than replacing human connection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A sex therapist and psychotherapist outlines four common but often overlooked factors that can damage intimacy in a relationship. These "intimacy blockers" include the constant distraction of phones, unresolved emotional attachments to an ex-partner, a persistent negativity bias that leads to self-rejection, and the physiological effects of stress. The author emphasizes that intimacy is more than just physical and is essential for a thriving partnership. She offers practical advice for couples to address these issues, such as setting screen-free boundaries, processing past relationships, and challenging negative thought patterns to foster deeper connection.</p>

          <p>Successfully negotiating a higher salary is a process that takes time and strategy, not a single conversation, according to negotiation expert Kathryn Valentine. She advises that the initial meeting should aim to start the dialogue, not to secure a final deal. It's crucial to time the request well, such as during a mid-year check-in rather than an annual review when budgets are already set. After the first discussion, one should solidify a time for a follow-up meeting and send a summary email to maintain momentum. This patient, collaborative approach is more likely to yield the desired results.</p>

          <p>On the first anniversary of the near-assassination of Donald Trump, friends and aides report seeing subtle changes in the President. While his core personality remains, some allies, like Senator Lindsey Graham, describe him as more attentive and appreciative. Trump himself speaks openly about his belief that he was saved by divine intervention to serve a second term and has surrounded himself with memorabilia from the event. The attack profoundly impacted the 2024 campaign, and those close to Trump believe it reinforced his sense of purpose and deepened his connection with his supporters.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has acquired a 9.01% stake in Tripadvisor, intending to engage with management on strategies to unlock shareholder value. The travel platform, which owns Tripadvisor.com, Viator, and TheFork, is seen as undervalued despite its market-leading positions. Starboard's potential strategies could include improving operational efficiency, focusing on profitability, or a strategic sale of one or more of its business segments. Given recent shareholder discontent with some board members and multiple past acquisition offers for the company, Starboard's involvement is likely to intensify scrutiny and could lead to significant changes.

          <p>The British and Irish Lions secured a commanding 48-0 victory against the Australia and New Zealand Invitational XV in their final warm-up match before the first Test against the Wallabies. Winger Duhan van der Merwe was a standout performer, scoring a hat-trick as the Lions ran in eight unanswered tries in Adelaide. The match also saw the return of Owen Farrell as a second-half substitute. Despite the dominant performance, the team suffered a setback with a head injury to center Garry Ringrose, ruling him out of the upcoming Test, and a knee injury to hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering an authorization of new funding for Ukraine, a potential policy shift that would be the first of its kind since he took office. According to diplomatic sources, the move could be a signal to Russia following its recent wave of intense aerial assaults on Ukrainian cities. This follows recent comments from President Trump expressing disappointment with Vladimir Putin and suggesting more defensive weapons could be sent. The administration has access to billions in leftover presidential drawdown authority and could also potentially use seized Russian assets to aid Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Josh Earnest, who served as White House press secretary during Barack Obama's second term, recently described the day after Donald Trump's 2016 election win as his hardest on the job. He recalled the challenge of reconciling the administration's campaign warnings about Trump with the constitutional duty of a peaceful transfer of power. Earnest shared a poignant memory of a visibly demoralized communications staff being summoned to the Oval Office, where President Obama gave them an early, impromptu version of his public speech urging unity and reminding them that "we're all on one team."</p>

          <p>After 13-year-old Micah Clayborne complained of chest pains, his mother, who has a history of severe cardiac issues, rushed him to a cardiologist. He was diagnosed with Danon disease, an extremely rare genetic condition affecting only about 300 families worldwide, which was also found to be the cause of his mother's heart problems. With his heart functioning at just 7%, Micah required a transplant. Now recovering, Micah and his mother have launched "Transplant Teenz," a non-profit virtual community to provide the support for teenagers awaiting transplants that he felt was missing during his own journey.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay advocates for allowing children more freedom for unstructured, animal-like play, arguing that modern society over-regulates childhood movement to their detriment. The author posits that free play, like climbing trees or wrestling, is crucial for developing "movement quality" and building physical robustness that prevents injuries later in life. Citing injury-prevention expert Marcus Elliott, the article suggests that fear of minor injuries deprives kids of the chance to develop a broad "movement vocabulary." It encourages parents to embrace a degree of chaos and provide children with opportunities for physical exploration and problem-solving.</p>

          <p>In her new book "Rich Girl Nation," author Katie Gatti Tassin argues that the recurring costs of maintaining an "acceptable feminine appearance" act as a significant and often overlooked financial hurdle for women. She describes this cycle of spending on hair, nails, and skincare as a "hot girl hamster wheel," where each expense commits a woman to future spending on a depreciating asset. Tassin suggests women perform a "hot girl detox" by annualizing these costs and experimenting with cutting them out to reclaim money, time, and mental energy that can be redirected toward paying off debt, saving, or investing.</p>
