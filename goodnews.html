          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that trade negotiations with the U.S. have resumed after his government rescinded a planned digital services tax on technology firms. The move came after U.S. President Donald Trump suspended talks, calling the tax a "blatant attack" on the country. The 3% tax would have affected companies like Google and Amazon and applied retroactively, creating a significant liability. While the decision paves the way for further negotiations on tariffs and a new economic relationship, some analysts view it as a concession that makes the Canadian government appear vulnerable to U.S. pressure.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has described China's decision to partially lift its blanket ban on Japanese seafood imports as a positive development. The ban was implemented in August 2023 following the release of treated water from the Fukushima nuclear plant. However, the prohibition remains in effect for seafood from ten prefectures, including Fukushima. A Japanese government spokesman stated that they will continue to strongly urge China to remove the remaining restrictions, seeking a complete normalization of seafood trade between the two nations.</p>

          <p>According to sources familiar with the matter, China is planning to invite U.S. President Donald Trump to a major military parade in Beijing on September 3rd. The event is intended to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. This development comes as the United States has reportedly proposed that Chinese President Xi Jinping visit the U.S. during the same month, coinciding with the U.N. General Assembly meeting. The potential for reciprocal high-level visits suggests a complex diplomatic dance between the two global powers amidst ongoing trade and geopolitical tensions.</p>

He was freed as part of a deal following a rare visit to Minsk by a senior U.S. delegation. In his first interview, a visibly transformed Tikhanovsky described the psychological toll of his isolation but insisted his spirit was not broken. His arrest in 2020 for challenging dictator Alexander Lukashenko led his wife, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, to run for president in his place, sparking mass protests and her emergence as the leader of the Belarusian opposition in exile.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has stated in an interview that he has assembled a group of "very wealthy people" who are prepared to purchase the U.S. operations of TikTok. This comes as the social media platform's Chinese owner, ByteDance, faces a U.S. law requiring it to divest or face a ban due to national security concerns. Trump, who has extended the divestiture deadline to September 17, indicated that any deal would likely require approval from Beijing, but expressed optimism that Chinese President Xi Jinping would agree.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers are now studying. Studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs are a primary cause. In particular, the regenerative braking systems, which convert kinetic energy back into electrical energy to charge the battery, result in a low-frequency deceleration that can provoke queasiness. Researchers are exploring solutions, including auditory cues and adjustments to vehicle dynamics, to mitigate the effect and improve passenger comfort in the new generation of automobiles.</p>
