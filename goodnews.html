        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Beijing has reportedly offered tax refunds to major French cognac producers, including Hennessy and Martell, as an anti-dumping investigation into European brandy nears its conclusion. To receive the refund, companies must agree to a minimum selling price and commit to fair trade practices, according to an anonymous source. The move comes as a potential resolution to a trade dispute that could see temporary tariffs of up to 39% become permanent if no agreement is reached.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a comprehensive review of the parental leave and pay system, which has not been significantly reformed in decades. The review will examine maternity, paternity, and shared parental leave, aiming to modernize a system critics call confusing and one of the least generous in the developed world. With low take-up rates for paternity and shared leave often attributed to affordability, the 18-month review seeks to create a system that better supports modern working families.</p>

          <p>Philip Lane, the chief economist for the European Central Bank, stated that the institution's recent cycle of monetary policy interventions to control inflation is now "done." He clarified that the primary task of bringing inflation down from its peak has been accomplished, with the May rate hitting 1.9%. While the ECB has successfully removed past price shocks from the system, Lane cautioned that the bank must remain prepared to address new shocks and potential cyclical movements to maintain medium-term stability.

          <p>Scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have developed a new framework using satellite remote sensing data to more accurately monitor carbon dioxide emissions from individual power plants. The study, published in a peer-reviewed journal, offers a high-precision, standardized methodology that could improve global carbon accounting, which currently lacks such a system. Researchers state this technology has significant potential for tracking emissions from coal plants and could also be applied to other industrial sources like oil and gas fields.</p>
