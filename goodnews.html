        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce an interest rate cut in September, experts suggest the immediate effect on mortgage rates could be muted. The anticipated reduction is a modest 25 basis points, a smaller cut than previous ones that caused more significant rate drops. Furthermore, many lenders may have already priced this expected cut into their current mortgage offers, meaning borrowers might not see a substantial change right after the official announcement.

          <p>A cryptocurrency token backed by the Trump family, known as WLFI, has begun public trading, valuing the holdings of the president and his sons at around $5 billion. The family's firm, World Liberty Financial, launched during the presidential campaign, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Despite a significant price drop since trading began, the token's value remains higher than the initial purchase price for many early investors, and financial disclosures indicate crypto is now the most significant source of Trump's personal fortune.

          <p>Walmart is enhancing its Walmart+ subscription service by adding NBCUniversal's Peacock as a streaming option, in a direct move to compete with Amazon Prime. Starting September 15, members can choose between ad-supported versions of Peacock Premium or Paramount+ as part of their existing membership, with the ability to switch between the two every 90 days. This strategy aims to add more value to the $98 annual plan without increasing its price, appealing to consumers navigating a crowded streaming market.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's recent acquisitions, including the over $18 billion purchase of SRS Distribution, are part of a strategic push to capture a larger share of the professional contractor market. A key component of this strategy is the expansion of its trade credit program, which allows contractors to buy supplies and pay for them later, acting as both an advisor and a financier. This "hidden gem" is seen as a crucial tool for attracting "complex pro" customers working on larger, high-value projects. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are pointing to a "golden opportunity" for investors to potentially pay a 0% tax rate on long-term capital gains, thanks to new deductions in President Trump's recent tax legislation. The 0% bracket applies to individuals with taxable income below certain thresholds, which more investors may now fall into due to a higher standard deduction and other new tax breaks. This allows for strategies like "tax-gain harvesting," where profitable assets are sold without triggering taxes during lower-income years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>To combat financial pressures and avoid closures or buyouts by large health systems, independent rural hospitals across the U.S. are joining "clinically integrated networks." These collaborations allow small hospitals to pool their resources and patient populations to negotiate better prices for services like mobile MRI units and to secure value-based care contracts with insurers. By banding together, these hospitals can maintain their local autonomy while saving money and expanding the services they offer to their communities.</p>
