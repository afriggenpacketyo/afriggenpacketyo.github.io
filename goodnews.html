        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chelsea's recent FA Cup win and continued investment in the team under manager Bompastor suggest they are only going to get better. They are still chasing an elusive maiden Champions League trophy. Manchester United are one of those chasing, and manager Skinner knows they cannot compete financially. Skinner's plea for more investment is supported by Bompastor, who said Chelsea will only improve on the European stage if they are pushed by others in England. </p>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies closer Jos√© Alvarado has been suspended for 80 games after testing positive for external testosterone under Major League Baseball‚Äôs drug-testing program. The team's president said the positive test was caused by a weight loss drug Alvarado took during the offseason. The suspension means Alvarado will be ineligible for the postseason and will lose $4.5m of his $9m salary. The Phillies are now tasked with finding closing options among other team members. </p>
