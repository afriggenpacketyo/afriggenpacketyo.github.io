          <p>Michael Saylor's bitcoin treasury strategy, which significantly increased Strategy's market cap, is now being adopted by other companies, including meme stock firms and multinational conglomerates. Despite this growing interest, Wall Street remains skeptical of the trend. Trump Media and GameStop have announced plans to invest in bitcoin, while Tether, SoftBank, and Strike are launching a bitcoin-native public company called Twenty One. Saylor believes this marks a global shift in corporate finance, with bitcoin ambassadors planting the orange flag everywhere on earth. The Biden administration previously treated corporate bitcoin adoption as a regulatory red flag, but the Trump administration has established a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and rolled back guidance that discouraged bitcoin investments in retirement plans.

          <p>Doctors at the University of Maryland Medical Center successfully removed a tumor from a patient's spine through her eye in a first-of-its-kind surgery. Karla Flores was diagnosed with a second chordoma on her spine after an MRI revealed the tumor, and its location made traditional surgical approaches impossible. Dr. Mohammed Labib developed a unique surgical plan, approaching the tumor through Flores' eye, a technique he called the "third nostril" approach. The procedure involved removing part of Flores' eye socket and cheekbone to access the tumor, which was then carefully dissected and removed, and after rehabilitation therapy, Flores has no evidence of cancer. </p>
