          <p>Kelly Stafford, wife of Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, discussed the relationship between Bill Belichick and his girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, on her podcast, noting that Hudson's social media presence makes their personal life "fair game" for public scrutiny. This comes after Hudson interrupted an interview with Belichick to shut down a question about how the couple met, leading to accusations from Belichick that CBS created a "false narrative" with selectively edited clips. CBS responded by stating there were no preconditions or limitations to the interview, and the company disagreed with Belichick‚Äôs version of events. Hudson has posted numerous photos of Belichick on her social media accounts.</p>

          <p>Harvard President Alan Garber is fighting the Trump administration's efforts to cut federal funding while simultaneously addressing campus culture problems, including intolerance of differing viewpoints and unchecked antisemitism. Garber has vowed to defend Harvard against federal intrusion but acknowledges the need for reforms, such as changing student discipline policies and managing protests. He has also rolled back policies related to diversity and race, facing pushback from students who believe these changes prioritize optics over values. Garber's actions aim to preserve the integrity of the university and restore trust in academia amid growing skepticism about higher education.</p>

The company estimates $2.7 billion in annual synergies by 2027, stemming from expense savings and network benefits, with debit card volume expected to fully transition to the Discover network, providing a regulatory advantage by exempting it from swipe fee caps.</p>

          <p>New research reveals that domestication has led to cats and dogs evolving similar skull shapes, driven by human selection. Despite millions of years of evolutionary separation, selective breeding has caused some breeds to develop similar facial features, such as flat faces. This convergence, while appealing to human preferences for infant-like traits, often results in health problems for the animals, including breathing difficulties and neurological conditions. The findings highlight the powerful role humans play in shaping the evolution of domesticated species and the importance of considering animal welfare in breeding practices.</p>
