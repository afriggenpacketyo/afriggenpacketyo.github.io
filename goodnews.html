          <p>China and the European Union have scheduled a new round of trade talks to address their economic relationship before a high-level leaders' summit next month. The European Commission announced the talks after a meeting between China‚Äôs commerce minister and the EU trade chief in Paris. Both sides have expressed a desire to rebalance trade and level the playing field, but it remains to be seen whether they can resolve the existing economic deadlock. The talks aim to prepare for a summit in Beijing where European leaders will meet with President Xi Jinping to discuss pressing economic and trade issues. The current global economic climate necessitates these discussions, as both regions seek to stabilize and grow their economies.

          <p>Linda McMahon and Moms for Liberty rallied at the Supreme Court to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Pierce v. Society of Sisters, a case that affirmed parental control over children's education. The rally also highlighted anticipation for decisions in two key cases affecting parental rights. One case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, concerns parents' right to opt their children out of exposure to LGBTQ+ content in school, while the other, United States v. Skrmetti, addresses state restrictions on medical treatments for transgender minors. Speakers at the event emphasized the importance of parental involvement in education and advocated for legislation protecting children from certain medical interventions related to gender identity. The ongoing debates surrounding parental rights reflect broader cultural and political divisions over education and healthcare.</p>

Current national average CD yields range from 1.70% to 2.00%, but top CDs offer significantly higher rates, especially from online banks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Maria Foscarinis' book, *And Housing for All: The Fight to End Homelessness in America*, argues that housing should be recognized as a human right to address the homelessness crisis in the U.S. Foscarinis examines the origins and perpetuation of homelessness, emphasizing that it is a policy failure rather than a personal one. The book challenges the notion that homelessness is primarily driven by personal failings, highlighting systemic inequalities and bipartisan policy decisions that have contributed to the crisis. It advocates for the Housing First model and calls for enshrining the human right to housing in law to ensure effective interventions and lasting change, asserting that homelessness is a societal choice.</p>
