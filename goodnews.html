          <p>China has announced the mass production of a four-channel, single-photon detector, known as the "photon catcher," which is designed to detect individual photons. This ultra-low noise device is a key component in quantum communication and quantum radar technologies. It has potential applications in daily communications and national defense, including the detection and tracking of stealth aircraft. The device was developed by the Quantum Information Engineering Technology Research Centre in Anhui province, marking a significant advancement in quantum technology capabilities.</p>

          <p>NATO chief Mark Rutte made light of the condition of the Russian naval fleet, referring to a Russian submarine as "limping" home and joking about the search for the nearest mechanic. This followed reports of a diesel-powered submarine, Novorossiysk, surfacing off France, with Russian authorities claiming it was complying with navigation rules. Dutch authorities had previously reported the submarine was under tow in the North Sea. Rutte noted a diminished Russian naval presence in the Mediterranean, contrasting it with past naval power.</p>

          <p>SpaceX conducted its eleventh test flight of the Starship rocket, successfully completing a flight halfway around the world and releasing mock satellites. The booster made a controlled entry into the Gulf of Mexico, and the spacecraft descended into the Indian Ocean. This test included more maneuvering, particularly for the spacecraft during entry, as practice for future landings. The Starship is intended for use in missions to Mars and is crucial for NASA's plan to land astronauts on the moon by the end of the decade. The flight lasted just over an hour, originating from Starbase in Texas.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and other world leaders gathered in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to sign a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. The agreement, dubbed "The Trump Declaration for Enduring Peace and Prosperity," commits to resolving future disputes through diplomatic engagement rather than force. Noticeably absent from the signing ceremony were representatives from Hamas and Israel, with Benjamin Netanyahu citing a Jewish holiday for his absence. Hamas released the remaining 20 living Israeli hostages, and Israel freed Palestinian prisoners as part of the ceasefire agreement. The article states that questions remain about the future of Gaza and President Trump's role in shaping it.</p>

          <p>Missouri has implemented a new hands-free law targeting distracted drivers, with fines for first offenses. The law was prompted by the death of Randall Siddens, who was killed by a distracted driver in 2019. The Department of Transportation is using data gathered anonymously from smartphones and vehicles to identify distracted driving hot spots. Telematics data suggests that distracted driving is a factor in a higher percentage of fatal crashes than indicated by police crash reports. This data will inform educational programs and law enforcement efforts.</p>

          <h2>California's Incarcerated Firefighters to Receive Wage Increase</h2>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation to increase the pay of state prisoners assigned to battle wildfires, raising wages from approximately $1 per hour to the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. The legislation, Assembly Bill 247, takes effect immediately and is supported by a $10 million allocation in the state budget. Prison fire crews play a significant role in the state's wildfire efforts, performing tasks such as clearing brush and digging containment lines. The low wages earned by incarcerated firefighters have become a social justice issue in recent years.</p>

          <p>The Gaza peace plan brokered by President Trump advanced with Hamas releasing all living Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and increased aid flowing into Gaza. These steps are crucial to Trump's peace plan, following a ceasefire and Israeli troop pullback. World leaders met in Egypt for a summit on Gaza's future. Key issues remain, including postwar governance and disarmament, with negotiations expected to be difficult. The article suggests that the next phase of the peace plan is in progress, but provides limited detail.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump declared "peace in the Middle East" as he and regional leaders signed a declaration to cement a ceasefire in Gaza. However, analysts note that many thorny issues remain unresolved, posing barriers to a lasting peace. Trump visited Israel and Egypt, praising Benjamin Netanyahu and pledging to guarantee the Gaza deal. As part of the agreement, Hamas released the last surviving hostages, and Israel released Palestinian prisoners. Despite these steps, challenges persist, including Hamas's refusal to disarm and Israel's reluctance to fully withdraw from Gaza.</p>

          <p>The Scottish National Party (SNP) is experiencing a resurgence in political competitiveness after a period of instability and electoral setbacks. John Swinney's leadership has brought stability to the party, and support has fragmented among its rivals. Recent polling suggests the SNP could achieve a near majority in Holyrood due to this fragmentation. The party is optimistic about the upcoming election and aims to secure a majority to strengthen its argument for another independence referendum. However, the UK government remains opposed to another referendum, presenting a significant challenge.</p>

          <p>California fire survivors will be able to receive up to $350,000 for personal property losses without providing an itemized list, thanks to a new state law.

This legislation aims to ease the burden on fire victims who struggle to create an itemized list of lost possessions. The article states that this law goes into effect in January.</p>
