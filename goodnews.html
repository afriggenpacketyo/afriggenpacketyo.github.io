          <p>Former Emperor Akihito of Japan, aged 91, was discharged from a Tokyo hospital after undergoing medical tests for myocardial ischemia, a condition involving reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. While he exhibited no symptoms, the Imperial Household Agency indicated that careful follow-up care will be necessary. Akihito was admitted to the hospital after an earlier checkup revealed signs of the heart condition, and he had previously received treatment for heart failure in 2022. Akihito abdicated the Chrysanthemum Throne in April 2019, marking the first abdication by a Japanese monarch in approximately two centuries.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched towards Venus in March 1972, is expected to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere after a rocket malfunction left it stranded in orbit. Experts predict the re-entry will occur soon, but the exact location remains unknown. The spacecraft, designed with a heat shield to withstand Venus' atmosphere, has a chance of surviving its descent through Earth's atmosphere, with potential debris reaching the surface. While the risk of injuries on the ground is considered low, the event is drawing attention as a forgotten piece of space history makes its return.</p>

          <p>A South Korean temple, Buseoksa Temple, has returned a 14th-century Buddha statue to Kannonji, a Japanese temple, after a prolonged ownership dispute.

          <p>Cerys Vaughan, an 18-year-old amateur footballer, is seeking an apology from the Football Association (FA) after a case against her was dropped. Vaughan was initially banned for improper conduct after questioning the gender of a transgender woman opponent during a match. An FA appeal board later found that Vaughan had received an "unfair" hearing and quashed the original ruling, but the case was ultimately dropped after the complainant withdrew. Vaughan says the experience was stressful and impacted her life, and believes the FA should not have pursued the matter.</p>
