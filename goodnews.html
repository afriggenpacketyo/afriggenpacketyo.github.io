In the caption, she referenced the song "Somewhere Over the Rainbow," to which Cyrus replied with affection. Hurley has publicly confirmed their relationship, stating they are very happy and share a love for country life and their children.

          <p>India's captain, Shubman Gill, scored a patient century to help his team reach 310-5 at the close of the first day of the second Test against England at Edgbaston. After England chose to bowl first, their bowlers made early inroads, but Gill's steady performance, supported by an elegant 87 from Yashasvi Jaiswal, stabilized the innings. Despite a mid-afternoon wobble that saw two quick wickets fall, Gill partnered with Ravindra Jadeja to build a crucial 99-run stand. While India holds a slight advantage, England remains in the contest, aiming to prevent the tourists from building an insurmountable first-innings total.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the economic landscape shifting due to lower inflation and anticipated interest rate cuts, savers with significant funds like $10,000 should carefully consider their options, such as a certificate of deposit (CD). Before committing, it's crucial to ask whether a short-term or long-term CD is better, as short-term accounts currently offer surprisingly higher rates. Savers must also assess if they can afford to have that amount of money inaccessible for the entire term, as early withdrawal penalties can be substantial. Finally, one should compare CDs to high-yield savings and money market accounts, which offer comparable rates with greater liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of ether (ETH) and stocks connected to the cryptocurrency have seen a notable increase, driven by growing enthusiasm for the tokenization of real-world assets. Companies that have shifted their treasury strategies toward holding ETH, such as BitMine Immersion Technologies and Bit Digital, experienced significant stock jumps. This renewed interest is linked to the Ethereum network's capability for creating digital representations of assets, including stablecoins and tokenized funds like BlackRock's BUIDL. The trend follows Robinhood's announcement to enable tokenized stock trading in Europe, signaling that real-world use cases for blockchain technology are gaining momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Britain's Cameron Norrie delivered a strong performance at Wimbledon, fighting back to defeat American 12th seed Frances Tiafoe in a four-set thriller on Court One. After dropping the first set, the former British number one rallied to win 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 7-5, securing his place in the third round. The victory provides a boost for Norrie, who reached the semi-finals in 2022. However, the day saw mixed results for British players, as Katie Boulter was unexpectedly knocked out by lucky loser Solana Sierra, while Sonay Kartal advanced with a comfortable win over Viktoriya Tomova.</p>

The menu, which includes dishes like lobster bisque and foie gras cream, was specially designed to meet the strict requirements for space travel, such as being crumb-free and having a long shelf life. These "bonus meals" are intended to boost crew morale and provide a connection to home. Chef Pic, who holds 10 Michelin stars, embraced the challenge of adapting haute cuisine for the unique constraints of space.</p>

          <p>New research from Tufts University indicates that consuming coffee with minimal or no sugar and cream could be associated with a reduced risk of death from cardiovascular disease. The study further reveals that individuals who drink their coffee black exhibit a 14% lower risk of all-cause mortality when compared to those who do not drink coffee at all. These findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting potential health benefits associated with coffee consumption, particularly when additives like sugar and dairy are limited. The research highlights a simple dietary choice that may contribute to a longer, healthier life.</p>

          <p>For the first time, scientists have sequenced the complete genome of an ancient Egyptian, providing new insights into the region's ancestral history. The DNA, extracted from a man who lived between 4,500 and 4,800 years ago, is the oldest yet recovered from the area. Analysis revealed that while 80% of his genetic material originated from North Africa, a significant 20% traced back to West Asia and Mesopotamia. This genetic evidence supports archaeological theories of cultural connections and substantial movement of people between ancient Egypt and the Fertile Crescent during the era when the first pyramids were being built.</p>

          <p>Former NFL player Corey Parchman has authored a new book, "IVF Playbook for Men," to address the lack of resources and support for men experiencing infertility. Appearing on "CBS Mornings," Parchman shared his personal journey through five IVF cycles with his wife, Elisha, and the shock and feelings of inadequacy he experienced upon receiving a diagnosis of male factor infertility. He emphasized the importance of open communication and creating a "safe space" for partners to share their feelings. Parchman aims to break the stigma surrounding the issue, which accounts for at least 30% of infertility cases, and encourage men to be more vulnerable.</p>

The 21-year-old, ranked 733rd in the world, put up a spirited fight on Centre Court but ultimately lost in straight sets, 6-1, 6-4, 6-4. Despite the loss, Tarvet showed flashes of potential, creating 11 break points against the world number two. His impressive run through qualifying and the first round is expected to earn him significant prize money, though American college athletic rules may limit what he can accept while retaining his student status.</p>

          <p>Amid recent disruptions at U.S. air traffic control (ATC) centers and ahead of a busy travel season, a look into pilot training reveals multiple layers of safety protocols. Pilots are trained from their earliest days to handle communication loss with ATC. In-flight procedures include switching to backup radio frequencies, using an emergency channel, and employing a text-based messaging system. Furthermore, all airliners are equipped with a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) that autonomously communicates with other aircraft to prevent mid-air collisions. While ATC outages can cause significant delays, these redundant systems ensure that flight safety is maintained.</p>
