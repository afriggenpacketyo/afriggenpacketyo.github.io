          <p>President Trump addressed concerns about defying the Supreme Court regarding the deportation case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, stating that he relies on the Attorney General, Pam Bondi, to determine the legality of facilitating Abrego Garcia's return from El Salvador. Trump clarified that while he could ask El Salvador's president to return Abrego Garcia, the final decision rests with President Nayib Bukele. This statement comes after Trump previously indicated he "could" order Abrego Garcia's return, creating confusion about his administration's stance on the matter and the separation of powers. The situation highlights the complexities of immigration policy and the interplay between different branches of government.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist studying couples identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" as a particularly damaging statement in relationships. This comparison, often rooted in a fear of openly expressing needs, can lead to insecurity and feelings of inadequacy. The article suggests that clear and direct communication about one's needs is essential for a healthy relationship, rather than relying on comparisons that undermine a partner's self-worth. The ability to voice needs plainly is more likely when a person feels emotionally close and secure in their relationship.</p>

          <p>With America facing a shortage of millions of homes, economists and entrepreneurs are exploring ways to repurpose existing single-family homes into multifamily units. Zoning codes often restrict apartment buildings, leading developers to seek creative solutions like converting large houses into "roommate houses" or adding backyard cottages. This approach aims to address the housing mismatch where older individuals live in large, underused homes while others seek smaller, more affordable options. States like California are encouraging these efforts by easing regulations on accessory dwelling units, offering a less disruptive way to increase housing density.</p>
