          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former supporter of Donald Trump who was pardoned for her role in the January 6th Capitol riot, is refusing to accept the pardon and is attempting to return it. Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, believes the pardons contribute to a false narrative and whitewashing of the events of that day. She has sought assistance from Senator James Risch to formally reject the pardon, and the Department of Justice has acknowledged her non-acceptance. Hemphill has engaged in debates with other January 6th defendants over her views on the events of that day, and she expects her protest to garner attention from the former president. </p>

          <p>An exploration into why Australia, a country with a smaller population than Texas, produces a disproportionate number of successful actors, directors, and crew in Hollywood. The article highlights the training at NIDA (National Institute of Dramatic Art), the importance of institutions like the Sydney Theatre Company, and the training grounds provided by Aussie soap operas. Australian actors are characterized as skilled, confident, and courageous, with a strong work ethic and a down-to-earth attitude. The remoteness of Australia is also seen as a benefit, allowing actors to develop their talents without the constant gaze of Hollywood. </p>

          <p>The use of robots in sculpture is transforming the art world, with companies like Robotor employing them to carve with precision and speed. While some artists embrace the technology, others, like Tuscan artist Michael Monfroni, argue that only a human touch can bring the divine out of stone. Contemporary artist Barry X Ball uses robots to create complex works, while Richard Erdman finds them helpful in the rough cutting process. The debate centers on whether robots enhance or diminish the artistry involved in sculpture. </p>
