          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington to discuss bilateral relations and pressing international issues. The meeting, set for Thursday, marks the first in-person encounter between the two leaders since Merz assumed office on May 6. Discussions will encompass Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine, the complex situation in the Middle East, and trade policies that have caused friction between the European Union and the United States. This meeting underscores Germany's interest in de-escalating trade tensions, especially considering Trump's previous threats to impose tariffs on goods imported from the EU. Optimism is tempered by the complexity of the issues at hand.</p>

          <p>British cyclist Simon Yates delivered an exceptional performance in the penultimate stage of the Giro d'Italia, snatching the pink jersey from Isaac del Toro and effectively securing his second Grand Tour title. Yates's attack on the Colle delle Finestre allowed him to overcome a deficit of one minute and 21 seconds, leaving Del Toro and Richard Carapaz behind. His Visma-Lease A Bike team executed a masterstroke, with teammate Wout van Aert aiding Yates in building a significant lead over the final 20km. Yates's victory marks him as only the third British rider to win the Giro, joining Chris Froome and Tao Geoghegan Hart, and he was overcome with emotion at the finish line as he hugged team staff.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist specializing in youth development, offers five straightforward rules for effective parenting in an age of overwhelming and contradictory advice. These rules emphasize trusting parental instincts over influencers, following cultural traditions over clickbait, and paying attention to individual children's interests over conforming to the crowd. She also advises focusing on enjoyment rather than obsessing over developmental milestones and being authentic rather than striving for perfection. By prioritizing love, attention, and genuine engagement, parents can create a supportive environment for their children's growth and well-being.</p>

          <p>Sharon Horgan, the Bafta award-winning actor, writer, producer, and director, shared at the Hay Festival that she finally gained confidence after the second series of her hit show 'Bad Sisters' was released last year. Horgan, known for sitcoms like 'Catastrophe' and 'Motherland,' revealed that she previously doubted her success, wondering if it was due to timing or the people around her. With 'Bad Sisters,' she felt a sense of ownership and belonging, despite the large team involved. She also discussed turning to writing due to a lack of acting roles, leading her to create parts for herself and other flawed women, a concept that was uncommon at the time.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri secured pole position at the Spanish Grand Prix, beating his McLaren teammate Lando Norris in Barcelona, suggesting that recent rule changes targeting front wing flexibility had minimal impact on McLaren's performance. Despite expectations that the rule change would hinder McLaren, Piastri's advantage over Verstappen was significant, marking the largest margin for a pole-sitter this season. Piastri stated that the rule change had limited impact on McLaren's preparations, while Norris acknowledged making errors on his final run. The result indicates McLaren's continued strength on circuits with long, high-speed corners.</p>
