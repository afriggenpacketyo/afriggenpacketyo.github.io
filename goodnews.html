          <p>Nvidia has refuted reports that it is transferring graphics processing unit (GPU) designs to China to circumvent U.S. export controls. According to a company spokesperson, Nvidia is not modifying GPU designs to comply with export controls. The statement follows reports that CEO Jensen Huang discussed establishing a research and development center in Shanghai to cater to the local market while adhering to U.S. restrictions. The center would focus on assessing ways to meet U.S. restrictions while continuing production and design outside of China. Optimism score is 80.</p>

          <p>An Indian PhD graduate studying in South Dakota has been granted an injunction by a federal judge, allowing her to stay in the U.S. after her student visa was terminated by the Trump administration. Her visa was revoked due to a minor traffic violation, which her attorney stated is not a deportable offense. A federal judge in South Texas granted her a preliminary injunction, blocking the Department of Homeland Security from arresting and detaining her without court approval. The judge said that DHS‚Äôs actions ‚Äúappear unlawful and are likely to cause Saxena irreparable harm‚Äù. Optimism score is 80.</p>

          <p>As President Trump visited Saudi Arabia, some Saudis expressed admiration for him, calling him a ‚Äústraight shooter‚Äù who shares their values, particularly his conservative rhetoric and attacks on transgender people.

Cultural norms and political repression in the kingdom make it difficult to gauge public opinion accurately.
