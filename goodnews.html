          <p>Kaori Sakamoto, a three-time world champion in figure skating, announced her retirement from competition following the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina. Sakamoto, who won a bronze medal at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games and finished second at the world championships in Boston, revealed her decision at the opening of a new skating rink in her hometown of Kobe. She cited her age as a factor, stating that she would be 29 at the subsequent Olympics in 2030, making it unlikely for her to continue competing. Sakamoto, who debuted at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games, recently won her fourth straight Japanese championship. Optimism about her future endeavors is high as she transitions into a new phase of her career.</p>

          <p>China's ruling Communist Party is urging local governments to carefully implement austerity measures on lavish banquets, amid concerns about the impact on the food and beverage industry. Party publications emphasized that frugality regulations are intended to limit extravagant practices, not ordinary dining, after some local governments overzealously scrutinized meal gatherings and canceled official receptions. Such measures have complicated understanding of the regulations and brought unnecessary shocks to the catering industry. The curbs on excess in official meals followed the release of regulations on thrift and waste in government bodies, banning high-end dishes, cigarettes, and liquor at official events, leading localities to roll out their own guidelines.</p>

          <p>A contentious series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres culminated in a benches-clearing incident and managerial ejections. Tensions escalated in the final inning after Padres star Fernando Tatis Jr. was hit by a pitch, prompting Padres manager Mike Shildt to confront Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, leading to a heated exchange and both benches emptying. The scuffle resulted in the ejections of both managers. Despite a late rally by the Dodgers, the Padres held on for a 5-3 victory, concluding a heated stretch of rivalry baseball between the two teams. The game's intensity reflected the competitive nature of the National League West.</p>

          <p>Recent fire exchanges between Israel and Iran have highlighted the effectiveness of Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system, drawing attention to the proposed Golden Dome multi-layered missile defense system in the United States. The performance of Iron Dome underscores the need to strengthen U.S. missile defenses, particularly in the face of potential missile attacks from Russia or China. The Golden Dome project, which aims to defend the U.S. from ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles through a network of satellites, sensors, and interceptors, has garnered interest from private space companies. The project's progress is being closely monitored, with ongoing debates about its cost and viability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Experts are warning that children with lazy eyes are increasingly being missed for treatment due to the lack of early screenings in schools. Some councils are unable to offer this service because of budget constraints. The British and Irish Orthoptic Society is advocating for vision screening to be provided in all schools in England, as it is in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Early detection and treatment, ideally before the age of seven, are crucial for correcting amblyopia, the medical term for lazy eye, using patching. Increased funding for public health grants is needed to support school-based screenings and improve child health.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have created an edible, washable protein-based coating that can more than double the shelf life of fruits. The low-cost coating reduces moisture loss and microbial growth, effectively delaying rot by almost a week or more. Tested on 17 varieties of whole and cut fruits, including strawberries, tomatoes, kiwis, and mangoes, the coating costs just 9 US cents per kilogram of fruit. This new preservation strategy is as effective as existing methods while reducing carbon dioxide emissions and potential toxicity, offering a promising solution to global food waste. The team used computer-aided molecular simulation to develop the eco-friendly coating.</p>

She also shared tips for encountering a shark in the water, such as staying calm and maintaining eye contact.

Trade-war fears have receded after U.S. and Chinese trade representatives agreed to honor the consensus reached in Geneva, allowing for rare earth and tech trade while suspending tariffs.

          <p>Eighty-seven Japanese nationals and their family members have been evacuated from Iran and Israel due to escalating tensions in the Middle East. The evacuees arrived safely in Azerbaijan and Jordan by bus, as local airports remained closed. The Japanese government is arranging further evacuations and plans to dispatch Self-Defense Forces planes to Djibouti if airports reopen. While approximately 220 Japanese nationals remain in Iran and 1,000 in Israel, the government is prioritizing their safety. The evacuations follow continued strikes between Israel and Iran, heightening concerns about regional stability.</p>
