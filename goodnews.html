          <p>Rookie quarterback JJ McCarthy led the Minnesota Vikings to a 27-24 comeback victory against the Chicago Bears in his highly anticipated NFL debut. After a challenging first three quarters, the former Michigan star threw for two touchdowns and ran for another in the final quarter to secure the win. The game marked a promising start for McCarthy, who was drafted with the 10th pick in 2024 but missed his initial rookie season with a knee injury. His clutch performance turned the tide after a Chicago interception return for a touchdown had given the Bears a significant lead.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vancouver-based startup Jetson is working to make home electrification more affordable by significantly reducing the upfront cost of heat pump installations. Using a direct-to-consumer model that combines proprietary software and hardware, the company claims its average installation cost is around $15,000, which is 30% to 50% below typical quotes. Jetson recently launched its own heat pump, the Jetson Air, to further control costs. By factoring in available rebates, the company says it can offer installations for as little as $5,000, making it financially competitive with traditional gas furnace and air conditioner systems.</p>

          <p>The resignation of Angela Rayner as deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party has initiated a contested election to fill the influential position. The vacancy comes shortly after a government reshuffle that many in the party viewed as a shift to the right, heightening the stakes for the leadership contest. With nominations opening on a tight timetable, the election is expected to highlight internal party divisions and debates over the government's direction. The outcome will be closely watched as an indicator of the political winds within the ruling party.</p>

          <p>Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index climbed to a new record high, surpassing the 44,000 mark, following the resignation announcement of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The market rally was largely driven by technology stocks, with investors speculating that the country's next leader will introduce a new wave of fiscal stimulus to invigorate the economy. Analysts suggest that while the political transition may cause short-term volatility, it is expected to lead to greater long-term policy stability and a pro-growth environment for equities.

          <p>A succession battle within the Murdoch family has concluded with an agreement that solidifies Lachlan Murdoch's control over the global media empire, which includes Fox News and The Wall Street Journal. The deal resolves a legal dispute over the family's trust, which was set up after Rupert Murdoch's 1999 divorce. Under the new arrangement, siblings James, Elisabeth, and Prudence will sell their personal holdings in Fox and News Corp, each reportedly receiving around $1.1 billion, thereby ending their challenge to Lachlan's leadership and ensuring continuity in the companies' direction.</p>

          <p>An analysis of recent U.S. trade deals reveals a recurring pattern where partner countries announce large-scale purchases of Boeing aircraft. This trend has been observed in agreements with nations like South Korea, Japan, and the UK. The article explores the strategic value of these high-profile, high-value orders, questioning whether they are a pragmatic tool for countries to reduce their trade surpluses with the U.S. or a more performative gesture designed to appeal to President Trump's preference for symbolic, easily quantifiable deal-making. Experts note that aircraft are a politically safe import for most nations.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine reveals a 46% increase in cannabis use among Americans aged 65 and older between 2021 and 2023. As cannabis becomes legal in more states for both medical and recreational purposes, the associated stigma is diminishing, leading many seniors to explore it for managing conditions like chronic pain and anxiety. While users report therapeutic benefits, some medical professionals express caution, warning that THC, the main psychoactive compound, may carry cardiovascular health risks regardless of how it is consumed.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have activated third baseman Max Muncy from the injured list, providing a much-needed boost to the team's struggling offense. Muncy, who was sidelined with an oblique injury, was immediately placed back in the lineup for the game against the Colorado Rockies. His return is seen as a critical reinforcement for the Dodgers, who posted a losing record during his absence. He is the first of several key players expected to return from injury soon, bolstering the team's roster as they head into their final playoff push.</p>

          <p>To better serve a growing market of 100 million consumers, a port operator in Dalian is launching a "durian express" to bring the popular fruit from Southeast Asia to northeastern China faster and fresher. The initiative by Liaoning Port Group includes a new fruit transit center and a dedicated shipping service designed to cut transit times from as long as two weeks down to just six days. This logistical improvement aims to overcome the challenges of supplying the pungent, perishable fruit to a region geographically distant from traditional entry points in southern China.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed a bill aimed at shutting down the pipeline from out-of-state puppy mills by banning online brokers and other middlemen from selling dogs to California consumers. The legislation, AB 519, targets deceptive practices where resellers pose as small, local breeders while actually sourcing animals from large-scale commercial breeding facilities. If signed into law by the governor, the bill will close a loophole left by a 2019 law that banned pet stores from selling commercially bred dogs but did not cover the rapidly growing online sales market.</p>

Federal officials have emphasized that anyone who wants a vaccine can still receive one after consulting with their doctor, though this may limit access through some pharmacies.</p>
