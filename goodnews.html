          <p>Shares of SoftBank Group surged by 13% to a new record high, marking their best performance in five years. This significant increase followed the company's announcement of a fiscal first-quarter profit of 421.8 billion yen, which vastly surpassed analyst expectations and represented a major turnaround from a loss in the same period last year. The strong results were largely driven by a $4.8 billion gain in its Vision Funds, attributed to the performance of both private and listed portfolio companies. Several of its invested companies, including Indian eyewear retailer Lenskart, are also preparing for initial public offerings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. This marks the fourth time a court has blocked the policy, which seeks to deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are in the country illegally or on temporary visas. Judge Deborah Boardman ruled that the plaintiffs were highly likely to succeed in their argument that the order violates the 14th Amendment. The Trump administration has argued that the amendment's jurisdiction clause does not apply to parents without permanent legal status or allegiance to the country.</p>

Carano was dismissed after making controversial social media posts, including one comparing the political climate for Republicans to the persecution of Jews during the Holocaust. She had sued for wrongful termination and discrimination, seeking damages and to be recast in her role as Cara Dune. The terms of the settlement have not been disclosed, but Carano thanked Elon Musk, who had provided funding for her legal case.</p>

          <h2>Southern European Butterfly Species Spotted in the UK for the First Time</h2>

          <p>For the first time on record, the Southern Small White butterfly, a species native to Southern Europe, has been sighted in the United Kingdom. A volunteer at the Landguard Bird Observatory in Suffolk captured a photo of the female butterfly, which was later confirmed by experts. According to the charity Butterfly Conservation, this species has been rapidly expanding its range northward through Europe over the past two decades, reaching the Netherlands in 2015. While a warming climate is believed to be a contributing factor, the exact drivers of its rapid expansion remain unclear, and it is uncertain if the species will establish a breeding population in the UK.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people, particularly millennials, are reportedly moving away from dating apps and returning to old-fashioned, in-person methods of meeting potential partners. Companies like Date Cincy in Cincinnati are hosting popular singles events that cater to individuals tired of swiping and seeking genuine face-to-face connections. This trend is reflected in market data, with Bumble's stock value declining significantly and event platforms like Eventbrite reporting a 42% rise in attendance at dating and singles events. Participants cite a desire for authentic interactions and a way to avoid the pitfalls of online misrepresentation.</p>

          <p>Tonia Haddix, an exotic animal broker featured in the HBO docuseries 'Chimp Crazy,' has been sentenced to 46 months in prison. She was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice for lying to a federal judge about the death of a celebrity chimpanzee named Tonka, whom she was hiding in her basement. The chimp was discovered locked in a small cage after Haddix claimed he had died. Animal rights group PETA, which pursued legal action against Haddix, expressed relief at the sentence, stating it delivered a measure of justice for the suffering she inflicted on animals.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has announced that its experimental daily pill, orforglipron, successfully helped adults with obesity achieve significant weight loss in a late-stage clinical trial. Participants in the 72-week trial lost an average of 27.3 pounds, with a safety profile consistent with existing injectable GLP-1 therapies like Zepbound. Common side effects included nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The company plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval later this year, potentially making a more convenient and accessible oral treatment option available to consumers by 2026, pending FDA review.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Plans New Restrictions on Where Serious Offenders Can Go After Release</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 19:54:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is developing legislation to impose stricter geographical restrictions on serious sexual and violent offenders after their release from prison. Instead of traditional exclusion zones where an offender cannot go, the new system would confine them to a specific, pre-approved area, monitored by enhanced electronic tagging. The Ministry of Justice states this new approach would provide victims with greater peace of mind, allowing them to travel without fear of encountering their attacker. However, some probation officers have raised concerns that the plan could increase their already heavy workload.</p>
