While Seoul secured a favorable tariff rate for its key automotive sector, it successfully resisted U.S. pressure to further open its sensitive agricultural markets, marking a key victory for its negotiators.

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a bill into law that increases penalties for soliciting minors for sex, allowing prosecutors to charge some offenders with a felony on a first offense. The law specifically targets suspects who are at least three years older than the 16- or 17-year-old minor they solicit, a compromise reached after legislative debate. The new law also creates a support fund for survivors, which will be financed through increased fines on convicted offenders.</p>

          <p>The Arora Group, led by hotel tycoon Surinder Arora, has submitted a competing proposal for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport. Their plan features a shorter third runway, which they claim would be cheaper and less disruptive than the airport's own proposal, notably by avoiding the costly need to reroute the M25 motorway. This introduces the first-ever competitive bidding process for the long-debated infrastructure project, challenging Heathrow's previously exclusive position on its development.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani caused significant concern when he left his pitching start against the Cincinnati Reds in the fourth inning accompanied by a trainer. The team later announced the issue was only cramping, a major relief for the club and its fans, and Ohtani was able to remain in the game as a designated hitter. Despite the injury scare being minor, the Dodgers ultimately went on to lose the game 5-2.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to hold its key interest rate steady, resisting public pressure from President Trump to implement a cut. The rate remains in the 4.25% to 4.5% range, though the decision was not unanimous, with two board members voting for a rate reduction. The Fed's cautious approach comes amid conflicting economic signals, as recent GDP growth was driven by tariff-related import drops, while other underlying data suggests a loss of economic momentum.

          <p>Following the tsunami generated by a major earthquake off Russia, this article explains the science of how these powerful waves are created and how people can respond to them safely. A tsunami typically requires a strong underwater earthquake with vertical motion, creating waves that travel at high speeds in the deep ocean before slowing and growing in height near the shore. Experts stress the critical importance of heeding official warnings and moving to higher ground immediately.</p>

The team discovered vast fields of tube worms, clams, and bacterial mats fueled by chemical seeps from the ocean floor. This finding challenges previous assumptions about the limits of life in such extreme, high-pressure environments and suggests these unique ecosystems may be more widespread on the planet than previously thought.</p>
