          <h2>Federal Workers Face Furloughs as Government Shutdown Begins</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 10:28:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government has entered a shutdown, leading to potential furloughs for up to 750,000 federal workers as Democrats and Republicans failed to reach a funding agreement. The shutdown stems from disagreements over healthcare tax credits and funding priorities, with both parties blaming each other for the impasse. Federal agencies are initiating shutdown procedures, halting non-essential functions, and impacting various services. Essential employees will continue working without pay, and the duration of the shutdown remains uncertain as negotiations continue between lawmakers to find a resolution to the funding dispute. Optimism remains that a compromise will be reached to restore government operations. </p>

          <h2>A Look Back at Past Government Shutdowns Since 1980</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 10:26:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a historical overview of government shutdowns in the United States since 1980, detailing the causes and durations of 14 previous funding lapses. The shutdowns occurred under various presidents and congressional control, often stemming from disagreements over spending priorities, budget deficits, or policy issues like healthcare and immigration. The most recent shutdown in late 2018 resulted in significant financial losses, and the article highlights the increasing frequency of these events in recent decades. These shutdowns serve as a reminder of the political gridlock that can disrupt government operations. </p>

          <h2>Congress and the President Continue to Receive Pay During Government Shutdown</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 10:24:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article addresses the question of whether members of Congress and the President continue to receive pay during a government shutdown. Despite the potential for federal employees to face unpaid work or layoffs, the Constitution guarantees that lawmakers and the President will continue to receive their salaries. The article explains that lawmakers' pay is funded by a permanent appropriation, while other federal entities are governed by the Antideficiency Act, which restricts spending without congressional approval. While congressional staffers' pay may be delayed, the President's salary cannot be reduced while in office, ensuring their compensation regardless of shutdown actions. </p>

          <h2>Government Shutdown Could Disrupt U.S. Travel</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A government shutdown could potentially disrupt air travel in the U.S., although a short shutdown is unlikely to have a major impact. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) deem most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work without pay. However, a prolonged shutdown could lead to labor shortages as employees face financial pressure, potentially causing longer airport security lines and flight delays. The U.S. Travel Association warns that a shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while train travel is unlikely to be disrupted in the near term. </p>

          <p>The government shutdown will impact the U.S. military, forcing active-duty service members to continue serving without timely pay. While they will eventually receive back pay, the delay can cause financial strain. Civilian personnel deemed essential will also continue working, while others will be furloughed. The Defense Department has outlined priority missions, including securing the U.S. Southern Border and operations in the Middle East, and TRICARE medical insurance will continue uninterrupted. The Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA are offering special loans to military members to mitigate financial difficulties during the shutdown. </p>

          <p>The government shutdown will not interrupt Social Security payments to the 74 million Americans who collect them, as benefits are covered by mandatory spending. However, other Social Security services, such as benefit verifications and earnings record corrections, could be temporarily halted. The Social Security Administration (SSA) plans to keep nearly 90% of its workforce on the job, but some services will be suspended, and the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) announcement could be delayed. Supplemental Security Income payments are scheduled to go out as usual, but customer service interactions with the federal government could be affected. </p>

          <h2>Brexit Linked to Rise in Small Boat Crossings, According to Starmer</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 10:12:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has attributed the increase in small boat arrivals to Brexit, citing the UK's departure from EU agreements that previously allowed for the return of asylum seekers. Prior to Brexit, the UK returned more people than it received, but this trend reversed after the 2016 referendum. Migration experts also point to other Brexit-related factors, such as the loss of access to the EU's fingerprint database, as contributing to the rise in crossings. Reform UK has refuted these claims, but data indicates that the UK has had no effective mechanism to return asylum seekers to the EU since leaving the Dublin regulation. </p>

          <p>Ford Motor reported an 8.2% increase in third-quarter sales, driven by strong demand for electric vehicles (EVs) and large SUVs. Sales of all-electric vehicles rose by 30.2%, setting a new quarterly record of over 30,600 units. Ford's SUV sales also increased by nearly 10%, with significant gains for larger models and the Mustang Mach-E EV. While EV sales are expected to be a record for the quarter, analysts anticipate a potential slowdown after federal EV incentives end in September. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the Medigap open enrollment period, a six-month window that starts when you turn 65 and your Part B Medicare coverage takes effect. During this period, individuals can enroll in any Medigap plan without being denied coverage due to health issues. Missing this enrollment period could lead to higher rates or denial of coverage later on, particularly for those with underlying health conditions. Medigap plans help cover costs that Medicare doesn't, such as deductibles and coinsurance, providing more predictable healthcare expenses and greater provider options. </p>

          <p>The Cleveland Browns have announced that rookie Dillon Gabriel will start as quarterback in their upcoming game against the Minnesota Vikings in London, replacing Joe Flacco. The Browns have struggled offensively, ranking near the bottom in scoring this season, and the switch to Gabriel raises questions about Shedeur Sanders' potential future role. Gabriel, selected in the third round of the draft, has shown promise in limited action and during the preseason. Flacco's performance has been subpar, with the lowest passer rating among quarterbacks with at least 56 pass attempts. </p>

          <p>A British High Court judge has ruled that PPE Medpro, a company linked to an underwear tycoon, must reimburse the government over $163 million for breaching a contract to supply surgical gowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. The court found that the gowns were not sterile and could not be used as such, leading to a breach of contract. The company, connected to Michelle Mone, was awarded the contracts under a fast-track model that favored companies recommended by politicians. The government sued PPE Medpro over allegations that the gowns were faulty, and the judgment was welcomed by the Treasury. </p>
