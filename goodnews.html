          <p>During a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill, President Donald Trump cautioned House Republicans against tampering with Medicaid while urging them to pass a major tax bill. Trump's blunt message highlighted the divisions within the Republican party, as some members sought cuts to the Medicaid program, which provides healthcare coverage to nearly 80 million low-income Americans and children, jointly financed by the federal government and individual states. The tax bill's progress has been hindered by these internal disagreements among House Republicans regarding Medicaid cuts.</p>

          <p>Ryanair is requesting that some of its flight attendants in Spain return salary increases they received, ranging from ‚Ç¨1,500 to ‚Ç¨3,000, following a legal battle with the Union Sindical Obrera (USO). The USO had challenged the original pay agreement with CCOO, stating that the negotiators lacked the authority to make such a deal, and a court ruling sided with the USO, nullifying the agreement. Ryanair is complying with the court order, but the USO is exploring legal solutions, and Ryanair has agreed to a separate pay deal with CCOO members who will not be required to repay the increases. The airline has not specified the number of affected flight attendants or the consequences of non-payment.</p>

While the deal promises "dedicated dialogues" on professional qualification recognition, a full agreement could take longer to negotiate. Passport e-gate usage for UK citizens will be up to individual EU countries to decide, and changes may not come into force before a new EU border security scheme in October. The agreement commits to introducing a new pet passport system, but the timeline is unclear, and UK farmers will have to align with EU food standards in return for easier access to the EU market.</p>

While he may reconsider if he sees a future need, Musk currently does not foresee a reason to continue donating at the same level, a development that may concern Republicans preparing for the 2026 elections.</p>

A high ratio suggests that silver may be undervalued compared to gold, prompting investors to consider buying silver, and the current ratio is high, hovering around 100 to 1. While both gold and silver can diversify a portfolio, silver tends to be more volatile and has a lower barrier to entry due to its lower cost per ounce. (not investment advice)</p>

A HELOC is better for short-term needs and affordable payments, while a reverse mortgage suits those with limited income and a desire to age in place, so seniors should consider their financial situation and consult professionals to determine the best option.</p>

          <p>England's head cricket coach, Brendon McCullum, has called on the team to improve their "humility" as they prepare for a significant year, beginning with a Test against Zimbabwe and followed by series against India and Australia. McCullum emphasized the importance of how players conduct themselves and interact with the public, in addition to their performance on the field, and he expressed a desire for the team to be more humble and connected to the general population. This call for humility follows scrutiny of player comments in the media and an acknowledgement that the team can be "a bit dumb."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Joan C. Williams argues that Democrats have a historic opportunity to win back working-class voters but must address their economic concerns and cultural values. Williams suggests that Democrats should focus on predistributive policies that create well-paid jobs and value institutions that anchor self-discipline, such as religion and the military. She also criticizes the party's reliance on elite language and identity politics, which alienate many working-class Americans, and she emphasizes the need for cultural competence and an understanding of class inequality.</p>

          <p>Cadillac's expanding EV lineup is attracting new buyers, with nearly 80% being new to the brand, including a growing number of Tesla owners trading in their vehicles. The luxury brand reports that about 10% of new Cadillac EV customers are coming from Tesla, with a notable increase to roughly 25% of customers trading in Teslas for the Cadillac Lyriq SUV this year. This trend coincides with Tesla's declining sales and boycotts amid CEO Elon Musk's political stances, but Cadillac emphasizes that its success is due to the merits of its products.</p>
