          <h2>ESA Assesses Impact of NASA Budget Cuts on Lunar and Mars Missions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 10:33:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Space Agency is evaluating the repercussions of proposed budget cuts to NASA, particularly concerning the Artemis moon program and the shift towards Mars-focused initiatives. These cuts, potentially removing $6 billion from NASA's budget, could jeopardize major international collaborations. While NASA's human exploration portfolio remains largely untouched with a proposed $1 billion increase for Mars programs, the Space Launch System and Orion spacecraft program may be phased out by 2027, potentially replaced by SpaceX's Starship program. The ESA emphasizes the importance of international cooperation in space activities as they assess the full impact of these changes on European researchers' involvement in lunar and Martian endeavors.</p>

          <p>Google has entered into an agreement with Elementl Power to fund the development of three advanced nuclear reactor sites to power its energy-intensive data centers. Each site is expected to generate at least 600 megawatts of power, with Google having the option to purchase the power once operational. This move underscores the increasing demand for reliable, baseload energy to support the growing needs of AI and other technological advancements. Elementl Power aims to add 10 gigawatts of nuclear capacity to the grid by 2035, utilizing Google's early-stage capital for site permitting, interconnection rights, and contract negotiations.</p>

          <p>Uber's first-quarter earnings surpassed analysts' expectations, but revenue growth fell slightly below anticipated levels, causing the company's shares to decline. Despite a 14% increase in revenue compared to the previous year, the company reported $11.53 billion against an expected $11.62 billion. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi addressed the Federal Trade Commission's lawsuit regarding Uber One's billing practices, defending the subscription service's simplicity and growth. The company's mobility and delivery segments saw bookings increase year over year, with monthly active platform consumers growing to 170 million. Uber is also continuing its push into autonomous vehicle technology, viewing it as a significant opportunity.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the trend of companies sending Mother's Day opt-out emails, acknowledging the potential pain and difficulty the holiday can bring for some. The author notes that while these emails are well-intentioned and aim to create a sense of community with customers, they are also a marketing tactic to maintain access to valuable inboxes. The article explores the paradox of sending numerous emails about Mother's Day in order to send fewer emails about it, and the broader trend of brands attempting to appear empathetic and aware of social issues. Ultimately, the author questions the effectiveness of these emails, arguing that pain and regret cannot simply be opted out of.</p>
