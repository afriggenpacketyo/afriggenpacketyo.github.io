          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 03:19:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government's plans to conclude talks regarding the Chagos Islands deal have been paused due to a last-minute injunction granted by a High Court judge. Bertrice Pompe, a Chagossian, filed a case against the Foreign Office, leading to the interim relief. The judge's order prevents the government from taking any conclusive steps to finalize negotiations about transferring the British Indian Ocean Territory to a foreign government. The court is scheduled to hear the case again on Thursday, introducing uncertainty into the future of the islands.</p>

          <p>Mayuri Chari and Janhavi Khemka are two Indian women artists with distinct styles, both deeply influenced by personal experiences of gender, disability, and family. Khemka, who is hearing-impaired, explores sound through vibration in her interactive art, while Chari challenges societal views of women through various mediums, often facing controversy for featuring nude female bodies. Despite institutional rejection, Chari's work resonates with Indian women, and both artists have garnered international attention, using their art to express their unique perspectives and empower others.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 03:02:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official figures indicate that UK government borrowing was higher than anticipated in April, reaching ¬£20.2 billion, which is ¬£1 billion more than the previous year and surpasses analysts' predictions. This marks the fourth-highest April borrowing figure since 1993, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). While tax receipts saw an increase due to higher National Insurance contributions from employers, government expenditure also rose due to pay increases, inflation-related costs, and pension and benefit hikes. Borrowing for the financial year ending in March is now estimated at ¬£148.3 billion, slightly lower than initial estimates but still above the government's forecast.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has expressed strong concerns to the European Union regarding the proposed handling fee on small parcels entering the bloc, most of which originate from Chinese e-commerce firms. A Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson urged the EU to ensure a fair, transparent, and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies. The European Commission is proposing a two-euro fee for small packages valued at 150 euros or less sent directly to customers from overseas, with a lower fee for parcels sent to European warehouses. This fee is expected to generate approximately 3 billion euros to cover customs and safety checks.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's rally continued as it reached a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and sustained interest from institutional buyers. Despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, Bitcoin's price surge is attributed to investors seeking alternative stores of value and concerns over broader macro issues, including Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. Favorable regulatory developments, such as the GENIUS Act and support from U.S. President Donald Trump, along with JPMorgan's decision to allow clients to buy Bitcoin, have also contributed to the market's positive sentiment.

The retailer confirmed that some personal customer data, including telephone numbers, addresses, and dates of birth, was stolen during the attack, but payment details and account passwords remain secure.

          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have concurred that the current dollar-yen exchange rate reflects underlying economic conditions during discussions about ongoing bilateral tariff negotiations. This acknowledgement suggests that the yen's recent weakness against the dollar should no longer be a contentious issue in trade talks. Japan has started a revamped gasoline subsidy to cut prices by 10 yen per liter to help ease cost-of-living pressures for consumers ahead of an upcoming parliamentary election. Additionally, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has criticized officials over a destroyer launch accident.</p>
