          <p>President Trump signed an executive order to implement a trade deal with Japan, setting baseline tariffs at 15% on most Japanese goods, including automobiles. As part of the agreement, Japan will invest $550 billion in U.S. projects and increase purchases of American agricultural products and commercial aircraft. The deal comes as Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba faces mounting political pressure at home due to recent election losses and internal party discontent over inflation-taming measures and previous scandals. Analysts suggest Ishiba is unlikely to survive a leadership challenge, potentially resigning before an election amid growing internal opposition. (not investment advice)</p>

Zuckerberg claims his account has been disabled five times in eight years, costing him thousands of dollars in lost business due to improperly taken down advertising. He has submitted photo ID, credit cards, and images of his face to prove his identity, noting his middle name is Steven, while the Facebook founder's middle name is Elliot.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is reportedly planning to sign an executive order to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War, reverting to a name used until after World War II. The order would allow Defense Department officials to use the title Secretary of War, and the White House says the name Department of War will serve as a secondary title for the Department of Defense. Trump has previously stated that War Department "just sounded better" to him, though it is unclear if the change can be officially made without congressional approval. The change could be costly, as renaming nine Army bases was previously estimated to cost $39 million.</p>

          <p>President Trump will speak at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C., during a Religious Liberty Commission hearing on religious freedom in education. The commission, created by Trump, aims to protect Americans' ability to practice their religion freely, especially in public education, and address perceived threats to First Amendment protections. Parents and students are expected to share experiences of expressing their faith in public schools, with Attorney General Pam Bondi also scheduled to speak. The White House stated that the previous administration abused its power to interfere with religious freedom, particularly targeting Christians, and that Trump is the greatest defender of faith in modern history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has asked the Supreme Court to allow him to fire Federal Trade Commission (FTC) commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, after lower courts ordered her reinstatement. The White House asserts Trump acted lawfully in removing Slaughter, citing the President's authority to remove heads of executive agencies. Slaughter was removed in March, along with another Democratic commissioner, as part of an effort to exert influence over federal agencies. Slaughter maintains she intends to serve her term, which ends in 2029, and is focused on her work at the FTC, despite the ongoing legal challenge.</p>

          <p>President Trump hosted a dinner at the White House with tech leaders including Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, and Bill Gates, praising them as leaders of a revolution in business and genius. Elon Musk was invited but unable to attend, sending a representative in his place; Musk had previously criticized Trump's administration but Trump believes he will eventually return to the Republican Party. Gates discussed advancements in vaccine technology, and Trump addressed concerns about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s views on vaccines, calling him a "very good person" with a "different take." Trump has been cultivating close ties with tech CEOs, seeking investment pledges and pressing companies to boost their U.S. presence.</p>

Clark sustained the injury in July and later suffered a bone bruise, limiting her to 13 games in her second WNBA season where she averaged 16.5 points and 8.8 assists. The Fever's COO and GM emphasized that Clark's long-term health is the top priority, looking forward to her return at full strength in the 2026 season. The 2024 Rookie of the Year's absence is a blow to the Fever, who are currently in eighth place in the standings and trying to reach the postseason.</p>

California Governor Gavin Newsom's office acknowledged that the image was edited and shared it to mock Trump. There is no evidence to support rumors that Trump's health is failing, and in July 2025, the White House confirmed he had chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition.</p>

          <p>A US federal appeals court upheld an injunction against President Trump's policy directive preventing transgender and nonbinary Americans from obtaining passports that accurately reflect their gender identities. The ruling supports a previous decision that Trump's policy was arbitrary and rooted in prejudice toward transgender Americans, violating their constitutional rights. The lawsuit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, arguing that the policy unlawfully prevented transgender, nonbinary, and intersex people from obtaining passports consistent with their gender identities. The court found that the government failed to meaningfully engage with the conclusion that Trump's policy reflected unconstitutional animus.</p>
