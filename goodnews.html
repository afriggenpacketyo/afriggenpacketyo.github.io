          <p>The UK government, led by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, plans to end the recruitment of care workers from overseas as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration. The government intends to shift the focus to hiring British nationals and extending visas for overseas workers already in the country. The threshold for skilled visas is expected to be increased to graduate level, and the list of exceptions for temporary shortage visas will be narrowed. This move is expected to reduce lower-skilled visas by up to 50,000 over the next year, with new training commitments aimed at getting unemployed individuals back into the UK labor market.</p>

          <p>British plane parts, including Rolls-Royce engines, are expected to be exempted from US import tariffs as part of a developing trade agreement with the Trump administration. The agreement, which aims to provide certainty to the ¬£40bn UK aerospace sector, follows relief offered to the car and steel industries. The deal is also important for the US, as Boeing imports Rolls-Royce engines for its commercial airliners, and US-based repair and maintenance facilities require a regular flow of parts. The terms would bring car tariffs down from 27.5% to 10% on at least 100,000 vehicles a year and steel tariffs to zero.</p>

          <p>Andy Hill, a former UCLA basketball player and coach, is credited with inventing the plus-minus statistic, which measures a player's impact on the team's score while they are on the court. Inspired by John Wooden's emphasis on teamwork, Hill developed the Team Contribution Index to reward players for intangible contributions beyond scoring. While some analysts debate its accuracy, the plus-minus has become a widely used metric in basketball, highlighting the importance of well-rounded players who contribute to winning in various ways.</p>
