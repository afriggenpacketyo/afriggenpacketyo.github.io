          <p>United Airlines surpassed second-quarter earnings estimates, prompting an updated financial forecast for 2025. CEO Scott Kirby noted that a less uncertain global environment is bolstering confidence in a strong end-of-year performance, following a period of weaker domestic travel demand. While revenue of $15.24 billion slightly missed expectations, the airline's premium cabin sales showed robust growth. The new forecast projects adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share, aligning with analyst predictions and reflecting cautious optimism despite earlier economic concerns.

          <p>Bitmine Immersion Technologies, a company focusing on an Ether treasury strategy, saw its stock price surge after billionaire investor Peter Thiel revealed a 9% stake through his firm, Founders Fund. The news prompted a rally in related crypto stocks as well. Bitmine, which recently appointed market strategist Tom Lee as chairman, aims to become a major player in the Ether space, similar to MicroStrategy's role with Bitcoin. This investment from a high-profile figure like Thiel signals growing institutional interest in Ethereum and its related ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India secured a four-wicket win against England in the first one-day international, successfully chasing a target of 259 with 10 balls remaining. All-rounder Deepti Sharma was instrumental, scoring an unbeaten 62 to guide the tourists to victory in what became their second-highest successful chase in the format. For England, Sophia Dunkley's 83 and Alice Davidson-Richards' 53 were standout performances, but a sloppy fielding effort and a failure to accelerate their scoring earlier proved costly. The result gives India an early lead in the three-match series.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is being lauded for his statesmanship after the U.S. government approved the company's plan to sell its H20 AI chips to China, reversing an earlier ban. Huang consistently argued that restricting access to the Chinese market would harm U.S. tech leadership, a message that appears to have resonated with Washington. This diplomatic success, which involved cultivating relationships with both U.S. and Chinese officials, is seen as a major victory for Nvidia. The move is expected to restore a significant portion of the company's sales to the critical Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is promoting his "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) agenda, which is gaining significant traction at the state level. States like Louisiana and Texas have passed stringent food-labeling laws targeting artificial additives and seed oils, while Oklahoma is moving to defluoridate water and restrict soda purchases with food stamps. While Kennedy has the authority for nationwide changes, his strategy appears to rely on state-led initiatives and voluntary corporate action rather than federal regulation. This approach allows him to advance his goals without navigating Washington's bureaucratic hurdles.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ), based in The Hague, serves as the principal judicial body of the United Nations, tasked with settling legal disputes between states. Comprised of 15 judges from different nations, its rulings are legally binding on UN member states, though it lacks a mechanism for direct enforcement. The court's jurisdiction applies when states agree to submit to it, or when a case is brought under a specific UN convention, such as the Genocide Convention. Recent high-profile cases involve Ukraine's suit against Russia and South Africa's case against Israel.</p>
