          <p>After undergoing an extensive 20-year renovation project, the tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep III in Egypt's Valley of the Kings has reopened to the public. The restoration, led by a Japanese team, focused on preserving the intricate paintings depicting the pharaoh and his wife on the tomb's walls. Amenhotep III, one of the most prominent pharaohs of the 18th Dynasty, ruled for nearly four decades. The reopening is part of Egypt's broader effort to revitalize its tourism sector, a crucial source of foreign currency for the nation's economy.</p>

          <p>In the new A24 film "The Smashing Machine," Dwayne Johnson delivers a career-defining performance as MMA pioneer Mark Kerr, a role that starkly contrasts with his typical blockbuster characters. The gritty biopic, directed by Benny Safdie, chronicles Kerr's rise in the early days of the UFC and his harrowing battle with opioid addiction. While the film's narrative is considered somewhat conventional, Johnson's physical and emotional transformation is being praised by critics as a potential awards contender. Emily Blunt co-stars as Kerr's then-girlfriend, offering a strong supporting performance in the intense drama.</p>

Center Quinn Tupaea was instrumental in the victory, scoring two crucial tries late in the first half. Despite the win, the championship title remains within reach for South Africa, who can secure it with a victory over Argentina. New Zealand's bonus-point win, sealed by a last-minute try from George Bower, keeps the pressure on the Springboks in the final match of the tournament.</p>

          <p>Lyft CEO David Risher recounted his decision to leave a successful management role at Microsoft in 1996 to join a small online startup called Amazon. Despite Bill Gates calling it the "stupidest decision," Risher was convinced by Jeff Bezos's compelling vision and obsession with the customer experience. Bezos confidently predicted that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by the year 2000, a goal it surpassed a year early. Risher, who became a key executive during Amazon's explosive growth phase, was drawn by the rare opportunity to build a transformative company.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's new album has ignited fan speculation that the track "Actually Romantic" is a response to fellow pop star Charli XCX. In the song, Swift addresses another singer who writes songs about hating her, which fans have linked to Charli XCX's track "Sympathy is a Knife." In a film accompanying the album, Swift described the song as a "love letter to someone who hates you," adding that she finds the intense focus from another person to be flattering. Neither artist has confirmed the connection, leaving fans to continue decoding the lyrics.</p>

The firm argues that despite strong revenue growth and a high customer retention rate, Workiva's lack of profitability and founder-controlled board have led to an undervalued stock price.

          <p>The only commercial uranium enrichment facility in the U.S., operated by Urenco in New Mexico, is ramping up production to meet a resurgence in demand for nuclear power. This renewed interest is driven by the need to power AI data centers and a U.S. ban on Russian uranium imports set for 2028, creating a significant supply gap. The plant, which currently supplies about a third of U.S. demand, is expanding its capacity by 15%. However, industry leaders warn that the entire nuclear supply chain, from mining to conversion, must also expand to support ambitious national goals.</p>

          <p>A 37-year-old mother, Michaela Del Barrio, was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer after she proactively sought early screening due to her family's history with the disease. Despite having no symptoms, a breast MRI ordered by a high-risk clinic revealed two suspicious masses. Her experience underscores the importance of self-advocacy and understanding personal risk factors, as doctors recommend women with a family history of cancer begin discussions about screening in their mid-20s.

          <p>The late conservationist Jane Goodall, who passed away at 91, adopted a plant-based diet approximately 50 years ago, a decision deeply intertwined with her ethical and environmental activism. She famously stopped eating meat after reflecting on the fear and pain it represented, a choice she said made her feel immediately better and lighter. Goodall was a vocal advocate for plant-based eating, citing the negative environmental impact of factory farming and meat production. Her commitment to her work and diet aligns with traits often observed in the world's longest-living, healthiest people.</p>

With soaring tuition and a tough job market, many parents are questioning whether a brand name alone is worth the price. This shift is reflected in changing application patterns, with students considering a wider mix of public and private schools, and in the rising popularity of institutions that emphasize experiential learning over historical reputation, reshaping the hierarchy of American higher education.</p>
