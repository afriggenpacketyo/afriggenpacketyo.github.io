          <p>Marks and Spencer (M&S) has resumed taking online orders after suspending them in April due to a cyber attack. The retailer is initially offering fashion items for home delivery in England, Scotland, and Wales, with plans to expand to beauty, homeware, click and collect, and Northern Ireland services in the coming weeks. The cyber attack, which occurred over the Easter weekend, initially disrupted click and collect and contactless payments, and is estimated to cost the company around ¬£300 million in profits. Some personal customer data, including telephone numbers and addresses, was stolen during the attack, though payment details and passwords were not compromised. The article details the recovery process for M&S following a significant cyber security incident.</p>
