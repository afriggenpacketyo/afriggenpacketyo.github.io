          <p>The Bank of Korea (BOK) has lowered its policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 2.5%, marking the fourth cut in the last six meetings, as the country grapples with political uncertainty and the potential impact of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. South Korea faces ongoing political turmoil following a botched attempt by the former leader to impose martial law, along with economic challenges including a GDP contraction in the first quarter. The central bank attributed the rate cut to expectations of declining economic growth and stable inflation, while also slashing its full-year GDP forecast for 2025 to just 0.8%. The Kospi stock index jumped 1.25% following the announcement, while the South Korean won weakened 0.71% against the dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority by imposing reciprocal tariffs, dealing a blow to a key aspect of his economic agenda. The U.S. Court of International Trade determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to unilaterally implement sweeping duties. The court ordered a permanent halt to the tariffs and barred future modifications, though the Trump administration swiftly appealed the ruling. Dow futures jumped 500 points upon the announcement, and Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield hailed the decision as a victory for working families and small businesses.</p>

          <p>As immigration enforcement intensifies in the United States, the Latino community with permanent residency is increasingly seeking naturalization, also aiming to promote civic participation in upcoming congressional elections. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) reported over 7.9 million naturalizations in the last decade, averaging 790,000 new citizens annually. Community organizations and law offices report a surge in naturalization applications among Latinos in 2025, spurred by the Trump administration's policies and ICE operations. Academics note that this is an opportunity to advance electoral participation and provide a counterweight to President Trump in the 2026 congressional elections, emphasizing the obligation to defend democracy.</p>

The order applies to Ukrainians, Afghans, military members and their families, and others, requiring the government to restart processing applications for migrants renewing their status. Judge Indira Talwani wrote that the administration‚Äôs categorical termination of legal pathways for those groups was likely unlawful and could cause discord. The decision is a victory for civil and immigrant rights groups amid a campaign to strip legal status from various groups living, working, and studying in the country temporarily.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, driven by a 73% year-over-year increase in its data center business. The company's stock rose about 6% in extended trading following the announcement, although its guidance for the current quarter is slightly below expectations due to export restrictions on its China-bound H20 chips. Despite this political tension, Nvidia's growth continues to be fueled by high demand for its artificial intelligence chips. CEO Jensen Huang noted that the $50 billion market in China for AI chips is "effectively closed to U.S. industry."</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has criticized Nigel Farage's Reform UK policies as "fantasy" economics, likening Farage to former PM Liz Truss and warning that Reform's proposals would increase mortgage costs. Starmer argues that Farage is pledging unfunded tax cuts that could spark an economic meltdown, using family finances as a gambling chip. Reform made significant gains in recent local elections, but the Institute for Fiscal Studies has questioned the feasibility of Farage's tax plans, estimating they could cost between ¬£50bn and ¬£80bn a year without clear funding sources. Farage, in response, dismissed the Conservatives as an "irrelevance."</p>

Japan hopes to schedule an in-person summit between Ishiba and President Trump on the sidelines of the G7 summit in June.

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, delivering a significant blow to his economic policies. The Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The Manhattan-based court said the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations and this is not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The Trump administration has lodged an appeal, while the attorney general of New York welcomed the decision, stating that no president has the power to single-handedly raise taxes whenever they like.</p>
