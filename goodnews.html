          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 15:02:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to common belief, high-income individuals often struggle with credit card debt, primarily due to lifestyle inflation where expenses rise with income. A recent study shows that 62% of those earning $300,000 or more find it difficult to manage their balances. This article outlines several debt relief strategies tailored for high earners, including using debt consolidation loans to secure lower interest rates and leveraging balance transfer cards with 0% APR offers. It also suggests negotiating directly with creditors for better rates and working with financial advisors to create sustainable payoff plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of the cryptocurrency Ether has surged, outperforming Bitcoin, as the U.S. Congress passed a significant stablecoin bill known as the GENIUS Act. This legislation is now headed to the President's desk and is poised to become the first major crypto-focused law in the United States, a move seen as a symbolic victory for the industry. Ether-tracking ETFs have also seen record inflows, surpassing those for Bitcoin for the first time. Analysts suggest this could signal a shift in crypto market leadership from Bitcoin to Ethereum.

          <p>This article provides a historical survey of how non-binary gender identities and same-sex relationships have been viewed and treated throughout history. It highlights periods of relative acceptance, such as in ancient Greece and Rome, where figures like Emperor Hadrian openly had male lovers. The article contrasts this with eras of severe persecution, often justified by religious interpretations, which led to draconian punishments. It also explores the existence of third-gender roles in various non-Western cultures and acknowledges the hard-won progress for LGBTQ+ rights in modern times, while emphasizing the need to protect these achievements.</p>

          <p>American Express revealed in its second-quarter report that its affluent customer base continues to spend robustly, with overall card spending up 7%. However, a notable weak spot has emerged in travel, as spending on airline tickets has stalled compared to the previous year. The company's CFO identified domestic economy class airfare as the primary source of this weakness, while spending on premium cabins and luxury hotels remains strong. This trend could be a concern for Amex, given its significant partnerships in the airline industry and the increasing competition in the premium card market. (not investment advice)</p>

Having experienced similar injury setbacks in her own career, Ionescu mentioned she has been in contact with Clark to offer support and perspective.

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess, a move that provides the energy giant with a major stake in Guyana's vast offshore oil reserves. The deal was finalized after an International Chamber of Commerce arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region. Chevron's CEO expressed satisfaction with the outcome, stating it affirms that asset-level rights do not apply to corporate-level mergers. The company anticipates some headcount reductions as it integrates Hess into its operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the interest-earning potential of placing $20,000 into either a long-term certificate of deposit (CD) or a money market account. While money market accounts currently offer slightly higher rates, their variable nature means returns can change over time. In contrast, long-term CDs provide a fixed, guaranteed interest rate, which can be more advantageous in a fluctuating rate environment. The analysis suggests that savers must weigh the potential for higher but uncertain returns from a money market account against the security and predictable earnings of a CD.

          <p>Despite a recent dip in its stock price linked to accelerating beef inflation, some financial analysts are maintaining a positive outlook for Texas Roadhouse. A Bank of America note highlighted that beef prices rose about 15% year-over-year in the second quarter, pressuring the steakhouse chain's margins. However, the bank raised its price target on the stock, citing expectations that the company will continue to gain market share and post strong same-store sales. The long-term view is that the company's best-in-class traffic trends and steady expansion will outweigh the short-term commodity price challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British author Philippa Langley, known for helping find the remains of King Richard III, is now claiming to have solved the 500-year-old mystery of the two princes in the Tower. In her new book, she argues that the young princes, Edward V and his brother Richard, were not murdered by their uncle Richard III as history suggests, but actually survived. Langley's decade-long "Missing Princes Project" has reportedly uncovered documents supporting this thesis, including evidence suggesting one of the princes later led a rebellion under a different name. This new research challenges the conventional narrative popularized by Tudor historians and Shakespeare.</p>

          <p>A popular hiking trail in New York's Adirondack Mountains has been closed for over a month because of a bull moose demonstrating unusual and persistent behaviors. The moose has remained on or near the Goodman Mountain trail and has not responded to attempts by officials to move it. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation suspects the animal may have an underlying illness influencing its behavior. For public safety, the trail will remain closed until authorities can determine it is safe for hikers to return.</p>

          <p>The annual royal swan survey on the River Thames, known as "swan upping," has concluded with optimistic results, showing a notable recovery in the swan population. The five-day count found 115 young swans, a significant increase from the 86 counted last year. This suggests a reversal of a worrying trend that saw numbers plummet by 45% over the past two years, largely due to avian flu and human-related harm. The centuries-old tradition, now focused on conservation, provides hope that the iconic birds are beginning to rebound on the historic river.</p>

          <p>The latest University of Michigan Survey of Consumers shows that Americans' fears about future inflation have significantly decreased, with expectations falling back to levels not seen since before recent tariff announcements. The one-year inflation outlook dropped to 4.4% from 5% in June, while the five-year outlook also declined. This data suggests that while consumers are still wary, they may view the recent price pressures as temporary. The report is considered an encouraging sign for the Federal Reserve as it monitors the economy and plans future monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

Another major unknown is how Shohei Ohtani will be utilized as a pitcher and how his body will hold up under a two-way workload. Additionally, the team needs its star hitters, Freddie Freeman and Mookie Betts, to overcome recent slumps and regain their MVP-level form for a successful postseason run.</p>
