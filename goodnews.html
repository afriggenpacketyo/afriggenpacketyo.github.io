          <p>This article explores Elon Musk's legacy, arguing that he is a visionary figure akin to Cecil Rhodes, who is capable of bending reality to his will. Despite recent criticisms and political setbacks, Musk's space program, SpaceX, has achieved remarkable success. The author highlights Musk's long-term goal of interstellar colonization to save humanity from eventual solar incineration. The piece suggests that Musk's current endeavors in Washington will be seen as minor footnotes if he succeeds in his broader vision of space exploration and ensuring the survival of humanity, which is a key aspect of his overall plan. The article posits that Musk's impact extends beyond mere business or political influence. </p>

          <p>With above-normal temperatures expected this summer, home electricity bills are projected to reach a 12-year high, impacting lower-income households the most. Experts recommend using fans instead of or in addition to air conditioners, setting ceiling fans to rotate counterclockwise, and changing AC filters monthly. Other tips include using indoor plants for shade, keeping curtains closed, limiting oven use, and unplugging small appliances when not in use. Utility companies and state governments offer programs to help residents lower their electricity bills, including rebates for efficient appliances and home energy assessments. The article provides practical advice for managing energy consumption and reducing costs during the summer months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Charles Barkley suggested that the "Inside the NBA" crew might have another show on TNT, even after their emotional farewell and planned move to ESPN. Barkley described the idea as "stupid" and revealed that they taped a pilot that he didn't enjoy. The proposed show would air on TNT when they are not on ESPN, but it would lack basketball highlights and potentially compete with NBA games. While TNT did not comment, Barkley indicated that the show is an attempt to make the crew "earn their money" from TNT, despite the challenges it presents.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Credit card issuers can lower your credit limit without warning due to factors like inactivity, a drop in your credit score, high balances, missed payments, or changes in your financial situation. This can negatively impact your credit score and financial flexibility. To mitigate the impact, contact your issuer for an explanation, request a credit limit increase, review your credit utilization, monitor your credit reports for errors, and consider switching to another card if necessary. Maintaining good financial habits, such as using your cards periodically and paying on time, can help prevent this issue.</p>
