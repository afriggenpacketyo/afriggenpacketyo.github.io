          <p>Chelsea has reached an agreement with Bayern Munich for the transfer of striker Nicolas Jackson in a deal valued at over £70 million. The arrangement involves an initial loan for £14.3 million, which includes a mandatory purchase obligation for £56.2 million based on a minimum number of appearances. The 24-year-old Senegal international joined Chelsea in 2023 and is now set to move to the German club after personal terms for a five-year contract were put in place. The transfer follows a period where Jackson reportedly lost the trust of manager Enzo Maresca.</p>

          <p>Germany is actively pursuing deeper trade and strategic ties with India as a response to global economic uncertainties, including President Trump's tariff policies. German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul is visiting India to explore expanded cooperation in areas like technology, defense, and migration. While bilateral trade hit a record $33 billion in 2024, it remains small compared to Germany's trade with China. Both nations are pushing to finalize an EU-India free trade agreement, though challenges remain, as they seek to build a more resilient economic partnership.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) has approved a new development strategy aimed at shaping its direction until 2035, according to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. The plan was a key outcome of the regional bloc's summit and is intended to promote a multipolar world order. The strategy comes as the SCO, which includes China, Russia, and India, acknowledged growing threats from geopolitical tensions. The summit issued a unified message against unilateral actions and in support of the WTO-centered multilateral trading system, implicitly criticizing U.S. trade policies.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 10:20:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama has announced an ambitious plan for the country to become a fully digital, cashless society by 2030. However, the vision faces considerable challenges, including a large informal economy, particularly in agriculture, and a population that overwhelmingly prefers cash transactions. Financial and cybersecurity experts express skepticism, pointing to the country's vulnerability to cyberattacks and a lack of digital infrastructure. Critics argue that a forced transition could harm small businesses and that the goal is unrealistic without first addressing fundamental issues of financial education and security.</p>

          <p>A coronal mass ejection from the sun is expected to interact with Earth's magnetic field, potentially creating a vibrant display of the northern lights visible across parts of Canada and 18 U.S. states. According to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center, the aurora borealis could be seen late Monday into early Tuesday in northern states from Washington to Maine, and as far south as Illinois and Nebraska. Forecasters suggest finding a dark location away from city lights for the best viewing opportunity, with the geomagnetic storm expected to peak in the early morning hours.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that India has offered to reduce its tariffs on U.S. goods to zero. The claim comes amid ongoing trade tensions and after the U.S. imposed duties as high as 50% on some Indian products. Trump described the U.S.-India trade relationship as "one sided" and suggested the offer should have been made years ago. The statement was made while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, publicly showing solidarity with Chinese and Russian leaders.</p>
