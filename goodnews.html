          <p>Justin Bieber publicly apologized to his wife, Hailey Bieber, for a comment he made years ago stating she would never be on the cover of Vogue. He admitted that he made the statement out of disrespect and a desire to "get even" during a fight. Justin expressed that he and Hailey have matured and realized that such behavior only prolongs intimacy and connection. Hailey, in her Vogue interview, addressed rumors about their marriage and the difficulties of navigating public scrutiny during her postpartum period, emphasizing the importance of shutting out negativity.

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will continue approving updated COVID-19 vaccines for seniors and individuals at high risk of severe disease. However, the agency will require vaccine manufacturers to conduct randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials before approving the vaccines for broader use in healthy individuals between 6 months and 64 years old. This decision comes as the FDA acknowledges the divided opinions on repeat COVID-19 vaccine doses and aims to gather more robust evidence for their benefit in lower-risk populations. The new rules reflect a shift towards risk-based recommendations, similar to those adopted in other developed countries.</p>
