          <h2>Captive-Bred Axolotls Successfully Reintroduced to Mexican Wetlands</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 06:03:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have found that captive-bred axolotls, a critically endangered species native to Mexico City, can thrive in restored wetland environments. A study tracked 18 axolotls released into two aquatic locations, observing that they gained weight and demonstrated hunting and predator avoidance skills. This success is significant because captive animals often lose essential survival behaviors. The findings suggest that reintroduction efforts in suitable habitats can aid in the species' comeback, highlighting the importance of preserving these culturally and scientifically valuable amphibians. The ability of axolotls to survive in man-made habitats also provides hope for mitigating the effects of habitat degradation and climate change on this unique species.</p>
