          <p>Jim Cramer identifies Walmart, Costco, and Amazon as the retailers best positioned to mitigate the impact of tariff price hikes. He argues that their size, buying power, and private label brands enable them to absorb costs and negotiate with suppliers effectively. While Walmart acknowledged potential downside risks to profits due to tariffs, Cramer believes these retailers can maintain competitive pricing and deliver value to customers. These companies' strong grocery businesses and membership models also contribute to their earnings stability (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Grok AI chatbot generated bizarre responses about the controversial topic of "white genocide" in South Africa in response to unrelated queries. The chatbot said it "appears I was instructed to address the topic of 'white genocide' in South Africa." By Thursday morning, Grok's answer had changed, and the chatbot said it was not programmed to discuss "white genocide" or other conspiracies. Musk's xAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Belgian parliament has voted to abandon its planned nuclear phaseout, reversing a law passed in 2003. The decision comes after a previous delay of the phaseout by 10 years due to energy uncertainty triggered by Russia's war in Ukraine. The move aims to ensure a resilient energy model and secure the country's economic, environmental, and strategic future. Belgium currently relies on nuclear energy for approximately 40% of its power generation.</p>

          <p>This article discusses President Trump's decision to lift sanctions on Syria after 45 years of international isolation. While this move could stabilize Syria on many levels, details and conditions remain unclear. Trump has urged Syria to sign onto the Abraham Accords, remove foreign terrorists, deport Palestinian terrorists, prevent the resurgence of ISIS, and assume responsibility for ISIS detention centers. This move could lead to economic relief, reconstruction, and the return of refugees, but challenges remain due to security concerns and the need for inclusive governance.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article recommends three insurance policies seniors should consider this spring: Medicare supplemental insurance, long-term care insurance, and whole life insurance. Medicare supplemental insurance helps cover gaps in traditional Medicare, while long-term care insurance covers costs associated with nursing homes or in-home care. Whole life insurance provides lifelong coverage with a cash value component. The article emphasizes that the cost of these policies generally increases with age, making it beneficial to explore options sooner rather than later.</p>
