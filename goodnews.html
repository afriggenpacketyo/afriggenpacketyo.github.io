        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial analysts are increasingly advising Apple to make a significant acquisition in the artificial intelligence sector, specifically suggesting the AI-powered search engine Perplexity. The move is seen as necessary for Apple to transition from a passive "toll taker" to a proactive AI leader, especially as its current business model faces legal challenges like the DOJ's antitrust case against Google, which threatens a lucrative search agreement. Melius analyst Ben Reitzes proposed that acquiring Perplexity and launching a subscription service could cause Apple's stock to surge, a sentiment echoed by CNBC's Jim Cramer.

          <p>Adolfo Macias, the notorious leader of Ecuador's Los Choneros gang known as "Fito," has been extradited to the United States and pleaded not guilty to multiple federal charges. This marks the first direct extradition from Ecuador to the U.S. Macias, who had previously escaped from an Ecuadorian prison, faces charges including international cocaine distribution and weapons trafficking, which could result in a life sentence. His gang is classified as a terrorist organization in Ecuador and is known for its extreme violence and ties to Mexican cartels.</p>

          <p>Design software maker Figma has updated its IPO prospectus, aiming to raise as much as $1 billion and targeting a fully diluted valuation between $14.6 billion and $16.4 billion. The company plans to sell approximately 37 million shares priced at $25 to $28 each. This public offering follows a scrapped $20 billion acquisition deal by Adobe, which was blocked by regulators in 2022. Figma's preliminary second-quarter results show strong revenue growth and an increasing operating margin, signaling continued business expansion ahead of its debut on the New York Stock Exchange.

          <p>Yang Hansen, a 7-foot-1 center from China recently drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers, has shared insights into his basketball journey. The 20-year-old revealed that his father, a former pro player, advised him to find a sport to stay healthy after he initially wanted to quit athletics as a child. Yang, who became a star in the Chinese Basketball Association, is set to become just the ninth Chinese player in NBA history. He acknowledges the immense pressure and expectations but says he hopes to follow in the footsteps of legends like Yao Ming.</p>

          <p>A recent report showcases two inspiring stories of individuals helping others through personal challenges and generosity. One story features Brian Flynn, a man who became a rare double living organ donor by donating a kidney to a stranger and later part of his liver to a 4-year-old boy. The other highlights Rachel Bee, a teenager diagnosed with Crohn's disease who invented "Infusion Hero," a sweatshirt with a zippered sleeve to provide comfort and warmth for patients during IV treatments. Both individuals have found profound meaning and purpose by turning their experiences into opportunities to improve the lives of others.</p>

          <p>UK media regulator Ofcom has warned that the future of public service broadcasting is at risk if younger audiences do not engage with its content. In a new report, Ofcom suggested that platforms like YouTube should give more prominence to videos from broadcasters such as the BBC, ITV, and Channel 4, particularly in news and children's programming. The watchdog argued that with children spending significantly more time on YouTube, urgent collaboration is needed to make public service media more discoverable. Ofcom even suggested the government could consider legislation to enforce this prominence.</p>

          <p>Filing for a tax extension with the IRS provides an additional six months to submit your tax return, but it does not delay the deadline for payment. Taxpayers must still estimate their tax liability and pay what they owe by the original April 15 deadline to avoid penalties and interest. The late payment penalty is typically 0.5% of the unpaid amount per month, while interest accrues daily on the outstanding balance. For those unable to pay their full tax bill, the IRS offers options such as installment agreements or, in cases of severe financial hardship, an Offer in Compromise. (not investment advice)</p>

The judge ruled that the planning authority's decision was a "planning judgment rationally exercised," though the campaign group has indicated it may seek to challenge the ruling.</p>
