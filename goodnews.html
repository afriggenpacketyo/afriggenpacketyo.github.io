          <p>The Indiana Pacers orchestrated a remarkable comeback, overcoming a double-digit deficit in the fourth quarter to defeat the New York Knicks 138-135 in overtime in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals. Aaron Nesmith's impressive performance, including six consecutive three-pointers, fueled the Pacers' rally. Tyrese Haliburton hit a game-tying shot at the end of regulation. Despite Jalen Brunson's 43 points for the Knicks, the Pacers secured the victory, marking their third comeback win this season when trailing by seven or more points in the final minute of a playoff game. The series is a rematch of the second round last year, which Indiana won in seven games against an injury-riddled Knicks squad.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has confirmed that Canada is in high-level discussions with the United States about potentially joining President Trump's proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense program. The program, estimated to cost $175 billion, aims to develop a multilayered defense system against various missile threats. Carney emphasized the growing missile threats, including those from space, and stated that Canada is taking these threats seriously. He added that Canada has the ability to partner with the US in completing the Golden Dome with investments, but did not provide further details on potential contributions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New calculations suggest that Jupiter was once significantly larger, with a volume 2 to 2.5 times its current size, just 3.8 million years after the first solid materials formed in the Solar System. Astronomers Konstantin Batygin and Fred Adams based their findings on the study of the orbital motions of Jupiter's moons, Amalthea and Thebe. Their research supports the bottom-up method of planet formation for the gas giant. This discovery provides a valuable benchmark for understanding the evolution of Jupiter and its role in the Solar System's development. The team's work gives us a new tool for understanding Jupiter and its role in the Solar System, where it is thought to have played a vital part in stabilizing the planets enough so that life could emerge on Earth.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a bill that would provide $1,000 to every American baby born between January 1, 2025, and January 1, 2029, to be invested in financial markets. Initially called "MAGA accounts," the name was changed to "Trump accounts." These accounts would allow parents and third parties to contribute post-tax income, but gains would also be taxed upon withdrawal. Tax experts have expressed confusion over the purpose of these accounts, noting they function similarly to typical investment accounts without the tax advantages of retirement or health savings accounts.</p>

          <p>The European Union is providing Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty with millions of dollars in emergency funding after the Trump administration withheld $75 million previously designated by Congress. The network, which provides non-ideological news coverage to countries in Eastern Europe and neighboring states, has been facing financial challenges due to the withheld funds. The EU's support aims to ensure the survival of Radio Liberty's independent journalism. The move highlights the value Europeans place on the network's work and its importance in their news ecosystem, particularly its reporting on Russia and Hungary. This situation also raises the possibility of a more stable funding model combining European and American contributions.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has launched a revamped gasoline subsidy program aimed at reducing prices by 10 yen per liter to alleviate cost-of-living pressures for consumers. The subsidy, which started Thursday, provides a fixed sum to wholesalers regardless of prices. The government aims to reduce wholesale gasoline prices by 7.40 yen per liter in the first week, with further reductions planned until mid-June. The program is expected to last until the end of March 2026, with around 1 trillion yen allocated to the subsidies. The reintroduction of the subsidies comes ahead of the House of Councillors election.</p>

This agreement suggests that the yen's weakness against the dollar should no longer be a major issue in tariff talks. Both sides reaffirmed their belief that exchange rates should be market-determined. Japan has repeatedly denied engaging in currency manipulation and reiterated its opposition to additional tariffs.

          <p>Emerging markets stocks are gaining attention as the "sell U.S." narrative gains momentum, fueled by Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Bank of America and JPMorgan have highlighted emerging markets as a promising investment opportunity due to factors like a weaker U.S. dollar, China's economic recovery, and attractive valuations. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date. Concerns about U.S. assets, including a selloff in Treasurys and equities, have further boosted the appeal of emerging markets. (not investment advice)</p>
