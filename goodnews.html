          <p>Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) offer homeowners access to significant equity, but various hidden fees can substantially increase borrowing costs. Beyond interest rates, borrowers should be aware of application and processing fees, appraisal costs, and annual maintenance or inactivity fees. Additional expenses can include closing costs similar to mortgages, early termination penalties if the HELOC is closed too soon, and transaction fees for accessing funds. Careful planning and comparing offers from multiple lenders are crucial to minimize these charges and maximize the benefits of a HELOC. (not investment advice)</p>

This target aims to strengthen industrial leadership and energy security while progressing towards net-zero by 2050. A controversial "flexibility clause" would allow member states to offset up to 3% of emissions by purchasing international carbon credits, drawing criticism from activists who argue it diverts domestic investment and lacks oversight.
