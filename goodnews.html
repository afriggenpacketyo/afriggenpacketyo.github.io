          <p>Argentinian authorities are intensifying their search for an 18th-century Italian portrait, believed to have been looted by a fugitive Nazi officer 80 years ago, after its unexpected reappearance in a real estate advertisement. The painting, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Vittore Ghislandi, was originally stolen from Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker and later acquired by Friedrich Kadgien, who eventually settled in Argentina after World War II. Police recently raided a seaside villa, finding German documents from the 1940s but not the artwork itself. The renewed investigation was sparked by Dutch newspaper reporters who recognized the painting in an advertisement for a home potentially owned by Kadgien's descendants, bringing hope for its recovery.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Darren Aronofsky's latest film, "Caught Stealing," is reviewed as a bruising and grimy crime caper set in a vividly rendered 1998 New York City, starring Austin Butler as Hank Thompson. Butler portrays a former baseball player whose life descends into peril after a series of unfortunate events, including saving a cow and agreeing to watch a cat. Hank becomes unwillingly entangled with various dangerous criminal factions, from Russian thugs to Hassidic hitmen, all while being pursued by a hard-nosed NYPD detective. The article praises the film, adapted from Charlie Huston's novel, for its intimate, affectionate yet gritty portrayal of pre-millennial Alphabet City, showcasing a New York teeming with menace, humor, and a palpable sense of place.</p>

          <p>Chinese retail stock traders are experiencing a robust bull run, with some, like Shanghai software engineer Jacky Jia, reporting over 30 percent returns this year and anticipating further gains into next year. This widespread optimism is fueled by government pledges to stabilize the stock market amidst a shaky economy, driven by the belief that a rising market can generate a "wealth effect" to spur consumption. Investors are strategically concentrating their equity exposure in high-beta stocks, including new-consumer, consumer-electronics, software, and hardware companies. The article highlights a prevailing sentiment of confidence among individual traders, despite broader economic challenges, banking on continued market support and liquidity for more gains.

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $950 million for Saturday night's drawing, following the absence of a grand prize winner in the previous $850 million drawing. This substantial sum now ranks as the sixth-largest Powerball jackpot in history, carrying an estimated cash value of $428.9 million before taxes. Matt Strawn, Powerball Product Group chair, noted a significant doubling in ticket sales as the prize grew, emphasizing that participation also contributes to good causes in communities. A single jackpot winner would have the choice of taking a lump sum payment or opting for a payout via an annuity with increasing annual payments, as no one has claimed the top prize since May 31st.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Uncover "Hypercarnivore" Crocodile Relative That Preyed on Dinosaurs</h2>

          <p>Scientists in Argentina have announced the discovery of a new "hypercarnivore" crocodile-relative species, named Kostensuchus atrox, which terrorized dinosaurs approximately 70 million years ago. The remarkably well-preserved fossil, unearthed in the Chorrillo Formation, indicates that this apex predator likely reached about 3.5 meters (11.5 ft) in length and weighed around 250 kg (551 pounds). K. atrox possessed a wide, powerful jaw with large, shearing teeth, capable of devouring even medium-sized dinosaurs, making it the second-largest known predator from this rich fossil site. This significant discovery expands the known diversity of fossil vertebrates from the late Cretaceous period, offering new insights into the ancient Patagonian ecosystem and its formidable inhabitants.</p>

          <p>South Korea's central bank held its policy rate at 2.5% for the second straight meeting, prioritizing further assessment of housing prices and household debt, particularly in the Seoul metropolitan area. While acknowledging stable inflation and "modest improvement" in overall economic growth, the Bank of Korea notably upgraded its 2025 inflation forecast to 2% and GDP growth to 0.9%. The bank anticipates a modest recovery in domestic demand but warns of a gradual slowdown in exports due to the expanding impacts of US tariffs. This decision follows recent agreements with the US, including significant investment pledges and reduced tariffs for South Korean exports, influencing the economic outlook.

          <p>A deeply symbolic train ride from Chicago to Mississippi commemorated 70 years since the brutal lynching of Emmett Till, a pivotal event that ignited the modern Civil Rights Movement. Among the solemn passengers was Rev. Wheeler Parker Jr., Till's cousin and the last surviving eyewitness to his kidnapping in 1955. The journey deliberately mirrored the fateful trip Till, then 14, took before his murder for allegedly whistling at a white woman. His mother, Mamie Till, famously insisted on an open-casket funeral in Chicago, and the harrowing images of his disfigured body spurred national outrage and galvanized the fight for racial justice across America.</p>

          <p>USC has officially offered Notre Dame a multi-year extension to their historic 100-year-old football rivalry, aiming to quell public outcry over its potential termination. USC Athletic Director Jennifer Cohen expressed strong optimism for reaching a deal "very soon," acknowledging Notre Dame's clear preference for a long-term commitment. Previously, USC hesitated due to uncertainties surrounding the College Football Playoff format and the new demands of its Big Ten travel schedule. The primary sticking point in negotiations remains the game's date, as USC seeks to move it earlier in the season to better balance its demanding schedule, while Notre Dame has less incentive to alter the cherished tradition.</p>

          <p>Cardi B's defense in a civil assault trial received a significant boost from the testimony of an obstetrician and his receptionist, who largely contradicted the plaintiff's claims. Security guard Emani Ellis alleges the rapper assaulted her in 2018, seeking $24 million in damages. Cardi B, whose real name is Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar, testified she never touched or scratched Ellis, only exchanging heated words. The receptionist stated she observed Ellis corner Cardi B and then reach for the rapper, resulting in a cut on her own forehead, which the doctor confirmed Ellis caused. This testimony provided crucial support for the rapper's case, as the defense concluded its presentation at the end of Wednesday's session.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected quarterly results, with revenue growing 56% year-over-year to $46.7 billion and adjusted earnings per share exceeding estimates. Despite this robust performance, shares fell in extended trading, as some investors sought an even rosier outlook and noted slight shortfalls in data center revenue. CEO Jensen Huang expressed strong confidence in record-breaking years ahead, projecting AI infrastructure spending to reach $3-4 trillion by decade-end, with Nvidia poised to be a significant beneficiary. The article emphasizes Nvidia's commanding position in the AI revolution through its high-performance GPUs and growing software business, despite market reactions to exceptionally high expectations.
