          <p>The anglicized phrase "Das crazy" has been chosen as Germany's Youth Word of the Year, reflecting the strong influence of English and internet meme culture on the language of young Germans. The term, a grammatically incorrect mix of German and English, is used to express surprise or speechlessness in a humorous way. Its selection highlights a trend towards brevity and cross-cultural linguistic blending, originating from social media platforms and online chats where such expressions are common.</p>

          <p>A citizen-led group in Missouri, People Not Politicians, is actively collecting signatures to place a referendum on the 2026 ballot, aiming to overturn a new congressional map they argue is gerrymandered. The Republican-backed map, signed into law recently, targets a historically Democratic district in Kansas City. Despite facing legal challenges from the state's attorney general and secretary of state, the volunteer effort has gained significant momentum and support from residents who feel their voting power is being diluted.</p>

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge advises parents that delaying children's access to smartphones and social media can contribute to greater happiness and success in adulthood.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warren Buffett outlines his perspective on investing by dividing assets into three categories: currency-based, non-productive, and productive. He places gold in the non-productive category, arguing that its value is purely speculative as it generates no intrinsic return and relies on the hope that someone will buy it for a higher price in the future. In contrast, Buffett champions productive assets, such as farms and businesses, which create tangible value over time, making them the cornerstone of his investment strategy.

This contrasts sharply with Gen Z men, whose political views are more varied. The analysis suggests that issues with direct personal impact, such as reproductive rights and economic instability, along with a deep-seated disillusionment with the existing political duopoly, are primary drivers of this strong leftist identification among young women.</p>
