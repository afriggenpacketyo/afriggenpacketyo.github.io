          <p>This article highlights two individuals making a significant impact on others' lives through personal sacrifice and innovation. Brian Flynn, in a quest for meaning, became a rare double living organ donor, first donating a kidney to a stranger and later part of his liver to a 4-year-old boy. Separately, teenager Rachel Bee, diagnosed with Crohn's disease, invented "Infusion Hero," a specialized sweatshirt with zippered sleeves to provide warmth and comfort to patients during IV treatments. Both stories showcase how personal challenges and a desire to help can lead to extraordinary outcomes.</p>

          <p>UK media regulator Ofcom has warned that the future of public service media (PSM), including the BBC and Channel 4, is under a "serious threat" as younger audiences increasingly favor platforms like YouTube. The watchdog suggests that to remain relevant, broadcasters must create more content for these platforms and that YouTube should give more prominence to their videos, particularly news and children's programming. Ofcom has proposed a six-point plan, including the possibility of new legislation to ensure PSM content is easily discoverable, to help preserve British culture and trusted news sources.</p>

          <p>Shares of CoreWeave, a company that rents artificial intelligence data centers, climbed over 5% after it announced plans for a $1.5 billion bond sale. The capital raised from the notes, which are due in 2031, will be used for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment. This follows a previous successful debt offering and a major data center project announcement, contributing to the company's stock price more than tripling since its Nasdaq debut. The strong investor interest signals confidence in the company's role in the expanding AI infrastructure market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Figma, the popular collaborative design software company, is moving forward with its initial public offering, expecting to raise up to $1 billion by selling shares priced between $25 and $28 each. This pricing could give the company a fully diluted valuation as high as $16.4 billion, exceeding its last private valuation of $12.5 billion. The IPO comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was scrapped due to regulatory hurdles. Figma's public filing shows continued revenue growth and a slight increase in operating margin, signaling a potentially strong debut on the market. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies a common misconception about filing for a tax extension with the IRS. While requesting an extension grants an additional six months to submit a tax return, it does not postpone the deadline for paying any taxes owed. The IRS still requires taxpayers to estimate their liability and pay it by the original April deadline to avoid penalties and interest charges. For those unable to pay their full tax bill, the IRS offers several options, including installment plans and, in cases of significant financial hardship, an Offer in Compromise.</p>

England currently leads the five-Test series 2-1 and can secure a series victory with a win in Manchester. Pace bowler Chris Woakes retains his place in the team, while Gus Atkinson was not risked following a recent hamstring injury.</p>

The international project team, ProjectXplore, positively identified the wreck at a depth of 82 meters using the ship's name stamp, dimensions, and other matching historical records.

          <p>The All England Club's plans to nearly triple the size of the Wimbledon tennis grounds can move forward after a High Court judge dismissed a legal challenge from a local campaign group. The proposal includes 38 new courts and an 8,000-seat stadium on land formerly occupied by a golf club. The group, Save Wimbledon Park, had argued the development was unlawful because the land was protected for public recreation. The judge ruled that the planning authority's decision was a "planning judgment rationally exercised," clearing the way for the major expansion.</p>
