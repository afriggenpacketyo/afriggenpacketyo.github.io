          <p>Candy manufacturer Mars has partnered with biotech company Pairwise to use CRISPR gene-editing technology to develop more sustainable and resilient cocoa plants. The collaboration aims to protect the global chocolate supply by creating cacao varieties that can better withstand diseases, heat, and other climate-related threats. This initiative mirrors similar efforts in the agricultural industry, such as Starbucks' investment in climate-resilient coffee farms. Gene editing offers a faster and more precise method for crop improvement compared to traditional breeding techniques.</p>

          <p>A human foot found inside a hiking shoe on the shore of Utah's Fish Lake has been identified as belonging to David White, a man who went missing in 1997. The shoe, a model produced for only one year, helped investigators connect the discovery to the cold case. White had disappeared while fishing, with his empty boat found trolling across the lake at the time. DNA testing confirmed the remains were a parental match to White's daughter with 99.9994% certainty. The discovery provides long-awaited closure for the family and the original search and rescue members.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Angels slugger Yoan Moncada was placed on the restricted list and missed Tuesday's game for a significant personal reason: to take his U.S. citizenship test. The 30-year-old infielder, originally from Cuba, signed with the Boston Red Sox as a highly-touted international free agent in 2015 before being traded to the Chicago White Sox. Moncada, who has maintained his Cuban citizenship and played for Team Cuba in the World Baseball Classic, is now taking a major step in his life off the field. It is not yet known if he will be available for the team's next game.</p>

The investment will focus on bringing more of its supply chain and advanced manufacturing to the U.S., including a recent deal with MP Materials to produce magnets for iPhones in Texas. This move comes as Trump continues to pressure Apple to shift production from China and India to the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Four rare Barbary lion cubs have made their public debut at a zoo in the Czech Republic, representing hope for a breed that is extinct in the wild. The cubs—three females and one male—are part of an international endangered species program aimed at preserving their lineage in captivity. The Barbary lion, native to North Africa, was wiped out in the wild by the 1960s due to human activities. The Dvůr Králové Safari Park is working with Moroccan authorities on a long-term plan to potentially reintroduce the majestic species to its natural habitat in the Atlas Mountains, a complex but vital conservation goal.</p>

          <p>Following a destructive fire that ravaged the community of Altadena, resident Laurie Scott has started a free plant stand called "Regrow Altadena" to help her neighbors find solace and hope. After losing part of her own property, Scott realized the comfort a simple houseplant could bring and began propagating cuttings to give away. The stand, which now distributes hundreds of plants and seed packets, has become a symbol of resilience, with community members contributing everything from saplings to handmade pots. The initiative aims to restore the green spaces lost in the fire and provide residents with a tangible connection to growth and recovery.</p>

          <p>The Italian government has given its final approval for a €13.5 billion project to build the world's longest suspension bridge, connecting Sicily with the mainland region of Calabria. The 3.3-kilometer bridge is designed to withstand earthquakes in one of the Mediterranean's most seismically active zones. Proponents, including Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, champion the project as a major investment that will create jobs and stimulate economic growth in two of Europe's poorest regions. However, the plan faces strong opposition over costs, environmental impact, and fears of mafia involvement, and must still clear regulatory hurdles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When planning for retirement, both certificates of deposit (CDs) and annuities offer low-risk options, but they serve different purposes. CDs are simple, safe, and FDIC-insured, making them ideal for short-term goals and capital preservation, though their returns often fail to outpace inflation. Annuities, however, are specifically designed to provide a guaranteed income stream for life, addressing the risk of outliving one's savings, a primary concern for many retirees. While more complex and less liquid, annuities can offer higher periodic payments by pooling longevity risk. The best choice depends on an individual's specific needs. (not investment advice)</p>
