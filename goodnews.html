          <p>Taiwan's coast guard is requesting additional funding to enhance coastal surveillance following several undetected landings by mainland Chinese individuals using inflatable boats on sensitive Taiwanese shores. The request was prompted by two incidents: a father and son who claimed to be fleeing persecution and a man who allegedly crossed the strait, raised a Chinese flag, and returned. Authorities are investigating the authenticity of the latter incident, while also considering the feasibility of such crossings. The coast guard is working to improve surveillance and response capabilities to safeguard Taiwan's coastal regions. (not investment advice)</p>

Opposition parties have called for Eto's resignation, but Ishiba maintains that Eto should focus on addressing agricultural challenges, including mitigating the impact of inflation and higher tariffs.

          <p>Japan's animation industry is increasingly adopting AI to address labor shortages and boost production, despite concerns among artists about copyright infringement. Japanese copyright law permits using copyrighted materials to train AI models, attracting investment but worrying artists, 94% of whom have copyright concerns. The industry faces challenges like overworked and underpaid animators, leading studios to use AI for coloring, background generation, and converting media into anime. While AI is seen as a supportive tool, some fear job losses, but others emphasize that AI cannot replace human creativity and visual judgment, integrating technology into anime production and culture.</p>
