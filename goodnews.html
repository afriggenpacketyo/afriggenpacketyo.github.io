          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the U.S. government from deporting a group of ten unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala. The ruling came after lawyers argued that the planned deportations would circumvent legal protections established by Congress specifically for these vulnerable minors. The plaintiffs' attorneys contend that the children could face abuse, neglect, or persecution if they are returned. A hearing on the matter has been scheduled to further review the case.</p>

          <p>Musician John Fogerty, now 80, has released a new album of re-recorded Creedence Clearwater Revival hits after finally regaining the rights to his extensive song catalog. For decades, legal battles left him without control over his own music, a painful experience that led him to stop performing his most famous songs for a period. Encouraged by his wife and joined by his sons in the studio, Fogerty revisited classics like "Proud Mary" to create "John's Version," triumphantly reclaiming his musical legacy.</p>

          <p>The UK has finalized its largest-ever warship export deal by value, a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The deal is expected to support 4,000 UK jobs, particularly at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the advanced anti-submarine vessels will be built. This strategic partnership significantly strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 British and Norwegian frigates that will operate jointly in the region.

          <p>In a humorous commentary piece, comedian Jim Gaffigan shares his annual struggles with his summer garden, specifically an overwhelming surplus of cucumbers. He details his cycle of optimistic planting in May, which inevitably leads to the August realization that his "succession planting" strategy has produced far more produce than his family can possibly consume. The article lightheartedly captures the relatable plight of an amateur gardener who finds himself buried under the literal fruits of his own labor.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author, a self-described liberal, makes the case that hunting is a more honest and sustainable way to consume meat than relying on the factory-farmed products common in supermarkets. She describes the emotional and ethical complexities of taking an animal's life, while also arguing that hunters are often deeply invested in conservation and wildlife management. The author challenges the reflexive disdain for hunting on the left, suggesting that hunters and vegetarians share more common ground on food ethics than either group might admit.</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, highlights the little-known story of how surfing first arrived on the U.S. mainland in 1885. Three teenage Hawaiian princes—David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui—were studying at a nearby military school when they fashioned surfboards from local redwood trees. Their public demonstration of the "royal sport" at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River captivated locals and planted the seeds for the sport's eventual explosion in popularity across America.</p>
