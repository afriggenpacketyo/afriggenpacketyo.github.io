          <h2>CATL Shares Surge in Hong Kong Debut Amid US-China Tensions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 23:45:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Limited (CATL), the world's largest EV battery maker, experienced a significant share jump in its Hong Kong debut, raising almost HK$35.7bn. The listing, however, excluded onshore U.S. investors due to escalating tensions between the United States and China. The company, labeled a Chinese military company by the Pentagon, denies these allegations, and plans to use the funds raised to expand its European operations, particularly in Hungary, to supply batteries to major automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW and Volkswagen. The share sale marks a shift from a decade ago when Chinese companies sought U.S. listings.</p>

          <p>Sesame Street has partnered with Netflix to ensure its continued availability after federal funding for PBS was cut. Netflix will offer a new season of the show and 90 hours of previous episodes to its subscribers, while PBS will also retain access to the new episodes. The show has been a cornerstone of children's media for over five decades, using entertaining lessons and characters like Elmo and Cookie Monster to teach children about various topics, from music education to healthy eating habits. The move reflects Netflix's increasing focus on children's content.</p>

          <p>In-N-Out Burger is modifying its menu to comply with upcoming FDA regulations phasing out petroleum-based synthetic dyes. The West Coast chain will remove red dye No. 40 from its strawberry shake and pink lemonade, replacing it with beta carotene and vegetable juice. Additionally, the company is switching from high fructose corn syrup to real sugar in its ketchup and introducing Stevia Leaf Extract as a healthier sweetener option. This shift aligns with the Trump administration's goal to "Make America Healthy Again" by eliminating synthetic dyes linked to neurological problems in children.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) jumped as much as 14% in their Hong Kong trading debut, reflecting strong investor confidence in the electric vehicle (EV) battery manufacturer. CATL raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion) in its IPO, the largest global listing in 2025. The company plans to use the funds to build a factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients including Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. The company's global expansion efforts coincide with expansions from leading Chinese EV makers such as BYD, despite challenges posed by U.S.-China trade tensions.</p>

          <h2>China Attracts Capital Inflow Amid Trade War</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions with the United States, China saw a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April. This influx contrasts with concerns over rising Treasury yields and Moody's downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest this reflects a shift away from US dollar assets since President Trump initiated the trade war. Bank of America analysts highlight a weaker US dollar, peaking US bond yields, and China's economic recovery as factors favoring emerging markets.</p>

          <p>China's central bank reduced its key lending rates by 10 basis points, marking the first cut in seven months. The 1-year loan prime rate (LPR) was lowered to 3.0% from 3.1%, and the 5-year LPR to 3.5% from 3.6%. This move aims to boost the economy amidst easing trade tensions and a stronger yuan. The rate cuts came as state-backed commercial lenders reduced deposit rates, paving the way for lower lending rates.</p>
