          <p>Following the Colorado Buffaloes' first season loss to Georgia Tech, former quarterback Shedeur Sanders voiced his support for the team. The game marked the team's first outing without Sanders and Travis Hunter, who both entered the NFL Draft. Despite the 27-20 defeat, Sanders stated on social media that the team will "figure things out" under the leadership of his father, head coach Deion Sanders. Coach Sanders echoed this sentiment, noting the game was closely contested and that the team needs to capitalize on opportunities moving forward.</p>

          <p>Receding water levels in Iraq's largest reservoir, the Mosul Dam, have revealed 40 ancient tombs believed to be over 2,300 years old. The discovery was made in the Khanke region of Duhok province as a result of a severe, five-year drought that has plagued the country. Archaeologists were able to access the site after water levels dropped to historic lows, allowing for excavation of the Hellenistic-period tombs. While the drought has had devastating effects on agriculture and electricity, it has paradoxically created opportunities for significant archaeological finds in the region.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has reportedly rejected a proposal from Crystal Palace that would have sent defender Joe Gomez to the London club on loan as part of a deal for Marc Guehi. Crystal Palace is exploring options as Guehi has indicated he will not sign a new contract, making a transfer likely to avoid losing him on a free transfer next summer. While Palace was reportedly open to a deal around £30 million plus the Gomez loan, Liverpool is not currently interested in letting Gomez leave. The situation highlights the complex negotiations underway as the transfer window deadline approaches.</p>

          <p>Anthony D. Fredericks, a 78-year-old retired professor and author, attributes his "razor sharp" memory to five key daily practices. He emphasizes the importance of regular social interaction to combat stress and depression, which can contribute to memory loss. Fredericks also advocates for lifelong learning by reading widely, using an organizational system like color-coded notes, and engaging in daily physical activity to increase blood flow to the brain. Finally, he stresses the significance of a healthy diet, proper hydration, and getting at least seven hours of sleep each night for optimal cognitive function.</p>

          <p>According to the latest rankings from The Princeton Review, Princeton University offers the best return on investment (ROI) among private colleges in the U.S. Despite a high sticker price, generous financial aid brings the average annual cost down significantly for eligible students, who go on to earn high median incomes. The list, which also includes Caltech, MIT, and Stanford, was determined by evaluating factors like financial aid, academic rigor, and post-graduation earnings. Many top private institutions leverage large endowments to offer substantial aid, making them a valuable long-term investment for many families. (not investment advice)</p>

His heart had become so damaged it was described as "hard like cement." After his family performed CPR, Reid was hospitalized and remained unconscious for weeks, relying on life support. Following a difficult recovery period, he became a candidate for a dual heart and kidney transplant, which he successfully underwent in February 2024.

          <p>Indian cuisine in the United States is undergoing a transformation, moving beyond "cheap food and curry houses" to a sophisticated, upscale dining segment. Restaurateurs like Vikas Khanna are finding success with high-end establishments that explore the vast diversity of India's regional cuisines, rather than relying on a few stereotypical dishes. This evolution is driven by a growing consumer interest in global flavors, an increasingly affluent Indian American population, and a post-pandemic desire for unique dining experiences. The trend is also attracting significant investor interest, with private equity firms now backing popular Indian restaurant chains.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article by an attorney who argued key flag-burning cases before the Supreme Court analyzes President Trump's recent executive order targeting the act. The author explains that the Supreme Court has twice affirmed that flag-burning is a form of protected speech under the First Amendment. The executive order's directive to prosecute under general "content-neutral" burning laws is likely to fail, as it provides defendants with a strong "selective prosecution" defense by openly stating the government's message-based motive. The piece concludes the order is an empty threat that will likely encourage more protest-burnings rather than prevent them.</p>

          <p>Two major new studies have found that beta-blockers, a standard treatment for decades following a heart attack, provide no benefit for the majority of patients with preserved heart function. Furthermore, the research revealed that for women with little heart damage, the drug may significantly increase the risk of another heart attack, hospitalization, or death. These findings are expected to reshape international treatment guidelines, which have long recommended the drug. The lack of benefit is attributed to modern advances in treatment, such as the immediate use of stents and blood thinners, which have improved outcomes significantly.</p>
