          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£900 million to boost both major sporting events and grassroots facilities across the nation, marking a significant investment aimed at transforming the sports landscape. Over half of the funds, exceeding ¬£0.5 billion, will support the delivery of prominent international events like Euro 2028, co-hosted by the UK and Ireland, as well as the 2026 European Athletics Championships in Birmingham and the Tour de France cycling races in 2027. While the government has already backed these events and is considering a bid for the 2035 Women's World Cup, a decision on supporting London's bid for the 2029 World Athletics Championships is still pending, despite urging from numerous British athletes. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy emphasized that this investment will drive economic growth and create pathways for future sporting heroes. </p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers denied U.S. immigration enforcement agents access to the parking lot at Dodger Stadium, sparking protests and community concern. The team stated its decision via social media, emphasizing that the evening's game would proceed as scheduled, which featured the Dodgers facing off against the San Diego Padres and a celebrity softball game celebrating Black Heritage Night. Homeland security presence came as immigrant communities in LA are on high alert over aggressive and frequent immigration raids, including at workplaces, parking lots, and a swap meet.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that plastic bag bans and fees are effectively reducing shoreline pollution, with up to a 47% decrease in plastic bag waste collected during beach cleanups in areas with such policies. Researchers analyzed data from over 45,000 beach cleanups between 2016 and 2023, cross-referencing it with local bag policies. The study found that fee-based policies were more effective than full or partial bans, suggesting that policy design is crucial. California's experience with plastic bag regulations highlights this, as an initial ban led to an increase in thicker plastic bag waste due to a loophole, however, a new ban set to take effect in 2026 aims to eliminate single-use plastic bags entirely.</p>
