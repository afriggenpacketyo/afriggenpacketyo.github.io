          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake was recorded in the New York City and New Jersey region on Saturday night, with its epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. While residents reported feeling brief shaking, there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, such minor quakes are not unusual for the East Coast and are not expected to cause significant damage. The event follows a larger 4.8 magnitude earthquake that occurred in the same region in April 2024.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the wife of a U.S. Marine Corps veteran and mother of two young children, has been released from ICE detention after being held for two months. Clouatre, who was breastfeeding her newborn at the time, was detained in May during what she believed was a routine green card application interview. Her detention stemmed from a years-old deportation order she was unaware of, issued after her mother, who had abandoned her, missed an immigration hearing. Her case highlights the administration's intensified immigration enforcement, which is creating challenges even for military families.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's anti-corruption agencies have arrested a member of parliament and several other officials in connection with a large-scale bribery scheme involving military procurement. The officials are accused of inflating the prices of contracts for drones and electronic warfare systems by up to 30%. President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed the arrests, stating there is "zero tolerance" for corruption. The development comes shortly after the independence of Ukraine's anti-corruption bodies was restored following public protests, a move seen as crucial for the nation's bid to join the European Union.</p>

          <p>Former UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana are launching a new left-wing political party but have yet to decide on a name. The venture, which they claim has over 600,000 registered supporters, is inviting its followers to help choose a name that reflects its core values. While names like "The Left" have been suggested, the final choice must be approved by the Electoral Commission, which has strict rules to prevent confusion with existing parties. The move highlights the challenge of creating a modern, resonant brand in a political landscape dominated by historic party names.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have officially committed to Luka Dončić as the franchise's centerpiece, signing him to a three-year, $165-million contract extension. The move formalizes the 26-year-old's status as the team's leader, a shift that intensifies questions about the future of LeBron James. James, who is under contract for only one more season, was not present at the celebratory press conference. General manager Rob Pelinka expressed hope that James would retire a Laker but acknowledged the decision rests with James and his family, signaling an uncertain dynamic between the established superstar and the newly anointed one.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has revealed that the early death of his stepfather was a key motivator for his decision to leave medicine and pursue a career in entertainment. In an interview, Hill, who qualified as a doctor in 1988, explained that he felt unsuited for the emotional demands of the medical profession. Witnessing his stepfather pass away at age 54 before he could enjoy retirement solidified his resolve to follow his passion for comedy. Hill recalled the immense relief he felt upon leaving his hospital job for the last time, embarking on a new path that was both exciting and terrifying.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have likely solved the 80-year-old mystery of what killed a platypus sent to Winston Churchill as a gift from Australia during World War Two. The platypus, named Winston, died just days before reaching England in 1943, with long-held rumors blaming shell-shock from a nearby Nazi submarine encounter. However, new analysis of the platypus attendant's logbook by university researchers reveals the more probable cause was heatstroke. The records show that water and air temperatures on the ship climbed well above the safe threshold for the species as it crossed the equator, suggesting the animal was essentially cooked alive.</p>

          <p>NPR's media correspondent David Folkenflik discusses the complexities of covering the media industry, particularly when his own employer is in the headlines. He explains the formal protocol and editorial firewall that allow him to report on NPR with independence, treating it as he would any other major news outlet. Folkenflik notes the current challenging environment, with an administration actively pressuring news organizations through lawsuits and defunding efforts. He emphasizes that his primary role is to report the facts fairly, even when it involves internal network matters or creates tension with corporate leadership.</p>
