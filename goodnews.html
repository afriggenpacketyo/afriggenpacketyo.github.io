          <p>Chinese scientists claim to have found a solution to a major issue with hyperloop technology, potentially salvaging the concept of ultra-high-speed ground travel. Researchers found that even minor imperfections in the track can cause violent low-frequency vibrations in maglev cars traveling at 1,000 km/h. However, they say they have discovered a way to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, making the ride less unpleasant. The engineers are working at the world‚Äôs first full-scale test line in central China.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has updated its recommendations, no longer advising routine COVID-19 shots for healthy children or pregnant women. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cited a lack of data supporting shots for healthy children, while the agency did not offer an explanation for the change regarding pregnant women. Some experts disagree, citing the risk of severe illness in infants and pregnant women, while others suggest children's immune systems provide longer-lasting protection and most already have some immunity. The decision sparks debate about the necessity of annual COVID-19 vaccines for these groups.</p>
