        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Food manufacturers are simplifying ingredient lists due to growing consumer concerns about ultra-processed foods, spurred by books like "Ultra-Processed People." Retailers are seeing increased demand for products with fewer ingredients, leading brands to launch less-processed options. However, some nutritionists caution against prioritizing shorter ingredient lists over nutritional value, as fortified nutrients may be omitted. Experts advise food brands to streamline formulas and explore new processing technologies to maintain nutritional retention and extend shelf life, noting that marketing will likely emphasize the benefits and justify higher prices of less processed foods.

          <p>This article explores the history and evolution of teen movies, highlighting how they reflect societal anxieties and moral panics surrounding teenagers. From the rebellious teens of the 1950s to the stressed-out overachievers of the 21st century, teen movies have consistently captured the fears and fascinations of both teens and adults. The article also notes a shift in recent years, with adults becoming more afraid for teens than of them, reflecting concerns about social media, anxiety, and the future. While older teen movies focused on the wild parties and the lack of adult supervision, newer teen movies such as Eighth Grade are more focused on the digital revolution and its impact on teenagers. </p>
