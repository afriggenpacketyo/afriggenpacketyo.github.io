          <p>This opinion piece argues that China's burgeoning private space sector is a key area for future economic growth, with projections showing the global space economy could reach $1.8 trillion by 2035. The article highlights the increasing role of private investment in China's aerospace industry, supported by technological advancements and government backing. It cites successful private companies like i-Space and LandSpace as examples of this trend. The author suggests that Hong Kong is well-positioned to contribute significantly to this expansion, marking a major leap for the nation's presence in space. (not investment advice)</p>

The executive director emphasized that continuing the cultural event is an act of resistance and unity during a difficult time for the community. The series has been a local staple for 18 years, celebrating the city's diverse culture.</p>

          <p>Several start-ups, including London-based Better Dairy, are developing lab-grown cheese using precision fermentation to produce milk proteins without animals, aiming for a market launch in the coming years. These companies hope to overcome the taste and texture issues that have plagued existing plant-based alternatives. However, they face challenges, including regulatory hurdles, high initial costs, and a recent decline in vegan cheese sales. While proponents highlight health and environmental benefits, success will depend on achieving price parity and convincing consumers to embrace this new food technology.</p>

          <p>The British reality TV show "Love Island" is experiencing a revival in viewership for its 12th series, with its growth being significantly driven by social media, particularly TikTok.

The article explores the perspective that as AI technology advances, it could fulfill societal needs traditionally met through family structures, thereby redefining concepts of life and family. This shift could make traditional demographic concerns less critical. The piece reflects the views of younger Chinese urbanites who see AI-powered robots as a viable future alternative for caregiving, reducing the pressure to marry and have children.</p>
