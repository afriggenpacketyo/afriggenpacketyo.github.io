          <h2>Internal Conflict May Have Caused Collapse of Ancient Chinese Sanxingdui Civilization, Scholar Suggests</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New archaeological research suggests that the mysterious collapse of the ancient Sanxingdui civilization in southwestern China may have been caused by an internal conflict. According to a leading scholar, a war for control of the capital city likely occurred during the civilization's later period, leading to the destruction of city walls and religious sites. This internal strife is believed to have spurred a mass exodus of the population from the city. The Sanxingdui ruins, dating back around 4,500 years, are a pivotal archaeological site for understanding early Chinese history.</p>

The 79-year-old singer informed fans that her doctors have advised her to undergo a few medical procedures, which will prevent her from having enough time to rehearse and prepare the show. While not specifying the issue, she recently had to cancel an appearance due to a kidney stone. Parton reassured her fans that she is not quitting the music business and that original tickets will be valid for the new dates.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce a new government initiative aimed at abolishing long-term youth unemployment. Under the plan, young people who have been on Universal Credit for 18 months without working or training will be offered a guaranteed paid work placement. Those who refuse the offer without a reasonable excuse could face sanctions, including the loss of their benefits. The scheme, which builds on a previous "youth guarantee," will be funded from existing budgets and aims to provide young people with the skills necessary to secure full-time employment.</p>

A preceding Politburo meeting emphasized developing "new quality productive forces" through high-tech innovation and strengthening leadership to handle "worst-case scenarios," signaling a focus on resilience and technological self-sufficiency.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-29 02:15:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is launching a new "K visa" program this week, aimed at attracting young foreign graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The new visa category notably does not require a job offer or sponsoring employer, creating a streamlined path for entry, residence, and employment. This move is seen as a direct challenge to the United States, which recently announced a significant fee increase to $100,000 per year for its H-1B worker visas. China's initiative is part of a broader effort to appear more welcoming to foreign talent and investment.</p>

          <p>The pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), led by President Maia Sandu, has secured a clear victory in Moldova's parliamentary elections, winning over 50% of the vote. The election was seen as a crucial referendum on the country's path toward the European Union, with Sandu warning of "massive Russian interference" aimed at destabilizing the nation. Despite claims of victory from the pro-Russian opposition bloc, the result gives PAS a new majority in parliament. The tense election was marked by bomb scares and arrests of individuals suspected of plotting unrest.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police is consulting on a proposal to require its officers and staff to declare if they are members of the Freemasons. This move follows a recommendation from the Daniel Morgan Independent Panel report, which found that officers' membership in the secretive fraternity had been a source of suspicion and mistrust in the unsolved murder investigation. While the force would not ban membership, concerns have been raised about potential conflicts of loyalty. The proposal aims to increase transparency and strengthen public trust in the police force.</p>
