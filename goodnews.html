          <p>In a promotional segment for WWE's SummerSlam, wrestler John Cena appeared to abandon his recent villainous character. He addressed his upcoming championship match against Cody Rhodes, expressing regret for his recent actions and alignment with The Rock and Travis Scott. Cena delivered a speech reminiscent of his long-standing "hustle, loyalty, respect" persona, subtly criticizing his former partners for leaving him to face the consequences of their "shocking TV" angle. The segment sets the stage for a high-stakes street fight, with Cena vowing to defend his title as the "greatest of all time."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have identified a connection between the sun's magnetic cycle and precipitation patterns in China, potentially explaining the recent trend of "south drought and north flooding." A study published in the Journal of Climate suggests that decadal changes in solar activity influence the positioning of the monsoon rain belt over the country. This finding could be crucial for improving long-term climate predictions, particularly for managing flood seasons and mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events. The study highlights the significant role solar phenomena can play in regional climate systems.</p>

          <p>Lifeguards in Seal Beach, California, are reporting a significant rise in stingray-related injuries, increasing from an average of one per day to as many as 15 recently. This uptick is attributed to calm, warm waters drawing the stingrays closer to shore, coinciding with hot weather and more beachgoers. A specific area known as "ray bay" is a hotspot due to warmer water from a nearby power plant. To avoid stings, officials advise shuffling feet in the sand to alert the animals, and if stung, the recommended treatment is soaking the wound in hot water.</p>

          <p>A small clinic in Buffalo, New York, named La Bodega, is achieving remarkable success in treating Hepatitis C, a disease affecting millions of Americans. By using a streamlined model with new FDA-approved testing machines, the clinic can diagnose patients and start them on curative medication in a single visit. This approach has resulted in a 98% cure rate among its more than 7,000 patients, far surpassing the national treatment average. The clinic's success is providing a blueprint for a potential national program to eliminate the disease, which could save billions in long-term medical costs.</p>

          <p>ESPN is reportedly finalizing a deal to acquire several NFL media properties, including the NFL Network and the popular RedZone channel. In exchange, the NFL will receive an equity stake in ESPN that could be worth billions of dollars and may be as high as 10%. The agreement, expected to be announced next week, would also grant ESPN access to more regular-season games and the league's fantasy football operations. This deal deepens the existing partnership between the two giants and comes as ESPN prepares to launch a new direct-to-consumer streaming service. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a five-year diplomatic freeze following a deadly border clash, India and China are taking steps to normalize relations. New Delhi recently resumed issuing visas to Chinese citizens, a move that followed China's decision to allow Indian pilgrims back into the Tibet region. Direct flights, suspended during the pandemic, are also expected to resume soon. Experts suggest these initial measures could pave the way for deeper cooperation, driven by shifting global trade dynamics and strategic alliances. However, the unresolved Himalayan border dispute remains a significant obstacle to a full restoration of trust.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made several moves at the trade deadline to strengthen their roster, acquiring right-handed relievers Brock Stewart and Paul Gervase and outfielder Alex Call. Manager Dave Roberts stated these additions are intended to "raise the floor" for the first-place team. Stewart, a former Dodger, returns as a high-leverage relief option, while the 6-foot-10 Gervase adds a unique look from the bullpen. The front office emphasized that the team's biggest improvements are expected to come from its existing, underperforming stars. The team also hopes for the late-season return of injured pitcher Roki Sasaki.</p>

          <p>A psychotherapist who spent seven years in a religious cult is sharing insights on how to recognize the signs of coercive groups. Gillie Jenkinson, who specializes in helping cult survivors, notes that red flags include "love bombing," where abusers use intense affection to gain control, and providing overly simplistic answers to complex life problems. Other warning signs are the use of insider language, restricting access to outside information, and creating a high barrier to exit. Jenkinson appeared in a BBC documentary on the Jesus Army cult and advocates for more specialized mental health support for those who leave such groups.</p>

          <p>At an internal town hall meeting, social media giant ByteDance revealed that the median service length for its current employees is 2.9 years. The company, which owns TikTok and its Chinese version Douyin, also stated that about half of its 120,000-person workforce has been with the firm for more than three years. This disclosure appears to counter online speculation that the company had a much higher turnover rate. These figures suggest ByteDance is a relatively stable employer within China's competitive tech industry, which is known for its demanding work culture, despite the company officially abandoning its "996" schedule in 2021.</p>

This positive statement comes as the Trump administration has delivered mixed messages on trade policy.

          <p>An Ohio woman has taken a unique form of revenge against a car dealership that repossessed her vehicle. After Taylor Kia of Lima repossessed her car due to a loan issue, Tiah McCreary discovered the dealership had let its business name registration with the state lapse. She promptly registered the name "Taylor Kia of Lima" for herself and then sued the dealership for, among other things, using a name that legally belonged to her. An appeals court has ruled that this part of her lawsuit is separate from the car purchase and can proceed in court, not arbitration.</p>
