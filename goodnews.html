          <p>A federal judge has denied an emergency motion to stay a preliminary injunction, allowing a pro-LGBT organization to host an outdoor drag show open to all ages in Naples, Florida. Judge John Steele previously blocked the city from prohibiting the drag performance at Cambier Park and imposing an age requirement for attendance. The Naples PrideFest, scheduled for June 7, includes a drag performance, which the city had attempted to restrict to an indoor venue with an 18+ age limit. The city of Naples stated that its legal team is reviewing the order and determining next steps, while Naples Pride hailed the judge's decision as a victory for free speech.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump hosted a press event to celebrate Elon Musk as the Tesla CEO concludes his temporary government service leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk's departure follows a turbulent four months and comes at a precarious time for DOGE, with multiple top staffers leaving. Despite public disagreements and clashes with Cabinet members, Trump praised Musk's contributions. Musk expressed disappointment with a recent spending bill that would increase the federal budget deficit, undermining DOGE's work, but stated that the team's mission will continue.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer observes that the stock market has continued to rise in May despite confusing tariff headlines, noting that investors are focusing on signs of resilience in the U.S. economy. Despite Trump's accusations against China violating trade agreements and threats of tariffs on companies like Apple, job growth and consumer spending remain strong. Cramer highlights Costco's solid earnings report as an example of companies adapting to mitigate tariff impacts. He suggests the administration should recognize companies' efforts to move out of China, as the President is creating hurdles everywhere. (not investment advice)</p>
