          <p>Singapore's economy grew 1.4% in the second quarter, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after a contraction in the previous quarter. The growth, which surpassed analysts' expectations, was primarily driven by a strong performance in the manufacturing sector. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry expressed caution, highlighting significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy due to U.S. tariff policies. This economic context has led the country's central bank to loosen monetary policy in response to potential volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States will send Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine to help it defend against the Russian invasion. He specified that NATO and the European Union would provide 100% of the funding, characterizing the arrangement as a business transaction for the U.S. rather than aid. The announcement comes amid the president's growing frustration with the lack of progress toward peace and follows a recent, temporary pause on some arms shipments to Kyiv due to dwindling U.S. stockpiles.</p>
