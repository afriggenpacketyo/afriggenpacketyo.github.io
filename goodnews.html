          <p>A military spouse and mother of five, Amanda Johnson, is fighting back after a vaccine dispute has put her family's permanent change of station on hold. Despite Navy policy stating that vaccinations are not required for family members, their children were deemed unsuitable based solely on their vaccination status. The Johnsons' destination, Peru, also does not require any vaccinations for entry or residence. The family has filed a congressional inquiry and seeks reform to prevent similar situations in the future. Johnson emphasizes that vaccination status should not be a factor in determining suitability for travel for military dependents.</p>

          <p>Train services on Tokyo's busy Yamanote Loop Line resumed Friday morning after being suspended due to problems with pantographs, which connect carriages to overhead power lines. Both the inner and outer loops were halted, causing significant disruption for commuters. JR East conducted checks on equipment related to power supply to carriages. Services on the Keihin-Tohoku Line, which runs near the loop line, also resumed with delays. The Yamanote Line's outer loop was canceled Thursday night after an abnormality was detected near Shimbashi Station.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported multiple cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1 in the U.S., linked to a surge of the virus in China. Cases have been found in international travelers arriving at airports in several states, with origins tracing back to various countries including Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Experts are closely monitoring the variant, which is now dominant in China and rising in parts of Asia. Preliminary data suggests NB.1.8.1 may be more transmissible due to its ability to bind to human cells, but it doesn't appear to be better at evading the immune system.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation accelerated to 3.5% in April, the highest level in more than two years, driven partly by surging rice prices. The Bank of Japan is considering pausing its rate hike posture to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs. Headline inflation climbed 3.6% from a year ago, remaining above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for over three years. Economists expect core inflation to ease in the coming months due to lower crude oil prices and the yen's appreciation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prince William has cited Sir David Attenborough as a significant inspiration for his new six-part wildlife documentary series, Guardians, which highlights the work of rangers. The prince emphasized the importance of the series in reminding people that there are still wonderful parts of the world and that there is still hope through the amazing work being done. The series focuses on the increasingly risky work of rangers who protect endangered animals, with approximately 1,400 rangers having died in the past decade. Prince William hopes to emphasize the dangers these individuals face and the need for greater societal value and support for their efforts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army's Old Guard is resuming horse-drawn caisson funerals at Arlington National Cemetery after a suspension in May 2023 following the deaths of two horses.

Equestrian David O'Connor, an Olympic gold medalist, was brought in to help improve the program. Starting in June, two squads of 11 horses will perform two services a day, with changes including lighter caissons and extensive training for personnel to ensure the welfare of the animals.</p>

          <p>Dr. Maher Abdallah, director of American Reproductive Centers in Palm Springs, vowed to rebuild his clinic after a targeted bomb explosion nearly destroyed it. The bombing, which killed the suspected bomber, Guy Edward Bartkus, is being investigated as domestic terrorism. Despite the extensive damage, the clinic's in vitro fertilization lab remained intact, preserving thousands of frozen eggs, sperm, and embryos. Abdallah has forgiven the suspect and is focused on the future, with plans to temporarily relocate and eventually rebuild on the same site, ensuring continued service to the community.</p>

The forecast cites a confluence of factors, including the neutral phase of the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation, warmer ocean temperatures, and weak wind shear.

          <p>Beef prices in the U.S. have reached all-time highs, with ground beef costing nearly 50% more than five years ago. Ranchers are struggling to keep costs down due to rising prices for feed, land, and financing, leading to the lowest U.S. cattle herd numbers in over 70 years. Drought conditions have further exacerbated the issue, making it difficult to maintain adequate grazing land. The USDA forecasts that beef prices will continue to rise throughout 2025, impacting consumers and producers alike. (not investment advice)</p>
