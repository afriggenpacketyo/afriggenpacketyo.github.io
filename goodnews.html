          <p>Exxon Mobil reported second-quarter earnings that, while lower than the previous year, exceeded Wall Street's expectations. The company's net income fell to $7.1 billion, but strong production growth, particularly a record output in the Permian Basin, helped mitigate the impact of declining oil prices. The oil major's refining business saw a significant profit increase due to higher margins. Exxon also returned $9.2 billion to its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, signaling financial strength despite market fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

Masters stated that domestic football should not be sacrificed for global expansion and criticized FIFA for a lack of proper dialogue with stakeholders.

          <p>New York Mets star shortstop Francisco Lindor expressed his belief that his teammate, Juan Soto, was unjustly snubbed from this year's MLB All-Star game. Speaking to Fox News Digital, Lindor stated that Soto "deserved it" and "definitely should have been there," highlighting his status as one of the league's best hitters. Despite a slow start to the season, Soto has demonstrated strong performance with 25 home runs and 62 RBIs. Lindor's comments underscore the respect Soto commands from his peers, even when not selected for the midsummer classic.</p>

          <p>China has introduced its first anti-money-laundering regulation specifically targeting transactions involving precious metals and gemstones, expanding oversight beyond traditional financial institutions. Under the new rule, dealers must report any cash transactions exceeding 100,000 yuan (approximately US$13,870) to the national financial crime watchdog within five working days. The regulation also mandates reporting any suspicious activity regardless of the amount, aiming to close a loophole that criminals have exploited for laundering illicit funds. This move marks a significant step in strengthening China's financial crime prevention framework. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines has begun selling its first-ever assigned seats for flights starting next year, marking a significant departure from its long-standing open-seating model. The cost for selecting a seat will vary depending on the route, travel date, and seat location, with preferred and extra-legroom seats carrying additional fees that can add hundreds of dollars to a trip. This change, along with recently introduced baggage fees, aligns Southwest more closely with its competitors and follows pressure from investors to maximize revenue. The airline will still offer perks like free seat selection for elite status members and certain credit card holders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Family offices, the private investment firms of the ultra-wealthy, are increasingly formalizing their executive compensation with structured long-term incentive plans to attract and retain talent. According to a new report, a majority of these firms now use plans that tie pay to performance and investment returns, moving away from informal handshake agreements. Median total compensation for CEOs at investment-focused family offices has reached $825,000, with those at larger firms earning over $1.2 million. Popular incentives include co-investment opportunities, carried interest, and profit sharing, reflecting a more competitive and professionalized environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The longstanding rule limiting liquids in air travel hand luggage to 100ml containers may soon be eliminated across the European Union. The EU Commission has approved new CT-based scanners that can effectively detect liquid explosives without slowing down security lines, allowing individual airports to lift the restriction. While the technology is now officially permitted, the rollout will be gradual as most airports are not yet equipped. German airports, for example, have begun installing the scanners but will maintain current rules for now to avoid confusion during the busy summer travel season.</p>

          <p>Chevron announced a significant drop in its second-quarter net income, which fell by 44% to $2.49 billion compared to the same period last year. The decline was primarily driven by lower oil prices and a $215 million loss related to its recent acquisition of Hess Corporation. Despite the drop, the company's adjusted earnings per share beat Wall Street expectations, supported by a 3% increase in worldwide production. The acquisition of Hess, finalized after a prolonged dispute with Exxon Mobil, is expected to start contributing to earnings in the fourth quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starting October 12, the European Union will begin phasing in its new Entry/Exit System (EES), which will replace manual passport stamping with biometric checks for non-EU travelers, including those from the UK. Passengers will need to have their fingerprints and faces scanned upon their first entry, with the data being valid for three years. The system aims to enhance border security and eventually speed up processing times, though officials warn of potential delays during the initial rollout. The full implementation across all member states is expected to be completed by April 2026.</p>

Those who successfully complete the paid internship will be prioritized for the Fast Stream graduate program, creating a new pathway into Whitehall for underrepresented talent.</p>

          <p>Despite a federal administration championing fossil fuels and cutting support for renewables, Southern California is moving forward with significant investments in green hydrogen energy. One of the largest projects, a facility in Vernon, aims to produce clean hydrogen for heavy-duty trucks, leveraging state-level climate regulations and grants to proceed. While the production of hydrogen can be controversial due to its historical link to natural gas, this project will use 100% clean energy for its process. The initiative highlights California's commitment to its carbon neutrality goals, even in the face of an uncertain federal legislative landscape.</p>

          <p>Kamala Harris's announcement that she will not run for governor of California has fueled widespread speculation that she is preparing for a 2028 presidential campaign. Her decision reopens a persistent debate within the Democratic party about the electability of a female candidate, especially in the post-Trump era. While some analysts and donors express anxiety, others argue that a candidate's platform and ability to connect with an electorate angry about their standard of living will be more critical than their gender. The discussion highlights the strategic and ideological questions facing Democrats as they look toward the next presidential cycle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new California state law, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, has brought a major change to how homeowners associations (HOAs) can penalize residents. The law amends the Davis-Stirling Act to cap fines for most violations at $100, unless the issue poses a direct health or safety risk. This legislation is seen as a significant victory for homeowners who have long complained about aggressive and arbitrary fines from their associations. The law, which was passed quickly as part of a larger housing bill, has surprised and frustrated the HOA industry, which argues it undermines their ability to enforce community rules.</p>
