          <p>The Trump Organization has announced the launch of Trump Mobile, a mobile phone plan and a $499 smartphone, set to launch in September. The $47.45-per-month plan includes unlimited talk, text, and data, as well as roadside assistance and a "Telehealth and Pharmacy Benefit." The company will also sell a "T1" smartphone featuring a gold-colored metal case etched with an American flag. This venture is the latest example of Trump's business capitalizing on his association with the presidency through licensing agreements, similar to watches, sneakers, and Bibles. The monthly price and name of the wireless service are references to Trump's past and present presidential terms.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives narrowly passed a bill to strip USAID and public broadcasting of $9.4 billion by a 214-212 vote. The bill represents the first chance for the GOP to make good on proposed cuts. The passage of the bill was initially uncertain, requiring last-minute negotiations to secure enough votes from Republican representatives. Speaker Johnson touted the bill as fulfilling promises to the American people for responsible government, but the vote was overshadowed by news of Senator Alex Padilla's detainment. </p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is cutting costs and rethinking policy to accelerate the adoption of new technology, according to Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George. The Army Transformation Initiative, approved by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, aims to reposition jobs and shift defense dollars to rapidly produced, cost-effective products. The initiative seeks to move beyond the rigid, years-long acquisition process to quickly infuse formations with effective technologies. The Army is focusing on artificial intelligence-enabled platforms, SpaceX Starlink internet connectivity, retrofitted autonomous vehicles, and drones to modernize its forces.</p>

          <p>Despite the escalation of the Israel-Iran conflict, financial markets have largely shrugged off the events, with U.S. stock benchmarks opening higher and oil prices falling. Investors are betting that the attacks will not escalate into a broader regional conflict that disrupts the global economy. Deutsche Bank notes that geopolitical events typically only impact markets when they affect macro variables like growth and inflation. The biggest risk to oil prices is Iran shutting down the Strait of Hormuz, which could cause prices to spike above $100 a barrel, though analysts believe this is unlikely. (not investment advice)</p>

OrderlyMeds, for example, plans to personalize the medicines by adding supplements based on patients' unique needs, arguing that this makes the drugs individualized rather than copies. The FDA allows compounding pharmacies to make copies of brand-name drugs when those medicines are in short supply, but that grace period is ending as shortages of brand-name drugs are over. Experts are questioning where the line is between making "essentially a copy" of a commercially available drug and the personalized medicines compounding pharmacies have provided for decades.</p>

          <p>American Express and JPMorgan Chase are preparing updates to their premier credit cards, setting the stage for renewed competition in the luxury card market. JPMorgan Chase is set to refresh its Sapphire Reserve card, while American Express plans "major" changes to its consumer and business Platinum cards. The updates are expected to include expanded perks in travel, dining, and experiences, and potentially higher annual fees. The move comes as both companies seek to maintain their position in the lucrative premium credit card space.</p>
