          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 18:40:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, has engineered a new hardware solution, the In-Row Heat Exchanger (IRHX), to cool Nvidia's next-generation GPUs used for AI tasks. The company opted for a custom design after finding that existing liquid cooling technologies were too slow to implement or would consume excessive data center space and water. This new system can be integrated into both new and existing data centers, allowing AWS to support large-scale AI workloads powered by Nvidia's energy-intensive processors. The move reflects a broader trend of cloud providers like AWS and Microsoft developing their own hardware to optimize performance and reduce reliance on third-party suppliers.</p>

          <p>Paris Saint-Germain delivered a stunning 4-0 defeat to Real Madrid in the Club World Cup semifinal, showcasing a dominant team performance over Madrid's individual stars. Ousmane Dembélé was exceptional, contributing to a relentless attack that saw PSG take a 3-0 lead within the first 24 minutes. In contrast, Real Madrid appeared disorganized, with new star Kylian Mbappé struggling to make an impact against his former team. The match highlighted PSG's successful evolution under coach Luis Enrique, emphasizing structured, collective play over a reliance on a single superstar.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to a new record high of over $112,000, influenced by a broader rally in technology stocks, particularly Nvidia. Despite recent weeks of stable trading, the cryptocurrency's value climbed as the market displayed a strong appetite for risk-on assets. This upward trend is occurring even as institutional purchases by public companies have outpaced inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Investors anticipate further growth in the second half of the year, driven by increased corporate adoption and the potential for new U.S. crypto legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Delta Air Lines flight from Madrid to New York was forced to make an emergency landing on Terceira, a small Portuguese island in the Atlantic, due to an engine-related mechanical issue. The 282 passengers and 13 crew members were stranded on the island for approximately 29 hours before a replacement aircraft could fly them to their destination. Delta confirmed the flight diverted out of an abundance of caution and landed safely. The airline has apologized to the affected customers, provided them with hotel accommodation and meals, and stated it will offer compensation for the significant delay.</p>

          <p>Following a crucial 4-0 victory over the Netherlands, England's path to the Euro 2025 quarterfinals is now in their own hands. The defending champions will advance if they defeat Wales in their final Group D match. Wales, however, faces elimination and needs a large-margin victory to have any chance of progressing. In the same group, France has already qualified, while the Netherlands' fate depends on their result against France and the outcome of the England-Wales game. Meanwhile, in Group C, both Germany and Sweden have already secured their spots in the knockout stage.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined a request from Florida officials to lift a lower court's injunction against a controversial state immigration law. The law, known as SB 4-C, makes it a felony for certain undocumented immigrants to enter the state. A federal judge had previously blocked its enforcement, ruling that it unconstitutionally infringes upon the federal government's exclusive authority over immigration policy. The Supreme Court's decision means the law will remain on hold while the legal challenge against it proceeds, a move praised by the ACLU as a reaffirmation of federal jurisdiction over immigration matters.</p>

Despite the small dip, the precious metal's price has generally trended upward in 2024, and many analysts predict it could eventually reach $4,000 per ounce. Given that the dip is likely to be short-lived due to market volatility and geopolitical factors, now could be a strategic time to invest.

Nvidia's stock has seen a dramatic surge, benefiting from the massive demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) that power large language models.
