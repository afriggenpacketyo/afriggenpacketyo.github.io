        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party is anticipated to experience a decline in seats during Sunday's Tokyo assembly election, a contest viewed as a key indicator for the upcoming House of Councillors race, especially as Ishiba navigates a minority government on the national stage. The election outcome could mirror past instances where Tokyo assembly results influenced national political dynamics, potentially impacting Ishiba's leadership. Tomin First no Kai, led by Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, is expected to perform well among independent voters, highlighting the appeal of policies focused on quality of life and local concerns. The election encompasses issues like inflation support, political funding scandals, and child-rearing policies, reflecting national-level debates.</p>

          <p>Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska discusses her role as a moderate in a polarized Washington, highlighting her independence from party allegiance and her commitment to representing the diverse needs of her constituents. Murkowski reflects on her challenging elections, including a write-in campaign after losing the primary, which reinforced her belief in prioritizing the interests of Alaskans over party politics. She emphasizes the importance of Congress upholding its constitutional responsibilities and expresses concern about the Republican conference ceding authority to the executive branch under President Trump. Her new memoir, "Far from Home: An Alaskan Senator Faces the Extreme Climate of Washington, D.C.," explores these themes and her efforts to navigate the political landscape while staying true to her Alaskan roots.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reem Raouda, a parenting expert, suggests replacing common phrases that trigger defiance in children with more empathetic and autonomy-respecting language to foster cooperation. Instead of using phrases like "Because I said so," parents should explain their reasoning; instead of threats, offer choices that empower children to meet expectations. Raouda emphasizes that dismissing a child's emotions or assuming intentional difficulty can lead to disconnection, and promotes problem-solving and empathy to build trust and emotional resilience. By creating a safe and respectful environment, parents can encourage children to cooperate naturally, reducing power struggles and promoting healthy emotional development.</p>

          <p>Sixty years ago, The Doors formed in Venice, California, and ignited the music scene with their unique sound. The article recounts the band's early days, their breakthrough at the Whisky a Go Go, and the improvisational nature of their music. Surviving members John Densmore and Robby Krieger share memories of Jim Morrison's talent and struggles, along with the creation of iconic songs like "Light My Fire" and "Riders on the Storm."

          <p>J.J. Spaun, a 34-year-old golfer from Los Angeles, won the U.S. Open after a challenging final round, marked by a shaky start and a weather delay, culminating in a remarkable 64-foot putt on the final hole. What makes his victory particularly notable is that the night before the final round, Spaun spent the night caring for his sick two-year-old daughter, even driving to downtown Pittsburgh at 3 a.m. to find medication. Spaun acknowledged that the sleepless night may have contributed to his initial struggles, but ultimately, his dedication to his family and his perseverance on the course led to his triumph. His story serves as an example of prioritizing family responsibilities over personal ambition, and being rewarded in the end.</p>
