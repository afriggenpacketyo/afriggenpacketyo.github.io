          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence received the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for upholding the constitutional transfer of power after the 2020 election. In his acceptance speech, Pence emphasized the importance of the Constitution as the common ground that binds Americans together. His remarks came shortly after an interview aired in which President Trump expressed uncertainty about whether all individuals in the U.S. are entitled to due process. Pence highlighted his differences with both Democrats and his own Republican Party on issues such as spending, tariffs, and support for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has closed its last in-house beagle laboratory on the NIH campus, following public scrutiny and pressure from figures like Elon Musk. A report highlighted alleged abuses, including pumping pneumonia-causing bacteria into beagles' lungs and bleeding them out for experiments. PETA praised the closure, with the NIH director noting that PETA sent him flowers, a stark contrast to the usual physical threats NIH directors receive. The closure aligns with broader efforts to phase out animal testing, including actions by the FDA and EPA during the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Following the Miami Grand Prix, McLaren team principal Andrea Stella suggested that Lando Norris could have been more patient in overtaking Max Verstappen. Norris passed Verstappen at Turn 11 by going off track and had to cede the position before regaining it on the subsequent lap. Stella noted both drivers approached overtaking Verstappen similarly, but the time loss occurred when Norris had to give back the position. Hamilton ultimately finished eighth in the race, which was dominated by McLaren's Oscar Piastri.</p>

          <p>Australian stocks experienced a downturn following Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's return to power, as most Asian markets remained closed for holidays. Albanese's re-election signifies a desire for policy stability amid global macroeconomic uncertainty. The S&P/ASX 200 fell by 0.47%, reversing gains from its previous session, while the Australian dollar appreciated against the greenback. Oil prices also plunged after OPEC+ agreed to increase production. U.S. futures edged down, contrasting with strong gains on Wall Street the previous week.</p>

          <p>President Trump's policies and political style are impacting global elections, but not always in his favor. In recent elections in Canada and Australia, center-left parties saw their fortunes revive, while parties that emulated Trump's MAGA playbook faced defeat. Voters in these countries seemed to reject candidates associated with Trump's policies and rhetoric, particularly regarding trade and international alliances. However, in other countries like Germany, the impact has been more indirect, with leaders leveraging Trump's actions to justify policy changes.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing has become increasingly popular among women seeking to preserve their fertility, with the number of procedures increasing significantly in recent years. Women are freezing their eggs to preserve their options for later, delaying motherhood until they find the right partner or achieve their career goals. The process involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and storage in liquid nitrogen.

          <p>Egg freezing is gaining popularity among young women to preserve their fertility, offering a chance to delay motherhood until they are ready. The procedure involves hormone injections to stimulate egg production, followed by egg retrieval and freezing for future use.

Some companies are offering egg freezing as a benefit, but the high cost raises concerns about accessibility for lower-income women.</p>
