          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is revisiting its approval of azodicarbonamide (ADA), a food additive used to whiten cereal flour and improve bread dough, after concerns were raised about its safety. ADA is banned in Europe due to the potential formation of semicarbazide, a possible carcinogen, during bread making. While the FDA previously deemed ADA safe, it is now prioritizing a renewed safety review, along with other additives like BHT and BHA. The agency plans to release a modernized prioritization scheme for reviewing chemicals in the food supply for public comment later this month.</p>

          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka alleges that federal prosecutors attempted to "humiliate and degrade" him by requiring him to be fingerprinted and photographed a second time following a court appearance on a trespassing charge. The charge stems from his arrest at an immigration detention center protest. Baraka, a vocal critic of Trump's immigration policies, claims he did not violate any laws and was standing up for the Constitution. His attorney anticipates seeking dismissal of the charges, arguing selective prosecution on private property.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold investing has gained traction as a hedge against inflation, but a traditional approach may not be ideal. Experts recommend allocating no more than 10% of your portfolio to gold, but the timing and frequency of investment depend on individual circumstances. Getting invested quickly is generally advisable to avoid price increases, while existing investors might consider a slower approach to rebuilding their gold investment after selling for profit. The key is to build up to the recommended threshold based on personal needs and goals (not investment advice).</p>

The Magna Carta, a foundational document influencing the U.S. Constitution, aimed to limit the king's power and guarantee rights such as due process.

          <p>After major potential Republican candidates for key U.S. Senate races in 2026 passed on running, some Republicans are split on whether their party is struggling to recruit competitive Senate candidates. Some Republicans point to Kemp's decision, and to a lesser extent Sununu's, as signs that Republicans are having challenges recruiting centrist candidates who would appeal to voters statewide. Republicans currently hold 53 seats to Democrats' 45. The seat up for election in Georgia -- held by incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff, who is running for reelection -- has received close attention from Republicans, who hope they can flip what is widely viewed as a vulnerable seat.</p>

          <p>South Sudan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation on Thursday moved to dispel reports that President Salva Kiir had passed away. While there has been online speculation regarding the health of the 73-year-old leader, the foreign ministry said Kiir "is alive, well and fully engaging in the service of the nation." The claims come as South Sudan faces a bout of insecurity, with clashes between forces aligned with Kiir and Vice President Riek Machar breaking out in several areas around the country.</p>
