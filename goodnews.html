          <p>A widespread technology outage impacted numerous online platforms, including Google, OpenAI, Spotify, and others, due to issues with Google Cloud. The disruption, which began around 2 p.m. EST, caused intermittent failures across several services, with users reporting problems on Downdetector.com. Cloudflare, which relies on Google Cloud for some of its services, confirmed that its core operations were not affected, and Google Cloud reported that most services had been recovered by 3:30 p.m. EST. The outage highlights the interconnectedness of internet infrastructure and the potential for cascading failures.</p>

          <p>Oracle shares experienced a significant surge, climbing 13% to a record high, following the release of robust earnings and a strong forecast driven by cloud growth. Revenue increased by 11% year-over-year, exceeding analyst estimates, and adjusted earnings per share also surpassed expectations. The company's progress in the cloud infrastructure market, challenging Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, is fueling optimism. Oracle's remaining performance obligations (RPO) are up 41% year-over-year, with future expansion expected from sales of its database on other clouds, though the company faces the challenge of meeting client demand in cloud.

CEO Chris Britt stated that Chime focuses on serving Americans earning $100,000 a year or less, providing services to help them avoid fees and build credit.

          <p>The U.S. dollar index has reached its lowest level in three years, prompting analysis of the impact on U.S. markets and the economy. A weaker dollar generally benefits U.S. companies with significant overseas sales, as it increases foreign buyers' purchasing power. However, it can also lead to higher costs for imported goods, with the net effect depending on a company's specific mix of foreign and domestic sales and inputs. The weaker dollar is expected to decrease U.S. consumer demand for international travel but increase foreign tourism to the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite some modern waste, researchers are excited about the potential of the archaeological site, preserved largely intact.
