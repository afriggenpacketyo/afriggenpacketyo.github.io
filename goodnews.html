          <h2>Bank of England Governor Hints at Potential Interest Rate Cuts Amid Slowing Job Market</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 03:12:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Andrew Bailey, the Governor of the Bank of England, has indicated that larger interest rate cuts could be implemented if the UK's job market continues to weaken. In an interview, he stated that the path for interest rates is downward, citing an increase in economic "slack" and signs that businesses are reducing hiring and pay raises. This commentary follows a period where rates were held steady after two earlier cuts, and comes as the UK economy shows signs of contraction, raising concerns about a potential recession. The prospect of lower rates is seen as a likely development by many economists. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 03:07:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. This growth, which surpassed economists' expectations, was primarily driven by a strong expansion in the manufacturing and construction sectors. Analysts suggest the positive figures were partly due to businesses front-loading exports ahead of potential tariff changes. Despite the encouraging performance, the Ministry of Trade and Industry maintains a cautious outlook, highlighting significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy for the latter half of the year.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 03:05:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, surpassing forecasts, largely due to strong demand from Southeast Asian and European markets. This performance was also aided by a temporary tariff truce with the United States, which slowed the decline in shipments to America. Imports saw their first increase of the year, though the rebound is considered fragile by economists who predict export momentum may falter amid ongoing trade uncertainties. The data also revealed a significant surge in exports of rare earths, steel, and integrated circuits, providing a partial offset to weak domestic demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's value surged past $122,000, setting a new record high driven by significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and growing institutional interest. The rally is also fueled by anticipation of upcoming U.S. crypto legislation, dubbed 'Crypto Week,' which aims to establish a clearer regulatory framework for the digital asset industry. This legislative push has received support from President Donald Trump, who has positioned himself as a proponent of cryptocurrency. Analysts suggest that long-term institutional buying is a key factor, though potential risks from trade disputes and Federal Reserve policies remain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump is set to make a second state visit to the United Kingdom from September 17 to 19, an unprecedented honor for a U.S. president. He and First Lady Melania Trump will be hosted by King Charles II and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle. The invitation, delivered by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, is viewed as a strategic effort to maintain strong UK-US relations amidst global trade tensions. While the visit includes royal pomp and ceremony, it may also face protests and poses diplomatic complexities, particularly regarding Trump's stance on Canada, another of King Charles's realms.</p>

Unlike the U.S. and E.U., Norway has not imposed tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, creating an open market that serves as a "laboratory" for new brands entering Europe.

Albanese framed the joint development of green steel, which uses renewable energy, as a major economic opportunity for both nations.
