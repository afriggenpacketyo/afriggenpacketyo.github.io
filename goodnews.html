          <p>At a summit in Pittsburgh, the Trump administration and corporate leaders announced over $90 billion in private investments for Pennsylvania, aimed at fostering a new economy based on artificial intelligence and energy. The plan includes building energy-intensive data centers for AI and an innovation hub to train workers, leveraging the state's natural gas and nuclear resources. Hosted by Senator Dave McCormick, the event highlighted a vision for regional economic growth, with supporters like PNC's CEO noting the area's unique combination of technology, energy, and labor. The announcement faced some local protests from activists concerned about its focus on fossil fuels and corporate interests.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House is considering the Genius Act, bipartisan legislation that would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. The bill aims to provide consumer protections and clear rules, potentially allowing banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins, which promise faster and cheaper transactions. Proponents, like financial tech company Circle, view them as "digital dollars" that can operate outside traditional banking hours. However, risks remain, such as the potential for a stablecoin to "depeg" from its asset, as seen during the 2023 bank failures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles County to Pay $14 Million to Man Wrongfully Imprisoned for Murder</h2>

          <p>Alexander Torres, who spent over 20 years in prison for a murder he did not commit, will receive a $14 million settlement from Los Angeles County. Torres was convicted despite having a strong alibi and physical evidence—a cast on his arm—that made his involvement unlikely, based on shaky witness testimony. His conviction was overturned in 2021 after a review by the L.A. County District Attorney's Conviction Integrity Unit found he was factually innocent. The settlement resolves his lawsuit against the county, which alleged that sheriff's detectives failed to disclose exculpatory evidence and used suggestive methods during the investigation.</p>

          <h2>UK Health Review Recommends Renaming Physician Associates to 'Assistants' to Avoid Patient Confusion</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 19:02:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should have their titles changed to "assistants." The review, authored by Professor Gillian Leng, found that the current titles can confuse patients, who may mistake these professionals for fully qualified doctors. The report also advises that associates wear standardized uniforms and not be responsible for diagnosing patients, following tragic cases where misdiagnoses by PAs led to patient deaths. The recommendations aim to clarify the roles and responsibilities of these positions as their numbers are set to significantly increase within the NHS.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan group of House lawmakers has reintroduced the DIGNITY Act, a comprehensive immigration reform bill, as the Trump administration's mass deportation program faces scrutiny. Co-sponsored by Reps. Maria Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.) and Veronica Escobar (D-Texas), the bill would create a "Dignity Program" offering legal status to undocumented immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for at least five years and meet certain criteria. The legislation also aims to enhance border security, reform the asylum process, and protect sensitive locations like schools from enforcement actions. The reintroduction comes as immigrant communities express fear over recent ICE raids.</p>

          <p>The historic Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set to close in 2027 for a five-year, £50 million renovation project. Opened in 1848, the Victorian glass house's ironwork has been damaged by the constant hot and humid conditions required for its tropical rainforest collection. The extensive makeover will involve replacing 16,000 panes of glass, repairing the metal structure, and carefully relocating over 1,300 plants, including a 250-year-old cycad. A key goal of the project is to upgrade the heating systems to make the building's operations net-zero in emissions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an advert for Trip drinks for making unauthorized health claims, such as its ability to help consumers "feel calm" or reduce stress. The ad for the popular non-alcoholic beverage, which contains ingredients like magnesium and CBD, was found to be in breach of rules regarding marketing food products with health benefits. The ASA ruled that language like "crafted for calm" wrongly implied the drink could treat anxiety, a prohibited claim. The watchdog also found a claim about "0g added sugar" to be inaccurate, ordering that the advert not appear again in its current form.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade deal with Indonesia that lowers a threatened 32% U.S. tariff on Indonesian goods to 19%. In exchange, the agreement reportedly grants "full access" for American firms to the Indonesian market and includes commitments for Indonesia to purchase billions in U.S. energy and agricultural products, as well as 50 Boeing jets. This pact is the latest development following the administration's spring tariff threats, which have spurred negotiations with numerous countries. The terms of the deal were not immediately confirmed by Indonesia, which is one of America's top 25 trade partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Westinghouse interim CEO Dan Sumner announced plans to build 10 new AP1000 nuclear reactors in the United States, with construction intended to begin by 2030. The announcement was made directly to President Trump during an energy and AI summit in Pittsburgh. This ambitious plan aligns with the administration's executive orders aiming to quadruple U.S. nuclear power by 2050. Each AP1000 reactor can power over 750,000 homes, and the project is projected to generate significant economic value. The U.S. has only completed two new reactors in the last 30 years, both of which were Westinghouse units that faced significant delays and cost overruns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tony Gilroy, the creator of the "Star Wars" series "Andor," discussed the show's 14 Emmy nominations, including for outstanding drama series. He described the project as the "seminal creative experience" of his life and noted the "spooky" parallels between the show's depiction of a rising rebellion against an authoritarian empire and current political events. Gilroy said the grounded, political spy-thriller nature of the show was inspired by historical revolutions. He expressed particular pride in the sense of community among the cast and crew and celebrated the nominations for his brother, Dan Gilroy, for writing, and for the show's technical achievements.</p>
