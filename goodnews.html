          <p>The UK's upcoming strategic defense review will outline significant investments in national security, sending a strong message to countries like Russia and China. The government plans to allocate ¬£1.5 billion to establish at least six new defense factories, creating 1,800 jobs across the UK. This investment aims to bolster the UK's munitions production capacity, addressing concerns highlighted by the war in Ukraine regarding the West's ability to manufacture weapons and munitions. The funding will enable the procurement of up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons, strengthening the armed forces and supporting economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A palliative care physician shares reflections on how patients confront mortality and redefine what it means to live fully. The article contrasts popular culture's emphasis on extravagant bucket lists with the more profound, ordinary wishes expressed by those nearing death, such as reconciling with family or pursuing long-deferred personal goals. The author emphasizes that facing death often brings clarity about one's true desires, leading to a reevaluation of life's priorities. The reflections suggest that living with an awareness of death's uncertainty can lead to a more authentic and meaningful existence.</p>

          <p>Skateboarding powerhouse Japan has welcomed the new Olympic age limit restricting competition to athletes 14 and older from the 2028 Los Angeles Games. World Skate decided in April to institute the limit, which would have ruled some of Japan's previous Olympic medal-winning skateboarders ineligible. Japan's street skateboarding head coach Daisuke Hayakawa has nevertheless endorsed the new restriction against the backdrop of increasingly severe injuries, including ligament ruptures, being reported among growing children in many countries as the technical difficulty of tricks continues to rise. The International Olympic Committee started tightening age restrictions to protect child athletes after Russian figure skating prodigy Kamila Valieva tested positive for a banned substance at the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing.</p>

          <p>Blue Origin successfully launched six passengers on a suborbital flight to the edge of space, marking the company's twelfth crewed New Shepard mission. The international crew experienced several minutes of weightlessness and panoramic views of Earth. The New Shepard booster returned to a landing pad near the launch site, while the capsule parachuted to a safe touchdown in the West Texas desert. The passengers, including the first Panamanian to travel to space, described the experience as incredible and spiritual.</p>

          <p>Wayfarers Chapel, the historic Rancho Palos Verdes sanctuary, may have found a new site near Rancho Palos Verdes City Hall after landslides forced its disassembly. The chapel, a national historic landmark, was threatened by rapid land movement, prompting leaders to seek a more stable location. The new site is not in the city‚Äôs landslide zone and would include a visitor‚Äôs center, museum, cafe, and gardens. The move aims to preserve the chapel's legacy and provide a safe and accessible space for visitors.</p>
