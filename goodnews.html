          <p>Southwest Airlines CEO Bob Jordan stated the company is open to high-end changes such as airport lounges, premium seating, and long-haul international flights to attract high-spending customers, moving away from some of its traditional policies. This transformation comes amidst pressure from competitors and activist investors to increase revenue, as well as a drop in airfares. While Southwest has already introduced basic economy tickets and bag fees, it is now considering more luxurious offerings. Jordan specifically mentioned Nashville International Airport as a location where customers desire lounges and first-class services, highlighting the need to adapt to changing customer demands. The airline aims to implement these changes in a way that aligns with the "Southwest way." Optimism score</p>

          <p>Emil Bove, nominated by President Trump for the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, denied allegations from a whistleblower that he advised Justice Department attorneys to ignore court orders. The whistleblower, former Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni, claimed Bove made the suggestion during a meeting about Trump's plans to invoke the Alien Enemies Act. Bove, who previously defended Trump in legal cases, stated before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he has never advised anyone to violate a court order. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche also refuted the allegations, calling them "utterly false" and accusing the media of planting a false hit piece.

          <p>This article discusses whether credit card users should request a credit limit increase given the current economic climate. It advises against requesting an increase for those already carrying significant debt, as it suggests an inability to manage debt responsibly. Instead, it recommends exploring debt relief options. For responsible borrowers with little to no debt and a clear plan for using the increased limit, requesting an increase may be reasonable, but the article cautions that approval is not guaranteed and may require documentation. The article emphasizes that the decision depends on individual financial circumstances and goals (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>President Trump engaged with world leaders at the NATO Summit, receiving praise from NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and discussing defense spending. Trump highlighted that allies have agreed to increase spending to 5% of GDP, a key demand he had been pushing. He also commented on Spain's reluctance to commit to the spending target, noting his fondness for the country but emphasizing the need for fair contributions. This summit reflects warming relations within the alliance after months of disputes over defense spending and policies, and is a far cry from JD Vance's address at the Munich Security Conference.</p>

His campaign focused on grassroots engagement, digital strategy, and substantive policies addressing the affordability crisis in New York City, such as rent freezes and universal childcare.

          <p>BP's stock price rose significantly after a report surfaced that Shell was in early talks to acquire the British oil company, although Shell has denied these discussions. The potential deal would position Shell to rival competitors ExxonMobil and Chevron, marking the largest oil deal in decades. BP declined to comment, while Shell stated they are focused on capturing value through performance, discipline, and simplification. The specifics of a potential deal were not immediately available, and there is no guarantee that discussions will lead to an agreement.</p>

          <p>This article explores the potential interest earned on a $20,000 certificate of deposit (CD) account with a 2-year term, emphasizing the importance of considering the trade-off between accessibility and interest earnings (not investment advice). It highlights that online banks often offer higher interest rates due to lower maintenance costs. Examples are provided, showing potential earnings with rates ranging from 4.10% to 4.40%. The article also considers a 1-year CD account as an alternative, offering a balance between returns and accessibility, and advises savers to act proactively given the likelihood of interest rate cuts.</p>
