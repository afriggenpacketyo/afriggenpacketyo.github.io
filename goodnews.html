        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A unique group of individuals known as "SuperAgers" are providing scientists with valuable insights into healthy aging and resistance to cognitive decline. These people, aged 80 and older, possess the memory capabilities of individuals who are decades younger, even as their brains undergo the natural shrinking process associated with aging. Researchers at Northwestern University's SuperAging Program have been studying this cohort for over two decades to uncover the biological and lifestyle factors that contribute to their remarkable brain resilience. The findings could offer new pathways for preventing conditions like Alzheimer's disease and dementia in the broader population.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The constant pull of smartphones is a significant challenge for many, with studies showing that a phone's mere presence can diminish cognitive capacity, even when it is silent. Cultural critics and producers discuss how this "phone addiction" is particularly pronounced among young adults, with 81% of those aged 18-29 feeling they spend too much time on their devices. While some are turning to "dumbphones" or older models like BlackBerrys as a solution, experts suggest the key is not just willpower. They recommend creating intentional moments of connection with nature, friends, or oneself to interrupt ingrained habits and renegotiate one's relationship with technology.</p>

          <p>The market for space-related initial public offerings (IPOs) is showing renewed signs of life after a period of relative quiet, with several companies like Firefly Aerospace making successful debuts on the stock market. This trend marks a shift from the previous reliance on SPAC mergers for space firms to go public. Analysts suggest that despite geopolitical volatility, the timing is ripe for space IPOs, driven by investor hype around the sector's growth potential and its alignment with national innovation priorities. The increase in listings reflects strong investor appetite for companies building long-term strategic infrastructure in the final frontier. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is developing legislation to impose stricter geographical restrictions on serious violent and sexual offenders upon their release from prison. The new proposal would shift from the current system of exclusion zones to "inclusion zones," which would confine offenders to specific, designated areas policed by enhanced GPS tagging. The Ministry of Justice states this will provide victims with greater peace of mind, allowing them to move about more freely without fear of encountering their attacker. However, critics express concern that the plan will place additional strain on an already overburdened probation service.</p>

          <p>Shares in Japanese investment giant SoftBank Group surged by 13% to a record high following a fiscal first-quarter profit report that far exceeded analyst expectations. The company posted a profit of 421.8 billion yen, a significant turnaround from a loss in the same period last year. This strong performance was driven by a $4.8 billion gain in the value of its Vision Funds, the largest such gain since 2021. The positive results reflect gains from both private investments and listed portfolio companies like Grab Holdings and Swiggy. (not investment advice)</p>
