          <h2>Global Demand for Matcha Creates Supply Shortages and Soaring Prices in Japan</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 03:57:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A worldwide craze for matcha, fueled by its reputation as a superfood and social media trends, has led to significant supply shortages and price hikes, even in its native Japan. The surge in demand, coupled with a post-pandemic tourism boom, has strained Japan's aging farming communities and labor-intensive production process for tencha, the tea leaves used for matcha. Consequently, retailers are rationing supplies and prices have doubled, prompting the Japanese government to consider subsidies to encourage more farmers to cultivate the lucrative green tea powder.</p>

          <p>Lucy Guo, recently named Forbes' youngest self-made billionaire, attributes her entrepreneurial drive to a frugal upbringing by immigrant parents that motivated her to seek financial independence from a young age. She began trading Pokémon cards on the playground and later developed coding skills to create and sell bots for online games. This early start eventually led her to drop out of Carnegie Mellon University to accept a Thiel Fellowship, co-found the AI company Scale AI, and later launch the monetization platform Passes.</p>

          <p>New figures from England's Department for Education reveal a strong correlation between school attendance in the first week of term and persistent absence later in the year. The data from 2024 showed that 57% of pupils who missed some school in the first week went on to be "persistently absent," compared to only 14% of those with full attendance. In response, the Education Secretary is urging schools and parents to prioritize attendance from day one to combat the ongoing post-pandemic challenge of high student absenteeism.</p>

          <p>Chelsea and England defender Millie Bright has reflected on her decision to withdraw from the Euro 2025 squad, calling it essential for her mental and physical well-being. After a demanding season where she helped Chelsea secure a domestic treble, Bright felt she was on the verge of a breakdown and could not perform at her best. Choosing to prioritize her health, she underwent knee surgery and began counseling, and now feels mentally and physically rejuvenated ahead of the new Women's Super League season.</p>

          <p>Dr. Sohan Dasgupta, a political appointee of President Trump, is stepping down from his leadership role at the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) after a four-month tenure, declaring his mission "accomplished." During his time, he focused on repositioning the foreign aid agency as a strategic investment tool for the U.S., emphasizing returns on investment and countering Chinese influence. Dasgupta's efforts aligned with the "America First" agenda, reframing MCC's projects in countries like Nepal and Kosovo as crucial for U.S. national security and economic interests.</p>

          <p>In an innovative experiment to reduce wolf-livestock conflicts, U.S. biologists are using drones equipped with loudspeakers to scare wolves away from cattle. The drones broadcast a variety of startling sounds, including the rock band AC/DC, clips from films like "Marriage Story," and live human voices, which have proven effective in interrupting wolf hunts. This non-lethal hazing technique is part of an ongoing effort to find creative solutions for coexistence as gray wolf populations recover and expand in the western United States.</p>
