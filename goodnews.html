          <p>Actor Jason Bateman reflected on his struggles after achieving fame as a child star, explaining that a lack of a normal youth led to a period of intense partying in his 20s that nearly derailed his career. He recalled feeling that the industry had moved on without him, leading to deep anxiety and a consideration of leaving Hollywood entirely. The turning point came with his role in "Arrested Development," which revitalized his career and led to acclaimed dramatic roles in shows like "Ozark." Bateman now looks back on his journey as a cautionary tale, expressing that while he wouldn't change his past, he wouldn't want his own children to experience similar pressures.</p>

          <p>A massive, airship-like flying wind turbine, the S1500, successfully completed a test flight in China's Xinjiang region, generating one megawatt of power. Developed by Beijing-based startup Sawes Energy Technology, the turbine is the size of a basketball court and floats on helium to capture stronger, more consistent winds at higher altitudes. The company achieved all its goals during the desert trial, which included assembly, launch, and retrieval in challenging conditions. With mass production planned for 2026, this test marks a significant step toward deploying a new form of renewable energy technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Congress is considering the Claiming Age Clarity Act, a bipartisan bill designed to make Social Security's retirement benefit language easier for Americans to understand. The proposed changes would rename the "early eligibility age" (62) to "minimum benefit age" and the "full retirement age" (66-67) to "standard benefit age." Similarly, age 70 would become the "maximum benefit age." Proponents argue that this new terminology more accurately reflects the financial consequences of claiming benefits at different times, helping individuals make more informed decisions about their retirement security.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The bipartisan ROAD to Housing Act, which passed unanimously in a Senate committee, is being viewed as a promising federal approach to the U.S. housing crisis. The bill encourages the development of model zoning codes and provides financial incentives to municipalities that increase their housing supply. Analysts at the Economic Innovation Group suggest this could lay the groundwork for "Right-to-Build Zones," where cities could adopt less restrictive federal zoning rules in specific areas to streamline construction. This strategy aims to bypass local-level opposition that often stifles development, offering a potential breakthrough for housing policy.</p>

          <p>A London court has thrown out the terrorism case against Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, known as Mo Chara from the Irish rap group Kneecap, due to a procedural error. He was charged for allegedly displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah at a concert, an act he described as a political statement about Gaza. The chief magistrate ruled the charge was "unlawful" because prosecutors failed to obtain the necessary consent from the Director of Public Prosecutions within the six-month statutory time limit. Outside the court, Ó hAnnaidh stated the case was an attempt to silence dissent over the situation in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Costco delivered robust financial results for its fourth quarter, exceeding Wall Street estimates for both revenue and earnings. The wholesale retailer's success was driven by a significant 14% increase in membership fee income and expanding gross margins, aided by supply chain improvements and a higher penetration of its private-label Kirkland Signature products. Total revenue grew 8% year-over-year to $86.16 billion. While membership renewal rates saw a slight dip, attributed to a rise in online sign-ups which tend to have lower retention, the company's overall performance demonstrated continued strength in a challenging retail climate.</p>

          <p>Truck maker Paccar, the parent company of Peterbilt and Kenworth, saw its stock price jump over 6% following President Donald Trump's announcement of a 25% tariff on imported heavy trucks. The new import tax is expected to benefit Paccar by leveling the competitive landscape. According to analysts, the company's domestically manufactured trucks are more expensive than those produced by competitors in countries like Mexico. The tariff is designed to protect U.S. manufacturers from what the president described as an "onslaught of outside interruptions," directly addressing this price disparity.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs has announced the suspension of recently unveiled export controls on semiconductor products destined for South Africa. The decision to halt the curbs, which were set to take effect in November, follows a diplomatic tussle in which Pretoria demanded that Taipei's representative office be renamed. The South African government has reportedly agreed to suspend its demand pending further discussions, prompting Taiwan to pause its first-ever unilateral chip restrictions against a foreign government. This move signals a de-escalation as both sides seek a diplomatic resolution.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Goldman Sachs survey of 245 global family offices reveals that the ultra-wealthy prefer investing in the artificial intelligence boom through public equities and ETFs rather than direct investments in private startups. Over 52% of these investment firms reported exposure to AI via public stocks, compared to just 25% investing directly in private AI companies. This preference is partly attributed to more confidence in the valuations of public companies compared to the often-inflated valuations in private markets. The trend indicates a more cautious, mainstream approach to AI investing among the world's wealthiest families. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As Judy Blume's influential young adult novel "Forever..." marks its 50th anniversary, this article examines its lasting cultural impact. Published in 1975, the book was revolutionary for its honest and non-judgmental depiction of teenage sexuality from a young woman's perspective. It portrayed its protagonist, Katherine, taking control of her own sexual narrative, from getting birth control to experiencing her first sexual relationship, without facing dire consequences. For decades, the book served as a rite of passage for young readers and attracted controversy for validating female desire, making it a landmark text in adolescent literature.</p>
