          <p>In a recent interview, House Financial Services Chairman French Hill urged the administration to seize frozen Russian central bank assets to directly fund Ukraine's reconstruction, a more aggressive step than just using the interest. He also affirmed his belief in the Federal Reserve's independence, stating that while presidents can be critical, he does not think they have the authority to fire the Fed chair. Additionally, Hill promoted upcoming bipartisan legislation to create clear regulations for digital assets, arguing it would protect consumers and solidify America's leadership in financial technology.

          <p>Belgian sprinter Tim Merlier won his second stage of the 2025 Tour de France, emerging victorious in a bunch sprint on stage nine from Chinon to Chateauroux. The victory came after a dramatic, day-long breakaway attempt by Mathieu van der Poel was caught by the peloton within the final kilometer of the race. Despite the exciting finish, the general classification remains unchanged, with defending champion Tadej Pogacar maintaining his 54-second lead over Remco Evenepoel, though Pogacar's team suffered the loss of key rider Joao Almeida due to injury.</p>

          <p>The new 'Superman' movie provided a strong start for the rebooted DC cinematic universe, earning an estimated $122 million in its domestic opening weekend and $217 million globally. This debut marks the best-ever opening for a solo Superman film and represents a crucial success for DC Studios under the new leadership of James Gunn and Peter Safran. The film's performance is seen as a positive reset for the brand, which has had a mixed box-office track record in recent years, and provides momentum for their planned 10-year slate of interconnected films and television shows.</p>

          <p>In a significant development for player welfare, FIFA has reached an agreement with the global players' union, Fifpro, to introduce mandatory rest periods. The consensus includes ensuring a 72-hour gap between matches and a minimum three-week break for players at the end of each season. This agreement comes after Fifpro filed a lawsuit against the governing body over concerns that the expanded fixture calendar, including the new 32-team Club World Cup, was increasing the risk of player injury and burnout without proper consultation.</p>

          <p>The 2026 Senate race in North Carolina is shaping up to be highly competitive following Senator Thom Tillis's announcement that he will not seek re-election. His departure opens up a key seat in a perennial swing state, energizing Democratic hopes of capturing it. The decision sets the stage for what is expected to be an expensive and closely watched battle, as both parties will heavily invest in securing control of the seat. The outcome will be significant for the balance of power in the U.S. Senate.</p>

          <p>This article highlights numerous abandoned sites worldwide that have found new life as popular and often surreal tourist attractions. The list includes locations like the Maunsell Sea Forts in England, which were WWII defense towers, and Kolmanskop, a Namibian diamond-mining town now being reclaimed by desert sands. Other examples range from a sunken prison in Estonia that is now a beach to a replica of Paris in China, demonstrating how derelict spaces can be repurposed into fascinating destinations that offer a unique glimpse into the past.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The use of investigative genetic genealogy, a technique that combines DNA analysis with family tree research, has become a revolutionary tool for law enforcement in solving cold cases. This article details how hobbyist-turned-expert Barbara Rae-Venter used public DNA databases to identify the Golden State Killer, a notorious criminal who had evaded capture for decades. The method, which involves building a suspect's family tree from distant DNA relatives, has since been adopted by police departments nationwide, leading to breakthroughs in numerous unsolved homicides and sexual assaults.</p>

          <p>In the year following the attempted assassination of President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service has implemented significant technological upgrades to bolster its security operations. The agency is now deploying military-grade drones for enhanced aerial reconnaissance and mobile command posts that ensure direct radio communication with local law enforcement, addressing a key failure from the 2024 incident. These reforms are part of a broader effort to overhaul procedures and prevent a repeat of the security lapses that occurred.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced that the government will be taking steps to make electric cars cheaper for consumers to buy. While she did not confirm reports of a £700 million subsidy plan, she guaranteed that new measures to lower the upfront cost would be revealed later in the week. This initiative comes alongside a new funding package to improve charging infrastructure, including making it easier for people without driveways to charge their vehicles, addressing key barriers that have made motorists hesitant to switch to EVs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Professor Zheng Yongnian, a prominent Beijing policy adviser, has argued that Chinese think tanks must become more "self-centred" and develop an "indigenous knowledge system" to effectively project the country's soft power. He asserted that to explain China's unique practices and predict its future, these institutions should focus on empirical research based on China's own experiences rather than relying on Western academic frameworks. According to Zheng, this shift is necessary for think tanks to provide practical policy analysis and move beyond the more theoretical, post-analysis function often seen in university research.</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon men's final will feature a highly anticipated rematch between the world's top two players, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, just five weeks after their epic five-set final at the French Open.

This marks the first time since the Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal era that the same two men have contested both the French Open and Wimbledon finals in the same year, setting the stage for another classic encounter on Centre Court.</p>

          <p>Gisèle Pelicot, a 72-year-old French woman who gained international acclaim for waiving her anonymity to testify against her husband, has been awarded the Legion of Honour, France's highest distinction. Her husband was convicted of drugging and sexually assaulting her, and of inviting dozens of other men to abuse her over a decade while she was unconscious. Pelicot's courage in speaking out publicly during the trial was praised by President Emmanuel Macron and has been credited with inspiring other survivors of sexual assault to come forward and make "shame swap sides."</p>

          <p>According to a U.S. space surveillance firm, two Chinese satellites, Shijian-21 and Shijian-25, appear to have docked in geostationary orbit in what may be a historic autonomous refueling mission. The satellites were observed in prolonged, close-proximity operations for several days in early July, during which they seemed to be visually merged, suggesting a successful docking at an altitude of nearly 36,000 km. If confirmed as a refueling operation, this would mark a significant achievement in on-orbit satellite servicing technology for China, a capability the United States has not yet demonstrated.</p>
