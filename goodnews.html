          <p>A private dinner with Tan Su Shan, the CEO of DBS Group, was auctioned for approximately $14,790, more than doubling its pre-sale estimate. The event, managed by Sotheby's, was part of the National Gallery Singapore's 10th-anniversary gala, which raised over $2.8 million Singapore dollars in total. Such auctions offering experiences with high-profile business leaders are a common fundraising method, famously exemplified by dinners with Warren Buffett that have fetched millions. The proceeds from this event will support the gallery's mission to enhance art accessibility through new exhibitions, research, and community engagement programs.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK includes high-level diplomatic meetings following a day of royal pageantry at Windsor Castle with King Charles III. On Thursday, the president is scheduled for talks with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at the country estate of Chequers to discuss a UK-US trade deal and other matters. The visit is considered unusual, as second-term US presidents are not typically offered a full state visit. The itinerary also includes a business reception and a joint news conference, while First Lady Melania Trump will participate in separate events at Windsor Castle.</p>

The agenda is expected to focus on finalizing the U.S.-U.K. trade deal, with Trump indicating he is open to helping refine the agreement.

          <p>Chinese technology firm Huawei has unveiled new AI computing systems powered by its proprietary Ascend chips, positioning itself as a direct competitor to U.S. industry leader Nvidia. The company announced its "Atlas 950 SuperCluster," which will utilize over 500,000 Ascend chips and is slated for launch next year. Huawei claims its system architecture will deliver significantly more computing power than comparable Nvidia products, aiming to overcome U.S. sanctions that restrict access to advanced semiconductors. This move underscores China's strategic push for self-reliance in critical technologies, particularly in the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to lower its benchmark interest rate, Asian markets demonstrated a mixed performance, with Japan's Nikkei 225 index notably surging to a new record high. The Fed's move was framed as a "risk management cut," with indications of two more potential cuts by year's end, creating some uncertainty for investors. While Japanese tech and real estate sectors saw significant gains, other regional markets like Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 experienced losses. The article notes that the Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its current policy rates in its upcoming meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European stock markets opened higher as investors reacted to the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index saw gains, with the banking sector performing particularly well. Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the move as a "risk management" cut, tempering expectations for a long series of reductions this year, which created some initial volatility in U.S. markets. Meanwhile, traders in Europe are awaiting the Bank of England's upcoming interest rate decision, where it is widely expected to keep rates unchanged at their current level.

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk announced that its once-daily obesity pill demonstrated "significant" weight reduction in a late-stage trial, with results comparable to its popular Wegovy injection. The phase 3 trial showed that the oral semaglutide treatment led to an average weight loss of 16.6% after 64 weeks. This development intensifies the competition among drugmakers to bring an effective oral weight-loss treatment to market, which would offer a more accessible alternative for patients averse to injections. The pill is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, with a decision expected later this year.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. The weather system is currently forecast to remain over open water and poses no immediate threat to land. Meteorologists anticipate that Gabrielle will track north of the Caribbean and could intensify into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend as it moves through the Atlantic. While its path remains uncertain, the storm could potentially approach Bermuda next week. So far, the 2025 hurricane season has been quieter than initially predicted by NOAA.</p>
