          <p>Mother and son duo Caroline and Tom Bridge have won the fifth season of BBC One's 'Race Across The World,' a competition where teams race approximately 8,700 miles from northern China to the southernmost tip of India. The pair navigated through seven checkpoints across China, Nepal, and India, relying on a limited budget and resourcefulness to secure transportation, food, and accommodation. The winning team will share a cash prize of ¬£20,000, which they earned by keeping their victory a secret from friends and family until the broadcast of the final episode. Both Caroline and Tom expressed that the experience has strengthened their bond and instilled new confidence in Caroline, and they now plan to backpack through Kazakhstan.</p>

          <p>Former World No. 1 golfer Jason Day believes Scottie Scheffler is showing potential greatness comparable to Tiger Woods, citing Scheffler's consistent performance and dominance in the sport. Day noted that Scheffler's ability to consistently finish in the top five when he doesn't win is a rare feat. Scheffler's recent achievements include eight wins last year, including the Masters and Olympics, and three wins this year, solidifying his position as the World No. 1. Day acknowledged Woods' unparalleled dominance but suggested Scheffler is building himself into the next major force in golf.</p>

          <p>Kilauea volcano on Hawaii's Big Island has erupted for the 25th time since December, spewing lava fountains over 330 feet high from its north vent. The latest eruptive episode follows a period of gas-pistoning, with lava flows feeding into multiple streams. The U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory is monitoring the activity, warning of potential hazards including volcanic gas, vog (volcanic smog), and Pele's hair. The volcano has been pausing and resuming its eruptions, with most episodes lasting about a day or less, and the USGS has set up livestreams to monitor the summit.</p>

          <p>Following the death of Beach Boys frontman Brian Wilson at the age of 82, Sir Paul McCartney and other prominent musicians have paid tribute to his musical genius and legacy.

These owners prioritize a career defined by a local community, emphasizing personal connections with customers, employees, and suppliers. To improve their odds, they avoid high-rent spaces, run multiple operations from a shared space, and work the room in person. Despite challenges like changing consumer preferences, the threat of tariffs, and recent disruptions, these small, local restaurants offer good food with comfort and connection.</p>

          <p>The world mourns the death of music icon Brian Wilson, who passed away Wednesday at 82, and during the start of the 90's he recorded a rap song called ‚ÄúSmart Girls‚Äù. Wilson's ‚ÄúSmart Girls‚Äù was supposed to be the centerpiece and/or big closing number of his Sire Records album ‚ÄúSweet Insanity,‚Äù. Wilson's willingness to experiment with different musical styles is noted, and it's highlighted that he enlisted Matt Dike, a hip-hop producer, to help instead of thinking he could just make a rap song by himself. While other songs from the still-unreleased ‚ÄúSweet Insanity‚Äù would be rerecorded and eventually released on subsequent Wilson projects, namely 2004‚Äôs ‚ÄúGettin In Over My Head,‚Äù ‚ÄúSmart Girls‚Äù never saw an official release.</p>
