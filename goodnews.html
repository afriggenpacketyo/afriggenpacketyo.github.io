        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has recommended that veterinary practices be legally required to publish their prices, enabling pet owners to compare costs and find better deals. A CMA investigation found that vet prices have increased by 63% over seven years, nearly twice the rate of inflation, often leaving owners in the dark about potential expenses. The watchdog also highlighted that practices owned by large corporate groups charge significantly more than independent vets. These provisional findings propose solutions like mandating ownership disclosure, capping prescription fees, and prohibiting treatment-specific bonuses to address transparency and cost concerns in the £6.3 billion industry.</p>

          <p>Team GB track cyclist Jack Carlin, a four-time Olympic medalist, has announced his retirement from the sport at 28, citing a loss of motivation after the Paris Olympic Games. Carlin, who earned team sprint silver and sprint bronze in both Paris and Tokyo, admitted he couldn't "ignite that spark again" following a severe crash in his final Olympic event. Despite earlier excitement for the Glasgow 2026 Commonwealth Games, he concluded that he could no longer commit 100% to the rigorous demands of elite cycling. Carlin, who is Scotland's fourth most decorated Olympian, expressed contentment with his achievements and is now exploring a new identity beyond professional cycling.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' postseason success is increasingly driven by the lower half of their batting lineup, which has proven relentless and resourceful. In Game 2 of the National League Championship Series against the Milwaukee Brewers, the 6th through 9th hitters combined for seven hits, three runs, and three RBIs in a 5-1 victory. This trend shows the bottom of the order slashing an impressive .302/.391/.448 with 35 hits and 14 RBIs across eight playoff games, outperforming the top five hitters. The team emphasizes mutual trust and confidence in every player's ability to deliver, highlighting the lineup's unexpected depth.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has rejected Alex Jones' appeal, leaving intact the $1.4 billion defamation judgment against him for falsely claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax. The Infowars host had argued against a default judgment of liability without a trial on the merits of the allegations from victims' families. The justices issued their order without comment, reaffirming the lower court's decision which cited Jones' repeated failure to comply with court rulings and produce evidence. Jones, who filed for bankruptcy, continues to appeal a separate $49 million judgment in Texas.</p>

          <p>The USA men's national soccer team secured a 2-1 victory over Australia in a friendly match, with striker Haji Wright scoring two goals to overturn an early deficit. Australia's Jordy Bos opened the scoring, but Wright's double, including a crucial second-half strike, ensured the win for the World Cup co-hosts. The match saw USA captain Christian Pulisic exit early due to a lower leg injury after several heavy challenges. The physical encounter also featured rising tensions and a scuffle between the teams, as USA manager Mauricio Pochettino continues to prepare his young squad for next year's tournament. This win is the USA's first in some time.</p>

          <p>Yoshinobu Yamamoto pitched a masterful complete game, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 5-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series. This historic performance marked the first complete game by a Japanese pitcher in postseason history and the first by a Dodger since 2004, extending their series lead to 2-0. Yamamoto's dominance, requiring no bullpen support, highlighted the Dodgers' strategy of relying on strong starting pitching to overcome an unreliable bullpen. The win positions the Dodgers strongly for a World Series appearance, with 79 of 93 teams holding a 2-0 lead in a best-of-seven series ultimately advancing.</p>

          <p>A TV advertisement by Red Tractor, the UK's largest certifier of farm products, has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) for exaggerating its environmental benefits. The ASA ruled that Red Tractor lacked sufficient evidence to substantiate claims that its farms ensured a "high degree of environmental protection." Environmental group River Action, which filed the complaint, accused the scheme of "greenwashing" and urged supermarkets to reconsider its use. Red Tractor, however, called the decision "fundamentally flawed," arguing its primary focus is food safety and animal welfare, not environmental standards, which it leaves to the Environment Agency.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice announced the largest cryptocurrency forfeiture in history, seizing approximately $15 billion in Bitcoin linked to a vast "pig butchering" fraud operation based in Cambodia. Chen Zhi, the founder of Prince Holding Group, was indicted on wire fraud and money laundering charges, though he remains at large. Prosecutors allege Zhi's conglomerate secretly grew into one of Asia's largest transnational criminal organizations, operating forced-labor scam compounds where victims were coerced into cryptocurrency investment schemes. The Treasury Department also sanctioned Prince Group and over 100 associated individuals and entities, citing their roles in illicit activities and human suffering. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County officials have declared a state of emergency in response to ongoing federal immigration raids, citing widespread fear and financial impact on residents. The proclamation, passed by a 4-1 vote, empowers the county to mobilize resources, seek state and federal aid, and expedite contracts to support immigrant communities. Supervisors stated that the raids have disrupted local economies, decreased workplace attendance, and strained essential services like schools and hospitals. This declaration aims to provide relief, including rent assistance and legal aid, for tenants affected by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) actions, which have intensified since June.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed several key bills aimed at making artificial intelligence and social media safer for children and teenagers. Senate Bill 243 mandates AI companies incorporate guardrails against self-harm content and require chatbots to alert minors they are not human every three hours, prohibiting sexually explicit content for underage users. Assembly Bill 316 removes a civil legal defense for AI developers, holding them accountable for harm caused by their products. Additionally, AB 621 increases penalties for creating nonconsensual "deepfake" AI pornography, and AB 56 will require warning labels on social media platforms for minors.</p>
