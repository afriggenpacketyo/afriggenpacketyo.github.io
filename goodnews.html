          <h2>Captive-Bred Axolotls Show Promising Survival Rates in Restored Mexican Wetlands</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 06:03:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have found that captive-bred axolotls, a critically endangered species, are thriving in restored wetlands in Mexico City. The study tracked 18 axolotls released in 2017 and 2018, noting they gained weight and successfully hunted prey while avoiding predators. This indicates that captive-bred axolotls can adapt to and survive in the wild, even in man-made habitats, offering hope for the species' comeback and potentially mitigating the effects of habitat degradation and climate change. The axolotl is significant to Mexican culture and history, making its conservation a priority for both scientific and cultural reasons.</p>

          <p>The Kentucky Derby is highlighted as a significant event showcasing Latino jockeys, who make up a substantial portion of competitors in American horseracing.

Immigration policies are impacting the industry, with many riders relying on visas to compete in the U.S. The article emphasizes the sacrifices these athletes make, leaving families behind and training rigorously to reach the highest levels of competition, and recognizes the historical contributions of Latinos to the sport, from grooms to winning jockeys.</p>

          <p>The article argues that universities, particularly research universities, are vital to society because they embody the First Amendment's commitment to the pursuit of knowledge and truth. Universities are uniquely structured to discover, preserve, and disseminate knowledge, and they deserve special standing within First Amendment jurisprudence, similar to the press. The author contends that universities should actively defend their role and seek legal precedents that protect their academic freedom, especially in the face of government intrusion and funding threats. The author emphasizes the importance of universities remaining free from political control to fulfill their mission of advancing understanding and serving as societal critics.</p>

          <p>A new training program called CHAT (Changing Talk) is helping caregivers reduce their use of "elderspeak," a form of communication with older adults that resembles baby talk. Studies have linked elderspeak to increased resistance to care among nursing home residents with dementia. The CHAT program, which includes videos and interactive sessions, has shown success in decreasing elderspeak and reducing resistant behaviors in care settings. The article also suggests ways for individuals and institutions to combat elderspeak, such as addressing clients respectfully and being mindful of cultural differences.</p>
