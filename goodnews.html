          <p>China is set to launch its Tianwen-2 mission at the end of May 2025, marking its first attempt to survey and collect samples from an asteroid, Kamo'oalewa, putting China in competition with the US and Japan. The mission, expected to last a decade, involves a "touch-and-go" technique and a second "anchor and attach" technique for sample retrieval. Following the asteroid exploration, Tianwen-2 will analyze the comet 311P/PANSTARRS, furthering China's interplanetary exploration endeavors and contributing to understanding the composition of space objects. The name "Tianwen," derived from a Chinese poem, translates to "Heavenly Questions."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously upheld the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners who argued permission was needed. The ruling centers on the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, granting public access for "open-air recreation," which the court interprets to include camping. This decision, celebrated by campaigners, is expected to reignite discussions about public access to land in England, with calls to extend wild camping rights to other areas. The Dartmoor National Park Association emphasized that responsible camping is expected, urging visitors to "tread lightly and leave no trace."</p>

          <p>Real Madrid and England midfielder Jude Bellingham is set to undergo shoulder surgery after the Club World Cup, which is expected to sideline him for at least six weeks at the start of the next season.

Bellingham's absence will likely include preseason and England's World Cup qualifiers in September, following a successful first season with Real Madrid where he helped secure the La Liga title and Champions League.</p>

          <p>A leaked memo indicates that Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's department urged Chancellor Rachel Reeves to raise taxes by ¬£3bn to ¬£4bn annually before this year's Spring Statement, proposals which Reeves did not implement. The memo suggested increasing corporation tax on banks, extending the freeze on the 45% tax rate threshold, scrapping the tax-free allowance on dividends, and reinstating the lifetime pensions allowance. While government insiders claim such exchanges are routine, the memo highlights ongoing tensions within the Labour party regarding tax and spending decisions, particularly concerning welfare cuts and the funding of increased defense spending.</p>

The Booker jury praised Mushtaq's writing as witty, vivid, moving, and excoriating, highlighting her characters' resilience and her observation of human nature. Mushtaq's work draws from her own experiences, including overcoming post-partum depression, and reflects her activism against social injustices and challenges to religious interpretations.

It examines how small changes in the storyline can lead to vastly different outcomes, potentially exploring the theme of "what if" scenarios.
