          <p>European markets experienced a rebound, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 gaining after two consecutive sessions of decline, as traders awaited Nvidia's quarterly earnings report, a key indicator for the AI sector. France's CAC 40 index also recovered despite concerns over potential political instability and challenges in passing the 2026 budget, following opposition parties' refusal to support Prime Minister Francois Bayrou in an upcoming confidence vote. Meanwhile, U.S. futures showed slight gains, and Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed after China's industrial profits narrowed their decline in July, signaling a complex global economic landscape.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its Starship rocket for its tenth test flight, marking a significant comeback after earlier explosive failures. The more than 400-foot rocket achieved its first successful payload deployment of eight mock Starlink satellites, relit its Raptor engine in orbit, and stress-tested its reusable heat shield. This success is crucial for SpaceX's commercial ambitions and NASA's Artemis program, which plans to use Starship for the first crewed mission to the Moon since Apollo, currently scheduled for mid-2027.</p>

The article details Moldova's turbulent history, including its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the unresolved Transnistria conflict, and the pro-Russian sentiment among the Gagauz minority. Despite these challenges, Moldova was granted EU candidate status in 2022, receiving military support from European countries and hosting high-level European leaders for its 34th independence anniversary.</p>

          <p>China's embattled property market is exhibiting early signs of recovery, with some major developers reporting stronger earnings and reduced losses. State-owned China Resources Land saw its interim net profit rise by 16.2%, while privately owned Sunac's interim loss narrowed by 14.4%. These improvements are attributed to government stimulus measures and a recovery in retail consumption, indicating that policy lifelines are beginning to alleviate the debt crisis that plagued many developers a year prior.

          <p>Denmark's National Museum has unveiled what is believed to be the first 'portrait' of a Viking: a miniature 10th-century figurine carved from walrus tusk. Measuring just 1.2 inches, the artwork depicts a man with an imperial mustache, braided beard, and neatly-groomed hairstyle, challenging common perceptions of Vikings as wild. Curator Peter Pentz noted the figure's detailed carvings and smiling expression are unique among Viking Age art, which typically features animal motifs and simplistic human representations, suggesting it could represent a high-ranking individual like King Harald Bluetooth.</p>

          <p>Polly Bancroft, CEO of League Two club Grimsby Town, shared her excitement and the logistical challenges surrounding their Carabao Cup second-round draw against her former club, Manchester United. The rare fixture, their first meeting since 1948, caused Grimsby's website to crash due to immense interest, highlighting the financial boost for the smaller club. Bancroft, who previously headed Manchester United's women's football, is now focused on fully integrating Grimsby's women's team into the club's fabric, advocating for greater diversity and visibility for women in senior football roles.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets exhibited mixed trading results as investors evaluated new economic data from China and the impact of U.S. tariffs on India. China's industrial profits saw a narrowed decline of 1.5% in July, indicating a slight recovery after months of steeper drops, while Japan's Nikkei 225 was marginally higher, boosted by Nikon Corporation's surge. Concurrently, secondary U.S. tariffs of 25% on Indian shipments took effect, pushing overall duties to 50%, with Indian markets closed for a holiday, creating uncertainty across the region.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits declined by a narrower 1.5% year-on-year in July, a notable recovery from steeper drops in previous months, signaling the effectiveness of Beijing's campaign against intense price wars. The article highlights that government policies aimed at stabilizing consumer price levels have improved corporate profitability, particularly in the raw-material manufacturing sector, which rebounded significantly. Despite this positive trend, economists predict that manufacturing activity may remain in contractionary territory, emphasizing that deflationary pressures are likely to persist until market consolidation occurs.
