          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its plan to garnish Social Security benefits for individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. An Education Department spokesperson stated that this decision reflects the administration's commitment to protecting Social Security recipients, who often rely on a fixed income. This is a significant shift in policy, as the administration had previously announced the resumption of collection activity on the $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio after a nearly half-decade pause due to Covid-era policies. More than 450,000 federal student loan borrowers age 62 and older are in default and likely receiving Social Security benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pop Mart, the company behind the popular collectible character Labubu, is gaining international recognition, prompting analysts to compare its success to that of Sanrio's Hello Kitty. Labubu, a cute monster charm, has attracted a global fanbase, including celebrities like David Beckham's family, and has driven Pop Mart's stock to record highs. Some analysts suggest that Labubu's appeal lies in its ability to tap into universal emotions through strong design and clever marketing, representing a new model for Chinese cultural exports. The article also notes Pop Mart's surge in international sales, particularly in the US and Europe, which has made it a favorite among investors.</p>

The new portrait, taken by chief White House photographer Daniel Torok, will replace the existing official photographs in federal buildings and offices.

          <p>NPR is seeking submissions from parents about the songs they sing to their babies, inspired by a Yale University study that finds singing to babies lifts their moods and improves their well-being. The study, which surveyed 110 parents and their babies, found that infants who are sung to frequently are generally happier throughout the day. Researchers encourage parents to sing any songs they like, not just traditional lullabies, to provide their babies with the opportunity to hear their voice. NPR is inviting parents to upload recordings of themselves singing to their babies, with the possibility of the submissions being featured on Morning Edition.</p>

          <p>Despite a strong stock market rally in May, ETF flows suggest that investors remain skeptical about the strength of U.S. equities. While equity ETFs experienced significant inflows at the start of the year, those inflows have decreased by more than half since the market recovered from April losses. Investors are primarily seeking refuge in ultra-short duration assets, such as T-bill ETFs, indicating a cautious stance on stocks. This suggests that the year could follow a pattern from bull market history, with a more cautious approach to equities and a focus on short-term gains. (not investment advice)</p>
