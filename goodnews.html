          <p>Tropical Storm Erin is projected to intensify into the Atlantic season's first hurricane by Saturday and further strengthen to a major Category 3 storm by Sunday as it moves north of Puerto Rico. While the storm is not expected to make direct landfall in the United States, its outer bands will bring rain and dangerous surf to Puerto Rico. The current forecast track shows Erin remaining over the ocean between Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast. However, it will generate a high risk of rip currents along the East Coast from August 21 to August 27, and meteorologists will continue to monitor its path for any deviations.</p>

          <p>Amid persistent inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a savings vehicle with returns that can outpace the inflation rate, providing a secure, insured investment. The article notes that while national average yields for CDs are modest, top online banks offer significantly higher rates, particularly for short-term CDs with terms of six months to one year. This phenomenon, known as an inverted yield curve, makes shorter-term investments more lucrative than longer ones in the current economic climate. To maximize returns, savers are advised to compare rates from various online institutions and consider laddering CDs of different term lengths. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and HELOCs offer a more affordable borrowing solution compared to high-interest personal loans and credit cards. As of August 2025, average rates for these products are in the single digits and are expected to decrease if the Federal Reserve implements further rate cuts. The article explains the difference between a fixed-rate home equity loan, which provides a lump sum, and a variable-rate HELOC, which acts as a revolving line of credit. It also highlights potential tax benefits while cautioning that the home serves as collateral for these loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Building an emergency fund is crucial, and high-yield savings accounts currently provide a powerful tool for growing savings faster than traditional accounts. While the national average savings rate is a meager 0.38%, top high-yield accounts from online banks are offering rates between 4.11% and 4.30%. These online institutions can offer better rates due to lower overhead costs, and many have low minimum deposit requirements and no monthly fees. The article advises consumers to compare different high-yield savings options to secure the best possible interest rate and maximize their earnings over time. (not investment advice)</p>

The article suggests that rates may stabilize or fall if the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hikes, offering potential relief for borrowers.

Kennedy, a long-time vaccine skeptic, called the research a 'deceitful propaganda stunt' and demanded its retraction.
