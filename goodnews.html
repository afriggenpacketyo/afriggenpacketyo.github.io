          <p>Following the successful $17 billion initial public offering of Swedish payments firm Klarna, the financial technology sector is anticipating a new wave of companies going public. Klarna's strong debut has signaled a renewed investor appetite for large fintech listings, encouraging other major players to consider a stock market debut. Companies like digital payments giant Stripe, digital bank Revolut, and British neobank Monzo are among the top contenders being watched by investors. While some, like Stripe, have recently opted for secondary share sales, the positive market reception for Klarna could accelerate their timelines for a future IPO. (not investment advice)</p>

The meeting is expected to cover several topics, including arrangements for Chinese President Xi Jinping to potentially visit Seoul for the upcoming APEC summit. If confirmed, this would mark Xi's first visit to South Korea since 2014 and represents an opportunity to reset relations under South Korea's new president, Lee Jae-myung. The diplomatic engagement aims to move past the strained ties experienced under the previous administration, which had closely aligned with Washington.</p>

          <p>A group of climate scientists and experts, who were dismissed from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) by the Trump administration, have revived a popular government climate information website. After the official climate.gov site was effectively dismantled and its content altered, former manager Rebecca Lindsey is leading an effort to relaunch it independently as climate.us. The new platform aims to restore censored data, including information on the disproportionate impacts of climate change on disadvantaged communities, and protect it from political interference. The initiative is funded by public donations and seeks to ensure continued public access to trusted climate science.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite falling to an 0-2 record after an overtime loss to the Dallas Cowboys, the New York Giants displayed a newfound competitiveness that offered a glimmer of hope for their season. Quarterback Russell Wilson delivered a sensational performance with 450 passing yards, connecting repeatedly with star rookie receiver Malik Nabers. Although the team was ultimately undone by costly penalties and a late-game interception, their offensive firepower and fighting spirit were a stark contrast to their previous decade of struggles. This performance suggests that while the team's record is poor, the Giants may finally be a watchable and entertaining team.</p>

          <p>Data from China's central bank indicates a continued flow of household savings into the country's stock market, suggesting that the recent equity rally may have further momentum. In August, deposits at non-banking financial institutions, such as brokerages and mutual funds, rose by 1.17 trillion yuan. This trend is driven by low interest rates on traditional bank deposits, which are pushing investors to seek better returns in the capital markets. With the earnings yield of major Chinese companies significantly higher than government bond yields, equities are becoming an increasingly attractive asset class for domestic investors.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is considering an innovative initiative, known as 'Coal-to-Nuclear' (C2N), to repurpose retiring coal-fired power plants by converting them into sites for nuclear reactors. Proposed by a top state-owned energy infrastructure builder, this strategy aims to utilize existing infrastructure, particularly in coastal regions, to accelerate decarbonization efforts. The plan focuses on installing fourth-generation nuclear reactors, which may offer enhanced safety features and greater public acceptance. With approximately 100 gigawatts of coal power capacity expected to be retired by 2030, this project presents a direct path toward reducing carbon emissions while preserving valuable energy infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and the United States are set to formalize a major partnership to accelerate the development of nuclear energy, with a focus on advanced and small modular reactors (SMRs). The agreement, announced ahead of President Trump's state visit, includes several private sector deals, such as a plan for Centrica and X-energy to build up to 12 reactors in Hartlepool. A key component of the deal is the mutual recognition of safety checks, which is expected to significantly reduce licensing times for new projects. The initiative aims to bolster energy security, create thousands of jobs, and power energy-intensive AI data centers.</p>

After a promising fourth-quarter comeback victory in his debut, McCarthy was unable to replicate the magic, throwing two interceptions and being sacked six times. The game was largely a defensive battle dominated by field goals, with the only touchdown coming late in the fourth quarter from Falcons running back Tyler Allgeier. Atlanta's ground game was a key factor, as running back Bijan Robinson rushed for an impressive 143 yards.</p>
