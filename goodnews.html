          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has identified several S&P 500 stocks that he considers relatively inexpensive despite the market's recent surge to new highs. He highlighted companies across various sectors, including T-Mobile in telecom, Royal Caribbean and Dollar Tree in consumer goods, and several financial institutions like Citigroup and Capital One. Cramer also pointed to opportunities in healthcare, tech, and industrials, suggesting that even in a soaring market, diligent research can uncover stocks with above-average growth potential at a lower-than-average price.

          <p>Federal health officials have highlighted the potential for leucovorin, a prescription vitamin typically used in cancer and anemia treatment, to be repurposed as a therapy for autism spectrum disorder. The FDA plans to approve the drug for treating cerebral folate deficiency, a condition associated with autism, which would enable Medicaid programs to cover its off-label use for improving speech-related deficits in children. While small studies have shown promise in enhancing communication skills, experts emphasize that leucovorin is not a universal cure and urge families to consult with doctors, as larger clinical trials are still needed to confirm its safety and effectiveness for the broader autistic community.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 4.3 earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay Area early Monday morning, centered near Berkeley, waking many residents across the region. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported that over 22,000 people felt the tremor, which caused shaking and loud noises but resulted in no major damage or injuries. Public transportation services like Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) ran at reduced speeds for safety inspections, causing minor delays for commuters. Officials and residents view the event as a significant reminder of the ever-present risk of a much larger earthquake in the seismically active region.</p>

          <p>Disney has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air, ending a nearly week-long suspension that ignited a national debate on free speech. The show was pulled after host Jimmy Kimmel made comments about the death of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, which drew threats of regulatory action from the FCC chairman. In its statement, Disney explained the suspension was intended to de-escalate a tense situation, calling some of Kimmel's remarks "ill-timed and thus insensitive." The decision to reinstate the show follows significant backlash from First Amendment advocates, Hollywood figures, and even some Republican lawmakers who criticized the government pressure on a media company.</p>

The film, directed by Jon Favreau, marks the first Star Wars theatrical release since 2019.

          <p>NASA has officially introduced its 2025 astronaut class, a group of ten candidates selected from over 8,000 applicants to train for future missions to the International Space Station, the Moon, and Mars. The class, which notably includes more women than men for the first time, features a diverse mix of pilots, scientists, and engineers, including a former SpaceX private astronaut. These candidates will undergo two years of rigorous training before becoming eligible for flight assignments. Their selection comes at a time of uncertainty for NASA, with impending budget cuts and challenges facing the Artemis moon program and the eventual retirement of the ISS.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS in England has launched a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a patient's diagnosis if they present with the same symptoms three times without improvement. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from advanced cancer in 2020 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid over five months. The guidance encourages doctors to conduct further tests, seek second opinions, or refer patients to specialists after three unsuccessful consultations to prevent avoidable deaths. This initiative aims to standardize best practices and improve patient safety, particularly for younger patients whose symptoms of serious illness are often overlooked.</p>

          <p>China is currently drafting its 15th five-year plan, a comprehensive economic blueprint that will guide the nation's development from 2026 to 2030. This strategic document is considered crucial for achieving President Xi Jinping's long-term goals, including reaching the per capita GDP of a "moderately developed country" by 2035. As officials prepare to discuss the plan, experts note that it will need to balance ambitious growth targets with increasing uncertainties both domestically and internationally. Analysts suggest that in the face of a turbulent global landscape, Beijing may need to prioritize qualitative goals and flexibility over rigid quantitative targets to ensure sustainable progress.</p>

          <p>Police in Menlo-Atherton, California, successfully prevented a potential school shooting after receiving a tip through the "Say Something" anonymous reporting system. The tip alerted authorities to concerning Instagram posts made by a former student, prompting a lockdown of two schools until the individual was located and weapons were recovered from their home. The tip line was created by Sandy Hook Promise, an organization founded by families of the 2012 school shooting victims. This incident marks the 19th credible planned school attack the system has helped thwart since its launch in 2018, highlighting the critical role of community reporting in preventing gun violence.</p>

Shedeur, once considered a potential first-round pick, ultimately fell to the fifth round. Deion Sanders defended his son's mindset, stating that elite athletes should not be content to learn from the bench and must be ready to play.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have reportedly reached a basic agreement on the ownership structure of TikTok, with a key stipulation focusing on who controls its powerful and closely guarded algorithm. Under the new arrangement, TikTok's U.S. operations will become a U.S.-based joint venture that will control a copy of the algorithm and oversee security, with software company Oracle providing comprehensive monitoring. This deal aims to resolve national security concerns that the Chinese government could access American user data or manipulate content. The structure appears to be a compromise, allowing a U.S. entity to manage the algorithm without requiring its outright sale, which China had previously vowed to block.</p>

The 28-year-old was instrumental in PSG's treble-winning season, scoring 35 goals and providing 14 assists after stepping into the lead role following Kylian Mbappe's departure. Dembele's transformation is attributed to a newfound maturity and professionalism, as well as a tactical shift under manager Luis Enrique, who encouraged him to be more selfish and goal-oriented. After years plagued by injuries and inconsistency at Barcelona, his journey to being named the world's best player has been an emotional one.</p>
