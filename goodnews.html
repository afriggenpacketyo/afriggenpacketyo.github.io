          <p>Italian cyclist Jonathan Milan won his second stage of this year's Tour de France, emerging victorious in a sprint finish on stage 17. The Lidl-Trek rider navigated a rain-soaked final 30 kilometers and avoided a late crash that involved several of his main rivals. This victory strengthens his hold on the green jersey for the points classification, while Tadej Pogacar safely retained the overall leader's yellow jersey with no changes in the general classification.</p>

Barcelona will cover all of Rashford's wages, saving United a significant sum. The move follows a difficult period for Rashford at Old Trafford, where his form declined and he faced criticism from management, leading to him being excluded from first-team training.</p>

          <p>Republican Congressman Mike Lawler has announced he will not run for governor of New York, instead choosing to seek re-election for his competitive Hudson Valley House seat. Lawler cited the critical importance of maintaining the slim Republican House majority as a key factor in his decision. His choice avoids a potential primary contest against Rep. Elise Stefanik, who is also considering a run against incumbent Governor Kathy Hochul.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued a landmark advisory opinion stating that countries can sue one another over the impacts of climate change, including from historical emissions. This non-binding ruling is seen as a major victory for climate-vulnerable nations, like the Pacific islands that initiated the case, as it could pave the way for future compensation claims. The court affirmed that countries have a legal obligation to protect the climate system under international law.</p>
