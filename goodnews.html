          <p>Walmart's CFO has indicated that consumers are likely to see price increases later this month and more significantly in June due to tariffs, even with recent agreements to lower duties on imports from China. Despite this, Walmart reported better-than-expected earnings per share for the fiscal first quarter, driven by growth in e-commerce, which posted its first profitable quarter both in the U.S. and globally, benefiting from online advertising and its third-party marketplace. The company is maintaining its full-year forecast, but declined to provide EPS guidance for the second quarter due to fluctuating tariff policy. Walmart's advantages, such as being the nation's largest grocer and a well-known value player, help it navigate the uncertain economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz has voiced reservations about banning the far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD), despite the party being classified as a "confirmed right-wing extremist endeavor" by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution. Merz emphasized the need for concrete proof that the AfD is actively undermining Germany's democratic order before considering a ban. While the AfD's platform contains elements that devalue certain population groups, major political parties refuse to form coalitions with them. The debate over how to address the AfD's agenda is becoming a divisive issue within German society.</p>

Hungary has strong trade relations with China, which has become a major investor in the country. Chinese investments in Hungary significantly surpass those in other European nations, and the country is unwilling to relinquish these economic benefits.

          <p>Private schools in the UK report a 22.6% average increase in fees compared to last year, exceeding the government's predicted 10% rise following the introduction of VAT on private school fees. The Independent Schools Council (ISC) attributes the increase to a "triple whammy" of VAT, national insurance changes, and the end of charitable business rates relief. Some schools have reduced fees (excluding VAT) to cushion the impact on parents, but many families are finding private education unaffordable. The government maintains that the fee increases are not solely due to VAT and that ending tax breaks for private schools will fund improvements in state schools.</p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant drop on Thursday due to rising expectations of a potential agreement between the U.S. and Iran regarding Tehran's nuclear program. President Trump's comments in Doha, Qatar, indicated that the U.S. was nearing a nuclear deal with Iran, shortly after an Iranian advisor signaled readiness to sign a deal in exchange for lifted economic sanctions. Analysts predict that a U.S.-Iran nuclear deal could lead to a substantial increase in Iran's crude oil exports, potentially impacting OPEC+'s production plans.

          <p>The UK economy is "beginning to turn a corner" after experiencing higher-than-expected growth of 0.7% in the first three months of the year, driven by increases in consumer spending and business investment. While the Labour government celebrates this progress, critics caution that the strong growth rate is unlikely to continue due to upcoming US import tariffs and increased employer taxes. Despite concerns about the cost of living crisis, the government remains optimistic, citing the UK as the fastest-growing economy in the G7 during this period.</p>

          <p>Germany is endorsing President Trump's proposal to increase NATO members' defense spending target to 5% of their GDP, according to German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul. Wadephul believes that NATO chief Rutte's proposal to increase spending to 3.5% with an additional 1.5% for security-related matters aligns with Trump's demand. Trump has consistently urged NATO members to increase their defense contributions, with some failing to meet the current 2% target.

          <h2>Free Diving Women of Jeju Island May Have Genetic 'Superpower'</h2>

          <p>A new study suggests that the Haenyeo, the all-female free divers of Jeju Island in South Korea, have physiological and genetic adaptations that enable them to endure an extreme lifestyle. These women dive for seafood in cold waters for extended periods, and the study reveals they have a greater drop in heart rate during simulated dives compared to non-diving women. Genetic analysis indicates that people on Jeju Island have genes related to cold tolerance and blood pressure regulation, likely due to generations of divers.</p>
