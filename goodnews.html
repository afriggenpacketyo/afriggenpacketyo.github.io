          <h2>Arsene Wenger Proposes Offside Rule Change to Favor Attackers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 07:44:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, now at FIFA, suggests modifying the offside rule. The proposed change would deem an attacker onside if any part of their body aligns with the last defender, excluding hands and arms. Wenger believes this would restore an advantage to the attacker, which he feels has diminished due to VAR implementation. The current rule considers any part of the body beyond the last defender as offside, leading to frequent marginal calls. This adjustment aims to encourage more attacking play and reduce reliance on video technology for tight decisions.</p>

          <p>A Kenyan court sentenced four men, including two Belgians, to a year in prison or a $7,700 fine for attempting to smuggle thousands of live ants out of the country. The ants, including giant African harvester ants valued at up to ¬£170 each, were destined for European and Asian markets. The court condemned the act as illegal wildlife trade and potential bio-piracy, emphasizing the need to protect all creatures. The Kenya Wildlife Service hailed the ruling as a testament to Kenya's zero-tolerance stance on wildlife trafficking, warning that the demand for rare insect species is growing.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is approaching its policy decision amidst economic uncertainty stemming from President Trump's tariffs and mixed economic signals. The article indicates the Fed is likely to hold steady, awaiting further clarity on trade policies and their impact on inflation expectations. Market expectations suggest a low probability of an interest rate cut in the immediate future, with analysts divided on the timing and extent of potential rate reductions later in the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell faces the challenge of interpreting conflicting data, including consumer pessimism and rising inflation expectations, while maintaining policy flexibility.</p>

          <p>Shares of Novo Nordisk experienced a surge after the drugmaker projected improved sales for its Wegovy weight loss drug in the latter half of 2025, expecting a decline in the availability of compounded copycat drugs. The company reported first-quarter net profit that exceeded expectations, although Wegovy sales fell slightly short of analyst forecasts. The FDA's end to a drug shortage ruling, which previously allowed compounding pharmacies to produce copies of Wegovy and Ozempic, is expected to boost Novo Nordisk's sales. The company also plans to combat copycats by launching a direct-to-consumer online pharmacy and partnering with telehealth providers.</p>

          <p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believes that timing is the primary reason for the club's lack of trophies in recent seasons. He emphasized that success depends on being in the right place at the right time, noting that Liverpool won the Premier League title with fewer points than Arsenal had in the previous two seasons. Arteta remains hopeful that Arsenal will be in the right position to win the Champions League. The Gunners have not won major silverware since the 2020 FA Cup, but they have reached their first Champions League semi-final since 2009.</p>

          <p>Uber reported first-quarter results with earnings per share exceeding expectations, but revenue falling short of anticipated growth. The company's shares subsequently declined.

Uber's CEO highlighted autonomous vehicles as a major opportunity, reporting an annual run-rate of 1.5 million autonomous vehicle trips.

          <p>The UK government has lowered the minimum age to become a train driver from 20 to 18 in an effort to combat driver shortages. The change aims to attract younger recruits and address disruptions caused by a lack of available drivers. The average age of a UK train driver is 48, with a significant portion expected to retire by 2029. Union Aslef supports the move, stating it will open up opportunities for school and college leavers. The Rail Safety and Standards Board's research indicated that 18-year-olds are capable of safely becoming train drivers.</p>

Revenue for the direct-to-consumer business rose 8%, driven by higher prices and increased subscriber numbers. The company expects a modest increase in subscribers in the current quarter.

          <p>Chinese scientists have identified a gene in upland rice roots linked to drought resistance, potentially transforming irrigated rice into drought-tolerant varieties. Researchers from BGI-Research, Huazhong Agricultural University, and Yunnan University discovered that removing the HMGB1 gene in irrigated rice promotes longer roots and greater drought tolerance, similar to upland rice. This could enable rice to thrive in water-scarce environments, enhancing food security. The findings, published in Molecular Plant, highlight the potential to improve crop resilience in the face of climate change.</p>
