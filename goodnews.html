          <p>Junto Nakatani defeated Ryosuke Nishida by technical knockout in the seventh round of their bantamweight title unification bout at Tokyo's Ariake Colosseum, adding the IBF belt to his WBC title. Nishida dislocated his right shoulder, preventing him from continuing the match. Nakatani, who has been primarily based in the United States since junior high school, expressed happiness and confidence after unifying the titles. The victory improved Nakatani's professional record to 31-0, while Nishida suffered his first defeat, falling to 10-1. The two boxers had an intense exchange from the beginning, with Naoya "Monster" Inoue observing from ringside, and Inoue and Nakatani have verbally agreed to fight each other next spring in what would be one of the most intriguing all-Japanese matchups in boxing history. Earlier in the day, Tenshin Nasukawa, a former kickboxing star, won against Victor Santillan by unanimous decision, and Nasukawa now plans to compete for a world title in his subsequent match. The boxing match score is now final.</p>

          <p>Carla Hayden, former Librarian of Congress, shared details about her unexpected termination via email by the Trump administration after serving nearly ten years. Hayden, the first woman and first Black person in the role, stated she received no prior notification or subsequent communication from the White House regarding the decision. She speculates her firing might be linked to a broader effort by the Trump administration to reduce public access to information, particularly concerning diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Hayden's supporters held a town hall meeting to protest her dismissal, emphasizing the importance of the freedom to read and learn. She also highlighted that the Library of Congress primarily fulfills research requests from members of Congress, rather than serving as a public lending library.</p>

          <p>A state-backed think tank in China has proposed four core principles as a framework for addressing disputes in the South China Sea, aiming to transform the region into one of peace and cooperation. These principles include resolving disputes through consultation, managing differences through rules-based co-management, achieving mutually beneficial cooperation, and opposing interference from external forces. China formally presented its cooperation blueprint in 2002 through an agreement with Asean, but its expansive claims over the waters are contested by several member states, including Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Face-offs between Chinese and Philippine vessels have become more frequent since 2023, particularly near Scarborough Shoal, Second Thomas Shoal, and Sandy Cay coral reef.</p>

          <p>Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar has accused John Swinney of running a "dishonest and disgraceful" campaign ahead of the Holyrood by-election, claiming the SNP pushed voters toward Reform UK. Swinney defended his "two-horse race" remark, citing Labour's vote share collapse and a surge for Reform in his party's data. Labour's Davy Russell won the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse seat unexpectedly, defeating the SNP. Swinney indicated he would consider a cabinet reshuffle following the defeat, and Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice hailed the result as a "massive boost" for his party going into the May 2026 vote.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece reflects on how China's historical fear of American conspiracies aimed at subverting the Communist Party through peaceful means has diminished under President Trump. The author recalls being taught from a young age to be vigilant against the dangers of "peaceful evolution," a strategy promoted by John Foster Dulles to undermine socialist countries by promoting Western values. Now, China has emerged as a major economic power, while the US has shifted away from nation-building efforts and lecturing other countries on governance. The author posits that Trump's policies have inadvertently reduced China's concerns about American subversion.</p>

          <p>The poem ‚ÄúUnder a Supermoon‚Äù reflects on finding joy in the minutiae of life, such as the gold flare in cottonwood leaves and the smell of split pi√±on and juniper. The speaker contrasts these simple pleasures with the desire for grander experiences, such as twirling in space or exploring the Mariana Trench. The poem references Blake's idea that persistence in folly leads to wisdom, and it suggests that the speaker has persevered and caught a glimpse of how life has both exploded and given birth to stars within. The poem explores themes of contentment, perseverance, and the beauty of everyday existence.</p>

          <p>An advice column addresses a reader's dilemma about her husband's interest in ethical non-monogamy, while she prefers monogamy and wants more of his attention. The advice emphasizes the importance of open communication and clearly stating one's desires, drawing on Erich Fromm's philosophy that love is an active striving for the other's flourishing, rooted in freedom. The column cautions against both masochistic and sadistic love, advising the reader not to pretend to be open to non-monogamy if it threatens her well-being. It suggests addressing insecurities within the current relationship and setting boundaries, such as asking the husband to cool it with the colleague he's attracted to, and working on interpersonal and intrapersonal skills before revisiting the topic.</p>

American Airlines apologized for the disruption, noting that they usually fly a smaller Boeing 787-8 to Naples.

          <p>Despite President Trump's goal to bring back manufacturing jobs, the aviation industry is struggling to hire skilled workers fast enough. The average age of a certified aircraft mechanic in the U.S. is 54, with 40% over 60, and the country will be short 25,000 technicians by 2028. Companies like GE Aerospace are ramping up hiring and offering on-the-job training, with base pay averaging between $80,000 and $90,000 a year, but hiring remains difficult. The impending worker shortages aren't just for those who repair aircraft and engines, as a shortfall of air traffic controllers has also stifled airline growth and raised safety concerns.</p>

The referendum, triggered by an NGO-led grassroots campaign, includes questions about reducing the residency requirement for citizenship and increasing worker protections against dismissal. The governing right-wing coalition, led by Prime Minister Meloni, advises supporters not to participate, hoping the vote does not reach the required 50% turnout. Campaigners for the citizenship law change argue it will help second-generation Italians better integrate, while Meloni defends the current system as already open.</p>

Chennai, Tamil Nadu, is the epicenter of Indian chess, producing both of India's world champions.

          <p>Tinder's trial of a height filter for premium users has sparked mixed reactions, with some worrying it might stifle connections and others suggesting it could help shorter men find matches. Ashley, who found love with her 5ft 6in partner Joe on Tinder, believes the filter could prevent meaningful connections. Joe suggests limiting oneself to physical attributes lessens opportunities to find a partner, while Matt Heal feels desensitized about dating apps due to preferences for taller men. Beth McColl thinks the filter may offer shorter men reassurance by helping them avoid women who only want to date really tall men, but the real problem of modern dating lies with the apps themselves, encouraging users to treat dating like picking something from the menu.</p>

          <p>The article argues that institutions are exhibiting ‚Äúanticipatory compliance‚Äù by preemptively adhering to Trump's agenda, which enables the regime's power. The author urges a counter-strategy of ‚Äúanticipatory noncompliance‚Äù to halt autocracy. Examples of anticipatory compliance include universities censoring course content, media outlets settling lawsuits, and corporations reducing DEI programs. The author highlights examples of anticipatory noncompliance, including universities pushing back against Trump's demands, states challenging the administration's reading of civil rights law, and law firms refusing to cave to blackmail tactics, demonstrating a growing opposition to Trump's policies, and the author concludes that restoring democracy will require a years-long fight that deploys an arsenal of tactics.</p>

          <p>A network of women in Latin America transformed safe, self-managed abortions by sharing information about misoprostol, a drug used for at-home abortions. Activists connected the dots: If women could get their hands on misoprostol, they could end their pregnancies despite the severe legal restrictions on abortion most Latin American countries had. It began with whispers at a feminist gathering in Argentina in 1990, eventually leading to the establishment of hotlines and accompaniment networks. The activists created a step-by-step manual on how to have an abortion with pills and used a model of care called acompa√±amiento (accompaniment), helping women use misoprostol to have safe abortions despite the legal restrictions.</p>

          <p>Bill Plaschke, a sports columnist for the LA Times, reveals his four-year battle with Parkinson‚Äôs disease, finding strength and community in a boxing program. The Kaizen Kinetics program in Monrovia provides a space for people with Parkinson's to fight the disease through boxing and movement. Plaschke, along with other individuals ranging in age from 50 to 90, punches and kicks at punching bags, pushing back against the limitations of their condition. He shares the physical and emotional challenges of living with Parkinson's, including weakness, tightness, and a masked face, but he also emphasizes the inspiration he draws from his classmates' courage and determination.</p>
