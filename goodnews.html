        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A primary school teacher, Alice Cole, returned to her job part-time after having a baby and believes that flexible working options are key to addressing recruitment and retention issues in the profession. The Education Secretary, Bridget Phillipson, also suggested more schools should offer flexible hours. Sam Alner, a computer science teacher and vice principal, notes the relentless nature of teaching and the challenges of maintaining a work-life balance, leading some experienced staff to leave for better opportunities. Data suggests that teacher recruitment targets are being missed, particularly in specialist subjects, exacerbating inequalities in disadvantaged communities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have developed an artificial retina using the rare mineral tellurium, restoring sight in blind animals and granting them the ability to see infrared light. The study, published in Science, details how tellurium nanowire implants were used in a biocompatible device to restore vision in mice and a monkey. Tellurium, a byproduct of copper refining, converts visible light and infrared radiation into electrical energy, serving as a replacement for photoreceptor cells in the retina. This advancement holds promise for treating human blindness and expanding visual capabilities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates, particularly in countries like China facing a demographic crisis. Researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong found that subsidies for fathers produce higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. China's fertility rate has declined to an estimated 1.1 children per woman, well below the replacement level, and traditional expectations place the burden of childcare on women.</p>

They emphasize the importance of sustainable innovation cultures, access to funding, and work-life balance. Europe's most successful companies have achieved dominance through innovation rather than overwork, and younger generations are less tolerant of hustle culture.</p>

Since AI learns by absorbing online content, it is crucial to be mindful of the information and values it is exposed to.
