          <p>The England women's football team, the Lionesses, were greeted by hundreds of jubilant fans upon their return home after securing the Euro 2025 title. The team defeated Spain in a dramatic 3-1 penalty shootout, with goalkeeper Hannah Hampton making two crucial saves. Following their arrival, the squad attended a reception at Downing Street hosted by Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner.

          <p>University of Colorado football coach Deion Sanders announced he was diagnosed with bladder cancer and is now considered cancer-free following successful treatment. At a press conference with his medical team, doctors confirmed they removed a high-grade tumor and his bladder, subsequently creating a new one using his intestines. Sanders, who became emotional while discussing his journey, stated he never questioned "God, why me?" and hopes his experience encourages others, particularly African-American men, to get regular health checkups. He confirmed he will continue in his role as head coach for the team.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Iona rapidly intensified into a Category 1 hurricane, marking the first hurricane of the season in the central Pacific Ocean.

          <p>China's aviation authority is assessing the country's airlines for their interest in purchasing new commercial jets from Boeing, signaling a potential warming of trade relations with the United States. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) has asked carriers to update their fleet plans for 2025 and beyond, specifically inquiring about overdue Boeing orders. This development follows a meeting between the CAAC director and a Boeing senior vice-president to discuss expanding cooperation. Industry insiders believe Boeing could be a primary beneficiary if a broader trade deal between Washington and Beijing is reached.</p>

          <p>Lakers superstar Luka Doncic has revealed a transformed physique, which he attributes to significant lifestyle changes during the offseason in his home country of Croatia. The five-time All-Star has been engaging in twice-daily, 90-minute workouts and has adopted a gluten-free, low-sugar, high-protein diet combined with intermittent fasting. This renewed focus on conditioning comes after reports of frustration within his former team, the Mavericks, over his diet and discipline. Doncic stated he is motivated by that narrative and considers his new regimen to be "just the start" of a long-term commitment.</p>

          <p>A Palestinian family seeking to flee the conflict in Gaza has achieved a significant legal victory in the United Kingdom. The High Court has ruled that the foreign secretary must reconsider the government's refusal to help the family of six, who are living in a tent and are at "constant risk of injury or death." The family, who has a British relative, was granted permission to come to the UK but has been unable to leave Gaza to complete the required biometric checks. The ruling stated that while the government is not legally required to assist, it must re-evaluate the case given its exceptional circumstances.</p>

          <p>A new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union is being analyzed as disproportionately beneficial to American interests. The deal imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, a significant increase, while American goods exported to the EU will face no tariffs. In exchange, the EU has also committed to large purchases of American energy and increased investment. While the deal averts a threatened 30% tariff, economists suggest it will negatively impact the EU's GDP, though it reduces trade uncertainty for businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Canadian vape company CEA Industries surged nearly 550% after it announced plans to emulate MicroStrategy's corporate strategy by purchasing cryptocurrency for its treasury. The company, along with investment partners, plans to raise $500 million through a private placement to buy Binance Coin (BNB), the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. This move is part of a growing trend where public companies use debt or equity to acquire digital assets, hoping to boost shareholder returns. The dramatic stock reaction suggests a high level of speculative interest in the crypto market amid a more favorable regulatory environment.</p>

The data shows UC offered admission to over 100,000 first-year California students, addressing public demand to prioritize residents. The rise in international offers is a strategy to offset an expected decline in enrollment from that group due to increased tuition and U.S. visa hurdles. Racial diversity among admitted students remains strong, with Latinos being the largest group for the sixth consecutive year, reflecting the state's demographics.</p>

          <p>This article explains the "4% rule," a long-standing guideline for retirement planning, and its application to annuities. The rule suggests that retirees can safely withdraw 4% of their portfolio annually, adjusted for inflation, for at least 30 years. When considering annuities, this rule serves as a benchmark to compare the guaranteed income from an annuity against potential portfolio withdrawals. While an annuity may offer a higher payout and longevity protection, it often lacks inflation adjustments and liquidity, making a hybrid strategy of both potentially effective for balancing security and flexibility.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has presented a new, European-led peace plan for Gaza to U.S. President Donald Trump during a meeting in Scotland. The proposal, developed with France and Germany, aims to provide immediate humanitarian relief and create a sustainable path toward a two-state solution. This initiative follows the breakdown of U.S.-led peace talks and comes amid growing international pressure to address the starvation crisis in the territory. An emergency UK cabinet meeting is scheduled to discuss the plan, as a growing number of MPs call for the immediate recognition of a Palestinian state.</p>
