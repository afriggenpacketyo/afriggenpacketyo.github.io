          <p>This article reviews three new film releases: 'Ballerina,' a John Wick spin-off starring Ana de Armas; 'Dangerous Animals,' a thriller about a psychopathic tour guide; and 'The Ritual,' a horror film featuring Al Pacino as a priest involved in a publicized exorcism. 'Ballerina' is praised for its action sequences and Ana de Armas' performance, despite a weak script. 'Dangerous Animals' is noted for its suspense and the performances of its actors, while 'The Ritual' is criticized for its uninspired direction and overuse of jump scares, though Al Pacino's presence is highlighted as a potential draw for cinephiles. Overall, the reviews offer a mixed bag of entertainment options for moviegoers.</p>

The Home Builders Federation supports the move but cautions against burdensome paperwork that could hinder the construction of new homes. The new rules will be part of the Future Homes Standard, with developers required to add panels unless buildings have exemptions such as being covered by shade.</p>
