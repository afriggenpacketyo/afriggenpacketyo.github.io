          <p>The 2025 Met Gala, themed "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style," saw celebrities showcasing diverse interpretations of Black dandyism. Co-chairs Colman Domingo, Lewis Hamilton, and Anna Wintour led the red carpet arrivals in dandy-inspired looks. The dress code, "Tailored for You," nodded to the exhibition's focus on menswear, with attendees like Lizzo, Keke Palmer, and Dapper Dan making notable fashion statements. The event celebrated the importance of clothing and style in the formation of Black identities within the Atlantic diaspora, offering a vibrant display of sartorial creativity. The gala and its corresponding exhibition are considered a celebration of Black culture and creativity, so the optimism score is relatively high.</p>

          <p>OpenAI announced it is restructuring as a public benefit corporation, allowing the nonprofit that controls it to maintain its grip on the company. This decision is a victory for critics like Elon Musk, who argued OpenAI was too focused on profits. The restructuring comes after corporate drama and concerns from regulators and experts about OpenAI's direction. Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, stated the change provides a more understandable structure, while law professor Jill R. Horwitz noted that the meaning of 'control' remains to be seen. The new structure allows the nonprofit to be OpenAI‚Äôs largest shareholder.</p>

          <p>A skull discovered in the ossuary of the Basilica of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Hungary may belong to Matthias Corvinus, a legendary European king. Facial reconstruction specialist Emese G√°bor found morphological similarities between the skull and that of Corvinus' son. The skull's physical features align with what is known about Corvinus, including his age and height, and greenish discoloration suggests a metal crown. Researchers plan further studies, including DNA and isotope analyses, to shed light on Corvinus and historical treasures at Hungarian heritage sites.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mr. Deepfakes, a large website dedicated to deepfake pornography, has shut down after a critical service provider withdrew its support. The site allowed users to upload and view deepfake porn videos, as well as buy and sell custom nonconsensual content. The shutdown follows the passage of the "Take It Down Act," which makes posting nonconsensual sexual imagery a federal crime. Experts see the closure as a positive step in combating deepfake abuse, though they acknowledge the issue will persist on less mainstream platforms. The issue of nonconsensual sexual deepfake imagery is taken more seriously and societal infrastructure is needed to react better than before.</p>

Cardinals surrender electronic devices, and those working behind the scenes are vetted and barred from communicating with electors.

          <p>A study published in the European Heart Journal suggests that getting a shingles vaccine may lower the risk of heart disease. Researchers found people given the shot had a 23% lower risk of cardiovascular events, including stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease, for up to 8 years. The protective effect was more prominent in men, people under 60, and those who smoke, drink, or aren't active. While the study doesn't establish a direct causal relationship, the findings suggest potential additional benefits of the shingles vaccine.</p>
