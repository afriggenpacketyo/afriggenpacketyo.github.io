          <p>Kroger's stock experienced a significant rise after the supermarket chain announced an increase in its full-year sales outlook, driven by consumers seeking more affordable options and dining at home more frequently. The company's identical sales, excluding fuel, are projected to increase between 2.25% and 3.25% year over year, surpassing previous expectations. Kroger is focusing on simplifying promotions, reducing prices on over 2,000 products, and highlighting its private brands to cater to value-conscious shoppers. Despite facing competition from Walmart and Costco, Kroger remains optimistic about its growth, particularly in e-commerce and its Simple Truth organic line.

The Terminally Ill Adults Bill, supported by a majority of MPs, will now proceed to the House of Lords for further review, with potential implementation by 2029. While Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer supported the measure, concerns remain among critics about potential coercion, although proponents insist on sufficient safeguards. Supporters emphasize the bill's potential to protect terminally ill patients from undignified deaths, while opponents fear the impact on vulnerable individuals, highlighting the need for high-quality end-of-life care.</p>

          <p>An Offer in Compromise (OIC) is an agreement between a taxpayer and the IRS allowing the taxpayer to resolve their tax debt for a lower amount than what is owed. The IRS considers factors like the taxpayer's ability to pay, income, expenses, and asset equity to determine eligibility. Applying for an OIC involves submitting detailed financial information and meeting specific criteria, such as filing all required tax returns and not being in bankruptcy. While an OIC can provide substantial relief for those facing financial hardship due to tax debt, the IRS has strict standards and thorough evaluation processes for approval.

The FDA plans to prioritize companies addressing health crises, delivering innovative cures, meeting public health needs, and increasing domestic drug manufacturing.

Silver has risen from $28.92 per ounce to $37.12 per ounce this week, according to American Hartford Gold. Investors may find that silver is worth a second look now. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla is set to launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, with a limited number of vehicles debuting on June 22. The initial rides, in Model Y vehicles, will be invitation-only and occur within a geofenced area, with remote drivers monitoring as a backup. This debut comes after years of promises from Elon Musk, and analysts believe successful robotaxis could significantly boost Tesla's market capitalization. The service is expected to expand to Los Angeles and San Francisco later on.</p>
