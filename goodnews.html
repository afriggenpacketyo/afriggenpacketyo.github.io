          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings that exceeded analyst expectations, driven by robust performance in its trading and investment banking divisions. The bank's revenue from fixed income trading saw a significant 14% jump, benefiting from market volatility, while investment banking fees rose by 7%. Despite an overall 17% decline in net income compared to the previous year, which was skewed by a large gain on Visa shares, the underlying results were strong. CEO Jamie Dimon noted the U.S. economy's resilience but also reiterated warnings about geopolitical and trade-related risks. (not investment advice)</p>

The event will also include several of Trump's cabinet members, Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro, and CEOs from companies like Alphabet and Amazon Web Services.

          <p>Citigroup announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street's forecasts, with net income climbing 25% year-over-year to $4.02 billion. The bank's success was largely attributed to a 16% increase in total markets revenue and an 18% rise in banking revenue, capitalizing on market volatility. CEO Jane Fraser highlighted the strong performance as evidence of the bank's ongoing turnaround plan, which includes strategic international pullbacks. However, the bank also reported a 16% growth in its cost of credit, citing a deteriorating economic outlook as a key factor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese technology firm Baidu has formed a multi-year partnership with Uber to integrate its Apollo Go autonomous vehicles into Uber's ride-hailing network outside of the U.S. and mainland China. The initial rollout, expected later this year in Asia and the Middle East, will eventually involve thousands of Baidu's driverless cars, allowing Uber users to hail them through the app. This collaboration allows Baidu to expand its autonomous driving business internationally while providing Uber with a proven partner in the driverless technology space. The news prompted a rise in both companies' premarket stock values.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 11,700 people from Afghanistan. The administration had planned to end the protections, arguing the security situation in Afghanistan has improved, but advocacy groups sued, citing the ongoing humanitarian crisis. The ruling provides a one-week pause to allow for legal briefs to be filed, offering a brief reprieve for Afghan nationals who faced deportation. The decision highlights the ongoing legal and political battles over U.S. immigration policy and the fate of those who fled Afghanistan after the Taliban's return to power.</p>

          <p>The UK Treasury, under Chancellor Rachel Reeves, has unveiled plans to encourage people with money in low-interest savings accounts to invest in stocks and shares. The proposal involves banks actively sending investment offers to savers, supported by a government advertising campaign, as part of a broader strategy to boost the UK's financial services sector. Additionally, the government will make its mortgage guarantee scheme for first-time buyers permanent. Critics raise concerns that these initiatives might be exploited by fraudsters and that the government should instead focus on fixing existing programs like the Lifetime ISA to better support home buyers.

          <p>The BBC's annual salary report, while listing high earners like Gary Lineker and Zoe Ball, omits many of the corporation's most famous personalities. This is because the disclosure requirement only applies to talent paid directly from the license fee, not those employed by the BBC's commercial arm, BBC Studios, or independent production companies. Consequently, stars of major shows like "Strictly Come Dancing," "The Traitors," and "The Apprentice," including Claudia Winkleman and Lord Sugar, do not appear on the list. This system, designed to allow BBC Studios to compete commercially, means the public report provides an incomplete picture of talent earnings at the corporation.</p>

          <p>At a rare high-level conference attended by President Xi Jinping, China's leadership has declared a fundamental shift in its urban development model. The nation will move away from large-scale expansion and instead focus on optimizing existing urban resources, improving human well-being, and enhancing governance. This new approach comes as 67% of China's population now lives in urban areas and the property sector faces significant challenges. The government has vowed to create a "new model" for property development, with an emphasis on renovating urban villages and repairing dilapidated housing, signaling a transition to a more sustainable phase of city growth.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have successfully used publicly available data from NASA's GRACE satellites to identify promising locations for deep-sea mining in the Indian Ocean. The NASA satellites detected gravitational anomalies along the Ninety East Ridge, which indicated areas where the Earth's crust is unusually thick. A subsequent expedition by Chinese researchers confirmed these findings, revealing dense rock formations rich in valuable minerals like copper, nickel, and cobalt. This use of open-source American scientific data has potentially saved the Chinese research team years of effort and significant financial resources in their search for undersea mineral deposits.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing a new grant scheme to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), offering discounts of up to £3,750 on eligible new cars. The discounts, funded by a £650 million program, will apply to vehicles priced up to £37,000 and are part of the government's strategy to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. While the auto industry has welcomed the move, critics and some consumers argue that the primary barrier to EV adoption is not just cost but the insufficient number of public charging points. The government has also pledged £63 million to expand the charging infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Linn Ullmann's latest book, "Girl, 1983," is examined in this review as a profound exploration of autobiographical writing, memory, and the nature of forgetting. The novel centers on a writer trying to reconstruct a painful memory from her adolescence involving a relationship with an older photographer, an experience she cannot fully recall. The review notes how Ullmann, daughter of Ingmar Bergman and Liv Ullmann, blurs the lines between fiction and memoir, using the novel form to embrace the gaps and absences in personal history. The book challenges the idea that memory is a perfect archive, suggesting that what is forgotten is as significant as what is remembered.</p>

This move is seen as a major win for Nvidia, allowing it to compete more effectively with rivals like Huawei in the vast Chinese market, which is home to half of the world's AI researchers.

The project is seen as crucial for Shetland's key industries, such as salmon farming and fishing, which are constrained by current infrastructure. While funding remains a challenge, a feasibility study is underway, with a toll-based financing model similar to the Faroes' being considered.</p>
