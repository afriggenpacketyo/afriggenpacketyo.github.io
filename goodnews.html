          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a critical 3-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 3 of the NLCS, placing them one win away from the World Series. The team initiated scoring early with Shohei Ohtani's triple and Mookie Betts' double, later breaking a 1-1 tie in the sixth inning thanks to Tommy Edman's crucial single, who was also named NLCS MVP. This triumph positions the Dodgers to become the first defending champions in 16 years to reach the World Series, a milestone not seen since the 2009 Philadelphia Phillies. Despite the Brewers' strong regular season record against them, the Dodgers are now intensely focused on maintaining pressure and aiming to conclude the series in Game 4 on Friday.</p>

          <p>Ford is recalling nearly 750,000 vehicles in the U.S. due to three separate safety concerns identified by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Approximately 290,000 F-Series trucks from 2020-2022 are affected by a rearview camera display issue, which may fail to show images correctly in certain lighting conditions, increasing accident risk. Another 115,539 Super Duty trucks from 2020-2021 are being recalled for a steering column defect that could result in a sudden loss of steering control. Furthermore, 332,778 2015-2017 Mustang models are under recall because corroded seatbelt cables could compromise occupant restraint. Ford dealers will address these issues with free software updates, inspections, or part replacements.</p>

          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed plans for a call with Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng on Friday, signaling a potential easing of tensions between the two global powers. This high-level communication is a crucial step ahead of a possible meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Bessent also announced that he and a delegation would meet with He in Malaysia the following week to further prepare for the leaders' summit. These diplomatic efforts highlight a concerted push to manage and potentially improve the complex and often strained economic relationship between the United States and China, fostering dialogue and aiming for greater global economic stability.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 16:51:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump stated he would consider an "interesting" Russian proposal for Elon Musk's Boring Company to construct an undersea rail tunnel through the Bering Strait, linking Russia and Alaska. Kirill Dmitriev, a Russian investment envoy, suggested the 70-mile "unity" link could cost $8 billion using Boring Company technology, significantly less than traditional estimates. This unusual infrastructure idea emerged after a call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the Ukraine War, a proposal that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has already expressed unhappiness with. The concept raises questions about feasibility given the region's harsh conditions and the Boring Company's limited experience in such environments.</p>

          <p>A collection of David Hockney's iPad drawings, titled "The Arrival of Spring in Woldgate," achieved a remarkable £6.2 million at Sotheby's in London, significantly surpassing its initial estimate. The 17 prints, which depict the Yorkshire Wolds landscape, were created by Hockney starting in 2011, several years after he moved from Beverly Hills to Bridlington. The renowned artist, now 88, opted for his iPad to execute this series, finding it more practical than traditional plein air painting during winter. This sale, described as an "exceptionally rare opportunity" for collectors and coinciding with the Frieze art fair, highlights the enduring appeal and market value of Hockney's innovative artistic endeavors.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan coalition of U.S. lawmakers is strongly urging President Donald Trump to personally attend three pivotal Indo-Pacific summits scheduled for this fall. The congressional members warn that presidential absence from these key gatherings could inadvertently grant China a strategic advantage, especially as Beijing aggressively expands its influence throughout the region. Their letter underscored the Indo-Pacific's critical importance to America's security and prosperity, identifying it as the central arena for strategic competition with China. This appeal for Trump's direct engagement highlights the perceived urgency for the United States to project robust leadership and send an unequivocal message to Beijing regarding its geopolitical ambitions and regional stability.</p>

          <p>Seven exceptionally well-preserved skeletons, unearthed from an ancient water well in the Roman city of Mursa, modern-day Croatia, have been identified as Roman soldiers dating back 1,700 years. The remains, belonging to taller-than-average adult men, exhibited indicators of early-life stress and injuries consistent with combat, including blunt-force trauma and puncture wounds likely from weapons. Researchers suggest these individuals were soldiers who perished during a 260 C.E. battle or subsequent skirmish for control of the city. DNA analysis further revealed that none were indigenous to the region, with origins traced to northern/Eastern Europe and the Byzantine Empire, providing valuable insights into the diverse recruitment of Roman legions.</p>
