          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren S√°nchez are celebrating their marriage in Venice, Italy, drawing a high-profile crowd of celebrities for events leading up to their Saturday ceremony. Guests including Oprah Winfrey, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kim Kardashian were seen arriving at the Madonna dell'Orto church for a reception. The influx of nearly 200 prominent guests has prompted protests from some Venice locals, who launched a "No Space for Bezos" campaign amid broader European frustrations over tourism driving up living costs. This marks the second marriage for both Bezos and S√°nchez.</p>

          <p>Chinese electronics company Xiaomi saw its shares surge after launching its new electric SUV, the YU7, which is priced to directly compete with and undercut Tesla's Model Y in China. The company reported receiving over 200,000 orders within the first three minutes of the launch, a testament to the strong consumer response. While CEO Lei Jun admitted the YU7's driver-assist software is not yet on par with Tesla's, he highlighted its competitive driving range of at least 760 kilometers. The launch occurs amid an intense price war in the electric vehicle market.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has announced it is retiring its infamous "Blue Screen of Death," a notorious error message that has appeared on Windows systems for over four decades. The company is revamping the error screen as part of a broader effort to improve the operating system's resilience, particularly after the major 2024 Crowdstrike IT outage. The new error screen will feature a black background and a simplified message stating, "Your device ran into a problem and needs to restart." This updated, streamlined interface will be rolled out on all Windows 11 devices starting later this summer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nike has announced that new U.S. tariffs will cost the company an estimated $1 billion in its current fiscal year, presenting a significant new challenge to its ongoing turnaround plan. The sportswear giant intends to mitigate these costs over time by shifting its supply chain, increasing prices, and working with partners, aiming to reduce its manufacturing reliance on China. Despite this headwind and a reported 86% drop in quarterly profits due to inventory clearance, the company's earnings beat Wall Street expectations, causing its stock to rise after the announcement.

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers made a series of trades to move up in the second round of the NBA draft, ultimately acquiring 6-foot-8 forward Adou Thiero from Arkansas with the 36th pick. To secure the pick, the Lakers first traded their 55th pick and cash to the Chicago Bulls for the 45th pick, then sent that pick and more cash to Minnesota. Thiero, an athletic wing player, averaged 15.1 points and 5.8 rebounds last season and is seen by the team as a valuable addition to play alongside Luka Doncic. The move addresses the team's need for athleticism on the wing.</p>

          <p>In Chelsea, Massachusetts, a neighborhood plagued by the urban heat island effect, a local environmental group is testing solutions on a single "cool block." The project, led by GreenRoots, involves planting over 100 trees, resurfacing streets with lighter, heat-reflecting colors, and painting rooftops white. Research shows that such interventions can reduce peak urban temperatures significantly as climate change intensifies heat waves. This urban laboratory, which partners with the city and Boston University researchers, could provide a valuable template for other densely populated cities looking to mitigate extreme heat and improve livability.</p>
