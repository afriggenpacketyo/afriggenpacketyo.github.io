          <p>Jon Jones, a prominent figure in mixed martial arts, has announced his retirement from the UFC, leading to Tom Aspinall being promoted to undisputed heavyweight champion. UFC president Dana White confirmed Jones' retirement, which Jones later acknowledged on social media after much speculation. Jones, who has a 28-1 record, was expected to have a unification bout with Aspinall, but an injury prevented Jones from fighting in November 2023. Aspinall expressed excitement about the heavyweight division's future after the announcement, while Jones previously hinted at a potential return to fighting in the future.</p>

          <p>Germany has witnessed a significant increase in Turkish citizens obtaining German passports, doubling in 2024, driven by political repression and economic instability in Turkey. Germany's June 2024 citizenship reforms, which allow dual citizenship, have incentivized migrants to seek a second passport. While many Turks have integrated into German society, they often maintain strong ties to their culture and homeland. Despite holding German citizenship, some Turks report experiencing discrimination and feeling like they are not fully accepted as Germans.</p>

          <p>A urine-based cancer risk screening kit developed by Japanese startup Craif Inc. is showing promise in detecting cancer at its earliest stages using non-invasive methods. The test kit can simultaneously assess a person's risk for up to seven types of cancer by detecting microRNA in urine samples. A trial in Hokkaido detected tumors and precancerous cells in several participants, leading to early treatment. The company aims to expand the use of the kit to improve cancer detection rates, especially in areas with limited medical resources.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have used mathematical analysis to decode the metabolic cycle of yeast, revealing parallels with the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. The study, led by Professor Li Lei, reorganized yeast metabolism into four distinct yet interconnected phases, mirroring the concept of mutual promotion and restraint in traditional Chinese medicine. The team's work highlights how the four phases reflect unique metabolic states, akin to the "four symbols" theory in traditional Chinese medicine, which emphasizes balance between passive and active forces.</p>
