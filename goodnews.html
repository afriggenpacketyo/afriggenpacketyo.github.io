          <p>Frustrated by the negative experiences and "dating burnout" associated with apps, 30-year-old Lucy Rout founded Haystack Dating to foster meaningful connections through in-person events. The company uses an algorithm to match attendees into small groups based on interests and personality for activities like cricket before a larger social gathering. This move taps into a growing trend of people seeking real-life interactions, as data shows a decline in users for major dating apps like Tinder and Hinge. Even established apps are now investing in IRL events to adapt to changing consumer preferences.</p>

          <p>Actor Chris Hemsworth has revealed that learning he possesses two copies of the APOE4 gene, which increases his likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease by eight to ten times, prompted a significant "gear shift" in his life. The discovery was made during the filming of his National Geographic series, "Limitless." Hemsworth explained that this genetic insight has deepened his focus on living a healthier lifestyle and prioritizing time with his family. For the show's second season, he took a more active role, exploring personal interests and even learning to play the drums for a performance with Ed Sheeran.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is on the rise, where people spend on small, affordable luxuries and significant experiences to boost morale during uncertain economic times. This behavior, an evolution of the "lipstick effect," involves consumers cutting back on daily essentials but splurging on items like makeup or major events like concerts. Analysts suggest this trend is driven by a re-evaluation of personal well-being and the unattainability of traditional life milestones for younger generations. Experts predict this focus on "guilt-free joy" will persist as long as economic uncertainty continues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the renowned astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97. Lovell is celebrated for his calm leadership that guided his crew safely back to Earth after an oxygen tank explosion, turning a potential disaster into a "successful failure." He was also part of the historic Apollo 8 mission, the first to orbit the Moon, from which he famously described Earth as a "grand oasis." Lovell's legacy, immortalized in the film "Apollo 13," is remembered for his courage, ingenuity, and profound impact on space exploration.</p>

The mayor of Cordoba praised the "rapid and magnificent intervention" of the emergency services, stating that their quick action averted a potential catastrophe. The blaze reportedly started in one of the chapels, possibly due to a short circuit in an electric sweeper. The incident at the architectural jewel, which was originally a mosque in the 8th century before being converted to a cathedral, drew comparisons to the 2019 Notre Dame fire in Paris.</p>

          <p>Walmart has agreed to a $5.6 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit filed by several California district attorneys' offices. The lawsuit alleged that the retail giant overcharged customers by selling products, particularly weighted items like produce and baked goods, for higher prices than advertised or for more than their actual weight. This practice was claimed to be in violation of the state's false advertising and unfair competition laws. As part of the settlement, Walmart will pay $5.5 million in civil penalties and implement measures to ensure accurate pricing in its California stores.</p>

          <p>A Bay Area man has been arrested and charged with stealing rare Chinese manuscripts, some dating to the 13th century and valued at over $216,000, from the UCLA library. The suspect, Jeffrey Ying, allegedly used multiple fake aliases and a recently implemented library system that did not require official ID to check out the valuable items. He is accused of replacing the authentic manuscripts with "dummy books" before taking the originals. An FBI investigation uncovered the scheme after library staff noticed books were missing, leading to Ying's arrest as he allegedly prepared to flee to China.</p>

          <p>Actress Gina Carano and Disney have settled a lawsuit she filed after being fired from "The Mandalorian" in 2021 over her controversial social media posts. While settlement details are private, a Lucasfilm statement praised Carano's professionalism and expressed hope for future collaboration. The article argues this was not "corporate capitulation" but the right decision, suggesting her firing was an overreaction to posts that were more ignorant than malicious. The case highlights the complex relationship between entertainment companies, their stars, and the pressures of social media outrage.</p>

          <p>The Ford Transit van, a cultural and commercial icon, is celebrating its 60th anniversary since first rolling off the production line on August 9, 1965. Originally a revelation for its space and practicality, it quickly became the vehicle of choice for tradespeople, delivery drivers, and even rock bands like Led Zeppelin. Despite production moving from the UK to Turkey, the Transit remains the world's best-selling van, with over 13 million built. As the brand moves into an electric and software-defined future, it faces a more competitive market where brand loyalty is no longer guaranteed.</p>

This landing marks a change from previous Atlantic splashdowns, a decision made to ensure any debris from the capsule's trunk section falls into a remote ocean area.

          <p>A surprising political friendship has formed between U.S. Vice President JD Vance and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, despite their starkly different political ideologies. Vance is currently vacationing in the UK and staying with Lammy at his official country residence, where they have bonded over family, faith, and fishing. The two men, who both overcame challenging childhoods to attend prestigious universities, have met several times and developed a personal rapport. This relationship is seen as potentially important for UK-US relations, particularly given the personalized nature of diplomacy under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>A viral social media claim, allegedly from a retired pilot, stating that Donald Trump's plane flew to Jeffrey Epstein's island 37 times has been found to be without evidence. The fact-check notes that the island, Little St. James, does not have an airstrip, making landings by a plane like Trump's impossible; visitors arrived by helicopter or boat. Furthermore, the credibility of the source was questioned, as the photo used showed a pilot costume pin available on Amazon. While speculation about Epstein's network continues, this specific, widely circulated claim is unsubstantiated.</p>
