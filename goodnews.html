          <p>Eric Schmidt and Selina Xu argue that China is rapidly catching up to the United States in various technologies, particularly in artificial intelligence, and excelling in the commercialization and manufacturing of tech. They highlight the rise of Chinese AI models like DeepSeek and the global popularity of apps like TikTok and Temu. The authors suggest that the U.S. needs to openly share more of its AI technologies, innovate faster, and focus on diffusing AI throughout its economy to maintain its competitive edge. The optimism score reflects the idea of a globalized market and the stability of competition between the US and China.</p>

          <p>Silent book clubs are gaining popularity, offering a chance to unplug and stop scrolling, with one club saying it's a chance to inhabit the same space, while being simultaneously in Middle Earth, the middle ages or Middle England. Unlike traditional book clubs, readers can bring any book they want. The hour of silent reading is followed by a discussion about the books everyone is reading. One woman studies a science fiction publication from her university course, while a man in headphones flicks through The Silk Roads by Peter Frankopan.

          <p>The Catholic Church prepares to elect a new pope, maintaining the centuries-old tradition of signaling the election's outcome with smoke from the Sistine Chapel chimney. The process involves custom fireworks, a carefully built chimney, and precise chemical recipes to ensure a clear message. Experts say the process requires "two custom fireworks", smoke test rehearsals and Vatican firefighters on standby. The tradition of burning the cardinals' paper ballots dates back to the 15th Century and became part of conclave rituals aimed at ensuring transparency and preventing tampering.
