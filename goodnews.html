          <p>North Carolina has been named America's Top State for Business for 2025, praised for its robust economy, skilled workforce, and business-friendly policies that attract major investments from companies like Amazon and JetZero. The state's success is attributed to bipartisan support for pro-business initiatives, including low corporate taxes and a strong pipeline of educated workers. However, the article also highlights significant challenges, such as a low ranking for quality of life, minimal worker protections, and potential economic headwinds from federal policy changes and hurricane recovery costs.</p>

          <p>Following former President Trump's comments on Liberian President Joseph Boakai's "good English," this article explains the deep historical ties between the United States and Liberia. The West African nation was founded in the 19th century by freed African-American slaves, which is why English is its official language and many cultural aspects, including its flag and capital city's name, reflect a strong American influence. This shared heritage accounts for the American-style accent that Trump likely noticed during their interaction, providing important context to his remarks.</p>

          <p>The Italian food conglomerate Ferrero Group has announced its intention to purchase WK Kellogg Co. for $3.1 billion, a strategic move to expand its global presence. WK Kellogg is known for iconic cereal brands like Corn Flakes and Froot Loops, which will now join Ferrero's portfolio of products like Nutella and Rocher chocolates. This acquisition follows Kellogg's 2023 decision to spin off its snack brands into a separate company, Kellanova, which was subsequently acquired by Mars.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Defense Department is set to become the largest shareholder in MP Materials, the owner of the only operational rare earth mine in the country, through a $400 million investment. This strategic public-private partnership aims to bolster the domestic supply chain for rare earth magnets, which are critical components for advanced military technology like F-35 fighter jets and submarines. The move is a direct effort by the Trump administration to reduce America's heavy reliance on China for these essential minerals, with the investment funding expanded processing and magnet production facilities.</p>

          <p>Vietnam's government has approved a significant tax hike on alcohol, with rates set to increase from 65% to 90% by 2031, as part of a broader effort to curb excessive drinking and improve public health. This policy is driven by rising alcohol consumption rates and the associated health costs, as the nation prepares for demographic shifts that will strain its healthcare system. While the move is supported by health organizations like the WHO, the alcohol industry has raised concerns, citing already declining sales and the risk of pushing consumers toward a dangerous unregulated market.</p>

          <p>In an economy with persistent inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way to earn returns that can outpace the inflation rate. This article provides an overview of current CD rates, noting that online banks typically offer significantly higher annual percentage yields than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions. It also explains the phenomenon of an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs, such as 6-month or 1-year terms, currently provide better interest rates than longer-term options, and suggests strategies like laddering to take advantage of this.
