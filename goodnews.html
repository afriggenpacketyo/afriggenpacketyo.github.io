          <h2>Dodgers to Maintain Trade Deadline Strategy Despite Max Muncy's Knee Injury</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 22:27:47 EDT</div>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are not planning to alter their trade deadline strategy despite an injury to third baseman Max Muncy, who is expected to miss about six weeks with a bone bruise in his knee. Initial fears of a season-ending injury were allayed, giving the team confidence that Muncy will return with ample time before the playoffs. General manager Brandon Gomes stated the team will rely on internal options like Tommy Edman to fill the role in the interim. Muncy was in the midst of a major offensive resurgence, but the team feels it can weather his absence without making a panic trade.</p>

          <p>Several beaches in the Rockaways, Queens, were temporarily closed on the Fourth of July after multiple shark sightings occurred dangerously close to swimmers. City officials used drone technology to monitor the sharks' movements and ensure public safety, reopening the beaches after about an hour. The incidents highlight a recent trend of increased shark activity along New York's coastline. Governor Kathy Hochul had previously reassured the public that authorities were enhancing shark surveillance measures at state park beaches on Long Island to protect beachgoers during the holiday weekend.</p>

          <p>As the United States targets China's dominance in the shipbuilding industry, rivals South Korea and Japan are stepping up efforts to support their own sectors. South Korea's new presidential administration has identified shipbuilding as a core industry in crisis and has outlined policies to promote the development of advanced, eco-friendly, and autonomous vessels. The government's growth guide focuses on improving production through digitalization and automation, as well as enhancing working conditions to attract skilled personnel. These moves signal a strategic push to reclaim market share and lead in the next generation of maritime technology. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that tiny marine creatures called zooplankton are unsung heroes in the fight against climate change, locking away vast amounts of carbon in the deep ocean. These animals undertake an epic annual migration in Antarctica, gorging on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface before sinking hundreds of meters to hibernate, where they burn their fat stores. This process sequesters an amount of carbon equivalent to the annual emissions of 55 million cars, a far greater contribution than previously understood. The findings highlight the critical importance of this overlooked animal in regulating the planet's climate.</p>

          <p>A same-sex pair of male Humboldt penguins, named Scampi and Flounder, are successfully raising a chick at the Chester Zoo in the United Kingdom. Zoo experts entrusted the pair with an egg from another couple to increase the chick's chances of survival during what has been a successful breeding season. This event highlights that same-sex pairings are not uncommon among penguins and showcases their shared parenting instincts. The chick is one of ten born at the zoo this year, a significant development for the Humboldt species, which is listed as vulnerable to extinction.</p>

          <p>Hamas has formally responded to the latest U.S.-backed proposal for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release, with a statement describing its response as "positive." A senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks clarified that while Hamas accepts the general framework, it has requested key amendments. These include a U.S. guarantee that hostilities will not resume if permanent ceasefire talks fail and that all humanitarian aid be distributed exclusively by the UN. The proposal is believed to involve a 60-day truce and a staggered release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, but a final agreement remains contingent on these negotiations.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart disease outlines five "toxic" food categories he avoids feeding his own children to promote lifelong health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like hot dogs and bacon because of sodium and nitrates. He also warns against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health. The doctor advocates for alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, lean proteins, and using an air fryer for a healthy crunch.</p>
