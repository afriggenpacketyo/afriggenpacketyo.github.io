          <p>Three Little Pitties, a dog rescue in Houston, Texas, provides a safe haven for pregnant stray dogs to give birth and find forever homes. The organization, founded by Alayna Matranga Goodson, addresses Houston's severe stray animal problem by offering a secure environment where mother dogs can care for their newborns without the dangers of the streets or overcrowded shelters. After giving birth, the mother dogs are spayed to control the pet population, and once the pups are ready, Three Little Pitties helps them find adoptive families. Since opening six months ago, the rescue has successfully adopted out 150 dogs, offering a new lease on life for both mothers and their puppies.</p>

          <p>The Minnesota Timberwolves have launched an investigation following accusations that fans made "racially charged" comments towards Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green during an NBA playoff game. According to a team statement, one fan was ejected from the Target Center, while another left before security could identify him; the team is working to identify him. Green stated that there is an "agenda" to paint him as an angry Black man, which he disputes. The incident occurred during Game 2 of the Western Conference Semifinals, which the Timberwolves won despite the absence of Steph Curry.</p>

          <p>An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 4.1 struck near Greenback, Tennessee, and was felt as far away as Atlanta, Georgia. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the tremor occurred on Saturday morning within the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone, an area known for minor annual earthquakes but not major tremors. The New York Times article notes that seismologists may revise the reported magnitude as they review the available data. The last time a strong earthquake was felt in the region was 2018, when a 4.4 magnitude tremor rattled houses but caused little damage.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, which failed to launch to Venus in 1972, reentered Earth's atmosphere after 53 years in orbit. The European Union Space Surveillance and Tracking confirmed the uncontrolled reentry, and the European Space Agency's space debris office also indicated its demise. Experts had anticipated that some parts of the half-ton spacecraft, built to withstand Venusian conditions, might survive the fiery descent. Launched as part of the Soviet Union's Venus exploration program, Kosmos 482 became stranded due to a rocket malfunction, with most of its components falling back to Earth within a decade of the failed launch.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order halting the Trump administration's sweeping government overhaul, citing that Congress did not authorize large-scale staffing cuts and agency restructuring. Judge Susan Illston sided with unions, non-profits, and local governments, preventing mass layoffs known as "reductions in force" for 14 days. The ruling challenges the work of the "department of government efficiency" (Doge), which has been tasked with identifying targets for mass layoffs. The plaintiffs argued that the reorganization disrupts critical services, and the judge scheduled a hearing to consider a longer-lasting injunction.</p>

          <p>Elliott Investment Management, holding over 12.5% ownership, has reached a cooperation agreement with Charles River Laboratories, a company involved in early-stage drug research and development. Under the agreement, four new directors will be appointed to the board, and the company will conduct a strategic review. The CNBC article suggests that the market may have overreacted to challenges facing Charles River, including uncertainties around animal testing. Potential value-creation strategies include evaluating the Manufacturing Solutions business, acquiring smaller competitors, or even exploring a sale of the entire company, given its strategic importance in drug development.</p>

          <p>Vox's Future Perfect section highlights the rapidly falling rates of family formation as a critical issue, arguing that it should be a concern for progressives. The article notes that an aging and shrinking population can lead to a massive decrease in the expected quality of life in the future. It suggests that policies supporting family formation, such as affordable housing, universal pre-K, and better healthcare, align with progressive priorities and could help address the looming demographic crisis. It argues that engaging in this conversation is essential, even if some of the current voices on the issue have distasteful politics.</p>

He found the process to be a "rather wonderful experience", noting the calmness and solemnity of the proceedings.

The therapy, led by Dr. Donald Kohn at UCLA Mattel Children's Hospital, allows a patient to be their own stem cell donor.
