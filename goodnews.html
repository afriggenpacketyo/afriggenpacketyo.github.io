          <p>The U.S. has imposed new tariffs on India, but New Delhi is not rushing to secure a trade deal. India is protecting its agricultural sector, a crucial voting bloc, and views its exports to the U.S. as a relatively small part of its economy. Analysts suggest the U.S. has a strategic interest in not alienating India, seeing it as a key partner in the Indo-Pacific and a potential manufacturing alternative to China. India's position within the BRICS bloc also provides it with diplomatic flexibility in negotiations with Washington.</p>

          <p>The United States and South Korea have reached a trade deal, setting a 15% tariff on South Korean exports, including cars, down from a threatened 25%. As part of the agreement, South Korea will facilitate a $350 billion investment into U.S. industries, though interpretations of how this fund will be managed differ between the two nations. The deal also includes a South Korean commitment to purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy products. While Seoul successfully protected its sensitive agricultural markets, the new blanket tariff negates some benefits of the existing U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

In a public statement, Harris explained that after careful reflection, she has decided her public service will not be in elected office for now. This decision ends months of speculation about her next political move following her 2024 presidential campaign. Sources close to Harris suggest that while she seriously considered the role, the choice keeps the door open for a potential presidential run in 2028.</p>

          <p>As the MLB trade deadline approached, several contending teams made significant moves to strengthen their rosters, particularly their relief pitching. The Philadelphia Phillies acquired formidable closer Jhoan Durán from the Minnesota Twins, a major splash in the market. In another key deal, the New York Mets added relievers Tyler Rogers and Ryan Helsley to fortify their bullpen for a tight division race. Other notable trades saw the Cincinnati Reds acquire third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes from the Pirates, signaling a heating market as teams position themselves for the season's final stretch.</p>

          <p>Billionaire hotelier Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan put forth by the airport's owners. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which it claims would avoid the costly and disruptive need to reroute the M25 motorway. The company argues its proposal offers reduced risk and a lower cost, estimated under £25 billion, compared to Heathrow's own spiraling budget. This development introduces a new dynamic to the long-debated expansion project, as the government will now consider two distinct bids.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani created a moment of concern when he left his pitching start against the Cincinnati Reds in the fourth inning accompanied by a trainer. The team later announced the issue was only cramping, a relief for the club and its fans. Ohtani, who was making only his seventh pitching start of the season after recovering from Tommy John surgery, remained in the game as the designated hitter. Despite the scare being minor, the Dodgers ultimately lost the game 5-2, capping a disappointing month for the team.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to hold its key interest rate steady, maintaining the 4.25%-4.5% range despite public pressure from President Donald Trump to implement a cut. The decision was not unanimous, with two board members dissenting in favor of a rate reduction, a sign of broadening support for lower rates. Policymakers are navigating a complex economic environment, weighing concerns about the inflationary impact of new tariffs against data suggesting the economy may be losing momentum.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Triggered by events like the recent 8.8-magnitude earthquake off Russia, tsunamis are powerful series of ocean waves with specific geological origins. They are typically generated by large, shallow underwater earthquakes that cause vertical movement of the seafloor, displacing massive volumes of water. While difficult to precisely forecast, scientists use tide gauges and deep-ocean sensors to track these waves, which can travel at jet-plane speeds in deep water before slowing and growing in height near the coast. Experts advise that upon receiving a warning, people should immediately move to higher ground.</p>

          <p>A research expedition using a human-occupied submersible has discovered and filmed what they describe as "thriving communities" of life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the northwest Pacific Ocean. The team observed vast beds of clams, tube worms, and bacterial mats, challenging previous assumptions about the limits of life in such extreme, high-pressure environments. These ecosystems are not powered by sunlight but by chemicals like hydrogen sulfide and methane seeping from the Earth's crust. The findings suggest such "chemosynthetic" communities may be widespread in the planet's deepest regions.</p>

          <p>A growing number of scientists are challenging the popular narrative that screen time is inherently damaging to children's brains, arguing that the scientific evidence is often flawed or inconclusive. Psychologists point out that much of the research relies on unreliable self-reporting and fails to distinguish between different types of screen use. While some studies link high social media use to depression, others have found little to no connection between screen time and poor mental well-being. This article explores the ongoing scientific debate, highlighting the complexity of the issue and the lack of clear, evidence-based guidance for parents.</p>

          <p>Researchers using high-resolution, near-infrared photography have uncovered stunning new details of tattoos on a 2,500-year-old female "ice mummy" from the Pazyryk culture of Siberia. The images reveal intricate and sophisticated designs of mythical creatures and animals, including leopards and a stag, that were previously not visible to the naked eye. The quality of the work suggests the Pazyryk people were highly skilled artists, likely using stencils and multi-pointed tools. The findings provide a vivid glimpse into the warrior culture and artistic practices of these ancient nomadic people.</p>
