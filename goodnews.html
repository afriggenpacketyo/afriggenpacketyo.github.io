          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a complete ceasefire, set to begin shortly, involving two 12-hour periods, starting with Iran. Israel will follow with a second 12-hour ceasefire, and after 24 hours, the war will be officially declared ended. Trump congratulated both countries on having the stamina, courage, and intelligence to end what he called 'THE 12 DAY WAR.' The announcement came two days after the U.S. launched strikes on Iranian nuclear targets. This agreement signals a potential de-escalation of tensions in the region.</p>

He believes he was targeted for representing a movement that opposes the administration's policies. Despite facing a potential appeal from the government, Khalil remains committed to advocating for Palestinian human rights and denounces antisemitism within the Palestinian movement.</p>

          <p>Pixar's latest film, 'Elio,' experienced the lowest opening weekend in the studio's history, earning only $21 million domestically. Despite positive reviews, the film struggled to attract audiences, highlighting the challenges that original animated movies face in the post-pandemic landscape. Analysts suggest that the film's performance may have been affected by competition from other family-friendly movies and unfamiliarity with the title. Disney remains hopeful that 'Elio' will find its audience over time, similar to the success of 'Elemental,' and reaffirmed its commitment to creating original animated intellectual property.</p>

          <p>China is unlikely to deploy its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz if Iran threatens to close it, according to a top U.S. analyst. Despite China's reliance on Middle Eastern oil, its approach would likely involve quiet negotiations and prioritizing its own interests over direct military intervention. The analyst pointed to China's agreement with Houthi rebels in the Red Sea to spare Chinese-flagged vessels as an example of this strategy. China's focus remains on protecting its economic interests rather than policing global waterways.</p>

Of this, 3.5% will be dedicated to core defense, while the remaining 1.5% will focus on defense-related areas such as resilience and security. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasized the need for agility and a clear sense of national interest in navigating an era of radical uncertainty.
