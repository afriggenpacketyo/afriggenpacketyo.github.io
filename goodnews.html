          <p>Millions of Filipinos are voting in midterm elections seen as a proxy battle between President Ferdinand Marcos and Vice President Sara Duterte, whose political feud has escalated. The elections will decide over 18,000 positions, including key Senate seats crucial for a potential impeachment trial against Duterte. Marcos is vying to advance his political and economic agenda, while Duterte faces charges of corruption and an assassination plot, further straining their once-allied relationship. Security has been tightened across the Philippines due to the history of violence during elections, with police and military personnel deployed to protect polling stations and ensure a peaceful process.</p>

          <p>For the last 30 years, the UK has consistently experienced higher immigration than emigration, marking a significant demographic shift. Despite various government efforts to curb net migration, numbers have remained historically high, becoming a key issue in the 2016 EU referendum. Brexit ended freedom of movement with EU member states, giving the UK full control over immigration policies. Recent data indicates a potential fall in migration for 2024, however, the article highlights the challenge of translating rhetoric into tangible policy changes amid fluctuating immigration figures.</p>

          <p>Former Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen will visit Britain this week at the invitation of British lawmakers, a trip that comes as London is trying to improve ties with Beijing. Tsai, who stepped down last year, has become a symbol of Taiwan's defiance against China's military threats. The visit aims to deepen friendship between Taiwan and Britain, and Tsai will meet with British politicians. Despite lacking official diplomatic ties, Taiwan views Britain as a vital democratic partner, with increasing economic and political exchanges between the two sides.</p>

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the discussions as "productive and constructive," while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng noted they were "in-depth" and "candid." The talks, the first since President Trump imposed steep tariffs, have raised hopes for tariff reductions and a more stable global economy.

          <p>Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad contends that President Trump's tariffs will hurt Americans more than targeted countries by increasing the U.S. cost of living. Mahathir argues that American products cannot compete with cheaper goods from other countries, leading to economic suffering for the U.S. He believes ASEAN can withstand the impact of tariff hikes through intergroup trade and business with other nations. Mahathir, advocating for peace, suggests retaliation is not the answer to the U.S. tariffs and that ASEAN should address concerns through dialogue.</p>

The recall was initiated after investigators found listeria monocytogenes on a piece of equipment during a routine inspection, prompting the company to take remedial actions.

Medicare provides health insurance for roughly 70 million older Americans, and complaints about high U.S. drug prices have long drawn bipartisan criticism.</p>

The New World screwworms are fly larvae that burrow into wounds and mucous membranes of animals, potentially causing death if untreated. The U.S. and Mexico had previously eradicated the screwworm in the 1960s and '70s, but recent cases in Mexico have prompted renewed concerns.</p>

          <h2>Trump Announces Executive Order to Lower U.S. Drug Costs by Aligning with International Prices</h2>

          <p>President Trump has announced an executive order aimed at lowering U.S. drug costs by aligning them with what other wealthy countries pay. The proposal, a "most favored nation" pricing model, is likely to face legal challenges and opposition from the pharmaceutical industry. In his first term, Mr. Trump tried unsuccessfully to enact a version of this idea for Medicare, but it was blocked by a federal court. The pharmaceutical industry bitterly opposes the idea, which would almost certainly cut into its profits, and has been lobbying against it as discussions of the policy have regained steam in Washington in recent weeks.</p>
