          <p>Alphabet's autonomous driving unit, Waymo, is expanding its robotaxi testing to Denver and Seattle, initially with human safety drivers behind the wheel. This move is part of the company's broader strategy to scale its driverless ride-hailing service across the United States, which is already commercially available in several major cities including Austin and San Francisco. The test fleets in the new cities will consist of electric Jaguar iPace and Geely Zeekr vehicles. Waymo's expansion signifies a continued push towards validating its technology for future fully autonomous operations in more diverse urban environments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alphabet's stock price increased by 8% following a federal judge's ruling in a major antitrust case that spared Google from the most severe potential penalties. The court decided against forcing the company to sell its Chrome browser, a key asset for its advertising business. However, the ruling does prohibit Google from engaging in exclusive contracts that make its search engine the default on devices and mandates the sharing of some search data with rivals. The decision provided relief to investors who had feared a more disruptive outcome for the tech giant's core operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Defending champion Aryna Sabalenka has advanced to the US Open semifinals after her opponent, Marketa Vondrousova, withdrew from their quarter-final match due to an injury. Sabalenka will now face American fourth seed Jessica Pegula in a rematch of last year's final. Pegula secured her spot by defeating Barbora Krejcikova in straight sets, continuing her impressive run in the tournament without dropping a single set. Vondrousova's withdrawal is a disappointing end for the 2023 Wimbledon champion, whose career has been frequently hampered by injuries.</p>

          <p>The government in England is planning to introduce a new law that would prohibit the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to anyone under the age of 16. The proposed ban aims to address health concerns linked to excessive caffeine consumption in children, such as headaches, sleep problems, and heart issues. This legislative action follows voluntary bans already implemented by most supermarkets and comes in response to calls from health experts and public figures like chef Jamie Oliver. A 12-week consultation will be held to gather evidence before the law is finalized.</p>

E. coli bacteria can cause a range of illnesses and is often contracted through contaminated food or water. Despite the health scare, the musician appeared to be in good spirits while taking steps to recover from the illness.</p>

          <p>Prominent defense attorney Abbe Lowell is representing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook in her legal fight against President Trump's attempt to fire her, a move unprecedented in presidential history. Lowell, known for representing high-profile clients across the political spectrum including Hunter Biden and Jared Kushner, has a long history of challenging what he terms as federal government overreach. He has filed a lawsuit on Cook's behalf, arguing that the unsubstantiated allegations of mortgage fraud used as grounds for her removal are politically motivated and irrelevant to her role at the Federal Reserve.</p>

          <p>In a significant antitrust ruling, a U.S. District Judge has ordered Google to end exclusive deals that establish it as the default search engine on various devices but declined the Department of Justice's call to force a sale of the Chrome browser. The decision, which Google plans to appeal, also requires the company to share certain search index and user interaction data and establishes a compliance oversight committee for six years. This ruling marks the most consequential outcome in a tech antitrust case in over two decades, setting a new precedent for regulating market dominance in the digital era.</p>

          <p>Air Lease, a prominent aircraft leasing company, has agreed to be taken private in a $7.4 billion acquisition by a consortium of investors including Japan's Sumitomo, SMBC Aviation Capital, Apollo, and Brookfield. The deal, valued at approximately $28.2 billion including debt, highlights a trend of consolidation within the airplane-renting industry. This sector has seen significant growth, owning over half the world's passenger jets, as airlines increasingly opt to lease rather than purchase costly aircraft. The acquisition is expected to enhance the new entity's scale in a market where rental rates have been high.</p>

Organizers stated that the vote gives a critical voice to park rangers, scientists, and other essential workers who have been dealing with job insecurity and increased workloads while being asked to maintain public services.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price increased on Tuesday, moving contrary to a downturn in the stock market, though it lagged behind a record-setting rally in gold. The leading cryptocurrency reclaimed the $110,000 level as traditional markets reacted to concerns over the legality of global tariffs and a rise in bond yields. Analysts suggest that while Bitcoin benefits from some of the same safe-haven drivers as gold, its performance has also been influenced by a significant market rotation into Ethereum. The differing movements highlight crypto's evolving and complex relationship with traditional financial assets. (not investment advice)</p>
