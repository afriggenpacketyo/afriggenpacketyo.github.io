          <p>Delta Air Lines has reinstated its 2025 profit outlook, causing its shares to jump significantly. The airline's CEO noted that while booking patterns have shifted, demand has stabilized, and the company anticipates a stronger summer travel season than initially expected by Wall Street. The positive forecast is supported by strong revenue from premium seating and its partnership with American Express, even as the company adjusts its capacity outside of peak travel periods. The report also led to a rise in stock prices for other airlines, signaling renewed investor confidence in the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 08:51:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Ukraine's burgeoning drone industry is considering exporting its technology and battlefield-tested expertise to European nations. Having developed rapidly during the war with Russia, Ukrainian companies have become adept at creating flexible, effective, and often low-cost drones, but they face funding shortfalls. Exporting could attract foreign investment and allow for joint ventures, potentially moving production to safer locations outside Ukraine. This move positions Ukraine not just as a recipient of aid but as a key partner and potential competitor in the European defense technology market, offering unique, combat-proven solutions.</p>

          <p>First responders successfully rescued 31 construction workers who were trapped in a collapsed tunnel in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The incident occurred at the Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel, a major infrastructure project, when a section collapsed miles from the single access point. Four workers entered the tunnel to help their 27 trapped colleagues before rescue teams arrived. The Los Angeles Fire Department deployed its Urban Search and Rescue teams, and all workers were brought to safety within about an hour, with none sustaining any visible injuries.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is set to become the largest shareholder in MP Materials, the owner of the only operational rare earth mine in the United States. The Pentagon will invest $400 million by purchasing preferred stock, a move aimed at expanding domestic processing capacity and magnet production to reduce reliance on China. This strategic investment will fund a new magnet manufacturing facility, with the government guaranteeing purchases of its output for ten years. The news caused MP Materials' shares to surge over 40%, marking a significant step in securing the American supply chain for critical minerals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At its recent biennial seminar, OPEC ministers and industry leaders focused on three key energy topics: the green transition, the oil market outlook, and the need for new investment. Officials reiterated their call for a pragmatic energy transition that includes continued investment in hydrocarbons to ensure global energy security while renewables are scaled up. The group released its 2050 World Oil Outlook, projecting sustained demand growth driven by developing nations. Ministers also stressed the urgent need for trillions of dollars in new oil and gas investments to boost dwindling spare capacity and meet future energy needs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an interview, economist Dean Spears, co-author of "After the Spike," argues that the world is facing a future of unprecedented population decline that warrants careful, non-political consideration. He contends that while environmental concerns are valid, progress has historically come from policy and technological changes, not from having fewer people. Spears suggests that a stabilized population is preferable to endless decline, as more people contribute to the collective knowledge and innovation that drive human progress. He calls for a new conversation that moves beyond conservative or liberal talking points to create a society that better supports families.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen comfortably survived a no-confidence vote in the European Parliament, initiated by a far-right Romanian MEP. The motion, which criticized her over transparency concerns related to COVID-19 vaccine contracts, failed with 360 votes in her favor. However, the debate provided an opportunity for center-left and liberal groups to voice grievances and extract policy commitments. Lawmakers expressed concerns over her party's perceived cooperation with the far-right and accused her of backsliding on Green Deal climate goals, highlighting the fragile political dynamics she must navigate in her second term.</p>

          <p>China has offered a rare glimpse into the production facilities for its fifth-generation stealth fighters, shown in the background of a state television report. While the segment focused on the J-15T, a 4.5-generation fighter, the presence of the more advanced, green-painted stealth aircraft suggests they may be ready for deployment on aircraft carriers with catapult launchers. A test pilot discussed the technical upgrades to the J-15T, including reinforced landing gear necessary for catapult launches. This subtle reveal hints at the progress of China's naval aviation capabilities and the expected deployment of advanced fighters on its third aircraft carrier.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Taylor Fritz is set to face two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon semi-finals, showcasing a newfound mental resilience. Long considered just outside the sport's elite, Fritz has demonstrated significant growth, surviving two five-set matches and playing with increased calmness and confidence. His powerful serve and success on grass courts, where he has won five titles, make him a formidable opponent. While Alcaraz is the favorite, Fritz's improved mental fortitude and high level of play suggest he has a genuine opportunity to challenge the Spanish superstar for a place in the final.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency has arrested four individuals in connection with the recent, disruptive cyber-attacks on retailers M&S and the Co-op. The suspects, including a 20-year-old woman and three males aged 17 to 19, were apprehended on suspicion of blackmail, money laundering, and other computer misuse offenses. The hacks, which involved data theft and ransomware, caused significant operational chaos, leaving some store shelves bare and costing M&S an estimated £300m in lost profits. The arrests mark a significant development in the investigation into the attacks that also targeted luxury retailer Harrods.</p>

          <p>Armed police in Romania have conducted raids targeting an organized crime group suspected of stealing millions from the UK's tax authority, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). The gang allegedly used sophisticated phishing techniques to steal the personal data of British taxpayers, then submitted fraudulent claims for tax refunds. Thirteen people were detained in raids around Bucharest, where luxury cars and cash were seized, while a fourteenth man was arrested in Preston, UK. The joint operation between Romanian and British authorities is a significant step in dismantling a complex international fraud and money laundering operation.</p>
