          <p>Bullet train services between Tokyo and Sendai on the Tohoku shinkansen line were suspended due to an inspection of an out-of-service train that halted between stations. JR East hopes to resume operations around 7 p.m. after the inspection is completed. The affected train, which debuted last spring on the Yamagata shinkansen line, stopped between Utsunomiya and Nasushiobara stations, causing two other trains to also stop. This disruption has impacted travel for many passengers in the region. </p>

          <p>Chris Woakes is set to return for England's five-Test series against India, highlighting his importance to the team. At 36, Woakes is the oldest player in the squad and will likely bowl the first over, leveraging his accuracy and movement against an Indian lineup inexperienced in English conditions. Woakes played nine Tests in 2024, his second-most in a calendar year, and his role as a senior bowler has become more prominent following James Anderson's retirement. Woakes emphasizes the importance of the team effort and looks forward to contributing to England's performance in the series. </p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to slow the pace of its monthly government bond purchases beyond April next year, reducing them by 200 billion yen per quarter, down from the current 400 billion yen. The BOJ will maintain its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 0.5 percent, reflecting a cautious approach to normalizing monetary policy amid economic uncertainties. This decision comes as U.S. President Donald Trump's higher tariffs blur the outlook for Japan's export-oriented economy. The central bank aims to trim its bloated balance sheet through March 2026 before potentially raising its key interest rate again. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order to reduce tariffs on UK cars being shipped to the US, implementing parts of a tariff deal agreed upon last month. The deal includes a 10% levy on most UK goods, including cars, and does not address the removal of charges on steel imports. The US will allow up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, instead of the 25% import tax imposed earlier this year. The order also agreed to remove tariffs on certain aerospace products, and the UK government will continue to pursue 0% tariffs on core steel products. </p>

Judge William Young stated that the cancellations, which affected studies involving LGBTQ+ issues, gender identity, and DEI, violated federal law. The judge ordered the NIH to restore the terminated grants. The ruling comes after lawsuits were filed against the administration, with plaintiffs arguing the cancellations were discriminatory. </p>
