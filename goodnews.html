          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that California Democrats are more supportive of Governor Gavin Newsom running for president in 2028 compared to former Vice President Kamala Harris. While Newsom's overall approval rating in the state is positive, California voters are divided on whether he should seek the presidency. The survey also indicates that few Californians believe their state sets a good example for the nation on key issues like housing, tax, or economic policy. Most independents in the state do not think either Newsom or Harris should run for president.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have continued their downward trend, with the average for a 30-year loan now at 6.19%, offering a potential opportunity for prospective homebuyers. However, the article advises caution, suggesting buyers consider that these declines have been gradual and that unforeseen economic factors could cause rates to reverse course. It also notes that acting now might be advantageous, as waiting could lead to increased competition during the traditional spring buying season if rates fall further. Buyers are encouraged to weigh these dynamics before committing to a loan. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a week of sharp fluctuations, the price of gold has become increasingly volatile, driven by competing factors like Federal Reserve rate cuts and a stronger stock market. The article outlines three potential strategies for investors looking to capitalize on these price swings. These include trading the stocks of gold mining companies, which can offer leveraged exposure, or using more liquid instruments like gold-backed ETFs for short-term plays. For long-term investors, the article suggests strategically buying physical gold during price dips to hedge against broader economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of quantum computing firms like IonQ and Rigetti Computing remained higher even after the Trump administration denied it was "currently" negotiating equity stakes in the companies. Investors appear optimistic due to the specific wording of the denial, which leaves open the possibility of future talks or different deal structures, such as warrants. The situation highlights the U.S. government's strategic interest in quantum technology to maintain a competitive edge over China, though the industry is still in a pre-commercial, cash-intensive phase.

          <p>In the new film 'Bugonia,' Emma Stone plays a pharmaceutical CEO who is abducted by two conspiracy theorists, played by Jesse Plemons and Aidan Delbis, who believe she is an alien. Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, the paranoid comedy is an adaptation of the Korean satire 'Save the Green Planet!' The review praises Stone's commanding performance, even with a shaved head and minimal setting, and highlights the film's sharp commentary on online misinformation, class division, and the human need for purpose. The film uses its absurd premise to explore themes of societal decay and corporate cruelty.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market's heavy concentration in a few mega-cap technology stocks is prompting investors to seek out alternative assets for diversification and risk management. According to market strategists, ETF flows indicate a growing trend towards cash, precious metals, and cryptocurrency as investors look for assets that are uncorrelated with the dominant tech sector. While allocations are still relatively small, the adoption of gold and spot bitcoin ETFs by mainstream investors is increasing as they look for ways to hedge against potential volatility caused by this unprecedented market imbalance.

          <p>President Donald Trump has reversed his plan to deploy federal forces in San Francisco, a decision he announced after speaking with prominent tech executives and the city's mayor. In a social media post, Trump credited calls from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, among others, for persuading him to hold off. The potential deployment had become a major flashpoint, but the reversal is being seen as a political victory for Mayor Daniel Lurie, who has advocated for continued partnership with federal agencies rather than military intervention.</p>
