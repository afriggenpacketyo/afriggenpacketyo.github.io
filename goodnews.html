        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report from Realtor.com reveals that home prices are declining in some U.S. regions, particularly in the South and West, offering some relief in a tight housing market. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen significant drops from their 2022 peaks, largely due to increased housing inventory from a pandemic-era construction boom. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to experience rising prices and limited supply, with cities like Milwaukee seeing substantial increases. This regional divergence is primarily driven by the availability of homes for sale. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trent Rockets began their season in The Hundred with a commanding six-wicket win against the Birmingham Phoenix. The Rockets' victory was anchored by an exceptional bowling performance, with fast bowler Lockie Ferguson taking three wickets for just 20 runs, restricting Phoenix to a modest score of 122-6. Despite an early setback in the chase, opener Tom Banton's 43 runs guided the Rockets to their target with 22 balls remaining. The comprehensive performance suggests the 2022 champions are a formidable contender again this year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of mining company MP Materials increased over 4% after it reported a smaller-than-expected loss for the second quarter. The positive financial results were driven by record production of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide, a critical component for magnets used in electric vehicles and electronics. This performance, coupled with a recent $400 million investment from the Department of Defense, has boosted investor confidence in the company's path to profitability. MP Materials is currently ramping up its magnet production facility in Texas to supply General Motors and other manufacturers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. is leveraging bipartisan federal initiatives, including the Defense Production Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, to strengthen its domestic mining and refining capabilities. One such project is a new nickel processing plant in Beulah, North Dakota, which received a $114 million grant from the Department of Energy. The facility, owned by Talon Metals, will process ore from Minnesota for use in EV batteries and other strategic applications, aiming to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign supply chains, particularly from China. This government backing reflects a cross-administration consensus on the importance of domestic raw materials. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For those who work at a desk, simple physical breaks can be a powerful tool to overcome creative blocks and reset focus. Bestselling author Kelly Corrigan shared her strategies, which include taking three-minute dance breaks to change her mood and getting up to walk around during phone calls. She also emphasizes the importance of tidying one's workspace and working in harmony with the body's natural energy rhythms rather than fighting against them. These small adjustments are presented not as distractions, but as integral parts of the creative process itself.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the celebrated astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission and safely guided its crew back to Earth, has passed away at the age of 97. Lovell's career was marked by historic achievements, including being one of the first humans to orbit the Moon on Apollo 8 and the first person to journey to the Moon twice. His leadership during the 1970 Apollo 13 crisis, when an onboard explosion crippled the spacecraft, turned a potential tragedy into what NASA calls one of its finest hours. His story of courage under extreme pressure was immortalized in the film "Apollo 13."</p>

          <p>Financial commentator Jim Cramer has suggested that a potential slowdown in the growth of Microsoft's Azure cloud division could inadvertently improve the market's perception of its rival, Amazon Web Services. He noted that if Azure's impressive growth rate moderates, it would make the recent performance of AWS appear less concerning by comparison. He also pointed out that while many new companies are building on OpenAI, which is heavily backed by Microsoft, Amazon has recently made its own deal with OpenAI. He separately praised Microsoft's overall flawless performance across all its business segments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United has officially reopened its Carrington training ground after a £50 million, year-long upgrade initiated by Sir Jim Ratcliffe. The revamped facility, described as now being "world-class," features an open-plan design to encourage interaction, state-of-the-art medical and data analysis tools, and unique amenities like a barber's room and an F1 simulator. The goal of the investment is to create an elite environment that helps the club compete at the highest level and encourages players to spend more time on their development at the facility, addressing past criticisms that the club's infrastructure was outdated.</p>

          <p>Italian football club AC Milan is reportedly interested in signing Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund. The interest comes shortly after United agreed to terms for another striker, Benjamin Sesko, increasing competition for Hojlund's position. Milan is said to be proposing an initial loan deal for the Danish forward with an option to buy next summer, a structure influenced by both clubs' financial constraints due to a lack of European competition this season. The potential move adds another layer of intrigue to United's forward line-up ahead of the new season.</p>

          <p>Massive investments in artificial intelligence are fueling strong growth in the digital advertising market, as evidenced by the impressive quarterly earnings of Meta and Alphabet. Meta credited its AI-driven ad system for a 22% year-over-year sales increase, while both companies continue to forecast massive capital expenditures on AI. In contrast, smaller platforms like Snap and Pinterest delivered lukewarm results, with Snap struggling after an ad platform update and Pinterest noting a pullback from some advertisers. The trend suggests that larger players with advanced AI are capturing a greater share of the ad market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alex Call, a recent trade deadline acquisition for the Dodgers, has transformed his career by becoming one of Major League Baseball's most difficult hitters to strike out. After a dismal 2019 minor-league season where he struck out in nearly 30% of his at-bats, Call dedicated himself to improving his plate discipline. Using virtual reality training and focusing on his approach, he dramatically cut his strikeout rate and developed a reputation as a "grinder." This overhaul of his offensive skills is what made the defensively versatile outfielder an attractive, low-cost addition for the title-contending Dodgers.</p>

The permit, valid until 2026, formalizes the robotaxi service the company has been testing with invited riders in Austin. While the current fleet operates with a human safety supervisor, the state permit allows for fully driverless operation. This milestone comes as Tesla's automated driving systems continue to face federal scrutiny and legal challenges related to safety and advertising claims. (not investment advice)</p>
