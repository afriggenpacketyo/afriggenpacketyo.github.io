Discussions also covered expanding cooperation in shipbuilding and trade relations between the two nations.

Hours before the meeting, Trump had posted criticisms on Truth Social about alleged "vicious raids on churches" by the new South Korean government, which he later clarified he was investigating.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles officials announced the arrest of several alleged South L.A. gang members, part of the "Rich Rollin’ Burglary Crew," accused of nearly 100 home and business break-ins since 2022. The crew, targeting high-end valuables, operated primarily in West L.A. and areas near LAX. District Attorney Nathan Hochman emphasized these were "crimes of greed." A February vehicle pursuit led to a breakthrough, and a subsequent search warrant uncovered weapons and stolen goods. Mayor Karen Bass praised the operation as a "major win" for the city, noting ongoing efforts against various burglary groups.</p>

This dual role highlights the challenges many working actors face in Los Angeles, particularly amid a significant slowdown in film and TV production. Huntley, who has a decade of experience in London's West End, moved to LA seeking screen opportunities but found himself needing survival jobs. His story underscores the financial realities for artists, even those achieving notable success on stage, in the current entertainment climate.</p>

          <h2>MLB Establishes Relief Pitcher of the Year Award to Recognize Evolving Role</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 14:23:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major League Baseball's Baseball Writers’ Association of America (BBWAA) announced the creation of a Relief Pitcher of the Year award for each league, starting in 2026. This new honor acknowledges the transformed and increasingly vital role of relief pitchers in modern baseball. Historically, relievers have been under-recognized in major awards, with only a few winning Cy Youngs or MVPs since saves became an official statistic. The award aims to properly celebrate these specialists, whose contributions are now considered essential to team success, especially as starting pitchers' workloads have decreased.</p>

          <p>Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, co-founder of the powerful Sinaloa cartel, pleaded guilty in New York to federal racketeering and criminal enterprise charges. The 77-year-old expressed remorse for the harm caused by illegal drugs in the US and Mexico, taking responsibility for his actions. Zambada, arrested last year under disputed circumstances, had overseen a vast criminal network responsible for moving tons of cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl. His plea comes as the Trump administration increases pressure on Mexico to combat cartels, and amid claims by Zambada's former partner, "El Chapo" Guzmán, of cruel prison conditions.</p>

          <p>SpaceX is preparing for the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket, a crucial mission aimed at validating corrective upgrades after three prior failures. The flight's objectives include testing the Super Heavy first stage's descent and splashdown, and sending the Starship upper stage on a sub-orbital trajectory to the Indian Ocean. Planned tests involve deploying Starlink simulator satellites and an in-space engine restart. A successful flight is vital for restoring confidence in the rocket's readiness for future moon missions, particularly NASA's planned 2027 lunar landing, amidst concerns about the complex architecture and propellant transfer challenges.</p>

          <p>Frustrated by "ghost job" advertisements, tech worker Eric Thompson is leading a working group to propose federal legislation, the Truth in Job Advertising and Accountability Act (TJAAA), to make the practice illegal. Ghost jobs are job postings without a genuine intent to hire, used for various reasons like collecting resumes or signaling growth, and represent a significant time-consuming headache for job seekers. The proposed act would require listings to include details like intended hire dates and previous posting frequency, with fines for violators. Thompson's advocacy is part of a growing movement addressing transparency in hiring.</p>
