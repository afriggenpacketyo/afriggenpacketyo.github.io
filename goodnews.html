          <p>The Dallas Mavericks have selected 18-year-old Cooper Flagg with the number one overall pick in the NBA Draft, positioning him as the new cornerstone of the franchise. The 6-foot-8 forward from Duke was the consensus college player of the year, demonstrating his pro-level talent by leading the Blue Devils in all major statistical categories. Flagg joins a talented Mavericks roster that includes Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving, signaling a new era for the team. The selection aims to help the organization and its fans move forward after the surprising trade of Luka Doncic earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced in a Fox News interview that he has secured a buyer for the popular video-sharing app TikTok. He described the prospective buyers as a group of "very wealthy people" and stated he would provide more details in about two weeks. The sale is contingent on approval from the Chinese government, which Trump believes President Xi Jinping will likely grant. This development comes after Trump repeatedly delayed the enforcement of a U.S. law passed last year that mandates TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, sell the platform due to national security concerns.</p>
