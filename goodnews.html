          <p>The announcement of singer Taylor Swift's engagement to NFL star Travis Kelce triggered a brief but notable spike in the stock price of Signet Jewelers. The social media post, which featured a "cushion cut" diamond ring, quickly garnered millions of likes, presumably driving investor speculation about a potential increase in ring sales. This event underscores Swift's significant economic influence, previously observed during her "Eras" tour, which was credited by the Federal Reserve for boosting local economies. The market reaction highlights the powerful intersection of celebrity culture and consumer finance.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced that its daily weight loss pill, orforglipron, successfully met its primary goals in a late-stage clinical trial involving patients with both obesity and Type 2 diabetes. The highest dose of the drug resulted in an average weight loss of 10.5% over 72 weeks and significantly lowered blood sugar levels. This success provides the necessary data for Eli Lilly to seek global regulatory approval, positioning the pill as a convenient, needle-free alternative in the lucrative GLP-1 drug market. The company anticipates a global launch around this time next year.</p>

          <p>A 17th-century Italian painting, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Ghislandi, which was looted by the Nazis from a Jewish art dealer over 80 years ago, has been discovered in an unexpected place. The artwork was spotted hanging in a home near Buenos Aires listed for sale by an estate agent. The property was once owned by a senior Nazi official who fled to Argentina after World War II. The painting belonged to the extensive collection of Jacques Goudstikker, and its discovery was the result of an investigation by a Dutch newspaper. Lawyers for Goudstikker's estate have confirmed they will pursue the painting's reclamation.</p>

          <h2>Utah Judge Orders State Legislature to Redraw Gerrymandered Congressional Map</h2>

          <p>A state judge has ruled that Utah's 2021 congressional map was unconstitutionally gerrymandered and has ordered the Republican-controlled legislature to draw a new one within 30 days. The decision found that the current map violated standards established by a citizen-led initiative aimed at preventing partisan gerrymandering. This ruling could potentially create a more competitive district, possibly opening a path for a Democrat to win a U.S. House seat in the heavily Republican state. The development comes amid a backdrop of renewed redistricting battles in other states across the country.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has grown to become the seventh largest in the game's history, reaching an estimated $815 million for the upcoming Wednesday drawing. The prize increased after no ticket matched all the winning numbers in Monday night's draw. The cash value of the current jackpot is estimated at $367.9 million. The last time the grand prize was won was on May 31, and the game has now gone 37 consecutive drawings without a jackpot winner. Two tickets from Monday's drawing, sold in Georgia and Texas, won $1 million each.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite strong performance from the S&P 500 index in 2025, some financial experts are cautioning investors about the risks of over-concentration. The index's growth has been narrowly driven by a few "Magnificent Seven" technology stocks, with the top 10 holdings now representing about 40% of the index's value. Analysts from firms like Morgan Stanley suggest that this narrow market leadership is not healthy and advise diversifying into other sectors such as business services, financials, and healthcare. Strategies like investing in equal-weight index funds or looking to international markets are recommended to mitigate risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard has offloaded more than 76,000 pounds of cocaine and marijuana at Port Everglades, Florida, marking the largest single drug seizure in the agency's history. The narcotics, with an estimated street value of $473 million, were intercepted during 19 separate operations in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific Ocean over a two-month period. A Coast Guard admiral stated the seized cocaine represented 23 million lethal doses, highlighting the scale of the threat from transnational drug trafficking. The successful interdictions involved a coordinated effort between the Coast Guard, U.S. Navy, and a Dutch naval vessel.</p>

          <p>Rising football talent Rio Ngumoha, who recently scored a last-minute winner for Liverpool, was successfully recruited from Chelsea's academy last year in a move that shocked the youth football world. Sources indicate that Ngumoha, regarded as the best player in his age group at Chelsea, chose Liverpool because he believed it offered a clearer and faster pathway to first-team opportunities. The move highlights a shifting landscape in English youth football, where clubs like Liverpool and Manchester United are increasingly competitive in attracting top domestic talent, partly due to post-Brexit rules limiting the recruitment of young European players.</p>

          <p>Star forward Christian Pulisic has been named to the U.S. Men's National Team roster for upcoming friendlies against South Korea and Japan, marking his return after a self-imposed absence. However, in a surprising decision, regular midfielder Weston McKennie was left off the squad announced by head coach Mauricio Pochettino. The roster also sees the return of Sergiño Dest and Josh Sargent, the latter of whom has been in excellent scoring form for his club. Several other key players, including Matt Turner and Folarin Balogun, are absent due to injury or other circumstances.</p>

          <p>The Katherine Johnson Technology Magnet Academy in DeSoto, Texas, is dedicating a week to teaching its students about the life and legacy of its pioneering namesake. Johnson was a brilliant mathematician whose critical calculations for NASA were instrumental in the success of America's early spaceflights, a story famously told in the film "Hidden Figures." The school aims to instill in its 600 students the values of hard work and self-confidence that defined Johnson's journey as a Black woman overcoming racial segregation. The lessons are designed to inspire students to understand the profound impact they too can have on the world.</p>
