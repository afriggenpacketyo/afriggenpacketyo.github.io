          <p>Indiana University has successfully extended head football coach Curt Cignetti's contract with a massive eight-year, $93 million deal, elevating him to the third-highest paid coach in college football. This significant commitment ensures Cignetti remains with the Hoosiers, effectively ending speculation that Penn State might recruit him to replace their recently fired coach. Cignetti has transformed Indiana's football program, guiding them to an 11-1 record and a College Football Playoff berth last season, along with National and Big Ten Coach of the Year accolades. With a current 6-0 record and Heisman frontrunner Fernando Mendoza, the Hoosiers are now considered serious national title contenders.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris has publicly accepted that he will face "consequences" from his McLaren team following his first-lap collision with teammate Oscar Piastri at the Singapore Grand Prix. The incident, where Norris made contact with Piastri after running into Max Verstappen, damaged his front wing but did not lead to in-race penalties. Norris emphasized that the team held him accountable, and they are working to understand the repercussions to prevent similar situations, underscoring McLaren's strict "do not crash with your team-mate" principle. Despite the team's internal review, Norris secured a third-place finish, with Piastri in fourth, highlighting the team's overall strong performance in the race.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced new initiatives aimed at significantly expanding access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) by reducing costs and encouraging employer-provided benefits. A key part of this plan is a deal with EMD Serono, a major fertility drug manufacturer, to dramatically cut the price of essential IVF medications, with the company offering an 84% discount directly to patients. The administration will also issue guidance to encourage employers to offer fertility benefits, similar to vision or dental coverage, though it will not be mandated. This move follows Trump's previous pledges to address IVF costs and accessibility, particularly after the contentious Alabama Supreme Court ruling regarding frozen embryos, making it a significant policy push.</p>

          <p>Susan Stamberg, a cherished "founding mother" of NPR, has died at 87, marking the end of an era for public radio. Joining NPR at its very beginning, Stamberg broke barriers by becoming one of the first women to host flagship programs like "All Things Considered" and "Weekend Edition," at a time when commercial networks rarely hired women for such roles. Colleagues fondly recall her as a tough, authentic, and inspiring storyteller who found joy in culture, science, and the humanity of politics. Her legacy is so ingrained that her recorded voice continues to announce floors in NPR's headquarters elevators, a constant reminder of her pioneering spirit.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld its block on President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops within the Chicago area, ruling that the administration failed to justify the action under federal law. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously determined there was "insufficient evidence" of a rebellion or its imminent danger in Illinois, which is required to federalize the Guard under Title 10. The court also found no proof that ongoing immigration protests had significantly hindered federal officers' ability to enforce laws. This decision allows the troops to remain under federal control but prevents their deployment, representing a legal challenge to the Trump administration's use of executive power.</p>

Thune's push for a vote comes as Trump indicated the timing might not be ideal, but the legislation has overwhelming support from 85 senators. The proposed bill aims to intensify economic pressure on Russia to end the war in Ukraine, notably including a 500% tariff on imported goods from nations purchasing Russian oil, gas, and uranium.

          <p>The University of Southern California (USC) has officially rejected the Trump administration's controversial education compact, which sought to align universities with a conservative vision in exchange for priority research funding. USC Interim President Beong-Soo Kim articulated concerns that linking research benefits to the compact would ultimately "undermine the same values of free inquiry and academic excellence" that are fundamental to higher education. The compact proposed mandates such as defining gender as two sexes, restricting foreign student enrollment, and eliminating race from admissions decisions. USC's decision aligns with rejections from other prominent institutions like MIT and Brown, and follows a threat from California Governor Gavin Newsom to withhold state funding from any university that accepted the compact.</p>
