          <p>Former Australian Football League (AFL) player Mitch Brown has become the first openly gay or bisexual man in the league's 129-year history. Brown, who played for the West Coast Eagles, revealed that hiding his sexuality significantly influenced his decision to retire. He hopes his public announcement will foster a safer and more inclusive environment for others. Brown described a "hyper-masculinity" culture within the AFL, recalling homophobic comments and a teammate's discomfort with gay players. Experts believe his candidness could drive significant cultural and behavioral changes in Australian men's sports, encouraging more players to feel secure enough to come out.</p>

The 400-foot rocket achieved its first successful payload deployment of eight mock Starlink satellites, relit its Raptor engine in orbit, and stress-tested its reusable heat shield. The Super Heavy booster performed a controlled splashdown in the Gulf Coast, followed by the spacecraft's splashdown in the Indian Ocean. This success is crucial for SpaceX's commercial dominance and NASA's Artemis program, which plans to use Starship for crewed lunar missions. Interim NASA head Sean Duffy congratulated SpaceX, highlighting its role in future space exploration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's embattled property market is showing signs of a tentative recovery, with major developers like China Resources Land and Sunac posting improved interim results. State-owned CR Land's net profit rose 16.2%, driven by property development and retail consumption, while privately owned Sunac narrowed its loss by 14.4% due to lower operating costs. These results indicate that government stimulus measures and recovering retail consumption are beginning to stabilize the industry after a period of significant debt and tepid sales. The improved performance, particularly in shopping centers, suggests a positive shift from the crisis mode experienced by many developers just a year ago. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Denmark's National Museum has unveiled what is believed to be the first 'portrait' of a Viking: a miniature 10th-century ivory walrus tusk figurine. Measuring just 1.2 inches, the detailed carving depicts a well-groomed man with an imperial mustache, braided beard, and neatly styled hair, suggesting high status or wealth. Curator Peter Pentz suggests it could represent King Harald Bluetooth. Found in Norway in 1796, the piece was rediscovered in the museum's archives. Its unique attention to individual detail and smiling expression stands in stark contrast to other, simpler Viking Age human depictions, which are rare compared to animal motifs.</p>

          <p>China has successfully tested a new residual heat removal system, enhancing the meltdown-proof capabilities of its next-generation, radioactive waste-recycling nuclear power plants. The China Institute of Atomic Energy announced this breakthrough in developing fourth-generation nuclear plants with a closed-loop fuel cycle. This passive heat removal system is specifically designed for integral fast reactors, which use high-energy neutrons for greater fuel efficiency and can act as breeders, converting consumed nuclear fuel into more fissile material for reuse. These reactors also reprocess spent fuel within the same facility, distinguishing them by their closed-loop fuel cycle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits saw a narrowed decline of 1.5% year-on-year in July, a notable recovery from steeper drops in previous months. This improvement signals that Beijing's campaign against internal "involution," or excessive competition leading to price wars, is easing the strain on company profitability. Profits in the first seven months fell 1.7%, primarily due to the mining sector, while manufacturing and utilities saw gains. Statistician Yu Weining attributed the recovery to policies aimed at restoring consumer price levels. Analysts suggest the anti-involution campaign, though incremental, demonstrates government responsiveness to business concerns, but deflationary pressures may persist until industry consolidation occurs.

Fearnley's rapid ascent in rankings over the past 15 months has quickly brought him to major tournaments, where he often faces high-profile opponents. He is now set for a second-round rematch against German third seed Alexander Zverev, hoping that continued exposure to high-stakes environments will help him manage his service issues.
