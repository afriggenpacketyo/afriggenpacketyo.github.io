          <p>South Korea's new progressive president, Lee Jae-myung, is expected to take a more cautious approach to Taiwan and prioritize economic ties with China. Observers anticipate continuity in military cooperation with the US and Japan, but Lee is likely to be more friendly towards China and North Korea than his predecessor. Under Yoon, South Korea emphasized its commitment to the US alliance and trilateral cooperation with Washington and Tokyo. This shift in leadership could potentially recalibrate Seoul's foreign policy in the region. </p>

          <p>Manchester United has reported a profit in the third quarter fiscal results of 2025, despite previous concerns about the club's financial stability. This turnaround is attributed to increased revenues across all streams, driven by strong performance in the UEFA Europa League and high demand for hospitality offerings. Commercial, broadcasting, and matchday revenues have all seen significant growth compared to the previous year. While debt and cash flow remain concerns, the club's improving financial situation may allow for substantial investment in the transfer window. </p>

          <p>Public health scientist Devi Sridhar argues that achieving a long and healthy life, aiming for 100 years, depends more on public policy, infrastructure, and community than individual optimization. While personal health choices are important, societal factors like access to nutritious food, clean air, and preventive healthcare play a crucial role. Sridhar emphasizes the need for collective responsibility and government policies that prioritize the conditions for good health. She suggests that the quest for longevity should focus on creating environments where healthy living is the norm, rather than solely relying on individual efforts. </p>
