Education Minister Toshiko Abe stated that the government will work with institutions to ensure educational opportunities for young people. The Japan Student Services Organization will release a list of universities offering support, and the ministry will provide consultation services for students studying in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The ultra-rich are increasingly storing their gold in Singapore due to growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty, with a notable increase in orders to store gold and silver in secure facilities like "The Reserve". Singapore is viewed as a safe jurisdiction with political and economic stability, attracting high-net-worth clients concerned about tariffs and potential instabilities. This trend reflects a preference for physical gold bars over paper assets to mitigate counterparty and geopolitical risks. The rise in gold prices and a lack of trust in some domestic banking systems are also driving this shift.</p>
