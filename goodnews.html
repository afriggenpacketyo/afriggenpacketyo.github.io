          <p>Terry Luttrell, the original singer for REO Speedwagon, was involved in a car accident on Sunday morning after performing at a reunion concert in Champaign, Illinois. Luttrell, 78, told The News-Gazette that he fell asleep at the wheel while driving to St. Louis for business, resulting in the crash on Interstate 57. He sustained a cracked sternum from the airbag and experienced back and neck pain but expects to recover fully after rehabilitation in the hospital. Luttrell said he was happy he performed at the farewell concert and that it was a fun evening, despite the accident. The band had previously announced they would stop touring due to "irreconcilable differences."</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved lenacapavir for the prevention of HIV, a drug with the potential to drastically curb the HIV epidemic. Clinical trial data suggest that just two injections a year provide near-complete protection against HIV infection. This twice-yearly injection offers a more convenient alternative to the current standard of care, a daily pill called Truvada. The high cost of the drug could price out many, and coupled with the U.S.'s steep cuts to foreign aid could prevent people in countries with the highest HIV burden from benefiting.</p>
