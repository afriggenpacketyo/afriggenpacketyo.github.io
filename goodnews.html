          <p>Renowned theoretical physicist Chen-ning Yang, a Nobel Prize winner, has died in Beijing at the age of 103. He was widely regarded as one of the 20th century’s greatest physicists, often ranked alongside Albert Einstein. In 1954, Yang co-authored a set of equations with Robert Mills, resulting in the Yang–Mills theory, which proved as significant as Einstein’s theory of relativity. This theory described how the electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions operate in the subatomic world, forming the mathematical basis for the Standard Model, the cornerstone of modern physics. His profound contributions unified fundamental forces and explained elementary particle behavior.</p>

          <p>Chinese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have significantly increased their presence in the South African SUV market, growing sales volume by an impressive 86% between January and August compared to the previous year. This surge has elevated their total market share to 15%, driven primarily by strong performances from brands like Chery, whose volume rose 27% to over 16,000 units, and Haval, which saw a 45% surge to over 12,000 units. This rapid growth is notably cutting into the dominance of established Japanese leaders like Toyota and Suzuki, both of whom recorded a decline in market share during the same period, indicating a major shift in regional automotive market dynamics.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered an unprecedented individual performance, single-handedly propelling the Los Angeles Dodgers to the World Series with a sweep of the Milwaukee Brewers in the NLCS. After a recent postseason slump that raised questions about his form, Ohtani made a crucial adjustment to his routine, which immediately paid dividends. In Game 4, he achieved a historic feat, hitting three home runs as a batter and striking out ten batters over six scoreless innings as a pitcher, earning him NLCS MVP honors. This extraordinary two-way display, drawing comparisons to Babe Ruth, fulfilled the long-held prophecy of his potential, cementing his status as a generational talent and securing the Dodgers' 26th pennant.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holding's cloud division has introduced Aegaeon, a new computing pooling solution that reportedly slashed the number of Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) needed for its artificial intelligence models by 82%. Beta-tested in Alibaba Cloud’s model marketplace, the system reduced GPU requirements from 1,192 to 213 for dozens of models up to 72 billion parameters. This innovation, presented at the 31st Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, addresses resource inefficiency in serving concurrent large language model (LLM) workloads. Researchers globally are seeking such solutions to optimize GPU power, allowing a single GPU to serve multiple models more efficiently.</p>

          <p>A popular Chinese spy drama, "Silent Honour," has inspired an outpouring of public praise and remembrance for real-life intelligence agents, particularly a deceased underground party member named Wu. Despite it not being Ching Ming, China’s grave-sweeping festival, Beijing's Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery has seen a "sudden surge" of visitors laying hundreds of flowers on Wu's tomb. Wu, a KMT lieutenant general delegated to Taiwan in 1949, was posthumously recognized as an "unsung hero" by many, including 35-year-old Beijing resident Harry Wang. The article highlights the profound cultural impact of the drama in fostering appreciation for historical figures and their sacrifices, demonstrating how media can shape public sentiment towards national service.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is actively building an ecosystem to solidify its role as a leading offshore yuan trading center, introducing new schemes to encourage greater use of the Chinese currency by international investors and companies. One key initiative, the Renminbi Bond Fund (RBF), makes it easier and cheaper for businesses to borrow yuan, with Hong Kong dollar interest rates being more than double yuan loan rates. This scheme is set to expand in December to include direct investments, allowing mainland firms to secure yuan loans for overseas investment and foreign firms to obtain yuan funding for mainland expansion.

          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation imposing new tariffs: 25% on imported medium- and heavy-duty trucks and their parts, and 10% on imported buses. This measure aims to protect U.S. companies from foreign competition and incentivize domestic manufacturing. Senior administration officials explained that the 25% tariff applies to Class 3 to Class 8 vehicles. A credit system will also be provided for manufacturers who import some parts to produce vehicles in the U.S., designed to offset tariff liabilities and support American labor and production.

          <p>This article pays tribute to the former commander of the Chinese navy, Liu Huaqing, hailed as a revered strategist and visionary technocrat. Liu directed the comprehensive modernization of China’s naval forces, transforming them into a world-class standard and championing the development of aircraft carriers. Throughout his distinguished career, he was often compared to Alfred Thayer Mahan, a prominent 19th-century American naval strategist. Born in 1916, Liu joined the Red Army at 13 and rose through the ranks of the People’s Liberation Army before being transferred to the newly established PLA Navy in 1952, where he first encountered the sea, marking the beginning of his influential naval career.</p>

          <p>The Orionid meteor shower is set to peak next week, offering a spectacular celestial display visible until November 7th, with the most intense activity around October 22nd. Originating from Halley's Comet debris, these bright, fast-moving meteors travel at about 41 miles per second, leaving distinctive light trails 60 miles up in space. Viewers can expect around 15 meteors per hour during the peak. For optimal viewing, find a dark spot away from city lights between midnight and dawn, and look towards the constellation of Orion, identifiable by its three bright stars known as Orion's Belt. No special equipment is needed to enjoy this annual event.</p>

          <p>Ahead of India's Diwali and Dhanteras festivals, the traditional gold rush is seeing a shift in consumer behavior due to soaring gold prices, which have topped $1,440 for 10g. While demand remains strong, with "fear of missing out" driving some purchases, customers are buying less or opting for lighter, more elaborate-looking pieces. A clear trend this year is an increased preference for gold and silver as investments rather than just jewelry, reflected in bullion market data showing investment demand rising from 19% to 35% year-over-year. The Reserve Bank of India is also significantly influencing prices by diversifying its foreign exchange holdings with gold. This article discusses market trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant turnaround in its drug death epidemic, with fatal overdoses falling by 25% in 2024, saving nearly 30,000 lives. This decline, particularly notable in states like North Carolina, is attributed to a commitment to harm reduction strategies. These include law enforcement-assisted diversion (LEAD) programs, which steer substance users towards recovery instead of incarceration, and increased access to medication-assisted treatments like methadone and buprenorphine. The widespread availability of naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal drug, has also saved thousands of lives. Additionally, a generational shift shows younger people avoiding opioids, while opioid settlement funds are being used for prevention, treatment, and recovery.</p>
