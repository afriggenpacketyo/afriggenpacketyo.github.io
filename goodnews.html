          <p>Democratic frontrunner Katie Porter faced criticism after a testy interview where she threatened to leave when pressed on appealing to Trump voters. The exchange, which gained significant attention, highlighted her strategic assessment that a Democrat in California doesn't need to win over Republicans in a general election. Rivals quickly seized on the incident, sharing their own interviews and questioning Porter's temperament and leadership abilities for the gubernatorial race. This event has potentially stirred the previously stagnant contest to succeed Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>

          <p>Home equity loan rates are becoming increasingly attractive for homeowners, especially as the Federal Reserve continues its interest rate reduction campaign. With average homeowners possessing significant equity, these loans offer a cheaper alternative to credit cards or personal loans. Current rates vary by repayment period, with opportunities for even better deals for those with strong credit. Prospective borrowers are advised to compare offers from various lenders to secure the most favorable terms, while also considering the inherent risks of using a home as collateral.

          <p>As gold prices surge past $4,000 an ounce amid geopolitical uncertainty and government shutdowns, financial advisors offer mixed views on its long-term investment appeal. While some experts, like Ray Dalio, suggest significant portfolio allocation to gold as a safe haven, others, including top-ranked advisors, argue that equities consistently outperform due to compounding earnings and dividends. This article highlights that despite gold's short-term sparkle during turmoil, a diversified portfolio with a limited, single-digit percentage exposure to gold, or none at all, is generally recommended for sustained growth.

          <p>Single-purpose reverse mortgages offer an affordable option for older homeowners to access home equity for specific, pre-approved expenses like property taxes or home repairs. Unlike broader Home Equity Conversion Mortgages, these loans are typically offered by state/local agencies or nonprofits, often with lower upfront costs and fees. Borrowers make no monthly payments, with the loan balance due upon selling the home, moving out, or death. This article highlights that while beneficial for those on fixed incomes, availability is limited, income qualifications apply, and the funds are restricted to a single use.
