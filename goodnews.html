          <p>Lowe's has reaffirmed its full-year forecast, buoyed by increasing sales to home professionals, which compensated for slower demand from do-it-yourself consumers. The home improvement retailer narrowly missed quarterly sales expectations but surpassed earnings estimates, leading to a nearly 2% rise in premarket trading of Lowe's shares. CEO Marvin Ellison credited investments in stores, technology, and customer service for navigating near-term market uncertainties. Lowe's anticipates full-year sales between $83.5 billion and $84.5 billion, with comparable sales projected to remain flat to increase by 1% year over year.</p>

          <p>Currently, 25 states have enacted laws regulating or banning cellphones in schools, reflecting a growing consensus that these devices negatively impact children. Connecticut State Representative Jennifer Leeper described phones as a 'cancer on our kids,' citing their role in increasing isolation and decreasing attention spans. While Florida initially banned phones only during instructional time, a new bill seeks to extend the ban throughout the entire school day for elementary and middle schools. There is a growing consensus around exceptions, with most states allowing electronic devices for medical needs and special education plans.</p>
