The winning numbers were 11, 14, 34, 47, 51, with a red Powerball of 18. This marks the 36th consecutive drawing without a grand prize winner, with the last major jackpot being claimed in California on May 31.

          <p>The UK government is set to overhaul the asylum appeals system in an effort to reduce processing times and decrease reliance on housing migrants in hotels. A new independent body with dedicated adjudicators will be established to hear cases more quickly, as the current average wait for an appeal is over a year with 51,000 cases pending. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the goal is to end unacceptable delays for those appealing rejected asylum applications. The move comes amid public protests and legal challenges from local councils over the use of hotels for asylum seekers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy received a written warning from the country's Environment Agency for fishing without a license. The incident occurred during a visit with U.S. Vice President JD Vance at Lammy's country estate, where the two held a bilateral meeting and participated in a fishing photo opportunity. Lammy, who called the situation an "administrative error," subsequently purchased a license and reported himself to the agency. The event drew some lighthearted commentary, with Vance joking that the Foreign Secretary was the only one who didn't catch a fish.</p>

          <p>Chinese smartphone manufacturer Vivo has introduced the Vivo Vision, a mixed-reality headset positioned as a direct competitor to Apple's Vision Pro. The new device features a similar design and intuitive eye-tracking and hand-gesture controls but is significantly lighter, weighing 398 grams compared to Apple's 600 grams. It boasts 8K resolution powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2 Platform. While a price has not been officially announced, it is expected to be substantially cheaper than its American rival, potentially costing about a third as much.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The disability charity Disabled Motoring UK is advocating for all UK airports to eliminate "kiss-and-fly" drop-off charges for blue badge holders. An investigation found that while some major airports like Gatwick and Heathrow waive the fee, many others charge disabled drivers or have complex and inconsistent exemption processes. Critics argue the system is confusing, with some airports requiring online pre-registration that can be difficult for less tech-savvy individuals. The charity asserts that disabled customers deserve respectful treatment and should not be charged for accessing terminal drop-off zones.</p>

          <p>In its annual ranking, Time Out has for the first time included a list of the best cities for Gen Z, based on a survey of over 18,500 people. Melbourne, Australia, was ranked as the number two city, praised for its diversity, inclusivity, and vibrant arts and culture scene. New York City was the only U.S. city to make the top 10, placing at number four for its walkability, nightlife, and food, though it scored poorly on affordability. The rankings were determined by filtering responses from individuals born between 1997 and 2012 across various categories.</p>

          <p>The Yavapai County Sheriff's Office is investigating the discovery of human remains inside a wooden casket unearthed in the remote ghost town of Cleator, Arizona. The casket was found by a tractor grading the desert floor, and deputies estimate the remains are between 55 and 85 years old. The discovery is being treated as a historical case rather than a contemporary crime scene. The Sheriff's Office is collaborating with local historians at the Sharlot Hall Museum to identify the remains and understand the history behind the burial.</p>

          <p>As the UK Parliament's e-petitions system celebrates its tenth anniversary, its impact remains a subject of debate. While the system has given millions a direct way to engage with democracy, many petitions, even those with massive support like the calls to reverse Brexit, have not led to immediate policy changes. However, there have been notable successes, such as Finn's Law, which increased protections for service animals after a petition garnered 130,000 signatures. The platform continues to host a mix of serious campaigns and humorous suggestions, reflecting its role as a bridge between the public and Parliament.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young adults in their early 20s are opting for "preventative Botox" injections with the goal of stopping wrinkles before they form. This trend involves using botulinum toxin to relax facial muscles, thereby reducing the skin creasing that eventually leads to static lines. While some practitioners support the approach as a way to slow the aging process, others, including the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, argue it is often a waste of money to treat lines that do not yet exist. Critics also express concern about the societal pressure on young people to pursue anti-aging treatments.</p>

The leaderboard sets up a dramatic final round, with Russell Henley two shots behind in third place. A victory for Fleetwood would mark his first win on American soil, but he faces a tough challenge from the in-form Cantlay.</p>

          <p>Scientists have digitally reconstructed the faces of two men from 2,500-year-old skulls excavated at an ancient burial site in Tamil Nadu, India. The project, a collaboration between Madurai Kamaraj University and Face Lab in the UK, aims to understand the appearance of early inhabitants of the Keeladi civilization. This civilization, dating back to 580 BC, suggests a complex urban society existed in southern India independently of the northern Indus Valley Civilisation. The facial reconstructions reveal features primarily of Ancient Ancestral South Indians, but also hint at global migration through traces of Middle-Eastern and Austro-Asiatic ancestries.</p>

          <p>Bayern Munich began the Bundesliga season with a commanding 6-0 victory over RB Leipzig, signaling their intent to continue their domestic dominance. This comes as the league finds itself at a crossroads, trying to balance its strong traditional fan culture with the need for global commercial growth. In a bold move, the DFL has granted live streaming rights in the UK and Ireland to YouTube content creators to attract a younger, international audience. This innovative approach aims to close the financial gap with leagues like the Premier League, though concerns remain that a lack of competition at the top could undermine the league's appeal.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Jack Draper is set to compete in the US Open after a seven-week break due to bone bruising in his left arm. The injury, which he first felt during the clay season, worsened on grass and forced him to take time off after Wimbledon. Draper stated that while the bone is still healing and may cause some discomfort, he does not feel it will hold him back in his first-round match. He is looking forward to returning to competition, believing it will help take his mind off the physical issues.</p>
