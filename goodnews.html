          <p>Jin, the eldest member of the K-pop group BTS, demonstrated his unique appeal and deep fan connection during his recent solo tour stop at Anaheim's Honda Center. The concert was structured like a Korean variety show, incorporating interactive games and inside jokes that catered directly to the group's dedicated fanbase, known as ARMY. After completing his mandatory military service, Jin released new music and embarked on a tour that highlights his vocal talents and charming, humorous stage presence. The show's success proves the enduring power of each BTS member and their ability to command large audiences individually.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Tariffs May Inadvertently Push Nations Toward Economic Liberalization</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that while widely criticized, President Trump's universal tariffs may have a "silver lining" by forcing other countries and trading blocs to confront their own protectionist policies. The economic pressure from U.S. tariffs is compelling nations like Canada and China to dismantle long-standing internal trade barriers and regulations that have hindered their own growth. The piece suggests this self-reflection and subsequent domestic reform could unlock economic potential that equals or exceeds the losses from the tariffs. However, it notes the European Union seems more focused on a war economy than on implementing similar free-market reforms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Treasury Secretary Calls for Major Bank Regulation Reform, Including Scrapping Dual Capital Rules</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 20:53:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is advocating for significant reforms to the nation's financial regulatory system, which he described as antiquated. Speaking at a Federal Reserve conference, Bessent argued that excessive capital requirements are stifling lending and distorting markets. He specifically called for abandoning a proposed Biden-era rule that would have required banks to comply with two different methods of measuring risk capital, arguing it was designed simply to increase capital aggregates without a principled basis. The Treasury will take a stronger role in driving these reforms to boost innovation and growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Coffee Chain Dutch Bros as a Potential High-Growth Stock</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The coffee chain Dutch Bros is highlighted as a compelling growth stock, driven by its rapid domestic expansion strategy and strong performance. The company is innovating with store layouts and menu additions, like more food options, to boost sales and customer engagement. While its stock trades at a high price-to-earnings ratio, indicating significant market optimism, its price-to-sales ratio is considered more reasonable. The article notes that investing carries risk as the company is still in a heavy growth phase and not consistently free-cash-flow positive, but its strategic moves inspire confidence for long-term growth.

          <p>Following the deadly July Fourth floods in Texas, officials have now accounted for the vast majority of the more than 160 people who were initially reported missing in hard-hit Kerr County. The county's top executive announced that only three individuals remain unaccounted for, calling the search a "Herculean effort." Most of those reported missing were tourists who had safely returned home without checking in. The flash floods killed at least 135 people statewide, with the fast-moving water washing away buildings and vehicles along the Guadalupe River, a popular tourist and camping destination.</p>

          <p>Two months after announcing his diagnosis with Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH), singer-songwriter Billy Joel says he is feeling "good" but still working on his balance. The rare brain condition, which involves a build-up of fluid, forced the 76-year-old to cancel numerous tour dates earlier this year. Speaking on a podcast, Joel acknowledged that the term "brain disorder" sounds severe but stated that his personal feeling is more positive than the label suggests. He is currently undergoing physical therapy and remains committed to prioritizing his health and recovery from the condition.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has identified a group of four stocks—Palantir, AppLovin, Robinhood, and Coinbase, which he dubs "PARC"—that he believes will continue to perform well due to strong momentum from retail investors. He notes that these companies represent a "two-track market," where certain names are relentlessly pushed higher by enthusiastic individual buyers, often irrespective of traditional metrics. While cautioning that investors should remain disciplined and take profits, Cramer suggests these specific companies have solid enough fundamentals and analyst attention to potentially sustain their rally, distinguishing them from more speculative trendy stocks.
