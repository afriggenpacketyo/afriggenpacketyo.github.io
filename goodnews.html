          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) forecasts an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season for 2025, predicting 13 to 19 named storms, with 6 to 10 becoming hurricanes and 3 to 5 reaching major hurricane status. The forecast considers factors like neutral El Niño conditions, warmer ocean temperatures, and a potentially active West African Monsoon. Officials emphasize the importance of preparedness, urging communities in storm-prone areas to develop plans and gather supplies before the season begins on June 1st. The forecast is intended to provide a framework for communities to prepare, given the increasing intensity of storms due to climate change.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department plans to phase out the penny, ceasing production of the 1-cent coin due to rising manufacturing costs. The final order for penny blanks has been placed, with the U.S. Mint expected to halt production in early 2026. Manufacturing each penny currently costs about 3.7 cents, making it more expensive to produce than its face value. This decision is projected to save the Mint approximately $56 million annually, addressing concerns about the penny's economic viability.</p>

          <p>House lawmakers passed changes for the federal deduction for state and local taxes, known as SALT, as part of President Donald Trump's tax package. If enacted, the SALT cap would rise to $40,000, up from $30,000 in the previous plan, and phases out over $500,000. The provision would go into effect in 2025. However, the House proposal for changes to the SALT deduction could still face pushback in the Senate.</p>

          <h2>Trump Tax Bill Includes $1,000 Baby Bonus in 'Trump Accounts'</h2>

          <p>The new tax bill includes a provision for "Trump Accounts," offering a $1,000 baby bonus to new parents. These accounts function similarly to 529 college savings plans, with tax-deferred earnings and long-term capital gains rates on qualified withdrawals. While presented as a benefit, some experts argue that existing options like 529 plans may offer greater advantages for families focused on higher education due to tax-free growth and broader eligibility for educational expenses. The program is designed to encourage early savings for children's future expenses.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally, reaching a new record high above $111,000, driven by institutional ownership, corporate adoption, and optimism around U.S. crypto regulation. Positive momentum, easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and the Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt have also contributed to the price increase. This rise occurs despite a drop in U.S. equities, suggesting investors are seeking alternative stores of value. Pro-crypto policies from President Trump and the Senate's advancement of crypto legislation are further supporting the market.</p>
