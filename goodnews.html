          <p>NATO allies are expected to pledge to increase their defense spending, potentially reaching 5% of their GDP, at the upcoming summit in The Hague. The U.S. has been pushing for allies to commit to this target, which includes 3.5% for "pure" defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure like cyber warfare capabilities. While some countries are close to meeting the 2% threshold agreed upon a decade ago, others still lag behind, raising questions about whether these pledges will materialize into concrete action. European aerospace and defense companies are closely monitoring these commitments, seeking long-term contracts to scale up production, but they remain in limbo between pledges and actual procurement.</p>

          <p>Siarhei Tsikhanouski, a key Belarusian opposition figure, was unexpectedly released after five years in prison and reunited with his wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, in Lithuania. Tsikhanouski, who was arrested after planning to challenge President Alexander Lukashenko in the 2020 election, described his imprisonment as torture, citing isolation, denial of medical care, and insufficient food. He credited U.S. President Donald Trump with aiding his release and blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for supporting Lukashenko's regime. Despite his health issues, Tsikhanouski intends to resume his political activities and continue fighting for democratic change in Belarus, while supporting his wife's role as the leader of the Belarusian opposition.</p>

          <p>An NHS psychiatrist in Scotland is planning to establish a ketamine clinic at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital by the end of the year to treat severe depression. This initiative follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that offers ketamine-assisted therapy, and aims to provide an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for patients with hard-to-treat depression. Ketamine, while not officially licensed for depression treatment, has shown effectiveness in making patients more receptive to psychotherapy. Concerns exist regarding the potential for misuse and side effects, but proponents argue that the controlled clinical setting and lower doses mitigate these risks.</p>

          <p>The NATO summit in The Hague is expected to focus on increasing defense spending, a key demand of U.S. President Donald Trump, potentially marking a win for his administration. NATO countries are likely to commit to higher spending targets, driven by Secretary-General Mark Rutte's efforts and Germany's support. However, some European nations are hesitant about social cuts to fund new weapons, and there are concerns about the lack of focus on Ukraine's NATO aspirations. Despite these challenges, the summit aims to project a strong political alliance and deter Russia, though the declaration is expected to be concise to maintain Trump's interest.</p>

          <p>New York City will use ranked choice voting in its upcoming Democratic mayoral primary election, a system that allows voters to rank multiple candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the voters' second choices. The process continues until a candidate receives a majority. The system aims to ensure that the elected candidate has broad support, but it also introduces complexity and potential challenges for transparency and vote tabulation.</p>

          <p>The United States men's national soccer team defeated Haiti 2-1 to win their Concacaf Gold Cup group, despite a goalkeeping error. Patrick Agyemang scored the winning goal in the 75th minute after a tiebreaking goal. Malik Tillman put the US ahead early, but a botched clearance by goalkeeper Matt Freese allowed Haiti to equalize. The US, using a largely B team, had already secured a spot in the quarter-finals and will face Mexico or Costa Rica next weekend, marking their last competitive test before co-hosting the World Cup next year.</p>
