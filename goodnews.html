          <p>The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is celebrating its 10th anniversary, welcoming new leadership while navigating fresh challenges from the United States. Initially viewed with skepticism by the West, the bank has grown from 57 to 110 member economies, focusing on infrastructure over poverty reduction, a key difference from other development banks. Its president insists the AIIB aims to improve international practices and demonstrate that China can be a force for global peace and prosperity. Despite this, many in the West remain unconvinced, highlighting ongoing geopolitical and economic tensions.</p>

          <p>The UK government has paused immediate plans to alter cash Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) following significant opposition from banks, building societies, and consumer advocates. Chancellor Rachel Reeves was reportedly considering reducing the £20,000 tax-free allowance for cash savings to encourage more investment in stocks and shares to boost the economy. However, facing a potential backlash from savers, the Treasury has shelved the proposal for now, though future reforms have not been ruled out. The government still intends to promote investment through other means, such as educational programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Liverpool captain and England international Jordan Henderson is set to join Premier League club Brentford on a two-year contract. The 35-year-old midfielder is returning to English football after a brief stint with Dutch club Ajax, which agreed to terminate his contract a year early. The move is seen as a way for Henderson to maintain his position in the England squad ahead of the next World Cup. He is expected to fill the void left by former Brentford captain Christian Norgaard, who recently moved to Arsenal.</p>

          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Norway jumped 54% year-on-year in June, a stark contrast to the company's declining sales across much of Europe. The surge is largely attributed to the popularity of the revamped Model Y, which meets Norwegian demand for space, all-wheel drive, and value for money. This success comes despite a significant backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political activities, with a survey showing 43% of Norwegian EV drivers would not buy a Tesla for political reasons. Norway's strong pro-EV government policies continue to make it the world's most EV-friendly market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a major environmental effort, China has demolished approximately 300 dams and shut down hydropower stations along the Red River, a key tributary of the Yangtze. This action aims to restore natural water flows and save critical habitats for rare and endemic fish species. For decades, the dense network of dams has blocked fish migration routes, restricted water volumes, and degraded the ecosystem in what is considered a last refuge for biodiversity in the upper Yangtze. The project represents a significant shift in policy towards prioritizing ecological restoration over power generation in the region.</p>
