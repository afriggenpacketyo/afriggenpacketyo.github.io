          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the 'NVLink Fusion' program, allowing customers to use non-Nvidia CPUs and GPUs with Nvidia's NVLink, previously exclusive to Nvidia chips. This enables semi-custom AI infrastructure by combining Nvidia processors with different CPUs and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Partners like MediaTek and Qualcomm Technologies can now connect their CPUs with Nvidia's GPUs in AI data centers. According to an analyst, NVLink represents Nvidia's plans to capture a share of data centers based on ASICs, which have traditionally been seen as Nvidia competitors.</p>

          <p>President Trump threatened to cut federal funding for K-12 education in Maine after Gov. Janet Mills refused to follow an executive order banning transgender athletes from school sports. Maine schools rely heavily on federal dollars to support low-income students, special education, mental health services, and after-school programs. Federal funds account for 6-13% of school funding, supporting students from low-income families, English language learners, and students with disabilities.

Connelly mentions that 'The Lincoln Lawyer' books take the most time to write because he consults with lawyer friends to ensure accuracy. Connelly also states that he almost retired, but the opportunity to write about detectives like Ren√©e Ballard and Det. Sgt. Stilwell changed his mind. He is now working on another Stilwell story and is heavily involved with the television series, 'Ballard,' debuting in July.</p>

A key factor for round two could be voters who supported far-right candidates that were eliminated in the first round.
