          <p>A former software CEO, Mike Conner, has completed a challenging five-year, multi-million-pound renovation of Thorne Island, a derelict 19th-century Napoleonic fort off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales. After purchasing the historic, off-grid property in 2017, he overcame significant logistical hurdles, including the lack of running water and electricity, to transform it into a unique party and event space. The renovated fortress now features 40 beds, modern amenities, and even a nightclub. Conner, who described the project as a "midlife crisis," has now placed the fully restored island back on the market with a £3 million asking price.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With food prices rising, parents are adopting meticulous planning and creative cooking techniques to manage the increased cost of feeding children during the school summer holidays. Strategies include buying reduced "yellow-sticker" items to freeze for later, batch cooking meals, and organizing the fridge to ensure food with the nearest use-by date is used first. Some families also rely on community pantries that provide surplus food from supermarkets at a low cost. These methods help stretch household budgets at a time when expenses for childcare and activities are also high, and the subsidy of school meals is unavailable for many.</p>

          <p>The historic Hollywood Forever Cemetery has addressed the challenge of limited space by constructing a new, five-story vertical mausoleum. This modern structure, known as the Gower Mausoleum, provides permanent housing for approximately 13,000 people and offers views of Los Angeles landmarks. The cemetery, famous as the final resting place for numerous Hollywood legends, has evolved into a cultural venue hosting movie nights, festivals, and yoga classes. The mausoleum's design, featuring natural light and marble, aims to create a peaceful environment for visitors, reflecting the cemetery's effort to serve the needs of the living community as well as the deceased.</p>

          <p>A group of students preparing for their GCSE exams have opened time capsule letters they wrote to their future selves as 11-year-olds in 2021, just after returning to school from a COVID-19 lockdown. The letters reveal their younger perspectives, with questions about girlfriends, hopes for university, and reflections on the strangeness of pandemic life. The exercise, organized by a teacher to instill motivation during a difficult period, served as a poignant reminder of their personal growth and resilience. Their entire secondary education was shaped by the pandemic, from remote learning to returning to school in restrictive 'bubbles'.</p>

          <p>A new wave of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding globally, introducing international diners to a wide variety of authentic regional cuisines far beyond standard Westernized fare. Brands are finding success by first establishing themselves in diverse markets like Singapore before expanding further into Asia, North America, and Europe. These restaurants aim to showcase the vast culinary diversity of China, from the spicy dishes of Hunan to the savory soups of Zhejiang. This culinary expansion is seen by some as a form of "ping-pong diplomacy," potentially serving as an effective tool for Chinese soft power by correcting outdated stereotypes and fostering cultural appreciation.</p>

          <p>A new collection titled "Sunset Boulevard" documents the music Elvis Presley recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975, capturing his final burst of studio creativity. The set includes his last top 10 hit, "Burning Love," and soulful ballads like "Separate Ways," recorded during the collapse of his marriage. The article recounts how Presley's disappointment over losing a role in the film "A Star Is Born" opposite Barbra Streisand in 1975 may have contributed to a career decline before his death in 1977. The recordings showcase a mature artist, removed from the rock culture he helped create, but deeply expressive as a ballad singer.</p>

          <h2>Samsung Gains U.S. Market Share on Apple as Foldable Phones Prove Popular</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Samsung is successfully challenging Apple's dominance in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's declined. This shift is partly driven by the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold 7, which offer new form factors that appeal to consumers. While Apple remains the market leader, Samsung's wider range of products at various price points and its experimentation with new designs are creating significant competition. Analysts suggest Apple may release its own foldable iPhone by 2026 to counter Samsung's momentum in the premium device category. (not investment advice)</p>
