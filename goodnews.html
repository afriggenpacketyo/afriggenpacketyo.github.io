          <p>Costco has partnered with drug manufacturer Novo Nordisk to sell GLP-1 weight-loss medications, including Ozempic and Wegovy, to its members at a significantly reduced cost. The program allows members with a valid prescription who are paying out-of-pocket to purchase a four-week supply for $499, roughly half the typical price. This initiative aims to provide access to authentic versions of the high-demand drugs, countering the trend of consumers turning to cheaper, unregulated compounded alternatives. The move could substantially increase the accessibility of these medications for Americans.</p>

          <p>After two decades of meticulous restoration work led by a Japanese team, the tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep III has been opened to the public in Luxor, Egypt. The site, one of the largest in the Valley of the Kings, dates back over 3,000 years and had suffered severe deterioration before the extensive conservation project began. The tomb features a long, sloping passageway and chambers decorated with exquisite wall paintings from the Eighteenth Dynasty. Officials praised the restoration, which involved over 260 specialists, for adhering to the highest international standards.</p>

Manager Thomas Frank and pundits like Wayne Rooney have praised Kudus for his creativity, dribbling skill, and overall impact on the team's offense.

After being left off the wild-card series roster, the future Hall of Famer's return is expected to bolster the team's bullpen with a steady, experienced presence. The move provides crucial left-handed pitching depth needed to face the Phillies' lineup. This series could mark Kershaw's final postseason appearance, as he is expected to retire after this season, adding a significant emotional element to his inclusion.</p>

          <h2>US Stock Markets Reach New Highs Amid Government Shutdown as Healthcare and Tech Sectors Lead</h2>

          <p>Despite the ongoing federal government shutdown, U.S. stock markets continued their rally this week, with the S&P 500 achieving another record high. The market appears to have dismissed the shutdown as a "non-event," focusing instead on positive sector performance. Healthcare stocks surged following a deal exempting Pfizer from certain tariffs, while the technology sector continued to benefit from the artificial intelligence trade, boosting companies like Nvidia. The Investing Club notes it has been actively managing its portfolio, purchasing shares in companies like Nike and Boeing while trimming its position in Bristol Myers Squibb.

          <h2>Financial Analysts Suggest US Investors May Be Overly Concentrated in Domestic Markets</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 11:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Some financial experts are advising that U.S. investors should consider increasing their exposure to international markets, despite record highs in domestic stock indices. Dave Nadig of ETF.com noted that "home bias is about as bad as it's ever been," suggesting that American portfolios are too heavily weighted in U.S. assets. The argument is that better value and growth opportunities may be found abroad, particularly in emerging markets. For example, countries like India are highlighted for their large populations, favorable demographics, and rapid economic growth, mirroring the trajectory China experienced over the last two decades.

          <p>A civil rights alliance has called off days of violent protests in Pakistan-administered Kashmir after reaching an agreement with Pakistani authorities. The demonstrations, which resulted in at least 10 deaths, were sparked by demands for cheaper wheat, reduced electricity tariffs, and an end to lavish benefits for the political elite. Under the new deal, the government has agreed to these demands and pledged to improve public services. The alliance's leader has urged protesters to disperse, expressing gratitude to the Pakistani Prime Minister for addressing their concerns and helping to restore peace.</p>

          <p>Markeiz Ryan, a 36-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran, has relocated to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where he lives a comfortable life on an income of roughly $4,000 per month. His income is sourced from VA disability benefits, the GI Bill, and teaching English. Ryan pays $850 a month for a two-bedroom apartment in one of the city's tallest residential towers, a fraction of what comparable housing would cost in the U.S. He says the move has dramatically improved his mental health and motivation, allowing him to escape the "survival mode" he felt in America and focus on personal happiness and growth.</p>

          <p>David Risher, the current CEO of Lyft, shared the story of how he was persuaded to leave a stable management role at Microsoft in 1996 to join a small online bookstore called Amazon. He recalled that even Bill Gates thought it was a "stupid decision" at the time. However, Risher was won over by Jeff Bezos's obsession with the customer experience and his bold prediction that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by the year 2000. Risher found the opportunity to be part of such rapid, groundbreaking growth too compelling to pass up, becoming a key figure in Amazon's expansion.</p>

          <p>A child life specialist and therapist advises new parents to create an email address for their children shortly after birth.
