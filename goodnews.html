          <p>Lando Norris of McLaren emerged victorious in a dramatic Miami Grand Prix sprint race, capitalizing on a timely safety car deployment. Oscar Piastri, Norris's teammate, initially led after overtaking Kimi Antonelli, but the safety car period allowed Norris to pit for slick tires and gain the lead. Max Verstappen faced a challenging race, finishing fourth but receiving a 10-second penalty for an unsafe pit release that damaged Antonelli's car. The race was marked by a crash involving Fernando Alonso and Liam Lawson, contributing to the overall chaos of the wet-dry conditions.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, 94, has announced he will retire as chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year, handing over the reins to Vice-Chairman Greg Abel.

Mr Abel, sitting next to Mr Buffett on stage, was apparently caught unaware by the announcement. Mr Buffett handpicked Mr Abel as his successor four years ago but gave no indication at the time that he would retire.</p>
