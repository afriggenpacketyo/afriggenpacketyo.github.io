          <p>President Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced the framework of a trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K., aiming to boost trade and create jobs. While the 10% tariff on U.K. imports remains, the agreement includes increased access for U.S. agricultural products and reduced non-tariff barriers. The deal, described as a win for both countries, allows the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by British automakers to be subject to the 10% rate, with additional vehicles facing higher rates. Rolls Royce engines will be exempt from tariffs, and a British airline will purchase $10 billion in Boeing planes.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has granted refugee status to 54 Afrikaners, white descendants of Dutch colonizers from South Africa, who are expected to arrive in the U.S. The decision follows President Trump's executive order prioritizing humanitarian relief for Afrikaners facing racial discrimination. These individuals have been given P1 refugee status, granting them a pathway to U.S. citizenship and government benefits. Trump, along with figures like Elon Musk and Marco Rubio, has voiced concerns over the alleged persecution of Afrikaners in South Africa, while the South African government has dismissed these claims.</p>

          <p>A Southern California Edison transmission tower, being removed as part of an investigation into the Eaton fire, was damaged when it contacted power lines during a helicopter lift. No injuries were reported, but the extent of the damage and its impact on the investigation are still being assessed. The tower was being transported to a warehouse for testing, as investigators explore induction as a possible cause of the fire. This incident occurred after the successful removal of another tower from the suspected ignition point.</p>

          <p>India is considering eliminating tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S., signaling a significant shift in its trade policy. This move comes after the U.S. imposed tariffs on Indian exports, pushing India to rethink its protectionist stance. A trade deal with the U.S. could boost India's economic growth and attract foreign investment. Experts suggest that certain sectors, such as logistics and consumer staples, could benefit from a deal, while others may face challenges.</p>

          <p>Alex Ross Perry's experimental documentary, "Pavements," explores the essence of the '90s indie-rock band Pavement through multiple angles, including tour footage, a stage musical, an art gallery, and a parody biopic. The film aims to capture the band's era-defining greatness, even though they never achieved mainstream success. Perry combines the tour footage with events such as a Pavement museum and a faux-Hollywood biopic. The film's unorthodox approach is tailored to those who appreciate the band's creative unruliness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Camogie Association's enforced skort rule has ignited a debate over sexism and player comfort, with county and club teams mounting pressure to allow players the choice between skorts and shorts. Former Antrim camogie All-Star Jane Adams has criticized the rule as discriminatory and urged the association to change it. A Gaelic Players Association survey highlighted that 70% of players experienced discomfort while wearing the skort, and 83% wanted the option to wear shorts. The Camogie Association has called a Special Congress for May 22 to vote on the issue.</p>
