          <h2>A Comparison of Financial Aid for Ukrainian Refugees Across European Nations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 13:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate in Germany over reducing welfare for Ukrainian refugees highlights the significant disparities in aid across Europe. Germany currently provides generous support, including a monthly stipend of €563 for single adults plus housing and health insurance costs, placing it among the most supportive nations. In contrast, countries like Poland offer access to services but no monthly payments, while Hungary has tightened its eligibility criteria. Belgium offers the highest monthly assistance in the EU at around €1,100, demonstrating the lack of a standardized approach to refugee support within the bloc.</p>

          <p>Coterra Energy reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by higher-than-expected production volumes. The company is navigating a difficult market with declining oil and natural gas prices, as well as addressing operational issues with excessive water levels in some of its Texas wells. Despite the positive quarterly results, the company's stock performance has lagged this year. Management reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining consistent drilling activity and announced a new long-term natural gas supply agreement for a power plant in the Permian Basin.

The California Department of Fish and Wildlife rescued the cubs and transported them to the facility, which is one of the few in the region equipped for their rehabilitation. A third cub was also rescued but had to be euthanized due to a severe congenital deformity and an embedded BB pellet in its paw. The two surviving male cubs are recuperating in a large outdoor enclosure until they are ready to be released back into the wild.</p>

Throughout its long mission, Curiosity has been instrumental in making numerous scientific discoveries and observations about the Red Planet's geology and past environment. The mission continues to provide valuable data, expanding our understanding of Mars and its potential to have once supported life, with this article highlighting its journey through a series of photographs.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has released gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, its first open-weight language models since 2019, designed to compete with offerings from Meta and Mistral. These models provide developers and researchers with more affordable and customizable AI options, as their parameters are publicly available. The company collaborated with hardware makers like Nvidia and AMD to ensure broad compatibility and conducted extensive safety testing to mitigate misuse. The models, available under an Apache 2.0 license, can run on a range of hardware from laptops to cloud servers, aiming to democratize access to advanced AI technology.</p>

          <p>NASA's interim head has directed the agency to accelerate plans to deploy a small nuclear reactor on the moon by late 2029, aiming to establish a presence before China and Russia. The directive warns that the first nation to deploy a lunar reactor could establish a "keep-out zone," hindering U.S. Artemis missions. The Fission Surface Power program will seek proposals for a microreactor capable of generating at least 100 kilowatts of electricity. This ambitious timeline comes as the Trump administration has proposed budget cuts for NASA and the agency operates without a Senate-confirmed leader.</p>

          <p>High-grade U.S. corporations are increasingly using equity and cash to fund mergers and acquisitions this year, moving away from debt.

With strong corporate earnings and healthy cash flows, financing deals with stock has become more attractive. This shift could result in lower-than-expected issuance of investment-grade bonds for the year, as companies prioritize maintaining their credit ratings and leveraging high stock valuations for large transactions.

The deal for the fourth-year pro reportedly includes approximately $23 million in guaranteed money. Williams, a fifth-round draft pick in 2022, has been a vital part of the Rams' offense, rushing for over 1,100 yards in each of the last two seasons. The extension marks the first for a Rams running back since Todd Gurley's record-setting deal in 2018 and ensures Williams will remain a central figure alongside quarterback Matthew Stafford.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's dismissal of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner over downward revisions to jobs numbers, experts clarify that such adjustments are a normal part of the process. The BLS issues preliminary reports based on initial survey responses to provide timely data, then revises them as more complete information becomes available from businesses and households. Former officials and economists note that while the recent 258,000-job downward revision for May and June was large, it is not evidence of manipulation but rather a reflection of a standard procedure designed to improve accuracy over time.</p>
