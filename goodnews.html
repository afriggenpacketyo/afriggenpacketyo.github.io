          <p>House Republicans are proposing a bill to invest $1,000 on behalf of every American baby born between January 1, 2025, and January 1, 2029, into accounts initially called "MAGA accounts" but later renamed "Trump accounts." The funds would be invested in financial markets, and proceeds could be withdrawn later for expenses like college or buying a house. Tax experts have raised questions about the accounts, noting that contributions would be made with post-tax income, and gains would also be taxed upon withdrawal, making them similar to typical investment accounts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally, hitting a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. The price rise occurred despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, suggesting investors are seeking alternative stores of value. Broader macro concerns, including Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, have also contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a notable bitcoin skeptic, said that the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is considering reusing soil removed from areas around the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on the premises of the prime minister's office and other government agencies. This move aims to set a precedent for soil recycling outside Fukushima Prefecture, following opposition to demonstration projects in Tokyo and its vicinity. The soil, deemed safe by the Environment Ministry, would likely be used for flowerbeds and other landscaping purposes.</p>

          <p>Scientists are exploring a novel method to track the world's biodiversity by collecting and analyzing DNA from the air. Researchers have found that air quality monitoring stations, which continuously draw air across filter paper, also capture airborne DNA from various organisms. This approach could allow for a standardized, scalable, and cost-effective monitoring system to track biodiversity changes at a national or even global level, offering insights into species distribution, conservation efforts, and environmental impacts.</p>
