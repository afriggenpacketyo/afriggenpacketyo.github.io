          <p>Brock Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers have reportedly agreed to a five-year, $265 million contract extension, with $181 million guaranteed, solidifying Purdy's position as the team's franchise quarterback. Purdy, who was the final pick of the 2022 NFL draft, has exceeded expectations, leading the 49ers to consecutive playoff appearances, including a Super Bowl trip in 2024. Despite an injury-riddled 2024 season, Purdy maintained strong statistics, and his new contract places him among the highest-paid quarterbacks in the NFL, reflecting the 49ers' long-term commitment to him.</p>

          <p>A new CDC study estimates that hundreds of lives could be saved annually through increased use of life jackets and better pool fencing. The modeling found that 51 drowning deaths could be prevented by adequate pool fencing, and 297 could be averted by wearing life jackets during boating accidents. This study was one of the last produced by the agency's injury prevention experts before layoffs eliminated the drowning prevention research team, along with staff responsible for rape prevention, traumatic brain injury research, and a database on injuries.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic reports that after a significant increase in crime starting in 2020, the United States is now experiencing a decline in crime rates. Although final statistics are not yet available, experts suggest that 2024 may have seen the steepest fall in the murder rate, with 2025 showing further improvement. Real-time data indicates a substantial decrease in murder, violent crime, and property crime. The article explores the challenges of reporting on crime due to the lack of timely statistics and the complex factors driving changes in crime rates, while cautioning against policy choices that could reverse these positive trends.</p>

The World Bank is now planning to reengage with Syria, with the first project focused on improving access to electricity, a critical need in the country following years of conflict and infrastructure damage.</p>
