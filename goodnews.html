          <p>Shares of Inditex, the parent company of fashion retailer Zara, surged nearly 6% after it reported a significant acceleration in sales for its new Autumn/Winter collections. The company announced that sales between August 1 and September 7 jumped 9% year-on-year, reassuring investors after its second-quarter performance was weaker than anticipated. This positive report contributed to a broader uplift in European stocks, as markets also processed global trade news and awaited key inflation data from the United States. Analysts noted the report demonstrated a meaningful improvement in the company's trading momentum heading into the third quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cambodia's Deputy Prime Minister, Sun Chanthol, has publicly rejected the characterization of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as a 'debt trap' for developing nations. Speaking at a summit in Hong Kong, he asserted that Chinese-funded infrastructure projects, including roads, an airport, and an expressway, have been a significant boon to his country's economic development. His comments align with Chinese President Xi Jinping's recent pledge to continue building an 'open world economy.' The BRI is a global infrastructure strategy adopted by the Chinese government to invest in numerous countries and international organizations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the United States' long-held position as a global leader in innovation is under threat due to a decline in federal research funding, diminished support for education, and political attacks on free inquiry. The authors contend that the system of public-private partnerships that fueled past successes is being dismantled, while competitors like China are heavily investing in deep research. To reverse this trend, the article calls for decisive, bipartisan action, including restoring long-term research funding, revamping small business financing, and shielding universities from political interference. It warns that America's competitive edge cannot be taken for granted.</p>

          <p>A columnist shares a personal story about her dog's encounter with a rabid bat to highlight the critical importance of vaccinations in modern society. The incident prompted a quarantine for her dog and a local public health alert, serving as a stark reminder that deadly diseases like rabies still exist. The author reflects on how the success of vaccines has created a false sense of security, leading many to forget the dangers they prevent. She argues that this forgetfulness contributes to the rise of anti-vaccine sentiment and underscores the value of the scientific advancements that protect both pets and people from once-common fatal threats.</p>

          <p>Pioneertown, a California high desert community originally founded in the 1940s as a permanent movie set for Western films, is undergoing a modern renaissance. Once a quiet tourist curiosity, the town now boasts a growing number of locally-run shops, restaurants, and attractions, transforming the 'fake' western town into a genuine community with its own distinct identity. New management at the landmark Pappy & Harriet's venue has improved community relations, while businesses like the Red Dog Saloon and the Pioneertown Motel offer stable local employment. This evolution provides visitors with a richer experience while preserving the town's unique historical character.</p>

          <p>This article provides a step-by-step guide to properly shucking oysters, featuring advice from Ari Kolender, owner of two popular Los Angeles seafood restaurants. The key to successful shucking, Kolender explains, is not brute force but rather using leverage to pry open the oyster's hinge. He details the anatomy of an oyster, the correct way to use a kitchen towel for safety, and the technique of using a rocking motion with the knife to open the shell. The guide also covers how to cleanly sever the adductor muscle to free the oyster meat, ensuring a perfect presentation for serving.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition at the Getty Villa, 'The Kingdom of Pylos: Warrior-Princes of Ancient Greece,' showcases remarkable artifacts from the late Bronze Age, with a tiny seal stone stealing the show. The 'Pylos Combat Agate,' just over an inch long, features an exquisitely detailed battle scene that upends conventional timelines for ancient Greek art, suggesting the use of magnifying lenses 3,500 years ago. The exhibit centers on the tomb of the 'Griffin Warrior,' a wealthy, unidentified aristocrat whose burial site was discovered intact a decade ago. The show offers a glimpse into the art, life, and burial practices of this ancient kingdom.</p>

The annual event involves decorating a nearly mile-long stretch of deodar cedars with lights, a task that relies on more than 100 volunteers over several weekends. Organizers say they have been inundated with offers to help from across Southern California, demonstrating the community's resilience. The story highlights the dedication of longtime volunteers, including the event's Santa Claus, who lost his home but remains committed to preserving the beloved local tradition.</p>

          <p>Morningstar has introduced a new benchmark, the Modern Market 100 Index, designed to track the performance of both publicly traded stocks and venture-backed private companies. The index combines 90 of the largest U.S. public firms with 10 major private companies like SpaceX and OpenAI, reflecting a modern investment landscape where many high-growth firms are staying private longer. This initiative aims to provide investors with a framework to benchmark performance across these two asset classes. The index's one-year return of 28.2% outpaced the S&P 500's 20% gain over the same period, highlighting the potential of this combined approach. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook while her lawsuit challenging the removal proceeds. The judge ruled that Cook has a strong case that her termination violates the Federal Reserve Act's 'for cause' provision, which the court interpreted as applying to conduct during a governor's time in office, not before. Trump had moved to fire Cook based on allegations of mortgage fraud related to documents signed before she joined the Fed. The ruling is a significant development in the unprecedented legal battle over the central bank's independence from political interference.</p>

          <h2>UK Regulator Proposes Removing Limit on Contactless Card Payments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 05:24:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed removing the £100 limit on contactless card payments, potentially allowing for unlimited transactions with a single tap. The plan would permit banks and card providers to set their own limits, bringing card payments in line with digital wallets on smartphones, which already have no cap. While the move is intended to reduce 'payment friction' and reflect modern spending habits, it has raised concerns about increased fraud and theft. The FCA stated that providers would be responsible for fraud losses and would only permit higher-value payments for transactions deemed low-risk.</p>
