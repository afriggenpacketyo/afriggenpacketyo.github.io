        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Paris St-Germain head coach Luis Enrique made a significant decision by replacing star goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma with newly signed Lucas Chevalier for the Super Cup final. This strategic move reflects a shift towards a modern goalkeeper who is more skilled with ball distribution, a key element of Enrique's playstyle. Despite Donnarumma's crucial role in their Champions League victory, the club is prioritizing a different profile in Chevalier, who is noted for his on-ball ability. Chevalier's debut included a key penalty save in the shootout win against Tottenham after a 2-2 draw.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift has officially announced her 12th studio album, titled "The Life of a Showgirl," which is set for release on October 3. The announcement followed a countdown on her website and intense fan speculation, fueled by social media teases from her marketing team and her boyfriend Travis Kelce's podcast. This album marks her first new release since she successfully regained control of her entire music catalog by repurchasing it from a private equity firm. The release continues a period of immense productivity and success for Swift, following her record-breaking tour and multiple Grammy wins.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive study suggests that drug treatments for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) offer significant life benefits beyond managing core symptoms. Researchers found that medication is associated with reduced risks of substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminal activity. The study, which analyzed over 148,000 people in Sweden, provides strong evidence that by mitigating impulsivity and inattention, ADHD drugs can help prevent adverse life events. These findings could help patients and doctors make more informed decisions about starting medication, despite ongoing debates about side effects and drug shortages.</p>

          <p>In response to potential U.S. restrictions on China's shipbuilding industry, South Korean firms are increasing their investments in Southeast Asian nations like the Philippines. This strategic shift is seen as a way to overcome domestic constraints such as labor shortages and high costs, thereby enhancing their competitiveness against Chinese rivals. HD Hyundai plans to invest $550 million to revive a defunct shipyard in the Philippines, aiming to build up to 10 vessels annually and create 7,000 jobs. Analysts note that while this move could be a long-term solution, improving worker skills will take time.</p>

          <p>As trust shifts from traditional media institutions to individual online creators, a new class of "evidence-based creators" is emerging to combat misinformation. These journalists and specialists use expertise and reliable sources to provide factual context on platforms like Instagram and TikTok, where falsehoods often go viral. However, they face an uphill battle in an attention economy that rewards virality over veracity. This article argues for building new infrastructure, such as a certification system and collaborative frameworks, to support these trusted voices and help audiences navigate the complex and often misleading digital information ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Brinker International, the parent company of Chili's, has seen significant growth, which its CEO credits to a substantial increase in marketing efforts. The company boosted its marketing budget from $32 million to $137 million over three years, leading to a 23.7% rise in same-store sales at Chili's. The strategy has included leveraging social media influencers and standardizing a popular $10.99 value meal across the country. This growth-focused approach is helping the company combat inflationary pressures on labor and goods, allowing it to improve margins by leveraging fixed costs rather than cutting expenses.</p>

          <p>Stargazers across the U.S. East Coast were treated to a mysterious and dazzling light show featuring spirals in the night sky. The phenomenon was observed in numerous states and was quickly identified by astrophysicists as the result of recent rocket launches. The primary cause was the upper stage of an Ariane 6 rocket, which was tumbling while venting leftover fuel after deploying its satellite payload. The perfect spiral shape is created when sunlight reflects off the frozen fuel plume in the vacuum of space, providing a spectacular, if temporary, sight for those looking up.</p>

          <p>Record-level flooding from a glacial outburst near Juneau, Alaska, was largely contained by newly installed temporary barriers, preventing the widespread damage seen in previous years. The Mendenhall River crested at a new record high after an ice dam at the Mendenhall Glacier released a massive surge of water from Suicide Basin. While some water pooled on streets, officials reported that the system of reinforced barriers, or Hesco bags, effectively protected hundreds of homes that would have otherwise been flooded. The event highlights both the increasing severity of climate-change-related floods and the effectiveness of proactive mitigation efforts.</p>

The group includes leaders from cartels like Jalisco New Generation (CJNG) and the Sinaloa Cartel, who are wanted for crimes including drug trafficking and murder. This move is part of an increased effort by the new Mexican administration to crack down on powerful criminal networks amid pressure from the Trump administration.

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams have seen their franchise valuation soar to $10.43 billion, making them the second most valuable team in the NFL, behind only the Dallas Cowboys. This marks a dramatic turnaround from a decade ago when the team, then in St. Louis, was valued at just $930 million. The increase is largely attributed to owner Stan Kroenke's vision and investment in the state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium and the surrounding Hollywood Park district. The valuation reflects the team's successful monetization of its new venue and its strong position in the major Los Angeles market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An appeals court has denied Tory Lanez's attempt to submit new evidence in his case concerning the 2020 shooting of fellow artist Megan Thee Stallion. Lanez, who is currently serving a 10-year prison sentence, sought to introduce a new statement from a security guard, but the petition was rejected. This is the latest failed effort by the rapper to challenge his 2022 felony conviction for assault with a firearm and other charges. The court's decision upholds the previous legal proceedings, and Lanez's main appeal is scheduled for oral argument later in the month.</p>
