          <p>Chile and Google have signed an agreement to install the first-ever submarine fiber optic cable connecting South America to Asia and Oceania by 2027, known as the "Humboldt Project." The 14,800-kilometer cable will run from Valparaiso, Chile, to Sydney, Australia, via French Polynesia, offering a faster alternative to existing connections through the U.S. The project aims to improve connectivity for Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil, with Google investing between $300 million and $550 million, and the Chilean government contributing $25 million. The new cable will also reduce signal latency, benefiting telemedicine and other fields.</p>

          <p>Italians are participating in a referendum that includes a proposal to halve the legal residency requirement for non-EU adult foreigners to apply for Italian citizenship, from 10 to five years. The referendum bypasses parliament and puts the question directly in the hands of the people, offering a chance to make the country's bureaucracy slightly more benevolent. Prime Minister Meloni and several ministers are discouraging participation, hoping the referendum will not reach quorum. A successful vote would recognize the dignity and diversity of millions of residents and enrich Italy's national story.</p>

          <p>The Washington Department of Natural Resources used a firefighting helicopter to remove abandoned boats from Squaxin Island, an uninhabited island in Puget Sound. The operation, funded by a federal grant, removed 14 vessels, the agency's largest operation of its kind. The state agency opts to airlift boats when towing them would disrupt the marine bed or surrounding environment. The program has removed over 1,200 derelict vessels since 2002, addressing the challenge of people dumping old boats into the water.</p>

          <p>Palisades Charter High School held its graduation ceremony at the Hollywood Bowl after the Palisades fire damaged their high school stadium. The event, which hosted 740 graduating seniors, was bittersweet, as students honored the new venue but missed their beloved Stadium by the Sea. Steve Kerr and Billy Crystal spoke at the graduation, reflecting on the students' resilience in the face of tragedy. The Hollywood Bowl was gifted to the high school by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and the event served as a capstone illustrating the students' perseverance.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of feather fossils found trapped in Burmese amber has shed new light on the evolution of flight feathers, an essential step that allowed early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. Researchers conducted a detailed structural study of feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period. They found that an essential feature of the evolution of birds was the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift. Modern birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs, though most feathered dinosaurs did not have the same ability to fly.</p>

          <p>The first bacteria our bodies meet ‚Äì in the hours after we're born ‚Äì could protect us from dangerous infections, UK scientists say. They have shown, for the first time, that good bacteria seem to halve the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute investigated the earliest stages in our body's colonization by bacteria, fungi and more. They collected stool samples from 1,082 newborns in the first week of life.</p>
