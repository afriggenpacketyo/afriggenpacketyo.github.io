          <p>BeOne Medicines, a global drug company with mainland China origins, plans to launch more cancer drugs in Hong Kong and expand its Guangzhou production to capitalize on the region's recent drug-approval reforms. The company has already introduced three cancer medications and aims to seek approval for additional medical indications by year-end. This strategic expansion includes supplying Hong Kong from its Guangzhou facility, which produces large molecule therapies like PD-1 inhibitors, and maintaining supply from its Suzhou plant for small-molecule drugs. The initiative signifies a concerted effort to tap into greater market opportunities and enhance access to critical cancer treatments in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has canceled plans to deploy federal troops to San Francisco for an immigration crackdown, following widespread condemnation from California leaders and public protests. The decision came after discussions with Mayor Daniel Lurie and Silicon Valley leaders, including Marc Benioff. Governor Gavin Newsom and other local officials had vowed legal challenges, criticizing Trump's actions as dictatorial. While the immediate threat of a federal surge in San Francisco has receded, uncertainty remains about potential deployments in other Bay Area cities. Local leaders and community groups are continuing to mobilize rapid response networks and legal aid for residents, emphasizing preparedness and power in the face of potential future federal enforcement.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton has cautioned McLaren's Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris about Max Verstappen's "cut-throat" character as they head into the final five races of the Formula 1 season. Piastri currently leads the championship by 14 points, but Verstappen has rapidly closed the gap with three wins and a second place in recent races. Hamilton, drawing on his own intense 2021 battle with Verstappen, emphasized that the McLaren drivers must be equally ruthless and consistent to hold off the Red Bull driver, who benefits from being the hunter. This sets the stage for a highly competitive and high-pressure conclusion to the championship, with all three drivers vying for the ultimate score.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Attorney for Maryland has reportedly informed Department of Justice superiors that she does not believe there is sufficient evidence to criminally charge Senator Adam Schiff with mortgage fraud. This development comes despite President Donald Trump's public calls for the indictment of his staunch critic, who acted as prosecutor in Trump's first impeachment trial. MSNBC, citing sources, reported that prosecutor Kelly Hayes conveyed her assessment to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, though a controversial senior DOJ official is allegedly pressing to continue the investigation. Schiff's lawyer called the "politically-motivated allegations" baseless and a "transparently vindictive effort" to silence the senator, emphasizing the lack of merit in the ongoing probe.</p>

          <p>Industry experts believe increased collaboration between Hong Kong and mainland China could significantly advance the cryptocurrency sector, despite the mainland's years-long ban on most crypto-related activities. Hong Kong is recognized for its leading crypto regulation and role as a major international financial hub, while mainland developers excel in digital payments and artificial intelligence. Cyberport, a Hong Kong government-backed tech hub, aims for closer work with the mainland to foster Web3 development. Solana Foundation's president also highlighted substantial investments in China's developer ecosystem, emphasizing the potential for growth in areas like decentralized payments and AI within Chinese-speaking regions.</p>

Manager Dave Roberts and veteran players emphasize that this mentality is "in their DNA," allowing them to navigate an arduous season and a dominant postseason run to the Fall Classic. This internal culture of sustained winning and high expectations, coupled with significant star talent acquisitions, has become a defining characteristic of the franchise's impressive and consistent success.</p>

          <p>Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has stated the company will not develop artificial intelligence services that provide "simulated erotica," drawing a clear distinction from longtime partner OpenAI's recent stance on allowing such use.

This announcement highlights Microsoft's ethical guidelines for AI development, focusing on building AI for people rather than creating human-like entities.

          <p>A U.S. appeals court for veterans claims has unanimously rejected the Trump administration's attempt to delay rulings on disability benefits for veterans during the ongoing government shutdown. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins had requested a halt to nearly all cases, citing funding lapses that could prevent the VA from meeting deadlines. However, the court, led by a Trump appointee, deemed the request "significant and extreme," stating the administration failed to justify such sweeping relief. Veterans groups lauded the decision, arguing the VA was using the shutdown as a pretext to deny benefits to veterans, some of whom have waited decades for their claims.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Los Angeles has issued a tentative ruling ordering the government to ensure immigrant detainees have access to legal counsel at a downtown processing center. This injunction extends a previous temporary restraining order, addressing concerns about inhumane conditions, including lack of beds and heat, and systematic denial of Fifth Amendment rights during immigration raids. Government attorneys argued conditions had normalized, but the judge noted past violations, causing concern. The ruling is a significant victory for immigrant rights advocates, who emphasize the ongoing need for vigilance to ensure detained individuals receive their constitutional right to legal representation, despite previous Supreme Court setbacks on other aspects of the case.</p>
