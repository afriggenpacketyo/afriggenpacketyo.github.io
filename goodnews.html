          <p>According to a Fox News opinion piece, Jack Blanchard of Politico's Playbook noted President Trump's accessibility to the press, contrasting it with former President Biden's more sheltered approach. The article asserts that while journalists may criticize Trump's answers, his public availability allows voters to see his positions. The author argues that the media often attacks Trump while excusing Biden's lack of press engagement, suggesting a partisan bias. The article concludes by criticizing media figures for labeling any attempt by Trump to respond to criticism as authoritarian.</p>
