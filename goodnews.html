          <p>The UK government has introduced new guidance for baby food manufacturers, mandating reductions in sugar and salt content and prohibiting the promotion of snacks for infants under one year old. Companies are given an 18-month deadline to comply or face potential action, a move that follows a BBC investigation revealing high sugar levels and misleading marketing in popular products. Health campaigners have welcomed the guidelines, which also restrict unsubstantiated health claims, though some critics note the rules are voluntary and may be open to exploitation.</p>

He highlighted the company's success in attracting shoppers with low prices and absorbing tariffs, suggesting investors should be more optimistic about its performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Automaker Stellantis has unveiled the redesigned 2026 Jeep Cherokee, featuring the brand's first hybrid system in North America, as part of an effort to reverse six consecutive years of declining sales. The new model, which was discontinued in 2023, is larger, has more cargo space, and incorporates a 1.6-liter turbo-four hybrid powertrain. This relaunch is a key strategy for new Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa to regain market share for the Jeep brand, which has been facing headwinds from sales declines and tariffs.</p>

          <p>Aberdeen midfielder Dante Polvara made a significant impact in a Europa League match against FCSB, scoring a crucial goal just minutes after coming on as a substitute to help his team secure a 2-2 draw. The American's performance has intensified calls from fans and pundits for him to receive more playing time, especially amid rumors of a potential transfer to Hibernian. Despite being a fan favorite for his versatile and energetic displays, Polvara has been used sparingly by manager Jimmy Thelin, creating uncertainty about his future at the Scottish club.</p>

          <p>China is amending its 28-year-old pricing law to address what is known as "involution," a term for hyper-competitive, often loss-making price wars that have plagued industries like solar panel manufacturing. The revision, currently open for public feedback, aims to curb practices where companies aggressively slash prices on homogenized products to gain market share, leading to substantial industry-wide losses. Businesses affected by this destructive competition have expressed support for tighter regulations, hoping to establish a more sustainable market equilibrium and shift focus from price to product quality.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace achieved a historic first-ever win in European competition, defeating Fredrikstad 1-0 in a UEFA Conference League play-off, marking their return to continental football after nearly three decades.

The club now faces the challenge of reinvesting in the squad to build on their recent FA Cup and Community Shield successes while navigating a new European campaign.</p>

He also noted pressure in the higher education sector, partly due to President Trump's executive order to shut down the Department of Education, which creates uncertainty for university funding.

          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is gaining traction among wealthy investors, allowing them to transform highly appreciated stocks into shares of a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) without immediately triggering capital gains taxes. This process involves seeding a new ETF with existing assets, effectively deferring the tax liability until the ETF shares are sold. While the strategy can be highly effective for managing large taxable gains, it is subject to strict diversification rules and can limit an investor's future flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>
