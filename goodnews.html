        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump pressured House Republicans to unify around a sweeping budget bill, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," aimed at advancing his domestic agenda. The New York Times article details the intense negotiations and internal rifts among Republicans, with various factions demanding changes related to Medicaid, state and local tax deductions (SALT), and overall spending levels. Despite Trump's efforts to rally support and Speaker Johnson's attempts to broker compromises, significant divisions remain, threatening the bill's passage. The article underscores the challenges of balancing competing interests within the Republican party while adhering to Trump's policy priorities.</p>

          <p>Four British former special forces soldiers have made history by climbing Mount Everest in under five days without acclimatizing on the mountain, using a controversial method aided by xenon gas. The team, including a UK government minister, pre-acclimatized to low oxygen levels at high altitudes using xenon, enabling a significantly faster ascent compared to the typical six to eight weeks. While the science behind xenon's effectiveness is disputed, the expedition's organizer claims it helps protect the body from altitude sickness. This record ascent has drawn criticism from some in the mountaineering industry, who question the reliance on artificial aids.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's approach to the Middle East has been marked by leveraging the American private sector as an instrument of national power and navigating regional politics with less constraint from domestic concerns. The Atlantic article suggests that Trump's focus on commercial partnerships and his willingness to engage with various actors, including those traditionally at odds with the U.S., have been successful in some respects. By prioritizing economic interests and avoiding lectures on internal affairs, Trump has resonated with Gulf states seeking to diversify their economies. However, the article cautions that Trump must balance economic gains with other American interests and maintain conditions that make the U.S. an attractive investment destination.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has backed the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners who argued that permission should be required. The BBC article explains that the ruling centers on the interpretation of the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, which grants the public a right of access for open-air recreation, including camping. This decision is likely to reignite the debate over public access to land in England, where Dartmoor is a rare exception to the general lack of wild camping rights. Campaigners and nature advocates have welcomed the ruling, while landowners have expressed disappointment.</p>
