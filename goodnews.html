          <p>Japan and the United States are currently engaged in negotiations regarding tariffs, which include those impacting the automotive industry. This development suggests a potential shift in trade relations between the two economic powers, particularly concerning key sectors like automobiles. The outcome of these discussions could significantly influence market dynamics and trade flows between Japan and the U.S., affecting manufacturers, consumers, and related industries. The negotiations reflect ongoing efforts to recalibrate economic partnerships amidst evolving global trade policies.</p>

          <p>Five people survived for 36 hours in an alligator-infested swamp in the Amazon region of Bolivia after their small plane made an emergency landing due to engine failure. The pilot, Andres Velarde, stated that they stood on top of the plane surrounded by alligators, which were potentially deterred by leaking petrol. The survivors ate cassava flour brought by one of the passengers while awaiting rescue, and were eventually found by local fishermen who alerted authorities. All five were rescued in excellent condition and transported to a hospital.</p>

          <p>Singapore held its general election as Prime Minister Lawrence Wong faced his first major test against a revitalized opposition amid global trade tensions. The election serves as a key indicator of the People's Action Party's (PAP) popularity, which has ruled for 50 years, and Wong's leadership. Singapore, a major Asian trade hub, is vulnerable to tariffs and a potential recession resulting from the U.S.-China trade war, while voters are also concerned about living costs and housing availability. The PAP seeks a strong mandate to navigate economic uncertainty, while the opposition calls for greater scrutiny and alternative voices in Parliament.</p>

          <p>Europe is grappling with concerns over its reliance on US credit card firms like Visa and Mastercard, with the European Central Bank (ECB) advocating for greater independence in digital payments. ECB President Christine Lagarde emphasizes the need to reduce vulnerabilities and ensure a European alternative is available. While some experts challenge the notion of US dominance, others highlight the growing use of smartphone apps like Apple Pay and Google Pay, which are also led by American tech firms. The ECB's warnings are seen as a strategy to promote the idea of a digital euro, a central bank-issued currency.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using the blood of Tim Friede, a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Antibodies in Friede's blood protect against fatal doses from various deadly snakes in animal tests. This could lead to a universal antivenom, addressing the up to 140,000 deaths and disabilities caused by snakebites annually. The research identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies that target classes of neurotoxins, offering potential protection against numerous elapid species.</p>

The HKMA bought US$6.005 billion and sold HK$46.539 billion worth of local currency in its first market intervention in two years. The HKMA stated the strength of the Hong Kong dollar is driven by increased demand related to equity investment activities and the appreciation of regional currencies against the US dollar.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is undergoing an administrative "revolution" aimed at modernizing the state, boosting economic growth, and consolidating power. Led by party chief To Lam, the reforms include merging ministries, shuttering state media, and eliminating 100,000 public sector jobs. The changes also involve reducing the number of provinces and municipalities. Analysts say the reforms address dysfunction and aim to strengthen political governance amid external pressures such as US tariffs.</p>
