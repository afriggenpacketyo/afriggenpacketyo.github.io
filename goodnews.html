          <p>A child was successfully rescued after falling overboard from the Disney Dream cruise ship near South Florida, thanks to the heroic actions of her father who immediately jumped into the water after her. The ship's crew quickly launched a rescue boat and retrieved both the father and child, who were met with cheers from fellow passengers. Disney Cruise Line commended its crew for their swift and effective response, highlighting the success of their safety protocols in ensuring the guests' safe return within minutes. It remains unclear how the child fell past the ship's safety barriers.</p>

          <p>Following the conclusion of the Glastonbury Festival, a massive cleanup operation has begun at the Worthy Farm site as thousands of attendees head home. Volunteers are working to clear discarded items before the site's planned fallow year in 2026, while organizers urged festival-goers to take all their belongings with them. Traffic delays were reported as the exodus began, with attendees advised to leave early to avoid peak heat. The festival is scheduled to return in 2027, with organizer Emily Eavis stating that the break will be used to make improvements.</p>

          <p>Moderna has announced that its experimental mRNA-based influenza vaccine demonstrated a stronger immune response than an existing flu shot in a late-stage clinical trial. These positive results are a significant step for the standalone vaccine and also clear a path for the company's development of a combination COVID-19 and flu shot. The company plans to file for regulatory approval for both the standalone flu vaccine and the combination shot later this year, with potential approvals expected in 2025. This success positions Moderna as a potential frontrunner in the race for a combined respiratory vaccine.</p>

          <p>Chinese chip manufacturer Sophgo has announced that its SC11 FP300 compute card has been successfully verified to support the domestic AI model from DeepSeek. This verification, conducted by the state-affiliated China Telecommunication Technology Labs, marks a key step in China's push for technological self-reliance by using homegrown hardware to power its leading AI systems. The FP300 compute card, released last year, features advanced high-bandwidth memory, which enables faster data transfer for complex AI model training and execution. This development aligns with Beijing's broader strategy to build a self-sufficient technology infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Chicken finger chain Raising Cane's has overtaken KFC in annual U.S. sales, now ranking as the nation's third-largest chicken restaurant behind Chick-fil-A and Popeyes. The company's success is attributed to its simple, focused menu and a strategy of operating company-owned restaurants rather than franchising, which allows for greater control over operations. With sales doubling to $5.1 billion since 2021 and a rapid expansion to over 900 locations, founder Todd Graves aims to make the chain a top-10 restaurant brand. The growth capitalizes on the sustained high demand for chicken in the fast-food market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After decades of research, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that allow people to control computers with their thoughts are nearing commercial availability. Several companies, including Elon Musk's Neuralink, Precision Neuroscience, and Synchron, are developing implantable devices designed to help individuals who have lost the ability to move or speak. The first generation of these products will likely enable users to control a computer cursor or generate artificial speech, offering new ways to communicate and interact with the world. These advancements are built on years of experimental successes, such as the first demonstration of cursor control via thought in 2004.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While Hollywood approaches artificial intelligence with caution, China's entertainment industry is adopting it more aggressively, highlighted by a new government-backed project to 'revitalize' 100 classic kung fu films using AI. The China Film Foundation plans to use AI for animation and reinterpretation of iconic movies, aiming to reintroduce them to younger global audiences. This no-holds-barred approach contrasts sharply with the U.S., where guilds like the DGA and SAG-AFTRA have voiced strong opposition to using AI to alter creative works and have fought for labor protections against the technology's potential to displace workers.</p>
