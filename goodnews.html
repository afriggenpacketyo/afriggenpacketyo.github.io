          <p>A federal appeals court has affirmed the $83.3 million judgment against Donald Trump for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll in 2019. The court rejected Trump's claims of presidential immunity and his argument that the damages awarded by the jury were excessive. The ruling stated that Trump acted with reckless disregard for the truth when he denied sexually abusing Carroll and that the financial penalty was reasonable given the thousands of threats and attacks she endured as a result of his statements.</p>

          <p>After a 2022 tongue cancer diagnosis required surgeons to remove and reconstruct most of his tongue, singer Roger Blevins Jr. has made a remarkable return to his music career. Blevins, frontman for the band Mingo Fishtrap, had to relearn how to speak and used singing as a central part of his rehabilitation. Now celebrating a year with no evidence of disease, he and his wife have launched a nonprofit, "The Tough Crowd Project," to provide financial and other support to families affected by cancer.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.2 trillion, many households are exploring debt relief strategies to manage overwhelming financial obligations. These methods range from debt consolidation, which combines multiple debts into a single loan, to credit counseling for creating manageable payment plans. More aggressive options include debt settlement, where a reduced amount is negotiated with creditors, and bankruptcy, which legally eliminates or restructures debts but severely impacts credit. The article advises that such options are best considered when high interest rates make repayment difficult.</p>

          <p>Amid a cooling U.S. job market, financial experts are outlining options for the more than 40 million Americans with student loans who may be facing unemployment. For federal loans, borrowers can often enroll in income-driven repayment plans, which can lower monthly payments to as little as zero based on current income, including unemployment benefits. Other options include an Unemployment Deferment or Economic Hardship Deferment, which can temporarily pause payments, although interest may still accrue on some loans during the forbearance period.</p>
