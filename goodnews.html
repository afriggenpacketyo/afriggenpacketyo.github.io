          <h2>Chinese Scientists Link Modern Tibetans to Ancestors in Yunnan Province</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-01 08:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by Chinese scientists has traced the origins of modern Tibetans' "ghost ancestors" to Yunnan province through ancient DNA analysis. The research, published in *Science*, verifies a long-held hypothesis that a Yunnan archaeological site is linked to the Tibetan Plateau's population origins. This discovery fills a critical gap in the genetic data of prehistoric East and Southeast Asian populations, identifying one of the Tibetan Plateau's "ghost ancestors" from a genetic perspective, shedding light on the mystery of how ancestors migrated and settled in the oxygen-poor land. The study involved scientists from institutions including the Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Palaeoanthropology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that President Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel and aluminum was not raised during recent talks with U.S. officials. Akazawa met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent for the fourth round of bilateral tariff negotiations. The Japanese government will closely monitor the details of the measures revealed by the United States in the future. Japan and the United States are planning a meeting between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump on the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit in Canada in mid-June after a fifth round of tariff talks.</p>

Diamondback Energy (FANG) is another pick, with RBC Capital analyst Scott Hanold noting the company's decision to reduce its capital spending plan has increased his free cash flow estimate (not investment advice).

          <p>National police chief Dieter Romann has given a favorable initial assessment of the tightened border controls in Germany, dismissing concerns about overburdened personnel. Since September 16, 2024, Germany reintroduced temporary checks at all nine of its land borders, reinforcing personnel by almost 1,200 colleagues. Romann rejected the assumption that personnel would be withdrawn from other operational areas, such as train stations, for border controls. The Federal Police permanently has around 9,800 officers in their regular stations along the national borders.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Orthorexia, an unhealthy preoccupation with healthy eating and the purity of food, is becoming increasingly common, potentially fueled by social media pressures. Dietitians note that while not officially recognized in the DSM-5, it's a widely recognized form of disordered eating. Signs include extreme food restrictions unrelated to allergies, social life interference due to food-related stress, compulsive ingredient analysis, and anxiety or guilt after breaking self-imposed food rules. Experts recommend seeking support from a dietitian or mental health professional specializing in disordered eating to address concerns and ensure a balanced approach to nutrition.</p>

          <p>As Trump's administration proposes legislative cuts impacting Medicaid and Snap, Rev Dr Liz Theoharis and Noam Sandweiss-Back advocate for a new social contract that uplifts society from the bottom. Drawing from the welfare rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s, particularly the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO), they emphasize the need for the poor to unite across differences, assume leadership, and build visionary projects of survival. The Johnnie Tillmon model proposes strategic principles relevant today, including grassroots movements operating independently, attending to community needs, and utilizing survival projects as bases for organizing and leadership development.</p>

The administration began by banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs and followed by yanking back overhead contributions in support of scientific research. Then it imposed a set of demands on Columbia University in exchange for continued federal funding.</p>
