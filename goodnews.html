          <p>Actor Eric Dane is actively advocating for the Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies for ALS Act, set to expire in 2026, as he manages his own progressing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis symptoms. Dane, who publicly announced his diagnosis in April, has shifted his emotional response from anger to a determined fight for his future. He met with U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell to highlight the legislation's importance in funding research and providing early treatment access, aiming to see his daughters grow up. The article notes ALS affects nerve cells controlling movement, leading to eventual loss of speech, mobility, swallowing, and breathing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the U.S. government shutdown, stock markets closed at record highs on Wednesday, with investors largely unfazed by the political impasse. Historically, shutdowns have had a modest impact on financial markets and the broader economy, often delaying economic activity rather than disrupting it long-term. An analysis from Carson Group shows the S&P 500 gained an average of 0.3% during previous closures and 13% in the 12 months following. However, experts caution that a prolonged shutdown could introduce market uncertainty and halt the flow of crucial economic reports, potentially leaving investors "flying blind" and impacting future growth.</p>

          <p>Ahead of its 51st season, "Saturday Night Live" is subtly shifting its casting strategy by incorporating more internet-savvy comedians who gained prominence on platforms like TikTok and podcasts. While the overall cast shake-up is not as drastic as rumored, with many veterans remaining, the new additions represent a move towards talent cultivated online rather than solely through traditional improv or sketch theaters. This article highlights newcomers like Jeremy Culhane and Veronika Slowikowska, known for short-form digital comedy, and Kam Patterson, a stand-up comedian with a controversial online following. This approach marks a notable departure for Lorne Michaels, reflecting evolving comedy production and audience engagement.</p>

          <p>The new Amazon Prime Video documentary, "The President and the Dragon," chronicles Jimmy Carter's post-presidency mission to eradicate Guinea worm disease. After leaving office, Carter dedicated his life to combating this debilitating parasite, which spreads through contaminated water and causes painful blisters. Through education and clean water initiatives, his program dramatically reduced cases from 3.5 million in 1986 to just 14 by his death in 2024, nearing eradication. The film, directed by Waleed Eltayeb, emphasizes the power of collective action and hope, showcasing local heroes and the program's impact, including its role in fostering peace in Sudan.</p>

          <p>Dame Jane Goodall, who died at 91, revolutionized our understanding of chimpanzees through her groundbreaking research in Tanzania, challenging established scientific beliefs. Her 1960 observation of a chimpanzee using a tool disproved the notion that only humans made and used tools, leading to a redefinition of humanity itself. Despite lacking formal scientific training and facing sexism, her informal approach, including naming the animals, was validated by her mentor Louis Leakey. This article highlights her scientific legacy, which revealed complex chimpanzee behaviors like strong family bonds and territorial warfare, before she dedicated her later life to environmental advocacy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major automakers like GM, Ford, and Hyundai reported robust third-quarter U.S. auto sales, primarily driven by record electric vehicle (EV) sales as consumers capitalized on expiring federal incentives. GM and Ford saw overall sales increase by approximately 8%, with EV sales more than doubling for GM and growing 30% for Ford. Hyundai also recorded a 13% sales increase, led by its EV performance. The article notes that while this surge created a record 10% market share for EVs in Q3, Ford's CEO anticipates a potential drop to 5% after the incentives end. Automakers are now implementing their own incentives to maintain momentum.</p>

          <p>FIFA is likely to schedule 2026 World Cup matches involving major European nations after midnight UK time to mitigate heat issues experienced during the recent Club World Cup. The tournament, hosted across the United States, Canada, and Mexico, faces challenges with midday kick-offs in hot North American summers. Concacaf president Victor Montagliani acknowledged kick-off times as a major lesson from the Club World Cup, where players suffered from extreme heat. While five of the 16 stadiums have roofs, it's impractical for all early games to be played indoors, necessitating adjustments to ensure player welfare and accommodate global broadcasting needs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration's proposal to lend Argentina up to $20 billion, despite political unpopularity, is a wise and generous risk. The bailout aims to support Argentina's currency and Javier Milei's free-market reforms, which have already significantly reduced inflation and revived the housing market. Milei's strategy to devalue the peso in stages, rather than outright dollarization, has created a currency mismatch threatening his economic agenda. The U.S. assistance, drawn from a Federal Reserve credit line, is crucial for Argentina to stabilize its currency and eliminate capital controls, potentially reviving economic liberalism in a region increasingly leaning towards authoritarian nationalism.</p>

          <p>CrowdStrike stock is showing strong momentum, with Wells Fargo adding it to its "tactical ideas list" and raising its price target, implying significant upside. Analysts note the cybersecurity company's annual recurring revenue (ARR) growth is expected to accelerate after an eight-quarter slowdown linked to a 2024 IT outage. CEO George Kurtz's handling of the crisis, including customer commitment packages, is now turning into a tailwind as those clients resume full payments.
