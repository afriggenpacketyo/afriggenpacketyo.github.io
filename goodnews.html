          <h2>Florida Highway Patrol Enforces Federal Immigration Laws Under 287(g) Agreement</h2>

          <p>The Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) is now enforcing federal immigration laws on state roads through the 287(g) agreement, a move hailed by Governor Ron DeSantis as a national model. This initiative allows trained state officers to enforce immigration law in partnership with federal agents, marking a significant shift in state law enforcement authority. During a ride-along with Fox News, troopers initiated a traffic stop that led to the apprehension of an individual with prior convictions. FHP is the only state agency currently operating under this agreement, and has already detained numerous undocumented individuals during traffic stops. While immigration advocates criticize the agreement as racial profiling, officials assert that FHP has a lawful basis for these stops and operates with transparency and professionalism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin has reached its highest level since February, climbing above $100,000, driven by positive market sentiment following President Trump's trade announcement. The cryptocurrency's price increased nearly 5%, reaching $100,881.90, according to Coin Metrics. Analysts suggest that recent market uncertainty has benefited Bitcoin, with investors viewing it as a safe-haven asset amid doubts about the stability of the U.S. economy. The pro-crypto stance of the Trump administration and strong buying from spot-ETF investors are also contributing factors. However, experts caution that Bitcoin's resilience will be tested further due to geopolitical tensions and the Federal Reserve's cautious approach to cutting rates.</p>

          <p>The Gates Foundation will close its doors on December 31, 2045, after 20 more years of generous aid, with Bill Gates committing his remaining personal fortune to the cause. This decision comes amid concerns over cuts to foreign aid by the Trump administration and a changing landscape in global philanthropy. Gates expressed optimism that the foundation's goals in health and human development can be achieved in a shorter time frame, emphasizing the potential of biomedical tools and AI. He acknowledges the challenges posed by post-pandemic setbacks and political headwinds but remains confident in the power of innovation and the 'Golden Rule' to drive progress. The foundation will focus on areas like eradicating diseases and reducing childhood mortality, while also addressing poverty and malnutrition.</p>

          <p>California drivers who filed claims in a $50 million settlement related to gas price gouging are now receiving payments. Over a million residents are receiving $21.65 via check, direct deposit, or Venmo. The settlement stems from allegations that three gasoline trading firms manipulated gas prices in 2015 following an explosion at an Exxon Mobile refinery. The state's Attorney General Rob Bonta stated that the companies exploited the market disruption to inflate gas prices for profit, violating California antitrust laws. While the trading firms settled with the state, they did not admit fault.</p>

The news has been met with joy and a sense of inclusion, particularly among Latino Catholics in the United States. Pope Le√≥n XIV spent much of his pastoral life as a missionary in Peru, working in poor and marginalized communities, which has deeply connected him to Latin America. His fluency in Spanish and experience in the region have positioned him as a figure of hope for millions, with many expecting him to prioritize issues important to Latinos, such as immigration reform and access to education.</p>

Senator Thom Tillis stated he could not support Martin due to his views on January 6th, while others cited Martin's lack of relevant experience.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners considering a HELOC this May should be aware of minimum draw requirements that could affect the cost-effectiveness of this borrowing option. Lenders may require an upfront draw, ongoing minimum usage during the draw period, or both, potentially leading to higher interest costs and complicated repayment plans. Understanding these terms is crucial, as failing to meet the requirements could result in additional fees or a frozen line of credit. While HELOCs can offer flexible access to equity and lower rates than other borrowing options, borrowers should carefully consider the fine print before moving forward.</p>
