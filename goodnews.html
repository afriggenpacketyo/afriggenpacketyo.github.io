        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has announced a 25-basis-point interest rate cut, lowering the deposit facility rate to 2% from its mid-2023 high of 4%. This decision follows a drop in Euro zone inflation to 1.9% in May, below the ECB's 2% target. The ECB also released updated economic projections, anticipating an average inflation rate of 2% in 2025, revised down from the March forecast of 2.3%, primarily due to lower energy prices and a stronger euro. ECB President Christine Lagarde noted that the outlook for euro area inflation remains more uncertain than usual, while the growth forecast for 2025 remains unchanged at 0.9%.</p>

          <p>NBA teams have generated $1.62 billion in sponsorship revenue this season, marking an 8% increase from last year and a 91% rise from five years ago. The growth is attributed to the expansion of sponsor patches on team jerseys and the opening of the Los Angeles Clippers' Intuit Dome. The increase in jersey patch deals, common in international soccer, has more than doubled year-over-year, contributing over $80 million in new spending. Rakuten and JPMorgan Chase are the top-spending brands in the league, with Chase sponsoring the Golden State Warriors' arena and Rakuten having a patch on their jersey.</p>

          <p>The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in China is expected to alleviate labor shortages in the long term, but its short-term impact on deflationary pressures is a subject of debate. Morgan Stanley analysts suggest that AI-induced labor market disruption could worsen deflation due to potential labor displacement. However, Standard Chartered's chief Greater China economist, Ding Shuang, argues that AI will not be a primary driver of deflation, attributing it instead to overcapacity in some industries and weak domestic demand. Ding emphasized that China should continue developing AI as a strategically important industry.</p>

          <p>The 10-year Treasury yield fell following a higher-than-expected increase in weekly jobless claims, with first-time filings reaching 247,000, surpassing the Dow Jones estimate of 236,000. This move follows sharp declines in yields on Wednesday due to disappointing U.S. data, including a weakening services sector and lower-than-expected private sector payrolls. Despite the forecast misses, Deutsche Bank suggests the numbers are not severe enough to revive recession fears. Traders are now focusing on May's nonfarm payrolls and unemployment rate, due out on Friday. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Circle Internet Group, the issuer of USD Coin, priced its initial public offering at $31 per share, above the expected range of $27 to $28, giving the company a market value of $6.8 billion. The offering of 34 million shares will raise $1.05 billion for Circle, its founder, and some original shareholders. Demand was so high that Circle increased the number of shares sold after the market closed Wednesday. Cathie Wood's ARK Investment Management has expressed interest in purchasing up to $150 million of the shares. (not investment advice)</p>
