          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has officially endorsed Democratic assemblyman Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor, a significant show of party unity just before early voting begins. Jeffries' backing follows Mamdani's primary victory and consolidates support from key Democratic figures, including Governor Kathy Hochul and Senator Bernie Sanders. The endorsement comes after Mamdani's opponent, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, received support from outgoing Mayor Eric Adams. Mamdani's campaign, focused on the city's affordability crisis, continues to build momentum with this crucial endorsement from a powerful party leader.</p>

          <p>A judge has ordered the permanent closure of the S&W Atlas Iron & Metal recycling facility in Watts, Los Angeles, and imposed a $2 million penalty on its owners for endangering the adjacent Jordan High School. For decades, the scrap yard's operations resulted in explosions, toxic dust, and flying shrapnel, posing a significant risk to students and staff. The ruling follows multiple criminal charges against the owners for illegal hazardous waste handling. The company must also perform an environmental cleanup of the site and give the school district the first option to purchase the land.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated a 3% annual inflation rate for September, a figure slightly below economists' predictions of 3.1%. This data, crucial for determining the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment, suggests that the economic impact of President Trump's tariffs has been somewhat muted so far. Despite being above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, the benign report is not expected to deter a potential interest rate cut at the upcoming Fed meeting. Economists note that rising inflation combined with a slowing job market presents a complex challenge for the central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel is scheduled to travel to China next month to address the flow of precursor chemicals used in the production of fentanyl. This visit is part of the Trump administration's broader strategy to crack down on international supply chains contributing to the U.S. opioid crisis. President Trump has emphasized that he will make the fentanyl issue a top priority in his upcoming discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The administration has recently indicted several Chinese companies and individuals for their alleged roles in manufacturing and funding this illicit trade.</p>

          <p>With two months until Christmas, major retailers like Kohl's and Academy Sports and Outdoors are starting their holiday promotions earlier than usual to capture spending from increasingly cautious shoppers. Executives report that consumers, particularly in lower- and middle-income brackets, are feeling budgetary pressures and are more strategic about finding deals. Many are making more frequent trips but with smaller basket sizes, a trend retailers expect to continue. Despite concerns over a potential government shutdown and tariffs, retailers are maintaining normal inventory levels and do not anticipate merchandise shortages for the holiday season.</p>

          <p>Over 20 allied nations supporting Ukraine have committed to removing Russian oil and gas from the global market to intensify economic pressure on Vladimir Putin's government. Following a summit in London, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the coalition is focused on "choking off funding for Russia's war machine." The move follows recent sanctions by the UK, US, and EU targeting Russia's energy sector. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, also present at the summit, emphasized that sustained pressure is the only path to ending the conflict, though no new long-range missile commitments were announced.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut its benchmark interest rate on October 29, homebuyers and homeowners are closely watching for potential impacts on mortgage rates. Currently, the average 30-year mortgage rate stands at 6.19%, having gradually declined throughout 2025 from a high of over 7% in January. While a Fed rate cut could lead to further decreases, experts caution that this expectation may already be priced into current rates. Complicating factors like rising inflation and the government shutdown could also influence rate movements independently of the Fed's decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has announced a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026, which will increase monthly payments for approximately 71 million beneficiaries. The adjustment, based on recent inflation data, will raise the average monthly benefit by about $56 to $2,071 starting in January. While the COLA is intended to help recipients keep pace with rising costs, some advocates argue it is insufficient, particularly as projected increases in Medicare premiums could consume most of the additional benefit. This year's COLA is slightly higher than the 2.5% increase for 2025.</p>

Mehiel, a trans Latine performer who previously won an acting award at Sundance for the film "Mutt," views this high-profile project as a milestone for representation. They emphasize that their character, Alex, is portrayed as a complex individual whose story is not solely defined by their queer or trans identity. Mehiel believes that such nuanced portrayals in mainstream films help normalize and humanize trans experiences for a broader audience.</p>
