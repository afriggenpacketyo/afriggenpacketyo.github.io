          <p>An excerpt from Arundhati Roy's first memoir, "Mother Mary Comes to Me," has been released ahead of its September publication. The Booker Prize-winning author of "The God of Small Things" delves into her complex and formative relationship with her mother. The previewed section, titled "Gangster," reflects on her mother's recent death, the arrangements for her unconventional funeral, and the decades-long, often tumultuous conversations they had about mortality and inheritance. Roy explores the profound, almost physical pain of losing a parent so deeply intertwined with the landscape of her home in Kerala, India.</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has issued guidance clarifying how consumers can still qualify for the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit, which is scheduled to be eliminated after September 30. According to the IRS, a buyer who enters into a "written binding contract" and makes a payment by the deadline is entitled to the credit, even if they take physical possession of the vehicle at a later date. This provides crucial flexibility for those unable to drive their new EV off the lot before the cutoff. The clarification applies to new, used, and leased electric vehicles, offering continued access to the significant federal incentive.</p>

          <p>During the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, Chinese President Xi Jinping engaged in several key diplomatic meetings, including with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In their first meeting in seven years, both leaders committed to improving bilateral ties, with Xi stating they should be partners, not rivals. Xi also met with leaders from Azerbaijan and Armenia, discussing strategic partnerships, economic cooperation through the Belt and Road Initiative, and supporting their potential inclusion in the SCO. These discussions highlight Beijing's efforts to strengthen regional cooperation as an alternative to Western-led global structures amid ongoing geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>With the transfer deadline approaching, Manchester United is reportedly considering a move for Aston Villa's goalkeeper, Emiliano Martinez. The club has been actively seeking to resolve its goalkeeping situation and has also been in negotiations for Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens. However, Martinez, a World Cup winner with Argentina and a two-time FIFA goalkeeper of the year, offers a wealth of high-level Premier League experience that the younger Lammens lacks. The potential acquisition of Martinez would provide a seasoned and proven option for a position that has been a point of concern for the club.</p>

          <p>In a rare contract involving a North American company, the Chinese launch provider CAS Space has successfully deployed two small satellites for ThumbSat, a startup based in Tijuana, Mexico. The launch, which took place from China, marks Mexico's first commercial mission to low Earth orbit and is being hailed by CAS Space as a significant milestone for China's entry into the North American launch market. The two "femtosatellites," each weighing less than 100 grams, carry selfie and artistic payloads. The mission aims to demonstrate the viability of small, meaningful satellites and to engage students and amateur users across Mexico.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Black History Offers a Blueprint for Resisting Fascism</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the history of Black Americans provides essential lessons for combating the rise of fascism today. Drawing on a 1995 speech by author Toni Morrison, the article suggests that American racism has long been a precursor to fascist tendencies, and its roots are deeper than any single political administration. The author contends that Black communities have historically countered these forces through a combination of unwavering belief in democratic ideals, diverse forms of resistance, and profound faith. This legacy of resilience offers a powerful model for defending democracy against current and future authoritarian threats.</p>

          <p>A feature story profiles brothers Jim and Tom Ross, successful political consultants who work for opposing parties—Jim for Democrats and Tom for Republicans.

The article highlights their mutual respect and reliance on each other for support, especially during high-stress campaigns. Their relationship serves as a poignant example of maintaining personal connection and empathy in an era of intense political polarization, suggesting that family ties can transcend partisan conflict.</p>

          <p>England and Chelsea defender Millie Bright has spoken about her decision to withdraw from the Euro 2025 squad, calling it the best she has ever made for her mental and physical well-being. After a demanding season where she helped Chelsea win a domestic treble, Bright realized she was on the verge of a breakdown and could not give her best for the national team. The 32-year-old, who has since had knee surgery and started counseling, emphasized the immense pressure of her leadership roles and the importance of prioritizing her own health. She now feels rejuvenated and ready for the upcoming Women's Super League season.</p>

          <p>Germany is marking the tenth anniversary of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's famous declaration, "wir schaffen das" ("we can do it"), which signaled the country's open-door policy to hundreds of thousands of refugees in 2015. The policy profoundly changed German society and politics, and its consequences are still debated today. While data shows that nearly two-thirds of refugees from that wave are now employed, challenges with integration and unemployment persist. The anniversary has prompted a national stock-taking of the successes and failures of the integration efforts over the past decade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an innovative effort to protect livestock, biologists with the USDA are using drones to haze gray wolves away from cattle ranches near the California-Oregon border. The drones are equipped with loudspeakers that blast a variety of sounds, including the AC/DC song "Thunderstruck," clips from the film "Marriage Story," and live human voices. This nonlethal method is part of an ongoing experiment to find creative ways to manage the increasing conflict between ranchers and the recovering wolf population. While the technology is expensive, early results have shown success in interrupting wolf hunts and promoting coexistence.</p>
