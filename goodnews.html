          <h2>Chinese Researchers Announce Lower-Cost Method for In-Body Cancer Cell Therapy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 02:00:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in China have developed a more affordable and simpler method for CAR-T cell therapy, a treatment for blood cancers and other diseases. By using gene therapy tools, they can generate anti-cancer cells directly within a patient's body, significantly reducing the high costs associated with conventional methods. This innovative approach has already been used to treat four patients with multiple myeloma. The breakthrough aims to make this highly effective but expensive therapy more accessible to the public.</p>

          <p>China's top market regulator, the SAMR, has summoned major tech companies including Alibaba, Meituan, and JD.com to address an intense price war in the delivery sector. The meeting was intended to promote rational competition and ensure a healthy market environment for all stakeholders, from consumers to delivery riders. The regulator emphasized that these companies must comply with e-commerce and anti-unfair competition laws. A separate meeting also addressed food safety issues arising from products sold via live-streaming e-commerce platforms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Dodgers Pitcher Tyler Glasnow Shows Promising Performance Despite Team's Loss</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 00:39:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a 2-0 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers, Dodgers pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered a strong performance, signaling a positive step in his return from injury. He pitched six innings, allowing only one run and striking out six batters, demonstrating improved velocity and control. Glasnow has been working on simplifying his mental approach to pitching, focusing more on athleticism and less on mechanical details to overcome past injury-plagued seasons. His consistent performance is seen as crucial for the Dodgers' rotation as they aim for a successful postseason run.</p>

          <p>Beijing's disciplinary authorities are using a failed tourism project in Guilin as a prime example of wasteful grass-roots government mismanagement. The "Yaohan Longevity City" was an ambitious 1.65 billion yuan health tourism initiative that collapsed due to a broken capital chain and poor local decision-making, leaving multiple buildings abandoned. China's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection condemned the project as a "severe waste of resources" resulting from blind decisions. The case serves as a cautionary tale for local officials across China to avoid projects that are out of touch with reality.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that a majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, favor the U.S. returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. This support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The 1969 Apollo 11 mission is still widely viewed as a worthwhile achievement and a source of national pride. The poll suggests that Americans generally believe the space program contributes to technological advancements and boosts feelings of national accomplishment, with support cutting across party lines.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech firms are challenging the dominance of U.S. companies like OpenAI and Google through the release of powerful, open-source artificial intelligence models. The recent launch of DeepSeek's V3 and R1 models, which are free for global developers to use and modify, has sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley. This open-source approach fosters collaborative development and presents a significant alternative to the closed, proprietary systems of American tech giants. Analysts suggest this trend is redefining the global AI landscape by creating a viable and competitive ecosystem outside of U.S. control.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that ten more hostages held in Gaza are expected to be released "very shortly." The statement was made as his administration continues to push for a 60-day ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. The current proposal reportedly includes the return of these 10 living hostages and the remains of 18 others, in exchange for Israel releasing an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement comes after recent visits by Israeli officials to Washington and ongoing indirect talks mediated by Qatar to finalize the truce.</p>

          <p>The Australian government has delivered M1A1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine as part of a significant military aid package to support its defense against Russia. The tanks are part of a A$245 million ($160 million) contribution, with most of the 49 promised vehicles already in Ukrainian possession. As one of the largest non-NATO contributors, Australia has provided over A$1.5 billion in total aid, including ammunition and other defense equipment.

          <p>Retired Marine Scott Harrison, who endured the horrors of the Vietnam War, found solace in a small music box that inspired a vision of a peaceful carousel. After battling PTSD for years, he decided to make that vision a reality to help himself heal. In 1986, he brought a broken-down carousel to Nederland, Colorado, and spent 26 years hand-carving new animals for it. Now a nonprofit, the "Carousel of Happiness" has brought joy to over a million people and has become a source of profound healing for Harrison, turning his personal therapy into a gift for others.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act, a landmark bill creating the first major regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. The legislation, which received bipartisan support, establishes consumer protections and clear legal definitions for these dollar-pegged digital currencies. It allows banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins, a move hailed by the administration as a way to strengthen the dollar and upgrade the financial system. The law is seen as a major victory for the crypto industry, which has long advocated for clearer regulations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An adviser for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has stated that the global financial system needs to rewrite its rules to adapt to a future dominated by tokenization. The rise of stablecoins presents new challenges for payment infrastructure and complicates efforts like anti-money-laundering due to their cross-border and pseudonymous nature. This call for new regulations comes as the stablecoin market experiences rapid growth, spurred by the Trump administration's embrace of digital currencies. The warning highlights the urgent need for global regulators to address the systemic changes brought by this new technology. (not investment advice)</p>

He recently held a press conference to publicly accuse the Police Minister of having ties to organized crime and shutting down an elite investigative unit. This is not his first time confronting political power, having previously suspended a corrupt, high-ranking official allied with a former president. Despite the risks to his career, Mkhwanazi is seen by many citizens as a "no-nonsense" hero in a country where public trust in the police is extremely low.</p>

Stocks often experience a rally upon being added to a major index because it compels index-tracking funds to purchase the shares to rebalance their portfolios. Despite being down for the year, Block's inclusion reflects the growing weight of the technology sector in the benchmark index. (not investment advice)</p>
