          <p>Apple, previously considered a safe haven in the tech market, is now underperforming compared to its sector, raising questions about the tech sector's overall stability. While tech stocks have generally rebounded from tariff-induced selloffs, Apple has struggled, trading below its 50- and 200-day moving averages. Investors are broadly betting on the U.S. stock market, which inherently includes tech, rather than solely focusing on the tech sector, with ETFs like Vanguard S&P 500 ETF seeing significant inflows. Experts suggest investors are diversifying with traditional defensive sectors amidst market volatility, indicating a shift in how tech is perceived. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The proportion of children in Germany growing up in large families (three or more children) has increased in recent years, largely due to immigration since 2015. Families with a migration background are almost twice as likely to have three or more children compared to families without foreign roots. In 2024, 19% of migrant families had at least three children, compared to around 10% of other families. Larger families are slightly more common in western federal states than in eastern Germany, reflecting demographic shifts within the country.</p>

          <p>Ford is recalling nearly 200,000 Mustang Mach-E electric SUVs from model years 2021-2025 due to potentially faulty door latches. The electronic door latches may remain locked after the driver exits, potentially trapping passengers, especially in the back seat. Ford will notify owners, and dealerships will update the vehicle's software to fix the problem, with the remedy expected to be available by late September. This recall aims to address a safety concern that could affect the ability of passengers to exit the vehicle.</p>

Trump also urged the Department of Energy to increase domestic oil production, despite the fact that oil production decisions in the U.S. are made by private companies in response to market dynamics.

          <p>Researchers have observed orcas in the North Pacific using kelp to "massage" each other, selecting pieces of seaweed and rubbing them between their bodies. Drones were used to film the animals, which appears to be an example of tool use in killer whales, fashioning a tubular piece of seaweed and using it for a specific, planned purpose. Scientists believe this behavior, dubbed "allokelping", might have a health or hygiene function, and also be a form of social bonding. This marine version of allogrooming in primates highlights the importance of physical touch in maintaining social relationships among these social animals.</p>
