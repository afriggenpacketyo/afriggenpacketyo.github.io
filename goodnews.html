          <p>Julian Cheng, a distinguished communications expert and academic, has left his 30-year research career in Canada to join a newly established university in China's Guangdong province. Cheng, who earned fellowships at two prestigious Canadian engineering institutes, is known for his work in ultraviolet communication, wireless robot communication, and the integration of AI into wireless networks. His move is notable as it comes just days after China's education ministry officially approved the new university's establishment. This relocation highlights the ongoing global movement of top academic and scientific talent.</p>

          <p>During a visit to a hospital in Essex, Catherine, the Princess of Wales, spoke openly about the difficult, life-altering recovery process following cancer treatment. She shared that the phase after chemotherapy can be particularly challenging, as individuals are no longer under constant clinical care but may struggle to return to their normal lives. The princess emphasized the significant impact on both patients and their families, describing recovery as a "rollercoaster" rather than a smooth journey. Her comments are seen as a message of support for others facing similar post-treatment struggles.</p>

          <p>New Zealand is experiencing a significant increase in applications for its Active Investor Plus visa, often called a "golden visa," particularly from wealthy American citizens. Since the government relaxed rules in April, such as removing an English language requirement, it has received 189 applications in under three months, compared to 116 over the previous two and a half years. Experts suggest that global uncertainty, including political polarization in the U.S. and conflicts abroad, is driving the elite to seek safe havens.

          <p>President Xi Jinping has emphasized the strategic importance of China's marine economy, calling for its "high-quality development" and stronger policy support to accelerate growth. In 2024, China's marine GDP surpassed 10 trillion yuan for the first time, contributing 7.8% to the national total, a milestone celebrated by the government as a significant achievement. This focus signals the sector's critical role in the nation's overall economic strategy, building on decades of investment in marine industries. The government's push is expected to benefit a wide range of sectors related to maritime activities and resources.</p>

          <p>A recent drop in mortgage rates to their lowest level since April has spurred a significant increase in demand for home refinancing. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, refinance applications rose by 7% last week and were 40% higher than the same period last year, driven primarily by conventional and VA loan holders. In contrast, applications for home purchases remained nearly flat, suggesting that while current homeowners are seizing the opportunity to save, potential buyers remain hesitant due to ongoing market uncertainty. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.79%. (not investment advice)</p>

Analysts note that while the Magic V5's features are impressive, Honor faces a significant challenge in overcoming Samsung's stronger global brand equity and distribution network.

To ease the burden on industries, the proposal includes a provision allowing member states to use carbon credits from non-EU countries for up to 3% of the reduction.

          <p>A report from the China Finance 40 Forum, a Beijing-based think tank, argues that mainstream metrics systematically underestimate China's true consumption power. The analysis contends that when properly adjusted, China's per capita consumption is not as low as commonly believed, potentially reaching 40 to 50 percent of levels in developed nations like Japan and Germany. This perspective challenges the market consensus that China's consumer sector is underdeveloped. It suggests a more robust potential for the world's second-largest economy than standard economic data might indicate. (not investment advice)</p>
