          <p>Asean faces a critical opportunity to leverage the US-China rivalry and assert itself as a pivotal player in global trade and geopolitics. With the finalization of an upgraded free-trade agreement with China and ongoing discussions with the U.S. regarding tariffs, Asean can shape trade rules to prioritize regional resilience and strategic autonomy. This requires navigating internal divisions and external pressures with unprecedented cohesion. By fostering a neutral, inclusive trade ecosystem, Asean can redefine its role and become the architect of a new regional order, rather than being a mere battleground for US-China competition. The opportunity hinges on Asean's ability to exploit the US-China rivalry.</p>

          <p>Premier League clubs are preparing for the summer transfer window with varying financial constraints due to profit and sustainability rules (PSR). These rules limit clubs to losses of ¬£105m over three years, with reductions for clubs outside the top tier. The article examines how much each club can spend, considering PSR limitations, and identifies those operating under a tight budget. The analysis, based on insights from football finance expert Kieran Maguire, highlights the strategic financial decisions clubs must make to reinforce their squads while adhering to league regulations.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study reveals that while parenthood provides a deeper sense of meaning in life, it often leads to lower life satisfaction, particularly for mothers. The study, based on data from over 43,000 respondents across 30 European countries, highlights that parents, regardless of nationality or social status, feel more fulfilled than their childfree counterparts. However, life satisfaction levels vary significantly based on factors like living situation and family policy, with Scandinavian countries showing less pronounced differences between parents and non-parents. Greater gender equality and societal support for parents contribute to higher satisfaction levels, emphasizing the importance of community involvement in raising children. The research points to the significance of robust social support.</p>
