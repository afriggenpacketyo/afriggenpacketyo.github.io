          <p>Online ticket marketplace StubHub has priced its initial public offering (IPO) at $23.50 per share, resulting in a company valuation of $8.6 billion. This pricing falls at the midpoint of the company's expected range, which was lower than the $16.5 billion valuation it had previously sought. After being acquired by eBay in 2007 and then reacquired by co-founder Eric Baker in 2020, StubHub's path to going public faced delays, including market volatility from tariffs. The company will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "STUB." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hazy conditions and reduced air quality in parts of Washington state are being caused by strong winds lifting volcanic ash from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. This phenomenon, known as ash resuspension, is occurring due to persistently dry weather and severe drought conditions in the area. Both the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Weather Service have confirmed that this is not due to any new volcanic activity. The volcano's alert level remains at "Normal," though the resuspended ash can pose a hazard to aircraft and human health.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur has demonstrated a significant shift in strategy under manager Thomas Frank, prioritizing defensive solidity over the attacking style of the previous season. This new "clean sheet mentality" was evident in their 1-0 Champions League victory against Villarreal, which marked their fourth clean sheet in five games. While this pragmatic approach has made Spurs a difficult team to score against, it has come at the expense of offensive excitement, with the team managing only one shot on target in the match. Players and the manager have acknowledged the focus on a strong defensive structure.</p>

The Democrat, who was Kamala Harris's running mate in the 2024 presidential election, highlighted his administration's progressive achievements, such as legalizing recreational marijuana and codifying abortion rights. In his announcement, Walz pledged to continue fighting against what he termed the "chaos, corruption and cruelty" from Washington. He faces potential headwinds, including public scrutiny over his administration's handling of a major COVID-19 fraud case.</p>

          <p>Google's Gemini app has claimed the number one spot for free applications on Apple's App Store, overtaking its rival ChatGPT. This surge in popularity follows recent updates to Google's AI model, including a new image editing feature that reportedly attracted 13 million new users in just four days. The increased consumer traction for Gemini reflects Google's growing momentum in the competitive generative AI space. This success has also been noted by investors, with parent company Alphabet's stock value rising and recently joining the $3 trillion market capitalization club.</p>

          <p>The National Hockey League is set to allow its players to participate in the Winter Olympics for the first time in 12 years, beginning with the 2026 Games in Milan. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman stated that the decision was made after weighing the pros and cons, concluding it was important for the league to be on a major global platform. The return was driven by a strong desire from players to compete for their countries and a new agreement with the IOC that improves commercial arrangements and player conditions. The league will pause its season for nearly two weeks to accommodate the event.</p>

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has dropped to 6.13%, its lowest point since late 2022. This sharp decline occurred as investors appeared to anticipate an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its upcoming meeting. While lower rates are generally welcomed by homebuyers, some market analysts caution that rates could paradoxically move higher after the Fed's announcement, a pattern seen in previous rate-cut cycles. Experts note that in non-recessionary environments, cuts to the short-term federal funds rate do not always translate to lower long-term borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

This new route reflects strengthening trade and political ties between China and Latin America.

          <p>President Donald Trump has once again extended the deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. operations, pushing the date to December 16. The extension comes as a framework deal has reportedly been reached, which would see an investor consortium including Oracle and Silver Lake own about 80% of the U.S. business. The deal, which may require existing users to switch to a new app, was spurred by the threat of a national security law that would have effectively banned the platform.
