          <p>Defense Secretary John Healey indicated that the UK's defense spending is projected to increase to 3% of GDP by 2034. This statement comes as the government prepares to release its strategic defense review, outlining military and security spending priorities. The review assumes the 3% target is the trajectory for spending, with potential for faster project delivery. New funding for defense will be partially sourced by reducing overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income, a move that has faced criticism.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas is experiencing a decline in casual tourism due to rising prices and inflation, with visitor numbers down compared to last year. While convention traffic remains strong, fewer international visitors are impacting the city's revenue, as they tend to stay longer and spend more. Higher hotel rates and traffic congestion are also contributing to the perception that Las Vegas is no longer a bargain destination. Despite these challenges, the city's summer calendar is packed with events, and officials remain optimistic about its resilience.</p>

The trial showed that the drug doubled the length of time patients were cancer free, on average, from around 2.5 years to five years. After three years, patients given pembrolizumab had a 10% lower risk of their cancer returning elsewhere in the body.
