          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology, the world's largest battery manufacturer, experienced a significant surge during their Hong Kong trading debut, fueled by investor confidence in the company's ability to capitalize on the burgeoning electric vehicle market. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion, making it the largest global listing of 2025. CATL intends to allocate 90% of the raised funds to construct a factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive giants like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen, reflecting Europe's pivotal role in CATL's global strategy given the slowing growth in China. The company faces increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU, including potential tariffs and military watchlist designation, potentially complicating its U.S. operations.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has reduced its policy rate by 25 basis points to 3.85%, the lowest in two years, as inflation concerns continue to ease. Australia's inflation rate has fallen to a four-year low of 2.4% in the first quarter of 2025. The RBA said its highest priority is returning inflation sustainably to its target of between 2% and 3% "within a reasonable timeframe". Analysts highlight downside risks for the Australian economy due to global trade tensions and uncertainty around the domestic economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Japanese government will initiate offshore "blue carbon" research to capture carbon dioxide using cultivated sea plants and store it in the deep sea. This effort aims to accelerate decarbonization, leveraging the high CO2 solubility in water and the carbon-absorbing properties of marine vegetation. The Environment Ministry will commission the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology and Eneos Corp., among others, to study seaweed behavior at significant depths and assess the environmental impact of these projects. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon.</p>
