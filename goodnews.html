        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bill Belichick, now head football coach at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, revealed he spent $5,000 on special milk to keep the relationship between Tom Brady and Antonio Brown afloat during Brown's brief stint with the New England Patriots. Brown ordered the milk for Brady, but it spoiled before reaching him. Belichick approved the expense report to avoid ruining the relationship between the two players. Brown and Brady later won a Super Bowl together with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p>

          <p>Rafal Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of Warsaw, secured a narrow lead in the first round of Poland‚Äôs presidential election, a vote viewed as crucial for Prime Minister Donald Tusk‚Äôs efforts to reverse hard-right policies. Trzaskowski, a member of Tusk‚Äôs Civic Platform, garnered 30.8 percent of the vote, narrowly edging out Karol Nowrocki, backed by the Law and Justice party, who received 29.1 percent. With no candidate securing a majority, a runoff election is scheduled for June 1, presenting Trzaskowski with a potential challenge given the combined support for right-wing candidates, as the Polish presidency holds veto powers that could impact Tusk‚Äôs agenda.</p>
