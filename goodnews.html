          <p>Minnesota Vikings cornerback Isaiah Rodgers made NFL history during a dominant 48-10 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. In an unprecedented performance, Rodgers became the first player ever to record a pick-six, a fumble-return touchdown, and two forced fumbles all within a single game, accomplishing the feat entirely in the first half. His 87-yard interception return and 66-yard fumble return for touchdowns were pivotal in building the Vikings' insurmountable lead. The game marked a significant defensive showcase for Minnesota and a difficult start for Bengals' backup quarterback Jake Browning, who is filling in for the injured Joe Burrow.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch are expected to be part of an investment group aiming to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. In a Fox News interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as likely participants, describing them as "American patriots." The potential deal is a response to a 2024 law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its U.S. arm over national security concerns regarding user data. The White House has suggested a deal is imminent, with Oracle set to manage U.S. data and privacy, and Americans controlling the algorithm.</p>

          <p>After catching Mike Trout's 400th career home run ball, a fan named Alberto negotiated a unique and heartwarming exchange with the Angels superstar. In addition to receiving three signed bats and two signed baseballs, Alberto boldly asked Trout if they could play catch on the field. The future Hall of Famer readily agreed, creating a special memory for the fan and his family who were in attendance. The home run was a significant milestone for Trout, making him the 59th MLB player to reach the 400-homer mark. The interaction highlighted a moment of genuine connection between a player and a fan.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Washington Nationals center fielder Jacob Young made two extraordinary defensive plays that were critical in a 3-2 victory over the New York Mets. In the fifth inning, Young prevented an extra-base hit with a juggling, "hacky-sack" style catch, kicking the ball back into the air with his foot after it was jarred from his glove at the wall. Later, in the ninth inning, he made a leaping grab at the fence to rob Francisco Álvarez of a potential game-tying home run. The loss was a significant blow to the Mets' playoff hopes, dropping them into a tie with the Cincinnati Reds for the final NL wildcard spot.</p>

          <h2>South Korean President Signals Openness to an Interim Nuclear Freeze Deal with North Korea</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 17:00:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung stated he would accept a deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un that involves freezing North Korea's nuclear weapons program as an interim measure, rather than demanding immediate denuclearization. In an interview with the BBC, Lee described a freeze as a "feasible, realistic alternative," given that Pyongyang is reportedly producing numerous new weapons annually. He expressed hope that Trump could resume nuclear talks, which broke down in 2019, believing the two leaders share a degree of mutual trust. This pragmatic approach marks a shift from previous hardline stances and aims to reduce regional tensions.</p>

          <p>A wild Sunday of NFL action was highlighted by several games with dramatic, late-game blocked field goals. The Philadelphia Eagles stunned the Los Angeles Rams when Jordan Davis blocked a potential game-winning kick as time expired and returned it for a touchdown to seal a 33-26 victory. Similarly, the Cleveland Browns rallied to beat the Green Bay Packers 13-10 after blocking a last-minute field goal attempt, setting up their own game-winning kick. In another thriller, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers edged the New York Jets 29-27, but only after the Jets had taken a late lead by blocking a field goal and returning it for a score.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Approves Controversial Second Runway for London's Gatwick Airport</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, has officially approved a £2.2 billion project to build a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport. The plan involves converting the airport's existing northern runway, currently used for taxiing, into a fully operational runway for regular use, which could significantly increase flight capacity. The government and airport officials champion the privately-financed project as a major opportunity for economic growth and job creation. However, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental groups and local campaigners concerned about increased noise, traffic, and climate impacts, arguing it contradicts the UK's legally binding climate commitments.</p>

          <p>A security camera at a high school in Summersville, West Virginia, captured the surprising moment a school principal, James Marsh, discovered a black bear inside a locked dumpster. As Marsh went to unlock the bin, the bear's snout poked out from under the lid, causing him to quickly retreat as the animal climbed out and fled in the opposite direction. The incident, which resulted in no injuries, serves as a stark reminder of how unsecured food and trash can attract wildlife into developed areas. Experts emphasize the importance of securing waste to prevent potentially dangerous human-wildlife encounters as natural habitats continue to shrink.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department has announced it will increase its presence around synagogues, schools, and community centers as the Jewish High Holy Days begin. This measure is a proactive response to a rise in antisemitic attacks across the U.S. and aims to provide reassurance and deter crime during the period from Rosh Hashana to Yom Kippur. Mayor Karen Bass stated that antisemitism is unacceptable and affirmed the city's commitment to protecting its Jewish residents. Local Jewish leaders have expressed confidence in their own robust security measures while welcoming the additional support from law enforcement during this important religious observance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola adopted an uncharacteristically defensive strategy that nearly resulted in a victory against Arsenal, but a last-minute equalizer secured a 1-1 draw for the hosts. After taking an early lead through Erling Haaland, Guardiola shifted his team to a deep-defending 5-5-0 formation, ceding possession in an effort to protect the lead. The tactic, which resulted in the lowest possession percentage of Guardiola's managerial career, held for over 90 minutes until Gabriel Martinelli scored in stoppage time. The result is seen as a setback for both title contenders, leaving league-leaders Liverpool as the primary beneficiaries of the weekend.</p>

          <p>McLaren driver Lando Norris managed to gain only six points on his championship-leading teammate Oscar Piastri at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, a weekend where Piastri uncharacteristically struggled. Piastri crashed in qualifying and again early in the race, failing to finish. Norris, however, could only manage a seventh-place finish, a result he attributed to a difficult qualifying session where he also made an error. While Norris felt he maximized his race potential from his starting position, the weekend is viewed as a missed opportunity to significantly close the gap in the title race, with Red Bull's Max Verstappen taking a dominant victory.</p>

          <p>London's Mayor, Sadiq Khan, has initiated a one-day trial banning vehicle traffic from a section of Oxford Street, describing it as the day "the fight back began to rescue this street." The long-term goal is to permanently pedestrianize the stretch between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch to increase footfall and improve the shopping experience. The proposal has been met with mixed reactions; while many pedestrians welcomed the car-free environment, some local groups and councillors have raised concerns about traffic being diverted to smaller side streets and potential accessibility issues for people with mobility challenges. A formal consultation on the detailed plans is expected later this year.</p>
