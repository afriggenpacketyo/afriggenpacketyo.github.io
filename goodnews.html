          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has implemented temporary flight restrictions at Newark Liberty International Airport due to recent technology outages, staff shortages, and ongoing runway construction. Flights will be capped at 28 departures and 28 arrivals per hour until June 15, with slightly higher limits through October 25. United Airlines, which operates a majority of flights at Newark, supports the restrictions, and the FAA hopes to relieve the substantial inconvenience to travelers. The FAA estimates a shortfall of air traffic controllers, exacerbating the airport's operational capacity issues.</p>

          <p>A new test developed by researchers at the University of Nottingham and Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust can diagnose brain tumour types in hours instead of weeks. The "ultra-rapid" method of genetic testing has been used in 50 operations with a 100% success rate in diagnosing the exact tumour type. Faster diagnosis allows surgeons to perform more radical surgery during the initial procedure and enables patients to receive radiation treatment or chemotherapy more quickly. The test, which uses software called ROBIN, has attracted interest from across the UK.</p>
