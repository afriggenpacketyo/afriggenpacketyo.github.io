          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. government has acquired a 10% equity stake in Intel, a major Silicon Valley chipmaker, a deal confirmed by Intel and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. This historic agreement, valued at approximately $11 billion, is funded by converting remaining CHIPS and Science Act grants and additional Secure Enclave program awards, with the government purchasing non-voting shares. Trump emphasized the deal's role in boosting domestic chip production and strengthening America's technological edge against China, a key focus of his trade policies. This move, while rare, mirrors past government interventions in struggling industries like General Motors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that Hong Kong can establish a vital role in the Greater Bay Area by focusing on climate resilience, presenting it as both an environmental necessity and a shrewd economic strategy. With the region's high economic activity and shared exposure to extreme weather, a coordinated approach is crucial for protecting trade, attracting investment, and ensuring sustainable growth. The article advocates for a cross-border early warning system and unified infrastructure standards, highlighting that every dollar invested in resilient infrastructure can generate up to four dollars in benefits. This framework could serve as a global model for other large coastal regions.</p>

          <p>Ether, the cryptocurrency underpinning the Ethereum blockchain, reached a new record high for the first time since 2021, surging significantly after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled potential interest rate cuts. Powell's dovish remarks at Jackson Hole prompted a "panicked repositioning" among traders, leading to substantial short liquidations for ETH and further propelling its price. This rally signifies renewed market momentum for monetary easing, which appears to align with the administration's policy direction. The article highlights Ether's recent outperformance of Bitcoin, largely due to regulatory tailwinds and growing institutional interest in stablecoins, many of which utilize the Ethereum network.

          <p>Wall Street saw one of its strongest days in months, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing over 800 points, after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled a potential shift towards lowering interest rates. Speaking at Jackson Hole, Powell noted that current economic conditions "may warrant adjusting our policy stance," highlighting a significant slowdown in job growth and increasing "downside risks to employment." This indication, despite prior resistance to rate cuts, suggests a change in the Fed's approach. Traders now estimate an 83% chance of a rate cut at the upcoming FOMC meeting, potentially setting the stage for a short-term stock market rally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article outlines three key factors that can unexpectedly reduce Social Security benefits for millions of American retirees, who often rely on these payments as a crucial part of their retirement income. These include the earnings test for those working before full retirement age, automatic deductions for Medicare Part B premiums (especially higher Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amounts for high-income earners), and federal income taxes on benefits if combined income exceeds certain thresholds. Understanding these potential reductions is vital for retirement planning, and the article suggests alternative income strategies like reverse mortgages or part-time work to supplement income.

          <p>Ron Turcotte, the revered Hall of Fame jockey celebrated for guiding Secretariat to horse racing's Triple Crown in 1973, has passed away at 84 due to natural causes. Turcotte's illustrious career included multiple wins in the Kentucky Derby, Preakness, and Belmont Stakes, most notably Secretariat's still-standing record of a 31-length victory in the Belmont. Beyond his racing achievements, he was admired for his courage and advocacy for injured jockeys after a 1978 accident left him paraplegic. Inducted into the National Museum of Racing Hall of Fame in 1979, his impact on the sport is considered immeasurable.</p>

          <p>The North Carolina Supreme Court has delivered favorable rulings, permitting lawsuits filed by bar owners seeking financial compensation from the state for COVID-19 restrictions to move forward. These legal challenges contend that former Governor Roy Cooper's executive orders, which mandated bar closures while allowing restaurants to operate, were discriminatory and unconstitutional. The court's Republican-majority rejected the state's immunity claims, affirming that business owners have the right to present evidence that their constitutional right to earn a living was infringed. This decision allows trials to proceed, potentially resulting in the state paying damages to plaintiffs who suffered economic losses during the pandemic.</p>

Despite its prior success as a streaming hit, industry projections suggest the film could gross $16 million to $22 million, potentially surpassing the official No. 1 movie, "Weapons." However, Netflix continues its policy of not disclosing box office figures, a stance that frustrates industry experts and underscores the streaming giant's often-contentious relationship with traditional cinemas. This theatrical release is primarily viewed as a marketing strategy to leverage the film's viral popularity and boost subscriber engagement.</p>

          <p>This article explains credit card forbearance as a temporary arrangement offered by issuers, allowing borrowers to pause or reduce payments during financial hardship, distinguishing it from debt forgiveness. With credit card balances hitting new highs and delinquencies rising, particularly among younger borrowers, forbearance can provide crucial breathing room. Eligibility typically requires proof of job loss, unexpected expenses, or a history of on-time payments, and proactive outreach to the issuer is essential. For those who don't qualify, alternatives like debt management plans, consolidation loans, balance transfers, or even bankruptcy are suggested to regain control of escalating debt.
