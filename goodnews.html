          <p>Research from Northwestern University suggests that Duavee, a drug used to treat menopause symptoms, may also help prevent breast cancer. A clinical trial involving post-menopausal women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) found that Duavee significantly reduced breast tissue cell growth. Patients taking Duavee also reported fewer hot flashes during the study. Researchers emphasize that these findings are preliminary and more research is needed before the drug can be approved for breast cancer prevention. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price experienced a rebound following a heated online exchange between Elon Musk and President Trump, after the stock closed down 14% on Thursday. Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives remains optimistic about Tesla's future, despite the recent volatility. Musk's net worth reportedly plunged $34 billion due to the fall in Tesla shares. The tension between Musk and Trump does not change Ives' bullish view of the autonomous future, which he values at $1 trillion for Tesla. (not investment advice)</p>
