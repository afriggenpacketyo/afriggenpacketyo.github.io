          <p>North Korea is actively cultivating relationships with Southeast Asian nations, highlighted by recent high-level visits from Vietnamese and Laotian leaders to Pyongyang. The visit by Vietnam's Communist Party General Secretary To Lam was the first by a Vietnamese leader in 18 years, resulting in agreements to boost defense and health care cooperation. Analysts suggest these partnerships provide North Korea with diplomatic legitimacy and potential avenues to bypass international sanctions, while offering its partners limited economic opportunities. These moves illustrate Pyongyang's strategy to diversify its alliances beyond its heavy reliance on China for trade and support.</p>

          <p>Karl Schlögel, a prominent German historian and expert on Eastern Europe, has been awarded the prestigious Peace Prize of the German Book Trade for his extensive work and his vocal support for Ukraine. Schlögel, who was one of the first to warn about Vladimir Putin's expansionist policies, argues that there can be no peace in Europe without a free and independent Ukraine. His selection has sparked debate due to his calls for military support for the nation. Schlögel emphasizes the importance of witnessing the reality of the war and believes the world must remain loyal to the Ukrainian cause.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is scheduled to speak with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng on Friday to continue trade negotiations between the two nations. The call could represent a step toward de-escalating recent tensions, which flared after President Trump threatened a 100% tariff on Chinese imports in response to Beijing's new export controls. Despite the threat, Trump stated he believes the U.S. will "do fine with China" and mentioned a potential meeting with President Xi Jinping in the coming weeks. Bessent has previously expressed respect for his counterpart and indicated a possible trip to Asia for further talks.</p>

          <h2>Meta to Introduce New Parental Controls for Teen Interactions with AI Characters</h2>

          <p>Following an inquiry from the Federal Trade Commission, Meta has announced it will roll out new parental controls for its AI chatbot features early next year. These tools will allow parents to monitor and manage their teenagers' interactions with AI characters, including the ability to block specific bots or disable one-on-one chats entirely. The move comes after reports that Meta's AI chatbots engaged in inappropriate and romantic conversations with children. Meta has since updated its policies to prevent its AI from discussing sensitive topics or engaging in age-inappropriate dialogue with teen users on its platforms.</p>

          <p>Nearly 40 years ago, in 1985, University of Kansas basketball star Lynette Woodard made history by becoming the first woman to join the Harlem Globetrotters. Woodard, who had captained the 1984 U.S. Olympic team to a gold medal, was selected from a group of 60 women who tried out for the team. Inspired by her cousin and Globetrotter Hubert "Geese" Ausbie, she played with the team for two years before continuing her professional career overseas and later in the WNBA. Woodard's groundbreaking achievement paved the way for other female athletes, and today, five women play for the celebrated team.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK court has ruled that the direct-action group Palestine Action can proceed with a High Court challenge against the government's decision to ban it under terrorism laws. The government had attempted to block the judicial review, arguing that a separate, slower appeal process was the proper channel. However, the Court of Appeal decided that a judicial review offers a quicker path to determine the legality of the ban, which criminalizes support for the group. The ruling is seen as a significant victory for the group's co-founder, Huda Ammori, and supporters who have been arrested during protests since the ban was enacted.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Rand Corporation suggests that stabilizing the U.S.-China rivalry is both possible and mutually beneficial, despite ongoing tensions over Taiwan and the South China Sea. The researchers argue that while the two powers are far from resolving their fundamental differences, they should seek ways to coexist and manage their competition to avoid dangerous escalation. The report notes that some rhetoric from Chinese leaders may not be as extreme as portrayed, presenting an opportunity for dialogue. It advises the U.S. to safeguard its interests while simultaneously working to prevent the relationship from descending into extreme conflict.</p>

          <p>China's foreign ministry has expressed deep condolences following the death of former Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, remembering him as an "old friend" of China. Murayama is highly regarded in China for his landmark 1995 statement, which expressed "deep remorse" for Japan's actions during World War II. During his tenure, he became the first sitting Japanese prime minister to visit the Marco Polo Bridge, the site where Japan's full-scale invasion of China began in 1937. A Chinese spokesman praised Murayama as a politician with a strong sense of justice who made significant contributions to China-Japan relations.</p>

          <p>A senior analyst at Moody's Ratings has stated there is little evidence of a systemic problem in the U.S. banking system, despite recent market anxiety over bad loans held by some midsize banks. The concerns were triggered after two regional banks disclosed losses related to bankrupt auto lenders, causing a sector-wide stock sell-off. However, the analyst noted that default rates on high-yield debt remain relatively low and are expected to decline further. The report suggests the U.S. economy has shown resilience, and overall credit quality is in a good position, countering fears of widespread financial contagion. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As energy demand from AI data centers and electrification grows, experts are promoting "demand flexibility" as a key solution to stabilize the U.S. power grid and lower costs. This policy involves rewarding consumers and businesses for reducing electricity use during peak hours or for selling stored energy back to the grid. A recent Duke University study found that such policies could add over 100GW of capacity, equivalent to the expected new demand from data centers by 2035. Proponents argue this approach is a cheaper and faster alternative to building new fossil fuel infrastructure, helping to prevent blackouts and reduce household energy bills.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has disabled the ability for its video generator, Sora, to create deepfake videos of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. following a request from his estate. The company acknowledged that some user-generated content featuring the civil rights leader was "disrespectful." The decision comes amid growing controversy over AI tools being used to create hyper-realistic and often bizarre videos of deceased historical figures and celebrities. While OpenAI has paused images of Dr. King to strengthen its guardrails, the platform still permits the creation of clips featuring other public figures, raising ongoing ethical questions about the use of their likenesses.</p>

          <p>As exchange-traded funds (ETFs) grow in popularity, financial advisors are cautioning investors against common mistakes that can negatively impact long-term financial growth. Key errors include "chasing performance" by buying into funds only after they have peaked and "trend hopping" into volatile thematic ETFs without a clear strategy. Another significant oversight is ignoring expense ratios, as even small differences in fees can compound over time, leading to substantial losses in potential returns. Experts recommend focusing on diversified, low-cost funds that align with individual long-term goals rather than short-term market hype. (not investment advice)</p>
