          <p>This article compares debt forgiveness and debt consolidation as strategies for managing high credit card debt. Debt consolidation combines multiple debts into a single loan with a lower interest rate, while debt forgiveness involves negotiating with creditors to accept less than the full amount owed. The article analyzes the costs, timelines, and credit implications of each approach. It concludes that debt consolidation is preferable for those who can manage the payments and protect their credit, while debt forgiveness may be an option for those facing unmanageable debt and potential bankruptcy (not investment advice).</p>
