          <p>The Kremlin has announced that an agreement has been reached for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in the coming days, although a specific date and location have not been disclosed. The confirmation follows a visit to Moscow by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, which President Trump described as "highly productive" in making progress toward ending the war in Ukraine. This development occurs as an August 8th deadline approaches, which Trump had set for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face severe new sanctions.</p>

Kildunne, who missed the Six Nations victory over France due to injury, is one of eleven changes from the team that recently defeated Spain. Key players like Zoe Harrison at fly-half and captain Zoe Aldcroft are set to start in what will be a crucial test for the squad.

          <p>Saudi Pro League club Al-Hilal has reached an agreement with Liverpool to sign striker Darwin Nunez for a fee of £46.3 million. The 26-year-old Uruguayan international is set to undergo a medical before completing the move. Nunez joined Liverpool in 2022 for an initial fee of £64 million and has scored 40 goals in 143 appearances, but his starting opportunities were limited last season. The sale could provide Liverpool with the financial flexibility to pursue other transfer targets, such as Newcastle's Alexander Isak, during the current window.</p>

          <p>In response to a query about resisting the urge to shop, NPR readers shared various personal strategies for exercising self-control. Common tactics include delaying purchases by leaving items in an online cart for a period or adding them to a forgotten wish list to see if the desire fades. Other creative solutions involve turning shopping into a game of imaginary spending, visiting a library to get a similar 'thrill of the hunt' without cost, or browsing thrift stores for low-cost satisfaction. These tips emphasize mindfulness and intention to combat marketing-driven artificial urgency and consumerism.</p>

          <p>The tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons has transitioned from a niche hobby into a major form of spectator entertainment, with live-play shows selling out large venues like Madison Square Garden. This phenomenon, known as "actual play," features comedians and actors performing games for millions of online viewers, fueling a new golden age for the game. The increased visibility and diverse representation in these shows are attracting new audiences, including more women and people of color, and inspiring more people to start their own D&D groups, expanding the game's reach beyond its traditional base.</p>

          <p>The NFL has officially banned the use of smelling salts by players on the field due to significant safety concerns. The league cited an FDA warning that the ammonia-based substance is not proven to be safe or effective for increasing alertness and can mask the symptoms of a concussion. Inappropriate use of smelling salts can also lead to adverse effects and potentially worsen head injuries by causing a sudden jolt of the head and neck. Despite their popularity among some athletes for a perceived psychological edge, there is no strong evidence they enhance performance.</p>

          <p>Pakistan and China are expanding their technological collaboration into new strategic areas, including nuclear power, space exploration, and artificial intelligence. Following a meeting with Chinese officials, Pakistan's planning minister announced discussions on strengthening cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear technology, particularly for applications in agriculture. This partnership builds on existing projects, such as the two Hualong One nuclear reactors China exported to a facility in Karachi. The expansion signifies a deepening of the strategic alliance between the two nations across multiple high-tech domains.</p>

          <h2>Experts Propose Strategies for Fireproofing Forests in a Warming World</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 03:55:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As global heating increases the frequency and intensity of wildfires, experts are advocating for new forest management strategies to enhance fire resilience. The best natural protection comes from healthy, native deciduous forests, which are less flammable than the dense, monoculture pine or eucalyptus plantations common in many regions. Short-term strategies include reducing fuel loads by clearing dry undergrowth, creating vegetation-free firebreaks, and using controlled burns during cooler months. These proactive measures, combined with rapid detection systems, are crucial for adapting to the growing threat of extreme fires worldwide.</p>

The Japanese conglomerate's fiscal first-quarter profit of 421.8 billion yen far exceeded analyst expectations, signaling a positive turn for its high-profile AI-focused investments. The Vision Fund's performance was bolstered by gains in publicly listed companies like Grab and private investments in Indian firms. This result comes as SoftBank continues an aggressive spending spree on AI, including a major funding round for OpenAI and a proposed acquisition of Ampere Computing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the traditional leadership model based on tight control is ill-suited for tackling today's complex global crises, from climate change to political polarization. The author suggests that leaders, including those in government and institutions, must embrace uncertainty and move away from a 'power over' mentality that stifles creativity and collaboration. By acknowledging what they don't know and resisting fear-based reactions, they can foster more resilient, democratic, and effective solutions. The piece posits that letting go of the illusion of control is essential for meaningful change and navigating an unstable future.</p>

          <p>Danish shipping company Maersk has raised its full-year financial guidance after reporting stronger-than-expected second-quarter profits. The company, a key indicator of global trade, now anticipates higher global container volume growth, citing robust demand driven by a manufacturing boom in China and strong exports worldwide. CEO Vincent Clerc noted that this strong demand is prevalent "pretty much everywhere in the world except for the U.S.," where he suggests the uncertainty around tariffs has had a dampening effect on trade activity. The ongoing disruption in the Red Sea is still expected to persist throughout the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The CEO of Deoleo, the world's largest olive oil producer, has provided an upbeat outlook for the industry, signaling a recovery from a historic crisis. A bumper harvest in Spain has led to a 50% drop in raw material prices, stimulating demand and allowing for lower prices on supermarket shelves. This follows two seasons of poor yields and extreme price volatility caused by climate change and inflation. The company now anticipates a more balanced and normalized market, allowing for increased investment in marketing to ensure olive oil remains a household staple. (not investment advice)</p>
