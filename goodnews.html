          <h2>Dust Storm Blankets Chicago, Prompting Rare Weather Warning</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 00:13:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rare dust storm swept through the Chicago area, significantly reducing visibility and disrupting travel, leading to ground stops at Midway International Airport. The National Weather Service issued only its second-ever dust storm warning for the Chicago office, with this being the first time the warning included the city itself. High winds blowing over dry farmlands caused the dust storm, which forced drivers to pull over on Interstate 55 and disrupted a high school graduation ceremony. While skies cleared within 30 to 45 minutes for most areas, the event highlighted the unusual weather patterns affecting the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tour of the Middle East was marked by honor and respect, with standing ovations, investment pledges, and awards, contrasting with the backlash he faces at home over tariff policies and ethical questions. He announced over $2 trillion in economic investments between the United States and Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, all major purchasers of American military equipment. The trip included campaign-style rallies at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, where he falsely claimed to have won the 2020 election. Gulf leaders praised Trump's shift away from judgment and confrontation towards peace and profit, while Democrats and Republicans approved of his decision to lift sanctions on Syria.</p>

          <p>As the United States and China reduce their investment and presence in Africa, the United Arab Emirates is increasing its influence through significant investments in ports, mines, and renewable energy projects. Emirati corporations have pledged $110 billion in deals since 2019, surpassing commitments from other countries. The UAE's investments align with its strategy to diversify its economy and increase its influence over global supply chains. However, the UAE's political choices, such as its involvement in the Sudan civil war, have raised concerns, even as Washington considers the Emirates a reliable ally in the region.</p>

          <p>This article details the rescue and rehabilitation of children who were victims of the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult, following the 1995 sarin gas attack on Tokyo's subway. Mitsuo Hosaka, a child welfare worker, recounts taking charge of 53 children rescued from the cult's compound, describing their initial state of malnutrition, brainwashing, and fear. Over time, the children gradually began to heal, engaging in team sports and forming bonds with the staff, eventually reintegrating into society. The story emphasizes the importance of addressing the psychological trauma inflicted on these innocent victims and the long-term effects of cult indoctrination on children.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Anthony Scaramucci, SkyBridge Capital founder, believes Bitcoin will be recognized as a full-fledged asset class once its market capitalization matches that of gold, requiring a price of $500,000 per coin. He cited the ongoing influx of capital into Bitcoin ETFs and the adoption of strategies following MicroStrategy's lead as positive indicators. Despite political risks, Scaramucci sees incentives aligning for bipartisan support if Bitcoin reaches this milestone. This bullish outlook aligns with his previous statements that Bitcoin is undergoing a structural transformation, evolving from a volatile tech investment to a maturing global asset akin to digital gold (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Chinese defence scientists are working to transform traditional rocket artillery into a system capable of striking aerial targets. A research team at the National University of Defence Technology has developed a small rocket named Tianxing-1, featuring lift-enhancing wings and adjustable tail fins for extended range and maneuverability. This guided munition operates similarly to hypersonic glide missiles but travels at a slower speed, potentially limiting its ability to chase high-speed aircraft or drones.</p>
