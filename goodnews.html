          <p>Shares of Canadian minerals explorer Trilogy Metals experienced a dramatic premarket surge of over 220% after the White House announced it was taking a 10% stake in the company through a $35.6 million investment. This move is part of a broader U.S. strategy to secure domestic supply chains for critical minerals like copper, cobalt, and zinc, particularly in Alaska's Ambler mining district. The decision reverses a previous administration's rejection of the Ambler Road project, a controversial 211-mile industrial road that opponents argue will harm the Alaskan wilderness and local communities.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 07:41:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study in Uganda has found that treating baby wraps with the insecticide permethrin can dramatically reduce malaria infections in young children. Inspired by the U.S. military's practice of treating uniforms, researchers observed a 65% reduction in malaria cases among babies carried in the treated wraps compared to a control group. This simple, low-cost intervention could provide crucial protection for children under five, who are most vulnerable to the disease, especially during daytime hours when bed nets are not in use. The results are being hailed as a major breakthrough in combating malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a report from the energy think tank Ember, renewable sources like solar and wind became the world's leading source of electricity in the first half of this year. The growth in clean energy was so substantial that it met 100% of the new global electricity demand, even causing a slight decrease in coal and gas usage. However, the report highlights a global divide, with developing nations, particularly China, leading the transition, while developed countries like the U.S. and those in the EU saw an increased reliance on fossil fuels. The International Energy Agency has also halved its forecast for U.S. renewable growth this decade.</p>

Williams, a guitarist, is scheduled to play at the prestigious Carnegie Hall in January alongside opera singer Jonathan Tetelman. In an interview, Williams compared the pressures of music and baseball, noting that both require immense preparation, teamwork, and the ability to perform under pressure. He views the opportunity to play at such a renowned venue as a significant measure of success in his post-baseball life as a musician.</p>

          <p>The Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret, and John M. Martinis for their groundbreaking discoveries related to quantum mechanics in electrical circuits. Their work demonstrated "macroscopic quantum mechanical tunnelling," proving that quantum behaviors previously thought to be purely theoretical could occur in real-world systems. This research has been fundamental to the development of superconducting qubits, which are the building blocks for the powerful quantum computers currently being developed. The laureates' discoveries underpin much of modern advanced technology and are paving the way for a new generation of computation.</p>

In the "Million Dollar One Point Slam," 10 amateurs and 22 professionals will face off, with the winner of a single point advancing to the next round. This innovative format aims to generate excitement and publicity for the Grand Slam event, building on a smaller version held the previous year.

          <p>For the first time in 100 years, pine martens are once again present in Exmoor National Park in the UK, following a conservation effort by the Two Moors Pine Marten Project. Nineteen of the cat-sized mammals were transported from Scotland and released at secret locations, each fitted with a radio collar for monitoring. Conservationists say the return of this native species is a "critical" step toward restoring the woodland ecosystem, as pine martens play an important balancing role. The successful reintroduction is being hailed as a positive sign that nature can be restored and that lost wildlife can be brought back to its rightful habitat.</p>

          <p>U.S. allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific are increasingly cooperating directly with each other, signaling a shift away from total reliance on American leadership. Countries like the U.K., France, Germany, Japan, and Australia are building coalitions to address shared interests in trade, technology, and defense, partly in response to growing U.S. protectionism and geopolitical uncertainty. This includes collaboration on trade agreements like the CPTPP and joint defense projects, such as a next-generation fighter jet. This strategic realignment aims to create a more resilient international order, even as coordinating without the U.S. presents its own challenges.</p>

          <p>California has enacted a new law that requires streaming services to ensure their commercial advertisements are not significantly louder than the programs they accompany. The legislation, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, extends the protections of the federal CALM Act, which applies to broadcast and cable TV, to streaming platforms like Netflix and Hulu. The law was inspired by consumer complaints about blaring ads disrupting the viewing experience, particularly for families with young children. This move makes California the first state to regulate ad volume on streaming services, aiming to create a more consistent and less jarring audio experience for viewers.</p>

          <p>California, led by Attorney General Rob Bonta, has become a primary legal obstacle for the Trump administration, filing 42 lawsuits since the start of the year and winning in approximately 80% of the cases. A recent significant victory was a federal judge's ruling blocking the administration from deploying the California National Guard to Portland, Oregon. These legal challenges have successfully restored over $160 billion in funding for the state and slowed or halted controversial policies on immigration and civil rights. The article portrays California as a key defender of democratic norms, using the court system as a check on federal overreach.</p>

          <p>Firefighters in San Diego County executed a technical rescue of a goat that had become wedged between two large boulders on a farm in Descanso. After falling from a rock, the animal was tightly pinned, and rescuers were unable to coax it out. The team used specialized pressurized air bags, capable of lifting up to 160,000 pounds, to carefully push one of the boulders just enough for the goat to wiggle free. The animal emerged with only a minor injury and was happily reunited with its family, who rely on it for both milk and wildfire prevention through brush grazing.</p>

The show, inspired by the 1950 film "Sunset Boulevard," leads small groups of seven guests through a darkened downtown storefront to explore themes of old Hollywood and artistic exploitation. The creators aim to combine theme park-level art direction with the tactile, personal nature of immersive theater. This project allows them to experiment with storytelling techniques in a scrappy, budget-friendly format for the Halloween season.</p>

          <p>The cast of the play "Jaja’s African Hair Braiding" highlights its role in celebrating the community and labor of West African women, a group rarely represented on major stages. The comedy, set in a Harlem salon, explores the bonds between stylists and their customers while touching on deeper themes of immigration, the American dream, and the scrutiny Black women face over their hair. The actors note that while the play is filled with humor, it also addresses the political turmoil and challenges faced by immigrants. They see their work as a way to tell truthful stories and provide a "balm" of laughter amid a difficult political environment.</p>
