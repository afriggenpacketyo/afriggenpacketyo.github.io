        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Space Force is set to receive a substantial funding increase, potentially reaching nearly $40 billion by 2026, as part of a major tax and spending package. A significant portion of these funds is allocated for an 'initial investment' in the 'Golden Dome' multi-layered missile defense system, covering interceptors and advanced sensors. While the project's overall cost and viability have been questioned, it represents a major investment in achieving 'space superiority' and provides a boost for defense and space contractors. The bill also includes funding for Mars exploration, though it has drawn sharp criticism from figures like Elon Musk over its impact on national debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Pop Mart's Growth Expected to Withstand Chinese Scrutiny of 'Blind Box' Toys</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 02:43:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite Chinese state media calling for tighter regulation of 'blind box' toys, analysts are confident that industry leader Pop Mart will remain resilient. The company's stock, which has surged over the past year, is expected to weather potential headwinds because its primary customers are young adults, not the minors targeted by the proposed regulations. Furthermore, Pop Mart is rapidly expanding its overseas sales, which already account for a significant portion of its revenue and are projected to grow substantially. The company's success highlights the 'dopamine economy' appeal of its products, though it still faces challenges like production delays and counterfeit goods.</p>

          <h2>Experts Believe Meteor Fragments May Have Landed in Scottish Highlands</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 02:15:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A small meteor that streaked across the UK sky has likely scattered fragments across the west Highlands of Scotland, according to experts. The UK Meteor Network (UKMON) tracked the object, which traveled from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and calculated that pieces could be found in a vast area between Loch Treig and Loch Etricht. Dozens of people reported seeing an orange glow and hearing a loud bang, with some residents near Ben Nevis feeling their houses shake. UKMON has appealed to the public, especially hillwalkers, to look for the meteorites, though acknowledges the search will be difficult in the remote, mountainous terrain.</p>

          <p>At a rally in Iowa, President Donald Trump celebrated the passage of his 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' a sweeping tax-and-spend package, calling it a perfect birthday present for America ahead of July Fourth. He used the event, officially the start of the 'America 250' celebration, to outline future commemorative events, including a UFC championship fight on the White House lawn and a traveling 'Great American State Fair.' During the campaign-style speech, Trump also repeated false claims of a stolen election, attacked the media, and made a notable policy shift by suggesting he would allow some migrant farm laborers to remain in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Following an impressive victory over a former champion, British tennis player Emma Raducanu is set to face world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the third round of Wimbledon. This match represents a significant test for Raducanu, who has acknowledged the need to add more 'weapons' to her game to compete with the sport's top elite. Sabalenka, the tournament favorite, is known for her powerful baseline game and has been a dominant force on the WTA Tour. Raducanu hopes that playing on home turf will help her rise to the challenge and bridge the gap to the very top of the sport.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a plan to host a Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) event on the grounds of the White House as part of the nation's 250th-anniversary celebrations next year. The president, a longtime friend of UFC CEO Dana White and a frequent attendee at fights, said the event would be a 'championship fight' for 20,000 to 25,000 spectators. The White House press secretary confirmed that the president is 'dead serious' about the idea. This unconventional event is one of several initiatives Trump previewed for the 'America 250' commemoration, which also includes a national state fair.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated that he 'understands what anchors' U.S. President Donald Trump, saying they have found common ground through shared family values. In a recent interview, Starmer revealed that this good personal relationship was instrumental in securing a vital trade deal that removed UK industries from sweeping U.S. tariffs. He recounted how Trump had called to console him after his brother's death, highlighting a personal connection that he believes helps him navigate their different political backgrounds for the UK's national interest. Starmer emphasized that building such international relationships is a crucial part of his role.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Dustin May had what may have been his best start of the season, leading the team to a 6-2 victory and a series sweep against the Chicago White Sox. The right-hander pitched into the eighth inning for the first time in his career, taking a perfect game into the sixth and striking out nine batters. May has become a crucial and dependable workhorse for a Dodgers rotation that has been decimated by injuries this season. His performance provided a much-needed lift for the team and demonstrated his potential when his 'electric stuff' is combined with strong command.</p>

          <p>The Australian hearing-technology company Cochlear has introduced its new smart implant system in China, making it one of the first global markets to receive the device. Unlike traditional hearing aids that amplify sound, this implant works by bypassing damaged cells in the inner ear to directly stimulate the auditory nerve. The system is designed to help users with severe to profound hearing loss for whom conventional aids are no longer effective. The launch represents a significant step in bringing advanced hearing solutions to the large and growing Chinese market.</p>

          <p>In a significant scientific advance, a team of Chinese scientists has successfully grown a beating heart structure containing human cells within a pig embryo. The researchers reprogrammed human stem cells to improve their survival and then implanted them into pig embryos, which were transferred to surrogate sows. The resulting chimeric heart structure continued to develop and beat for 21 days, marking a major step forward in the field of interspecies organogenesis. This research, which follows the team's earlier success with growing human kidneys in pigs, could have long-term implications for organ transplantation.</p>
