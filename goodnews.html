          <p>Collaborative design software company Figma has officially filed for an initial public offering, planning to trade under the ticker "FIG" on the NYSE. The move comes after a proposed $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated due to regulatory hurdles, resulting in a $1 billion fee for Figma. The company's prospectus reveals strong growth, with a 46% revenue increase in the first quarter and over 450,000 customers. In a letter to investors, CEO Dylan Field emphasized the benefits of going public, including increased brand awareness and allowing the community to share in the company's ownership.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France has enacted a new law significantly expanding its ban on smoking to include most public outdoor spaces such as beaches, parks, and areas near schools and libraries. The measure aims to "denormalize" smoking, particularly among young people, and reduce the public health impact of tobacco, which causes 75,000 deaths annually in the country. Violators of the new rules could face fines up to 700 euros. While smoking has been prohibited in indoor public spaces since 2008, this law marks a major step in further restricting it, though outdoor caf√© terraces remain one of the last refuges for smokers.</p>

          <p>The decision by Republican Senator Thom Tillis not to seek reelection has intensified the 2026 Senate race in North Carolina, creating an open-seat contest. On the Republican side, potential candidates being discussed include the president's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, who confirmed she would consider a run. For the Democrats, former Governor Roy Cooper is strongly considering entering the race and is seen as a top contender. The development provides a key opportunity for Democrats to flip a Senate seat, while Republicans are focused on finding a candidate who can hold it for their party in the crucial midterm election.</p>

This measure is part of a broader effort by parent company Match Group to combat scams, fraud, and fake accounts on the platform.

          <p>Oklahoma City Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has signed a four-year, $285-million contract extension, giving him the richest average annual salary in sports history at $71.25 million. This mega-deal underscores the financial power of the NBA, where smaller roster sizes allow players to earn a larger share of revenue compared to leagues like the NFL and MLB. While MLB players like Shohei Ohtani and Juan Soto have larger total contract values due to their length, top NBA players consistently command higher annual salaries.

          <p>Shares of clean energy companies, including NextEra Energy and AES, saw a significant increase after a proposed tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the final Senate version of the Republican budget bill. The tax would have applied to projects using components from foreign entities like China and could have cost the industry up to $7 billion. While the removal of the tax was a relief to the industry, the bill still phases out key investment and production tax credits that have been crucial for the growth of renewable energy in the U.S., making the legislation's overall impact a concern.

FBI Director Kash Patel described the move as cost-effective and a step into a "new era" for the agency.

The judge ruled that the sale to Wojcicki's nonprofit was the best path forward, as it would honor customers' rights and improve privacy practices. 23andMe, once valued at $6 billion, struggled with recurring revenue and a 2023 data breach.</p>
