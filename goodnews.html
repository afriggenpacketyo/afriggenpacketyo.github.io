          <p>Shares of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker BYD experienced a significant drop of over 8% following the company's announcement of price cuts on multiple models. The price reductions, aimed at boosting sales, have sparked concerns among investors about increased competition and a potential price war within the EV sector. Analysts anticipate a surge in foot traffic at BYD's dealership stores, and while other Chinese automakers also saw their shares decline, analysts remain optimistic about robust sales growth for new energy vehicle companies with prices below 200,000 Chinese yuan.

          <p>Japan has initiated sales of government rice stockpiles through direct contracts, aiming to reduce soaring prices to approximately 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. This measure comes in response to public criticism of the government's handling of rising rice prices, which have nearly doubled in recent months. The agriculture ministry has established a special response team to address the issue and prevent consumers from turning away from rice products, with the new approach bypassing the auction system to exert greater control over prices.</p>

This approach, which gained renewed attention under President Trump's administrations, requires multiple sales, arm's length transactions, proof of U.S. destination, and documentation of the first sale price.

          <p>A Chinese study has discovered that sleep serves as the brain's nightly repair mechanism, flushing out harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. The research deciphers how hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ), a reactive by-product of metabolism, acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. This breakthrough not only solves a long-standing mystery of why sleep is biologically essential but also opens pathways for therapies targeting oxidative stress to combat sleep disorders.</p>
