          <p>Following Elon Musk's announcement of expanding Tesla's robotaxi service, California regulators have clarified the company's limitations within the state. The California Public Utilities Commission stated that Tesla is not permitted to operate autonomous passenger transport and that any service must use non-autonomous vehicles with a human driver. This clarification comes as Tesla plans to extend its car service to "friends and family" in the Bay Area, highlighting the ongoing regulatory hurdles for its autonomous driving ambitions.</p>

          <p>Disgraced former New York Congressman George Santos has surrendered to a federal correctional facility in New Jersey to begin his 87-month prison sentence. Santos pleaded guilty to wire fraud and identity theft charges stemming from his 2022 campaign, where he fabricated his background to defraud donors and voters. Prosecutors stated he used campaign funds for personal enrichment, including luxury goods and Botox. After his sentencing, Santos publicly appealed to President Trump for a future pardon.</p>

          <p>The owner of a small salon in Leicester is facing a crucial hearing in her trademark dispute with the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal. Rebecca Dowdeswell's attempt to re-register her business name, "nkd," was opposed by L'Oréal, which owns the "Naked" trademark for an eyeshadow range and claims the similar name would confuse consumers. Despite having spent over £30,000 in legal fees, Dowdeswell remains determined to fight for her brand's name, which she has used for 15 years without any reported customer confusion.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has led to a significant increase in the populations of certain insects, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The boom is partly attributed to a surge in aphids, a key food source, which thrived in the warm conditions. However, experts warn that the concurrent lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year, as wetland habitats are drying up, potentially preventing eggs from being laid and surviving.</p>

          <p>An Illinois federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration that challenged Chicago's sanctuary city laws. The suit argued that the city's policies, which limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents, illegally obstruct federal immigration enforcement. In her ruling, the judge sided with the city, a decision praised by Chicago's mayor and Illinois' governor, who stated that the policies enhance public safety by allowing police to focus on local needs rather than federal immigration matters.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society explores the story of the Hollywood blacklist, which began in 1947 with investigations by the House Un-American Activities Committee. The exhibit focuses on the "Hollywood Ten," a group of writers and directors who were imprisoned and blacklisted for refusing to answer questions about their political affiliations. The display highlights how the anti-Communist fervor ruined careers, compelled individuals like Walt Disney and Ronald Reagan to testify, and created a climate of fear that extended beyond Hollywood.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's relationship with golf is multifaceted, serving as a competitive outlet, a business enterprise, and a tool for diplomacy and networking. Unlike other presidents who used the sport as a diversion, Trump integrates it into his political and business life, hosting allies and world leaders at his international courses. This article explores his passion for the game, his reputation as a fierce competitor, and how his golf properties, while sometimes unprofitable, provide prestige and a private venue for high-stakes conversations away from public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are undertaking a rescue mission to save the state's bighorn sheep, whose population has been halved in the last five years due to disease. The disease spread from non-native animals brought to the region. In a recent effort, biologists captured and airlifted dozens of healthy sheep, including pregnant ewes, from the last disease-free herd. They were relocated over 200 miles to an isolated, safe mountain range, where recent observations have confirmed the presence of newborn lambs, signaling hope for the species' recovery.</p>

          <p>This article explores the science and expert opinions behind common daily health targets, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting 10,000 steps, and sleeping eight hours. While some goals, like getting at least seven hours of sleep, are strongly supported by evidence for long-term health, others have more flexibility. Experts suggest that while benchmarks are useful guides, it is more important to be consistent and adapt healthy practices to one's own lifestyle rather than rigidly fixating on achieving every numerical target, which can sometimes create unnecessary stress.</p>

Pulido, who studied political science before his music career, aims to challenge incumbent Republican Rep. Monica De La Cruz, accusing her of prioritizing party politics over her constituents. He plans to host "ranch halls" to connect with voters and address issues like the economy, healthcare, and what he calls unfair redistricting that has diluted the Latino vote in the region.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, focusing on health issues unique to female athletes that were previously overlooked. Researchers are studying how breast biomechanics affect performance and how proper sports bras can provide a competitive edge. There is also growing research and open discussion about the menstrual cycle's impact on training and competition, as well as why female athletes face a higher risk of certain injuries, like ACL tears. This shift marks a departure from an era where female athletes were often treated as "mini-men."</p>

This debris poses a potential risk to orbiting satellites and any future lunar infrastructure. The scenario is prompting planetary defense experts to consider expanding their monitoring to include threats to the moon.</p>
