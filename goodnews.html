          <p>In Formula 1, Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the British Grand Prix in a tight qualifying session. He narrowly beat the McLaren team, with Oscar Piastri securing a career-best second place and his teammate Lando Norris finishing third. Verstappen noted that tricky, shifting wind conditions made the high-speed Silverstone circuit challenging, but his final lap was sufficient to top the time sheets ahead of the competitive McLarens.</p>

          <p>A phenomenon known as 'tipflation' is causing confusion and social pressure for consumers as the norms around tipping rapidly change. Digital payment systems increasingly present pre-calculated tip options in a wide range of service environments where gratuities were not previously standard. The article delves into the history of tipping, the psychological factors that influence it, and how modern technology is fundamentally reshaping these long-standing social and economic customs for both customers and workers.</p>

          <p>The Hamas terrorist group has issued what it describes as a 'positive response' to the latest U.S.-mediated proposal for a two-month ceasefire in its war with Israel. While the group stated it is prepared to enter negotiations on the framework's implementation, officials indicate Hamas is seeking firm guarantees of a permanent end to hostilities. President Trump expressed optimism about the development, suggesting a potential deal could be reached within the next week.</p>

          <h2>Can TikTok's Viral 'Cortisol Cocktail' Actually Reduce Stress? Experts Are Skeptical</h2>

          <p>A viral TikTok trend promoting a 'cortisol cocktail'—a non-alcoholic drink made with ingredients like coconut water, orange juice, and magnesium—claims to help lower the body's stress hormones. However, medical experts interviewed for this article express skepticism, clarifying that there is no scientific evidence to support these claims. While the drink is likely harmless for most people and can aid hydration, doctors emphasize that managing cortisol levels is a complex process not influenced by such simple concoctions.</p>

The machine, found in a New York basement, is a pivotal artifact in the history of East Asian computing. Its ingenious design, which organized thousands of complex characters by shape rather than phonetics, established the fundamental concepts that underpin how Chinese, Japanese, and Korean are typed on computers today.</p>

          <p>An Arizona renter received a $4,000 fine from his property management company after posting negative online reviews, a penalty outlined in a 'non-disparagement' clause within his 21-page lease. This practice is likely illegal under the 2016 federal Consumer Review Fairness Act, which protects a consumer's right to share honest feedback without fear of retaliation. The incident highlights the issue of businesses using unenforceable 'gag clauses' in contracts to suppress criticism and what legal recourse consumers have.</p>

          <p>Author and happiness researcher Mo Gawdat is promoting a '90-second rule' as a technique for better managing feelings of anger and stress. The rule is based on neuroscientific insight that the body's physiological stress response to a trigger, such as a surge in cortisol, only lasts for about 90 seconds. After that initial period, any prolonged negative emotion is the result of consciously or unconsciously replaying the thought, giving individuals a window to choose to refocus.</p>

          <p>This article examines the shifting motivations behind exercise, advocating for a move away from a singular focus on weight loss and aesthetics. It suggests that finding a form of movement that one genuinely enjoys, whether it be weightlifting, group fitness, or running, is key to building a sustainable and healthy habit. By reframing exercise as a source of strength, community, or mental clarity, individuals can develop a more positive and empowering relationship with their bodies and physical activity.</p>
