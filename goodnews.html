          <p>Southern California is bracing for an early-season storm next week, with widespread and beneficial rainfall expected to peak on Tuesday. The National Weather Service predicts 0.5 to 1.5 inches of rain for Los Angeles and Ventura counties, with higher amounts in mountainous areas, from Monday night until Wednesday. While minor road flooding is possible and burn scar areas face some flash flood risk, the storm is not expected to end the wildfire season. This unusually deep low-pressure system will also bring significantly cooler temperatures and strong wind gusts, requiring residents to monitor forecasts.</p>

          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old British army horse, has been retired to The Horse Trust sanctuary after sustaining a broken bone and serious bleeding during a dramatic runaway incident in London last year. Quaker was one of five Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment horses spooked by construction noise, leading them to gallop through the city streets, causing minor injuries to several people and soldiers.

          <p>Scottish National Party (SNP) members have overwhelmingly backed First Minister John Swinney's strategy to seek a mandate for a second independence referendum if the party secures a majority of seats in next year's Holyrood election.

While some grassroots members pushed for the 2026 election to be a de-facto independence vote, Swinney emphasized his commitment to delivering independence through a clear electoral majority.

          <p>Generation Z is increasingly rejecting "fast furniture," a trend of cheap, mass-produced home decor, in favor of secondhand and sustainable options. This article highlights a growing awareness of furniture's significant carbon footprint, with over 95% of globally consumed furniture eventually discarded due to non-recyclable materials and rapidly changing styles. Young consumers, like Daniel Santos, are finding emotional connections with refurbished antiques and utilizing platforms like Facebook Marketplace for eco-conscious purchases.
