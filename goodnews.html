          <p>Air Canada is set to resume flights after the Canadian government ordered an end to a strike by over 10,000 flight attendants that caused widespread cancellations. The government invoked federal labor laws to force binding arbitration, citing the need to protect the economy and supply chains during a period of international trade tension. While the airline works to stabilize its schedule over the next week, the flight attendants' union has criticized the intervention as a violation of workers' rights, as key issues like pay and compensation for ground time remain unresolved.</p>

          <p>A derelict Napoleonic-era fortress on Thorne Island in Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been fully renovated and is now on the market for £3 million. The new owner, Mike Conner, purchased the abandoned property in 2017 and undertook a challenging five-year restoration project to transform it into a modern space with 40 beds and a nightclub. The historic fort, originally built to defend against French naval attacks, now represents a unique piece of real estate, blending Victorian military architecture with luxury amenities for private events.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm after briefly intensifying to a powerful Category 5. The storm is currently located north of the Caribbean, bringing heavy rain and strong winds to Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the Turks and Caicos Islands, where a tropical storm warning is in effect. While forecasters note the storm is undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle, which can cause fluctuations in intensity, current models predict it will remain offshore and not directly impact the U.S. mainland.</p>

          <p>Germany's coalition government is facing internal division over how to expand its armed forces, the Bundeswehr, to meet NATO personnel targets. The center-left SPD, led by Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, has proposed an enhanced voluntary service model, while their center-right CDU/CSU partners argue for a return to compulsory military service, which was suspended in 2011. The current draft law would require all 18-year-old men to complete a questionnaire about their willingness to serve, but critics argue this falls short of ensuring Germany's defense capabilities amid a tense security climate.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued in a dramatic helicopter operation after being trapped behind a powerful waterfall in Tulare County, California, for two days. The man, an experienced rappeller, was pushed off his lines by the river's strong currents and became stranded in a cave behind the water. After he was reported missing, search crews used a drone to locate him and a highway patrol helicopter successfully hoisted him to safety. He was treated for dehydration and minor injuries in what authorities called a "stunning survival story."</p>

          <p>As the total cost of attendance at some U.S. colleges approaches $100,000 per year, a report identifies nine institutions that charge no tuition for their students. These schools, which include Berea College, College of the Ozarks, and all five U.S. military service academies, typically have highly selective admissions standards. In exchange for a debt-free education, students are often required to participate in work-study programs or commit to several years of military service after graduation, offering an alternative path to higher education for those concerned with affordability.</p>

          <p>Three years after the launch of ChatGPT, generative AI has become a standard tool for a majority of university students, fundamentally altering the landscape of higher education. Students increasingly use AI not just for efficiency but to manage heavy workloads and high expectations for extracurricular achievement, viewing it as a pragmatic necessity. The article notes that many faculty members have been slow to adapt, with some reverting to in-class, handwritten assignments, while students express a desire for more innovative, project-based learning that better reflects a world where AI is a given.</p>

          <p>The NoMa (North of Massachusetts Avenue) neighborhood in Washington, D.C., once an industrial area known as "Swampoodle," has been transformed into one of the city's fastest-growing residential and commercial districts.

By rebranding and redeveloping the area around the city's main train station, planners have created a dense, modern urban hub from a previously underutilized zone.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This personal essay reflects on how a deeper appreciation for Renaissance art can develop through life experience, moving beyond a youthful dismissal of its religious themes. The author describes how events like trauma, pregnancy, and motherhood opened up the emotional complexity of works by artists like Piero della Francesca and Michelangelo, making them profoundly resonant. The article connects this artistic empathy to a broader willingness to be moved by the pain of others, suggesting that great art's power lies in its ability to mirror universal human struggles and emotions.</p>

          <p>A Phoenix cold case detective successfully obtained a DNA sample from a murder suspect during a staged meeting at a Chili's restaurant in 2015, leading to the capture of the "canal killer." The suspect, Bryan Patrick Miller, was known locally for dressing as a "Zombie Hunter" character at festivals. An undercover operation secured Miller's DNA from a water glass, which matched evidence from the brutal murders of two women in the early 1990s. Miller was subsequently convicted and sentenced to death in 2023.</p>

The exhibition, organized in collaboration with Moscow's State Tretyakov Gallery, is designed to emphasize the artist's "Russianness" and connection to St. Petersburg. This framing comes as Ukraine's Ministry of Culture has asserted that Repin's works are part of its own national cultural heritage, highlighting the cultural dimensions of the ongoing geopolitical tensions.</p>
