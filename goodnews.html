          <p>Kelly Stafford, wife of Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, revealed on her podcast that she sometimes uses THC gummies to help her be a better parent. She stated that the gummies help her calm down after a long day and prevent her from getting frustrated with her four young daughters. Kelly acknowledged feeling a bit guilty admitting it, but her husband supports her, saying that as long as the children are in bed, fed, happy, and loved, it doesn't matter how they get there. A recent study suggests that edible cannabis has similar cardiovascular risks to smoking marijuana for long-term users.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve announced it would hold its benchmark interest rate steady, continuing its "wait-and-see" approach amid the Trump administration's economic policies. The central bank expects inflation to worsen but still foresees two interest rate cuts by the end of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited solid labor market conditions and continued economic growth but noted uncertainty remains elevated, particularly due to the administration's tariffs, which are likely to drive up inflation and slow growth. The Fed will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved lenacapavir, a drug with the potential to drastically curb the HIV epidemic, for HIV prevention. Clinical trial data suggest that two injections a year provide near-complete protection against HIV infection. Marketed as Yeztugo, this twice-yearly injection offers a more convenient alternative to the current standard of care, a daily pill called Truvada. However, the cost of the drug, roughly $28,000 a year, could price out many, and the Trump administration's steep cuts to foreign aid could prevent people in countries with the highest HIV burden from benefiting.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved Gilead's twice-yearly antiviral injection, lenacapavir (Yeztugo), for preventing HIV. The injection has demonstrated the potential to significantly reduce new HIV infections.

The annual list price for Yeztugo is $28,218 in the U.S., but Gilead has programs to reduce out-of-pocket payments for insured patients and provide the injection for free to eligible uninsured people. The company has also granted licenses to generic manufacturers to produce lower-cost versions in lower-income countries.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans largely support President Trump's handling of the conflict between Iran and Israel, trusting his judgment on whether the U.S. should get involved. However, the issue has divided Trump's MAGA base, with some emphasizing his promise to avoid foreign wars. Senator Lindsey Graham supports using force if diplomatic efforts fail, while others agree that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. Democrats advocate for de-escalation and negotiations, rather than inflaming the conflict. Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that the U.S. should be helping de-escalate, pushing for negotiations, not trying to set more things afire.</p>

          <p>If the U.S. were to drop a "bunker buster" bomb on Iran's Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, experts suggest that the risk of widespread contamination would be low. The site processes uranium isotopes, primarily in the form of uranium hexafluoride gas, which is heavy and unlikely to travel far. While there are concerns about the gas reacting with water to form hydrofluoric acid, the underground location and the collapse of the mountain above it would likely inhibit any significant environmental release.

As part of the agreement, Nippon Steel will invest around $11 billion by 2028 and Americans will make up the majority of U.S. Steel's board.
