          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced that the UK's Autumn Budget will take place on November 26, where she will outline the government's tax and spending plans. This announcement comes as the government faces mounting pressure to stabilize public finances while fostering economic growth, with economists suggesting tax hikes or spending cuts may be necessary. Reeves stated the budget's focus would be on investing in the economy and ensuring working people are better off. The government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, will now prepare its economic assessment of the proposed policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Proposed changes to English cricket's County Championship, originally planned for 2026, may be delayed until 2027 or scrapped entirely due to a lack of consensus among the 18 first-class counties. While a reduction in the T20 Blast was agreed upon, proposals to cut the Championship from 14 to 12 matches were rejected. The current debate centers on whether to maintain the 14-game season or adopt a 13-game structure with a revised divisional format. The difficulty in reaching an agreement has raised the possibility of postponing any structural changes to ensure the best decision is made for the domestic game.</p>

          <h2>Alphabet Shares Surge After Google Avoids Forced Divestiture in Antitrust Ruling</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-03 08:56:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alphabet's stock price increased by 6% after a U.S. district judge ruled against the Department of Justice's most severe proposals in its antitrust case against Google. The ruling means Google will not be forced to divest its Chrome browser or Android operating system, which investors viewed as a major victory for the company. While found to have an illegal monopoly in internet search, Google can still make payments to companies like Apple to be the default search engine, though exclusive contracts are now barred. This outcome removes a significant overhang on the stock and is seen as reinforcing the long-term durability of Google's core search business. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the evolution of how children have been depicted in art, from religious icons in the Middle Ages to symbols of dynastic ambition and, eventually, subjects of personal affection. Initially, art featured children primarily as religious figures like Jesus or as cherubs, before royalty began commissioning portraits to showcase their heirs for political marriages. As the bourgeoisie rose, they emulated this practice, often dressing their children in idealized costumes. The concept of a modern, unburdened childhood only emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries, leading to more spontaneous and playful depictions that continue to evolve with photography and social media.</p>

This optimistic outlook is based on factors such as a large stock of available homes in major cities and the anticipated start of the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate-cut cycle.

          <p>In an optimistic season preview, this opinion article predicts that the Los Angeles Rams will exceed expectations and make it to the Super Bowl. The author dismisses concerns about quarterback Matthew Stafford's health and the offensive line, instead highlighting the team's ascending young defense and bolstered receiving corps with the addition of Davante Adams. Citing the coaching brilliance of Sean McVay and a relatively weak schedule, the piece projects the Rams will win at least 11 games. The argument is framed by the team's strong finish last season, where they narrowly lost to the eventual champions in a close playoff game.</p>
