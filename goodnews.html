          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales, along with their three children, are planning to move to Forest Lodge, an eight-bedroom home in Windsor Great Park. This move from their current residence at Adelaide Cottage is seen as an opportunity for a "fresh start" following a challenging period that included the princess's cancer diagnosis and treatment. The family views this as a long-term relocation, intending for Forest Lodge to be their permanent family home, even when Prince William becomes king. The move is being funded privately, and the couple will pay market rent on the property, continuing their preference for a private family life without live-in staff.</p>

          <p>In Phoenix, Arizona, architect Brian Stark is repurposing old shipping containers to create sustainable and rapidly deployable housing for the city's unhoused population. His "X-WING" shelters, developed with Steel + Spark, consist of four containers arranged in an 'X' shape, creating five individual, air-conditioned rooms and shared courtyard spaces. These solar-powered units can be constructed in just one week, offering a cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution to the growing homelessness crisis. Stark is now planning a larger, 105-unit apartment complex for low-income seniors, aiming to further address the affordable housing shortage with his innovative designs.</p>

          <p>Millions of AT&T customers affected by two major data breaches in 2024 can now file claims as part of a proposed $177 million class-action settlement. The breaches exposed the personal information of 73 million account holders and the call and text records of nearly all cellular customers. Eligible individuals could receive up to $7,500 in compensation for documented losses traceable to the incidents, with a claim deadline of November 18, 2025. The settlement awaits final court approval, which is scheduled for a hearing in December 2025, meaning payments will not be disbursed until after that date.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Judy Faulkner, the 82-year-old founder and CEO of Epic Systems, a dominant force in electronic health record software with $5.7 billion in annual revenue. Operating from a whimsical, 1,670-acre campus in Wisconsin, Faulkner has built her empire by rejecting venture capital, acquisitions, and going public, focusing instead on long-term stability and customer needs. Described as a mix between Bill Gates and Willy Wonka, she has created a unique corporate culture and established a trust to ensure the company remains private after her death. Despite criticism over software usability and interoperability, her approach has made Epic a cornerstone of the U.S. healthcare system.</p>

          <p>In their first head-to-head 100m race since the Paris Olympics, Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson defeated American rival Noah Lyles at the Silesia Diamond League meet. Thompson clocked a time of 9.87 seconds, matching the meet record, while Lyles finished second at 9.90 seconds. The victory serves as a measure of revenge for Thompson, who lost the Olympic gold to Lyles by a mere five-thousandths of a second in a photo finish a year prior. Despite the loss, Lyles expressed confidence in his performance as a stepping stone toward the upcoming world championships in Tokyo, where both athletes are expected to be top contenders.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man, Ryan Wardwell, was rescued after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area of California. Wardwell was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the intense force of the water pushed him off his lines, leaving him stranded. After he was reported missing, a search operation involving a dive team and a drone located him alive and responsive. A California Highway Patrol helicopter successfully hoisted him to safety, and he was treated for minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>

          <p>A top scientist from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has called for China to intensify its efforts in developing space-based solar power to compete with the United States. This technology involves orbiting facilities that collect solar energy and transmit it to Earth via microwaves, offering a continuous power source unaffected by weather or nighttime. The academic, Ge Changchun, argued that China's current research, led by universities, lacks the capacity for such a large-scale project and requires a top-down national strategy. The push aims to close the technological gap with the U.S., which has been experimenting with this concept since the 1970s.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the concept of "Lighthouse Parenting" as a healthier alternative to the prevalent trend of intensive, hands-on parenting. Coined by pediatrician Kenneth Ginsburg, the approach encourages parents to act as a steady, guiding presence for their children rather than controlling every aspect of their lives. This method aims to build confidence and resilience in children by allowing them to navigate challenges independently while knowing support is available. The article contrasts this with the exhausting and potentially damaging effects of constant parental intervention, which can stem from a biological instinct to prevent children from struggling.</p>

This seizure is in addition to £2.7 million previously confiscated from the brothers in December 2024 for failing to pay taxes on business revenues. Authorities stated the recovered money will be reinvested into crime prevention and victim support programs within the community.</p>

          <p>Sadie Salazar, a therapist and COO of Sage Therapy, emphasizes the importance of a consistent morning ritual to ground herself and prepare for the day. Her single non-negotiable rule is waking up when her alarm goes off, which she says prevents feeling rushed and chaotic. This extra time is dedicated to non-work activities like reading, listening to a podcast, or walking her dog, allowing for creativity and rejuvenation. Salazar advises against overly rigid routines, suggesting that flexibility within this dedicated morning time helps avoid feelings of failure and sets a positive tone for the rest of the day.</p>

          <p>Samsung is challenging Apple's dominance in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is partly driven by the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold 7, which offer new form factors compared to the standard iPhone design. While Apple still leads, its recent stock underperformance reflects this renewed competition. Analysts suggest Apple may respond by launching its own slimmer and potentially foldable iPhone models in the coming years to reclaim momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

Kennedy also stresses the power of positive self-talk to reframe difficult situations as part of a process rather than a failure. Finally, she recommends taking on small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone, which gradually teaches your body and mind to tolerate discomfort and build resilience.</p>
