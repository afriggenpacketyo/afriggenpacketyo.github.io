          <h2>Patti LuPone Apologizes for Comments Following Broadway Community Backlash</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 19:08:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Broadway icon Patti LuPone has issued a public apology after facing criticism from the Broadway community for her remarks directed at Kecia Lewis and Audra McDonald. The apology came in response to an open letter signed by over 500 Broadway performers, condemning LuPone's "inappropriate and unacceptable public comments." The controversy stemmed from an interview where LuPone disparaged Lewis's self-identification as a veteran and made dismissive remarks about McDonald, stemming from noise complaints during performances of "Hell's Kitchen." LuPone expressed regret for her words, acknowledging they were inappropriate and ran counter to the values of the theater community, and hoped to personally apologize to both Lewis and McDonald.</p>

          <p>Following PSG's Champions League victory against Inter Milan, former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha and journalist Nicky Bandini have shared their positive assessments of the new league format. Onuoha highlighted the increased number of good games and big moments, noting that teams only played each other once in the league stage, which changed the energy and dynamics of the matches. Bandini pointed out that the format allowed PSG to develop throughout the season, providing a more entertaining journey for the team and fans, and that it benefits teams by not mattering if they don't make the top eight.</p>
