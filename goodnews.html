          <p>The White House is restructuring the National Security Council (NSC), resulting in staff reductions and reassignments, weeks after Secretary of State Marco Rubio replaced Mike Waltz as national security adviser. Some NSC staff are being moved to other positions within the administration, while others are being placed on administrative leave. Andy Baker, Vice President JD Vance's national security adviser, and White House deputy chief of staff Robert Gabriel are taking top roles as deputy national security advisers. These changes reflect a desire to streamline the NSC and ensure staff loyalty, though some former members express concern about reduced control of the bureaucracy.</p>

          <p>Four top partners at Paul Weiss law firm, including prominent Democratic lawyer Karen Dunn, are leaving to form their own firm following Paul Weiss's controversial decision to make a deal with President Trump to avoid an executive order restricting its business. The departing partners, Karen Dunn, Bill Isaacson, Jeannie Rhee, and Jessica Phillips, are forming their own law firm, with Dunn having played a key role in debate preparation for prominent Democratic figures. The decision to make a deal with Trump led to widespread criticism of Paul Weiss, with some associates, other firms, and Democrats decrying the firm's capitulation to the president.</p>

          <p>Following discussions with U.S. Cabinet members, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that the United States is increasingly acknowledging Japan's economic significance. Akazawa engaged in discussions with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, focusing on trade, non-tariff barriers, and economic security. The two countries agreed to expedite trade negotiations, but it is unlikely that Japan will obtain substantial concessions. While Japan continues to advocate for the elimination of additional tariffs, the Trump administration appears steadfast in its tariff stance.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming tour, including all scheduled concerts up to early July 2026, after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). The condition, exacerbated by recent performances, has caused issues with his hearing, vision, and balance, leading his doctor to advise him to refrain from performing and undergo physical therapy. NPH is a brain condition characterized by a buildup of fluid inside or around the brain, disrupting certain brain-related functions. Joel is looking forward to returning to the stage when he is able, and fans who purchased tickets will be automatically refunded.</p>

          <p>A 443-foot container ship ran aground in Norway, stopping just feet away from a cabin while the owner was asleep, with reports suggesting the helmsman was also asleep at the time. The ship, NCL Salten, sailed onto shore next to Johan Helberg's cabin in the Trondheim fjord, causing damage to a heating pipe. None of the 16 crew members were injured, and Norwegian police have launched an investigation. This is reportedly the third time the same ship has run aground, raising concerns about the shipping company's safety record.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered significant cuts to the White House National Security Council (NSC), dismissing numerous policy experts in a move to eliminate bureaucracy and duplication. The restructuring will leave the NSC at approximately the same size it was at the end of Trump's first term, with many functions shifting back to their home departments and agencies. Trump is relying more on cabinet members like Secretary of State Marco Rubio for foreign policy decisions rather than recommendations from the NSC. This overhaul is designed to streamline the NSC and reduce the influence of those perceived as holdovers from previous administrations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that Anna's Hummingbirds in the western United States have adapted to human influence by evolving changes in the size and shape of their beaks due to the prevalence of hummingbird feeders. The birds' beaks have become longer and more slender, allowing them to extract more nectar from feeders, and males' beaks have become pointier for fighting off competitors. This has also led to the expansion of the hummingbird's range northward as they followed the growing popularity of bird feeders. The study highlights how quickly evolution can occur in response to human-driven environmental changes.</p>

          <p>A French court has convicted eight people in connection with the 2016 armed robbery of Kim Kardashian in Paris, where the robbers stole jewelry worth $10 million. The convicted individuals received prison sentences ranging from three to eight years, with some suspended, while one received a fine, and two were acquitted. Kardashian, who testified earlier this month, expressed relief and gratitude to French authorities for pursuing justice in the case, describing the crime as the most terrifying experience of her life. Kardashian forgave the ringleader, Aomar A√Øt Khedache, who had asked for forgiveness.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his endorsement of a partnership between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, which had previously been blocked by the Biden administration on national security grounds. Trump stated that the partnership will create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy, with the bulk of the investment occurring in the next 14 months. Investors reacted positively, causing U.S. Steel shares to jump significantly. The United Steelworkers union expressed concerns about the impact on American jobs, while Pennsylvania officials showed support for the deal.</p>

          <p>King Charles is preparing for a significant visit to Canada, marking the first time a monarch has opened Canada's Parliament in nearly 70 years, as the country faces pressure from US President Donald Trump. The visit, following an election won by Mark Carney on an anti-Trump platform, is expected to affirm Canadian sovereignty and independence. While the King's speech will address government policy plans, it is anticipated to send a strong message that Canada will not become the 51st US state. The King will balance demonstrating solidarity with Canada while maintaining the UK's relationship with the US.</p>

          <p>Yasmina Asrarguis reflects on the life and tragic death of Sarah Milgrim, who was murdered outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., alongside her partner, Yaron Lischinsky. Asrarguis emphasizes that Milgrim was a quiet peace builder dedicated to fostering dialogue and coexistence between different faiths and cultures. She calls for Milgrim's legacy not to be co-opted or weaponized for political gain, but rather to be remembered for her commitment to shared humanity and the pursuit of peace in the Middle East. Milgrim's work involved promoting the "third narrative," focusing on shared humanity and mutual dignity for Jews and Muslims.</p>
