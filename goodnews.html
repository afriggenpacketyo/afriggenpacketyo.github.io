          <p>California's Legislature has passed several significant and controversial bills aimed at transforming the public school experience for 5.8 million students, now awaiting Governor Newsom's signature. Key measures include Assembly Bill 715, creating a state Office for Civil Rights to combat various forms of discrimination, including antisemitism, a move opposed by some who fear it could stifle classroom discussion. Assembly Bill 1454 mandates phonics-based "science of reading" instruction to improve literacy rates, while Assembly Bill 1264 seeks to eliminate ultra-processed foods from school meals. Other notable bills address truancy reform and cannabis tax revenue allocation affecting child care funding.</p>

          <p>Mötley Crüe's lead singer, Vince Neil, has disclosed that he suffered a severe stroke last Christmas, which left his entire left side paralyzed and doctors doubtful he would ever walk again. Neil recounted waking up unable to move and subsequently underwent an intensive recovery process, including physical therapy, to regain mobility. The stroke forced the band to postpone parts of their Las Vegas residency, but Neil has since made a significant recovery, returning to the stage at 90-95% of his former capacity. His remarkable determination to perform again highlights a powerful personal triumph over a serious health challenge.</p>

          <p>Wall Street experienced a stellar week, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hitting record highs, fueled by speculation about the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision and strong earnings from Oracle. Oracle's fiscal Q1 report, showing a 359% surge in contracted revenue, boosted chipmakers like Nvidia and Broadcom, signaling continued AI infrastructure demand. Mixed economic data, including a lower-than-expected August producer price index but higher consumer prices, complicated the Fed's decision, yet rising jobless claims suggested potential economic softness that could lead to more aggressive rate cuts. The Investing Club made several trades, including buying Boeing and Texas Roadhouse, and trimming Goldman Sachs, while analyzing updates from Wells Fargo and GE Vernova. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian officials and a U.S. International Development Finance Corporation team will conduct site visits to pinpoint investment projects under Kyiv's critical minerals deal with Washington. This agreement, championed by President Trump, grants the U.S. preferential access to Ukraine's new mineral projects in exchange for crucial investment. Ukraine views this as a vital mechanism for economic revival, particularly after the war ignited by Russia's 2022 invasion, and for securing continued U.S. defense support. The government aims to identify three pilot projects within 18 months, focusing on minerals, energy, and infrastructure, with half of Ukraine's revenues from new extraction going to a joint investment fund.</p>

          <p>New French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu announced he is abandoning his predecessor's controversial proposal to cut two public holidays, a measure previously considered to reduce the national deficit. This decision comes days into his tenure, as France faces increased pressure after Fitch downgraded its sovereign credit score to A+, the country's lowest level on record. Lecornu, President Macron's fifth prime minister in under two years, aims to find "creative ways" to pass a debt-slimming 2026 budget through a deeply divided parliament, emphasizing the critical need for stability and a sound financial trajectory. His challenge is to balance fiscal responsibility with political and social considerations.</p>

          <p>Arsenal secured a decisive 3-0 victory over Nottingham Forest, demonstrating the immediate value of their £250 million summer transfer window investment in strengthening their squad. Despite key injuries to influential players like Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard, the Gunners showcased significant depth, with five new signings starting and performing impressively. Manager Mikel Arteta's strategy of bringing in high-calibre players to maintain quality during a relentless schedule appears successful, as the team has won three of their first four league games without conceding from open play. This performance bodes well for their Premier League title aspirations and upcoming Champions League campaign, proving the investment worthwhile.</p>

          <p>California's State Assembly has passed SB 53, a bill requiring transparency reports from developers of powerful "frontier" AI models, specifically focusing on preventing "catastrophic risks" like AI-enabled biological weapons or cyberattacks. The bill defines catastrophic risk as events causing over 50 casualties or $1 billion in damages, and mandates safety frameworks, critical incident reporting, and whistleblower protections for large AI companies. While proponents see it as a crucial first step in regulating rapidly advancing AI before widespread disasters occur, critics argue it could stifle innovation or is too narrowly focused on hypothetical future harms rather than existing issues like bias. The legislation aims to set a national precedent for AI oversight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Georgia prosecutors faced a major setback as a judge dismissed RICO conspiracy charges against 61 defendants in the "Cop City" protest case, citing the Attorney General's lack of authority to bring the case without gubernatorial permission. This decision, nearly three years after arrests, invalidates most of the indictment, which critics called "overblown" and politically motivated. The collapse of the case highlights prosecutorial overreach and procedural negligence, drawing comparisons to other high-profile protest prosecutions. Opponents of the $109 million police training center celebrate the ruling as a victory for civil rights and a rebuke of attempts to criminalize dissent, affirming judicial checks on government power.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Popular lip oils, while offering cosmetic shine and hydration, can potentially cause issues like hyperpigmentation if they lack SPF or contain irritants, according to dermatologist Dr. Rebecca Small. The thin skin on lips is particularly vulnerable to sun damage and inflammation, which can increase melanin production. Some users, particularly women of color, have reported intense hyperpigmentation from certain trending products. Dr. Small strongly recommends choosing lip oils with broad-spectrum SPF and actively avoiding common fragrances like peppermint or cinnamon, while favoring beneficial ingredients such as linoleic acids, squalane, glycerin, and hyaluronic acid for safer use and optimal lip health.</p>

Athletes expressed disappointment, with one noting a lack of "endgame" and another regretting a missed overtaking opportunity during the race. In other events, Jazmin Sawyers was "gutted" to miss the long jump final after an Achilles injury, while Laura Muir also struggled in the 1500m heats.</p>

          <p>The Panama Canal Authority is undertaking significant investments in new infrastructure to mitigate the effects of severe drought and climate change, which recently paralyzed vessel transits. The canal, heavily reliant on rainfall, experienced a 29% drop in transits in fiscal year 2024, particularly impacting LNG and dry bulk traffic. Projects include a land bridge with a natural gas pipeline and port terminals to offer an alternative to waterway transport, aiming to attract more LNG traffic. Additionally, the Rio Indo dam project will supplement water for Lake Gatun, though it faces local opposition due to community displacement. These initiatives aim to secure the canal's future as a vital global trade route amidst environmental challenges.</p>
