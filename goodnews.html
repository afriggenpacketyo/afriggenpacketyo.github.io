          <p>The Trump administration has brokered a deal to prevent a ban on TikTok in the United States, allowing its parent company ByteDance to retain a minority stake. Under the agreement, the cloud computing firm Oracle will host American user data and review the app's code to ensure security and proper algorithm behavior. A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will hold a majority stake in the new U.S.-based joint venture. However, some lawmakers have expressed concern that the deal may not go far enough to sever operational ties with ByteDance, particularly concerning its influential content algorithm.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to announce plans for a compulsory, UK-wide digital identification scheme, arguing it would help combat illegal working and modernize state services. The proposal revives an idea previously blocked by a Conservative-led coalition, with Starmer suggesting the public's attitude has shifted due to the widespread use of digital credentials. The plan has drawn skepticism from Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch and condemnation from Reform UK, which labeled it a cynical ploy that would infringe on the freedoms of law-abiding citizens while failing to deter illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>Amazon has agreed to a $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission to resolve allegations that it used deceptive practices to enroll customers into its Prime membership program and made cancellation intentionally difficult. The settlement includes a $1 billion civil penalty, the largest in any FTC rule violation case, and allocates $1.5 billion for refunds to approximately 35 million affected customers. As part of the agreement, Amazon must also make its enrollment and cancellation processes more transparent and straightforward for consumers, though the company did not admit to any wrongdoing.</p>

          <p>Amazon is leveraging advanced robotics in its fulfillment centers to manage the anticipated surge in online orders during the upcoming holiday season. At its most advanced facility in Louisiana, nearly 1,000 robots work alongside 2,500 employees to move, sort, and lift packages, increasing efficiency by 25% compared to other centers. While the robots handle physically demanding tasks, the company states that this automation creates new, higher-paying roles such as robotics maintenance engineers. This integration of human and robotic labor is crucial for meeting consumer demand for fast and accurate delivery during peak periods.</p>

          <p>Beginning next month, the European Union will phase in a new Entry/Exit System that will require visitors from outside the Schengen Area, including U.S. citizens, to provide biometric data. Upon arrival, travelers will have their fingerprints scanned and a picture taken, with the data stored for three years to enhance security and track overstays. This automated process will eventually replace manual passport stamping across 29 European countries. U.S. citizens who refuse to provide the required biometric information will be denied entry into the region.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of 2025, mortgage rates have fallen to their lowest levels since early 2022, providing significant financial relief for homebuyers and homeowners. For a new $400,000 30-year fixed mortgage, the current average rate of 6.13% results in a monthly principal and interest payment of about $2,432, which is roughly $240 less per month compared to rates seen earlier in the year. This improved rate environment has also created a compelling opportunity for existing homeowners to reduce their monthly payments through refinancing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Polish mountaineer Andrzej Bargiel has made history by becoming the first person to ski down Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, without the use of supplemental oxygen. After reaching the 8,849-meter summit, he successfully navigated the treacherous descent on skis. The incredible feat was particularly challenging due to heavy snowfall, which forced Bargiel to spend 16 hours in the high-altitude "death zone," where low oxygen levels pose a severe risk to human life. This achievement marks a groundbreaking milestone in the world of ski mountaineering.</p>

          <p>A woman whose body was discovered by a road in Spain in 2005 has finally been identified as Liudmila Zavada, a Russian national who was 31 at the time of her death. The breakthrough in the 20-year-old cold case came as part of Interpol's "Identify Me" campaign, which shares details of unsolved cases internationally. Police in Turkey matched the victim's fingerprints to their national database, and a subsequent DNA test with a close relative confirmed her identity, bringing a name to the victim long known only as "the woman in pink."</p>

          <p>A new paper by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb suggests that 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system, is significantly larger and more massive than scientists initially thought. By analyzing its trajectory and the rate at which it shed gas and dust, Loeb's team inferred a mass greater than 33 billion tons and a diameter of over three miles. This would make it orders of magnitude more massive than previous interstellar visitors, deepening the mystery surrounding its origins and its unusually close trajectory to several planets, including Mars.</p>

This figure, revised up from a previous estimate of 3.3%, was largely driven by robust consumer spending, which increased at a 2.5% rate.
