          <p>Sony Group shares experienced a rise of over 3.5% amidst volatile trading following the announcement of a share buyback of up to 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion). The company's operating income for the last three months of the financial year surpassed analyst estimates, coming in at 203.6 billion yen, though it marked an 11% decrease from the previous year. Sony also detailed a partial spinoff of its financial unit, planning to distribute over 80% of the shares to shareholders through dividends, with the financial unit set to list this year. However, the company's outlook for the current financial year ending in March 2026 was described as lackluster. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>BBC Director General Tim Davie vowed to tackle Britain's 'crisis of trust' by expanding fact-checking services, countering disinformation, and enhancing local journalism. Davie argued that the BBC can play a key role in making the UK a global leader in trusted information, support democracy, boost education and economic growth, and improve digital access. Proposed measures include using artificial intelligence in its Bitesize educational service and calling for a national plan to switch off traditional broadcast transmissions in the 2030s for internet-only delivery of programs. The BBC is considering launching its own streaming media device with simplified user interface to help those yet to benefit from IP services.</p>

          <p>Family offices are struggling to find qualified money managers due to trust issues and competition from banks and private equity firms. While trust is a key factor for families, it can sometimes overshadow other important criteria. Young employees are often reluctant to work at family offices due to the lack of a clear corporate structure and the perception of it being a "retirement job". Family offices are increasing compensation packages to attract talent, including bonuses, co-investment opportunities, and a share in investment management profits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New climate data from oyster fossils challenges the belief that Antarctica was ice-free during the Cretaceous period. The research suggests the mid-latitudes of the southern hemisphere experienced seasonal temperature changes comparable to today, with polar ice present. The findings offer insight into climate change, highlighting the potential transition from a world with perennial glacier ice to one with only seasonal ice. Scientists emphasize the importance of understanding these shifts in light of ongoing and anticipated global warming.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to slash most of their recent new tariffs on each other's imports and suspend part of the reciprocal duties for 90 days, following high-level trade talks in Switzerland. The U.S. cut tariffs it had imposed on China to 30 percent from 145 percent, while China reduced its retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. to 10 percent from 125 percent. Both sides will retain a portion of their tariffs for negotiation during the 90-day pause, and China has agreed to suspend non-tariff countermeasures, including export controls on rare-earth minerals. The agreement aims to iron out more details for the future trade relationship between the world's two largest economies.</p>

          <p>The Prime Minister of Canada, Mark Carney, stated that Canadians "weren't impressed" by the UK government's decision to offer President Trump a second state visit, seeing it as undermining Canada's sovereignty. In response, Canada has invited King Charles to open its parliament as a symbol of sovereignty. Carney noted that Trump had shifted from expecting to annex Canada to merely desiring it, but that such a scenario would never happen. Despite past tensions, relations between the US and Canada have improved, with hopes for progress on trade and security agreements.</p>
