The article traces historical concerns about overpopulation and highlights the importance of managing consumption responsibly and developing sustainable technologies.

          <p>Defence Secretary John Healey expects UK defence spending to rise to 3% of GDP by 2034, a key assumption underpinning the government's upcoming strategic defence review. This review, set to be unveiled on Monday, will outline the nation's military and security spending priorities for the coming years. The review warns of a "new era of threat" characterized by drones and artificial intelligence and recommends deploying "digital" experts alongside troops. The additional funding will also address military housing improvements, including urgent repairs and new construction.</p>
