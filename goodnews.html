          <h2>Oil Prices Fluctuate Following Trump's Remarks on Potential Israeli Strike Against Iran</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 14:54:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oil prices experienced volatility, initially rising sharply due to concerns about a potential conflict between Israel and Iran disrupting crude supplies. President Trump commented that an Israeli attack on Iran was possible but not imminent, which contributed to the price fluctuations. The U.S. State Department advised nonessential personnel to leave Iraq, and the Pentagon authorized voluntary departures for military families in the Middle East, further fueling concerns. An analyst at JPMorgan suggested oil prices could surge to $120 per barrel if Iran blocked the Strait of Hormuz, though she deemed the risk of such a blockade as low. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite fears, President Trump's tariffs have not yet significantly impacted inflation, with recent data on consumer and producer prices remaining benign. However, expectations persist that prices will rise in the coming months due to Trump's trade policies. Factors such as companies stockpiling imported goods, the time lag for tariffs to affect the economy, and limited pricing power among companies have kept inflation in check so far. Economists anticipate that the impact of tariffs will materialize in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study by LendingTree reveals that tipping rates vary significantly across U.S. states, with New Hampshire residents tipping the most and Utah residents tipping the least. The analysis suggests that tipping rates are higher in states where people dine out more frequently. The study also found that Washington, D.C., has the highest per-capita spending on dining out. The "No Tax on Tips" provision in the GOP spending bill, which would remove federal taxes from tips for workers earning less than $160,000, could offer relief to millions of tipped workers.</p>

          <p>Eating blueberries daily can positively affect blood pressure, primarily due to their high levels of anthocyanin, an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound that improves blood vessel function. A study found that daily blueberry consumption can decrease systolic blood pressure. Blueberries may also increase nitric oxide production, improving blood flow, and reduce arterial stiffness, lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease. Registered dietitians recommend consuming about a cup of blueberries per day, with wild blueberries offering even greater benefits due to their higher nutrient content.</p>
