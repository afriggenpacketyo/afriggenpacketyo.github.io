          <h2>Analysts Evaluate Singapore Dollar's Potential as a Global Safe-Haven Currency</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 01:21:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Singapore dollar is increasingly viewed as a "quasi safe-haven" currency, especially within Asia, due to Singapore's strong institutional framework, economic stability, and prudent policymaking. While it has gained strength against the US dollar, its path to global safe-haven status like the yen or Swiss franc is hindered by the relatively small size of its market and its managed exchange rate policy. Experts believe that while it may not become a primary global reserve, the SGD offers significant diversification benefits and could evolve into a key regional safe haven, akin to the "Swiss franc of Asia."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The James Gunn-directed film "Superman" demonstrated strong staying power at the North American box office, earning $57.3 million in its second weekend and holding the number one spot. The Warner Bros. and DC Studios film experienced a standard 54% drop from its debut, bringing its global total to $406.8 million. This successful performance is a crucial first step in DC Studios' plan to reboot its cinematic universe, with the film's positive reception from audiences expected to support its profitability in the coming weeks. Hollywood's summer box office overall is up nearly 16% compared to the previous year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite years of U.S. trade restrictions that crippled its smartphone business, Chinese tech giant Huawei has strategically pivoted to become a formidable leader in artificial intelligence. The company has developed a comprehensive "full-stack" AI portfolio, spanning from advanced Ascend AI chips that rival Nvidia's to cloud computing infrastructure and industry-specific AI models. This transformation, spurred by U.S. sanctions, has turned Huawei into a national champion for Beijing's technological ambitions. Analysts note that no other company has shown such competence across so many complex, high-barrier tech sectors, positioning Huawei as a major global competitor.</p>

          <p>Soleno Therapeutics has announced that its new drug, Vykat XR, is significantly exceeding sales expectations, with preliminary net revenue projected between $31 and $33 million for the quarter ending June 30. Approved in March, Vykat XR is the first treatment for the insatiable hunger associated with Prader-Willi syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. The company has received a high number of "start forms" from physicians, indicating strong initial demand and a positive market reception for the novel therapeutic. This performance has positioned Soleno as one of the top-performing mid-cap stocks of 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The northeastern Chinese city of Hegang, facing a declining population and stagnant GDP, is investing 1.2 billion yuan to build a new airport, scheduled to open in 2027. This infrastructure project is a key part of the city's strategy to revitalize its economy, which has suffered from industrial decline. The Luobei Airport is expected to handle 450,000 passengers and 1,600 tonnes of cargo annually. This move is emblematic of a broader trend where smaller Chinese cities seek to spur growth and improve connectivity to overcome economic challenges and regional inequality.

          <p>Adolfo Macías Villamar, the notorious Ecuadorean gang leader known as "Fito," has been extradited to the U.S. to face federal charges of drug and arms trafficking. Fito, leader of the powerful Los Choneros gang, was recaptured in June after escaping from a high-security prison. His gang is blamed for much of the violent crime that has plagued Ecuador and is also linked to the 2023 assassination of a presidential candidate. This extradition is a major step in President Daniel Noboa's crackdown on organized crime, enabled by a recent referendum that allows for the extradition of Ecuadorean citizens.</p>

          <p>A new class of weight loss and diabetes drugs, known as GLP-1s like Ozempic and Wegovy, is emerging as a potential game-changing treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Women with PCOS, a common hormonal disorder linked to insulin resistance, have reported significant improvements in symptoms such as irregular periods, weight management, and hormone balance after using these drugs. While research is still in early stages, small studies suggest the drugs' ability to improve insulin sensitivity and promote weight loss indirectly helps regulate hormones. However, the high cost and limited insurance coverage remain significant barriers for many patients.</p>

She explained this was due to Trump providing a venue for the UFC in its early days when no one else would. Rousey emphasizes that voting is a personal right and encourages everyone to participate in the democratic process, particularly in local elections, regardless of their political affiliation.</p>

          <p>Despite looming tariff deadlines, market analyst Jim Cramer argues that numerous positive factors are currently buoying the stock market. He identifies ten key drivers, including a strong earnings season, the economic stimulus from Trump's "big beautiful bill," and significant tax relief for businesses. Other tailwinds include massive investment in data centers and the electric grid, a renaissance in the U.S. energy sector, and a primed IPO market. Cramer suggests that these pro-business conditions have created circumstances for economic growth that could counteract the negative sentiment often associated with trade disputes.

          <p>The UK government has warned that people retiring in 2050 will be financially worse off than today's pensioners unless action is taken to boost private savings. In response, the Department for Work and Pensions is reviving the Pensions Commission to address the issue that nearly half of working-age adults, particularly low earners and the self-employed, are not saving into a private pension. The commission will aim to build a national consensus on a future strategy to tackle the savings gap. This initiative comes as the cost of the state pension's "triple lock" is also under scrutiny.
