        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pop star Katy Perry encountered a startling technical issue during her San Francisco concert when a large mechanical butterfly prop she was riding malfunctioned mid-air. While performing her hit song 'Roar' high above the audience, the prop suddenly dropped several feet, causing a visible moment of surprise for the singer. Despite the scare, Perry demonstrated her professionalism by quickly recomposing herself and flawlessly continuing the performance without missing a beat. The incident, which she later referenced with a brief comment, underscores the potential dangers involved in elaborate, high-flying concert stunts used by many contemporary artists.</p>

          <p>Celebrity couple Rebecca Romijn and Jerry O'Connell have revealed their nontraditional approach to managing finances throughout their 18-year marriage. In a recent interview, they explained that they keep their personal money completely separate, contributing quarterly to a shared 'community pot' for family expenses. The amount each contributes varies depending on who is working more at the time, a system they developed to support their decision that one parent would always be home with their twin daughters. This financial arrangement reflects a tag-team approach to both their careers and their family life, offering a unique perspective on partnership in Hollywood.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy's third round at The Open featured a moment of high drama and a peculiar on-course incident that captured the crowd's attention. After a strong start, McIlroy encountered a bizarre situation on the 11th hole when his swing in the rough dislodged a buried golf ball, leading to a bogey. However, he electrified his home crowd with a spectacular 56-foot eagle putt on the 12th, producing one of the loudest roars of the tournament. Finishing with a score of 66, he remains in contention but faces a significant deficit behind the leader, Scottie Scheffler, heading into the final day.</p>

          <p>World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler has taken firm control of The Open Championship, building a commanding four-shot lead after the third round at Royal Portrush. Despite a brief challenge from Matt Fitzpatrick, Scheffler's steady, unflappable play, including crucial par saves and a key birdie, left him at 14 under par. His performance has created an air of inevitability around his victory, as he has won on all nine previous occasions when holding a 54-hole lead. Scheffler's dominance positions him to secure his fourth major title and continue a remarkable run of form in professional golf.</p>

          <p>Germany is reinforcing its strategic partnerships with France and the United Kingdom, forming a cooperative known as the 'E3' to address pressing security challenges. This pivot includes a new comprehensive treaty with the UK focused on security and arms cooperation, complementing the long-standing Franco-German friendship. The alliance is largely a response to the threat posed by Russia and uncertainty surrounding the United States' commitment to NATO under Donald Trump. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has suggested that the nuclear capabilities of France and the UK could supplement, or if necessary, replace US protection for Europe.</p>

          <p>World number one Scottie Scheffler is in a commanding position to win his first Open Championship, holding a four-shot lead heading into the final round at Royal Portrush. His steady, bogey-free third round of 67 extended his advantage over his closest competitor, China's Li Haotong. While home favorite Rory McIlroy provided early excitement with a charge that thrilled the crowd, he and other challengers were unable to keep pace with Scheffler's relentless consistency. A victory would mark the third leg of the career Grand Slam for Scheffler, further cementing his status at the pinnacle of golf.</p>

          <p>Marcus Rashford, who has been out of favor at Manchester United, is reportedly close to securing a move to Spanish club FC Barcelona. The transfer, expected to be an initial loan with an option to buy, comes after the England forward was sidelined by United's manager and told to train separately. While Rashford's form has been inconsistent, Barcelona is seeking to strengthen its attack after failing to sign other targets like Nico Williams and Luis Diaz. For Barcelona, the loan structure represents a low-risk opportunity to acquire a talented player who, if motivated, could be a major asset.</p>

          <p>Major champions Bryson DeChambeau and Henrik Stenson have voiced criticism of the R&A's enforcement of slow-play rules during the third round of The Open. Both golfers were warned by officials about their pace of play, which they found inconsistent with the handling of much slower rounds earlier in the tournament. Stenson noted the absurdity of being warned for being a few minutes over schedule on Saturday when earlier rounds had run an hour over. DeChambeau advocated for a new system that times every shot for every player, arguing it would be a fairer and more transparent solution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Pennsylvania-based Christian group called Generation Life is engaging in outreach with a message of 'chastity before marriage' for Generation Z. The young activists frame chastity not just as abstinence, but as a countercultural choice to seek deeper, non-transactional relationships in an age dominated by social media and what they see as superficial connections. By focusing on shared anxieties about modern dating and self-worth, they aim to present their message as a path to greater personal dignity and autonomy. This approach attempts to rebrand a traditional value as a radical response to contemporary social pressures.</p>
