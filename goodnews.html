          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. announced a 10% year-over-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by growing demand ahead of potential negative impacts from higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. The automaker's global production also rose by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, marking an all-time high for April. Despite U.S. President Donald Trump's imposition of additional tariffs on cars produced outside the United States, Toyota stated it would not pass the cost onto consumers, though analysts believe this may be difficult in the long term. The company anticipates a significant drop in net profit for the business year due to these tariffs and a stronger yen (not investment advice).</p>

The court rejected the administration's justification based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), stating that the law does not grant the president blanket authority to set tariffs.

          <p>The San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) has decided not to proceed with its proposed "Grading for Equity" strategy following significant backlash from the community. The strategy, presented during an SFUSD Board of Education meeting, aimed to offer professional development in standards-based grading. Under the proposed system, final exam scores would primarily determine semester grades, while homework, weekly tests, and tardiness would not impact the grade, additionally altering the letter-grade system to allow lower scores to receive higher grades. Amid criticism from the mayor, lawmakers, and the community, the SFUSD clarified that no changes to grading practices have been implemented, emphasizing its commitment to high standards and student success.</p>

          <p>Chinese startup DeepSeek has quietly launched an upgraded version of its R1 artificial intelligence reasoning model, intensifying competition with companies like OpenAI. The company did not make an official announcement, but the upgrade was released on the AI model repository Hugging Face. DeepSeek gained prominence earlier this year when its open-source R1 reasoning model outperformed rivals, raising concerns about overspending by U.S. tech giants on AI infrastructure. The upgraded model is a reasoning AI, meaning it can execute more complicated tasks through a step-by-step logical thought process and benchmarks closely with OpenAI's models.</p>
