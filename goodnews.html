          <p>China has approved the AG600, the world's largest amphibious aircraft, for mass production, marking progress in its aviation industry. The Civil Aviation Administration of China certified that the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China has a reliable system for consistent production meeting safety standards. This development is part of China's effort to build a self-reliant civil aviation industry, especially given US technology restrictions. The AG600 is designed for emergency rescue and natural disaster prevention, joining the Y-20 strategic transport plane and C919 airliner in China's domestically developed large aircraft fleet. This is a move towards a more standardized civil aviation manufacturing sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hong Kong aims to become a leader in the stablecoin market with its new comprehensive stablecoin law, effective August 1. This law puts Hong Kong ahead of the US and Singapore in regulating cryptocurrencies backed by assets like the US dollar. The move is expected to attract digital asset firms and promote innovation in the region, particularly with the city's large offshore yuan holdings. Experts believe this could position Hong Kong as a key player in the global stablecoin market, currently dominated by US dollar-backed tokens. This underscores the intensifying East-West contest over financial influence in the digital era.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered a new tyrannosaur species, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, in a Mongolian museum, which alters the understanding of tyrannosaur evolution. This 86-million-year-old species is considered the closest known ancestor to all tyrannosaurs, including T.rex. Khankhuuluu, meaning Dragon Prince of Mongolia, represents a transitional fossil between small, fleet-footed predators and the giant tyrannosaurs. Weighing around 750kg, it exhibits early evolutionary stages of features crucial for tyrannosaurs, such as skull anatomy for a strong jaw. The discovery revises the tyrannosaur family tree, providing insights into the evolution of these apex predators.</p>
