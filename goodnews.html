          <p>Data from China's central bank indicates a surge of household savings flowing into the mainland stock market, suggesting a potential continuation of the current rally. Deposits at non-banking financial institutions increased significantly in August, following a similar trend in July, while M1, a money-supply gauge, rose at its fastest pace since January 2023. Analysts attribute this shift to low-interest-rate policies that are diminishing returns from traditional banking deposits, driving investors to seek better returns in the capital market. The earnings yield of China's listed companies currently surpasses yields on government bonds and deposit rates. (not investment advice)</p>

Dyer expressed excitement about the glamorous costumes, while Pattison spoke candidly about her anxiety and how she's managing her nerves. The contestants also addressed the so-called 'Strictly curse,' with most dismissing concerns about finding romance with fellow participants, and former Apprentice star Thomas Skinner apologized for his behavior at the press event. The contestants also discussed previous dance experience with varying levels of formal training, and soap stars noted the opportunity to show the public who they are in real life as opposed to their television personas. </p>

          <p>The UK and US are poised to sign a significant agreement aimed at accelerating nuclear power development, with the goal of creating jobs and enhancing Britain's energy security. The Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy seeks to expedite the construction of new nuclear power stations by streamlining regulatory approvals and fostering commercial partnerships. Key proposals include X-Energy and Centrica's plan to build advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool, potentially powering 1.5 million homes and creating thousands of jobs. The partnership also aims to end reliance on Russian nuclear material by 2028 and includes collaboration on fusion energy research. </p>

          <p>China Energy Engineering Group Co. Ltd. has proposed converting existing coal-fired power plants into nuclear facilities, referred to as the C2N initiative, as a direct path to decarbonization.

China has over 1.19 terawatts of coal-fired power capacity, with approximately 100 gigawatts expected to retire by 2030. This conversion offers a way to meet site safety requirements and gain public acceptance for nuclear energy. </p>
