        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dame Louise Casey is calling for a newly announced inquiry into grooming gangs to serve as a "national reset" on the issue. Her report highlighted the need for openness to scrutiny and change from those giving evidence. Casey also addressed concerns about the ethnicity of perpetrators, urging people to "keep calm" and properly interrogate data, noting disproportionate Asian heritage involvement in child sexual exploitation cases. She emphasized the importance of implementing the recommendations from previous reports and holding the government accountable for action within six months, stressing the need for increased prosecutions and criminal investigations. The inquiry aims to ensure adults who sexually assault children face serious charges and to review convictions of victims who were criminalized instead of protected.</p>

          <p>Investment experts are weighing in on the possibility of gold reaching $4,000 per ounce, citing factors such as inflation, geopolitical instability, and central bank buying. Some analysts predict this milestone could be achieved within a year, while others suggest a more conservative timeline of one to two years, contingent on global events. Strategies for investing in gold now include maintaining a long-term outlook, leasing out gold holdings, and considering gold mining mutual funds. Experts advise treating gold as a long-term asset and diversifying a financial portfolio to realize consistent returns over time. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump suggested that China's approval is necessary and expressed optimism that President Xi will ultimately approve the deal. This would mark the third extension of the deadline.</p>

          <p>The pharmaceutical industry is making strides in developing targeted cancer therapies, known as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), that could potentially replace chemotherapy for some patients. These drugs are designed to deliver chemotherapy directly to cancer cells while sparing healthy cells, reducing side effects. Companies like AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Merck are investing billions in developing ADCs, with some already showing promising results in clinical trials. While challenges remain, such as optimizing the delivery of the chemotherapy payload, advancements in ADC technology are paving the way for more precise and effective cancer treatments.</p>
