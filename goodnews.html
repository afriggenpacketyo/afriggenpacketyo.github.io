          <p>Pep Guardiola defended his decision to exclude Jack Grealish from Manchester City's squad for the final game of the season, despite securing Champions League qualification. Guardiola dismissed suggestions of unhappiness with Grealish, emphasizing that squad selections are based on various factors and are not personal. He highlighted Rico Lewis's exclusion and James McAtee's performance as examples of other selection considerations, noting that future decisions regarding Grealish's role are for club management and agents to determine. Guardiola reiterated his support for Grealish, stating that he fought for his arrival and retention at the club.</p>

          <p>Speaker of the House Mike Johnson defended President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" on CBS's "Face the Nation," claiming it will stimulate the economy and cut government spending. Johnson argued that the bill will create jobs and increase wages, while critics, including Senators Rand Paul and Josh Hawley, have raised concerns about the rising debt and cuts to Medicaid and food stamps. Johnson insisted that the bill does not cut Medicaid or SNAP, but rather targets fraud, waste, and abuse within those programs. He also addressed concerns about the bill's impact on undocumented immigrants and the state and local tax deductions.</p>

          <h2>Expert Identifies Emotionally Safe Parenting As A New Parenting Style</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 13:36:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert has identified "emotionally safe parenting" as a new approach, prioritizing emotional attunement and open communication to foster resilience, trust, and connection. This method involves accepting a child's emotions without dismissing them, responding without shame, and viewing misbehavior as a signal for support. Emotionally safe parents also take responsibility for their actions after conflicts, apologize, and reconnect with their child, creating an environment where children feel safe expressing their authentic selves. This approach encourages parents to reflect on their own childhood experiences and triggers to become less reactive and more empathetic.</p>

          <p>Tommy Paul won his first-round match at the French Open after dealing with the repossession of his truck due to missed payments. Paul, seeded 12th, revealed that his Ford F-150 was repossessed because he changed banks and forgot to adjust automatic payments. He found out about the repossession when his trainer asked him to check security camera footage, which showed a tow truck taking his car. He has since regained the truck, finding humor in the experience and watching "repo" shows.</p>
