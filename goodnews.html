        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge ruled that President Trump's federalization of the California National Guard and deployment to Los Angeles was illegal, ordering him to return control to Governor Newsom. The judge, Charles Breyer, stayed the order temporarily to allow the Trump administration to appeal. Newsom and California's attorney general had sued to reverse Trump's action, arguing it was unprecedented and violated the Tenth Amendment. The judge agreed, stating that none of the conditions required for Trump's action were met and that it set a dangerous precedent. The ruling was praised by Newsom as a check on authoritarian tendencies, while the Trump administration sought to appeal the decision. Optimism score is proportional with the fact that the judge sided with the Governor. </p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that President Donald Trump illegally deployed the California National Guard to suppress protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles, ordering the troops to return to state control. Judge Charles Breyer found that Trump failed to demonstrate a "rebellion" and did not comply with procedural steps. Governor Gavin Newsom praised the decision as a win for American democracy and a check on authoritarianism. The ruling is a defeat for the Trump administration and is expected to face a legal battle that could reach the Supreme Court. The optimism score reflects the check on executive power and the upholding of constitutional principles.</p>

          <p>Dan Wang characterizes China as an "engineering state," highlighting its focus on large-scale infrastructure projects and technological advancements. China's subway stations, high-speed rail, and other infrastructure projects are noted for their beauty and innovation. The country has rapidly developed its transportation systems and excels in civil, electrical, nano, computer, solar, and space engineering. China's STEM graduates significantly outnumber those in the US, and many top officials are engineers, contrasting with the US's "lawyerly state." The optimism score is based on the author's tone, which reflects a sense of admiration for China's engineering achievements.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled against President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, siding with California's argument that the activation was improper. The order requires Trump to return control of the National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom. The judge rejected the administration's argument that courts cannot review a president's decision on the National Guard's necessity. Trump had deployed 4,000 California National Guard and several hundred U.S. Marines to Los Angeles over Newsom's objections, citing attempts to impede immigration agents. The ruling is a setback for the White House and could be appealed. </p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Pigs Were Domesticated in China Earlier Than Previously Thought</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 21:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeological research suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago, earlier than previously believed. The study, published in PNAS, analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region. Researchers found evidence that pigs were consuming humans' cooked foods and waste, indicating domestication alongside rice cultivation. This challenges the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East. The optimism score is based on the positive tone of scientific discovery and advancement of knowledge.</p>
