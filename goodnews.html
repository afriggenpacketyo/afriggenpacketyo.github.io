          <p>SoftBank's shares surged by 13% after the Japanese conglomerate announced its $5.4 billion agreement to acquire the robotics division of Swiss firm ABB. This acquisition significantly advances SoftBank's footprint in Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), a concept its founder Masayoshi Son believes will propel humanity forward. The deal means ABB will no longer pursue a spin-off of its robotics business. This strategic move aligns with SoftBank's broader vision to position itself at the forefront of the AI boom through various investments and acquisitions in technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have reached an agreement for the "first Phase" of a peace deal, which includes the release of all remaining hostages and a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces. The deal, which Trump called a "GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding Nations, and the United States of America," is expected to see hostages released as early as Monday. This development follows intense negotiations and comes after a two-year conflict sparked by Hamas's 2023 attack on Israel. Both Israeli and Hamas officials have confirmed the agreement, with mediators also praising the efforts.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement of a tentative Israel-Hamas peace deal, including hostage release and aid, elicited polarized responses. Republican lawmakers lauded Trump as a "peace president," with some even suggesting a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. Conversely, Palestinian Americans expressed deep skepticism, questioning the deal's language, the lack of a permanent ceasefire, and the continued suffering in Gaza. Concerns were raised about the clarity of Israeli withdrawal terms and the potential for the "first phase" to be insufficient, highlighting a stark divide in how the agreement is perceived.

          <p>Derrick Groves, the last of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in May, has been captured in Atlanta after a brief standoff.

          <p>The Liberal Democrat party has seen its membership almost halve in the last five years, falling from nearly 118,000 in 2020 to 60,000, according to BBC analysis. This decline comes despite the party achieving its most successful general election in terms of seats won last year. The drop has been obscured by the inclusion of "registered supporters" in official figures, who do not hold full membership rights. Experts note that while the decline is surprising given recent electoral gains, the party's members remain highly active, with a greater proportion canvassing voters than any other major party.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed 20-point peace plan for the Israel-Hamas war, now in its "first phase," outlines an immediate end to fighting, a hostage-for-prisoner exchange, and a phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The plan calls for Hamas to release all remaining Israeli hostages within 72 hours in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 other Gazans. Gaza would then be demilitarized and governed by a "technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee" under an "International Stabilization Force." While Israel's Netanyahu supports the plan, Hamas's full response and the long-term implications for Palestinian statehood remain key points of discussion.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court justices, both conservative and liberal, showed little enthusiasm for arguments in a case challenging Illinois' voting regulations that allow mail-in ballots to be counted up to 14 days post-election. Representative Michael Bost, who won his election, claimed harm due to a reduced margin of victory and increased staffing costs. However, justices questioned the sufficiency of his alleged harm, with some suggesting his arguments were based on policy disagreement rather than individual injury. The Court's skepticism highlights the difficulty in establishing standing for candidates challenging election rules, even when they emerge victorious.</p>
