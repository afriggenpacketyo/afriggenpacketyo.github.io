        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's national police chief, Dieter Romann, has positively assessed the tightened border controls, dismissing police union concerns about overburdened personnel. Since September 2024, Germany reintroduced temporary checks at all nine land borders, reinforcing personnel with almost 1,200 colleagues, totaling 13,000 to 14,000 officers. Romann rejected assumptions that personnel would be withdrawn from other operational areas, emphasizing support from counterparts and sufficient staffing levels. The Federal Police permanently has around 9,800 officers in their regular stations along the national borders. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>
