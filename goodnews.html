          <h2>Study Links Prolonged Smartphone Use on Toilet to Increased Hemorrhoid Risk</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-06 14:32:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center suggests that using a smartphone while on the toilet could increase the risk of developing hemorrhoids by 46%. Researchers found that individuals who use their phones in the bathroom tend to sit for significantly longer periods, which increases pressure on rectal veins regardless of other factors like diet or straining. The study highlights that the design of a toilet seat leaves the pelvic floor unsupported, making prolonged sitting particularly problematic for vascular health in the rectal area. Gastroenterologists advise limiting time spent on the toilet to only what is necessary to avoid this health risk.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, secured their place in the World Cup quarter-finals with a 47-7 victory over Australia, extending their winning streak to 30 consecutive Test matches. Despite a challenging first half where Australia initially took the lead, England rallied to dominate the second half, with Sadia Kabeya and Kelsey Clifford each scoring two tries. The win sets up a quarter-final match against Scotland, though concerns linger over injuries to key players Ellie Kildunne and Hannah Botterman during the game.</p>

          <p>The recent Reform UK party conference demonstrates the organization's significant and rapid expansion, transitioning from a fringe movement to a major political force in Britain. The event, held at Birmingham's NEC, had the scale of a mainstream party conference while retaining an insurgent energy, a combination previously unseen in UK politics. This growth is indicative of the party's professionalization and expanding local network, fueled by disaffected voters from both Conservative and Labour parties. Leader Nigel Farage's focus on discipline and purpose suggests a serious ambition to capitalize on this momentum and win the next general election.</p>

          <p>J.B. Pritzker, the billionaire governor of Illinois, is increasingly emerging as a prominent and combative figure within the Democratic Party. Known for his wealth and willingness to use it for political influence, such as bringing the Democratic National Convention to Chicago, Pritzker has become a vocal critic of Donald Trump. While he has recently been surpassed by Trump as America's richest politician due to the president's cryptocurrency ventures, Pritzker continues to build his national profile. His actions and rhetoric signal a clear ambition to take on a larger leadership role on the national stage.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has conducted a significant reshuffle of his government, including a major clearout at the Home Office, following the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. Yvette Cooper has been moved from Home Secretary to the Foreign Office, with Shabana Mahmood taking her place.

          <p>A new chapter of ecological restoration is beginning at California's Point Reyes National seashore after a landmark deal resulted in the buyout of 12 organic dairy and cattle operations. The agreement, financed by The Nature Conservancy, frees up over 16,000 acres for a five-year conservation effort aimed at restoring native grasslands and enhancing biodiversity. The plan controversially includes using new herds of cattle for targeted grazing to manage invasive plant species. While the transition is seen as a major environmental opportunity, it has also created tension within the local community over the loss of historic, multi-generational dairy farms.</p>

          <p>A dermatologist is urging people to treat applying sunscreen as a daily necessity, comparable to brushing their teeth, to protect the skin from long-term damage. Key advice includes applying sunscreen to often-missed areas like eyelids, ears, and lips, and using a product with an SPF of 30 or higher for effective protection. While reapplying every two hours is ideal during prolonged sun exposure, the most important step is establishing a consistent daily habit, even during winter months. This routine helps prevent chronic sun damage that accumulates over time and can lead to skin cancer and premature aging.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics and their families participated in a Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome, marking a significant shift toward greater acceptance within the Catholic Church. An Italian bishop celebrated a Mass for the pilgrims, emphasizing that the Jubilee is a time to restore dignity to all, especially those who have been marginalized. Participants credited the late Pope Francis with fostering this more welcoming environment, contrasting it with the feeling of being shunned during previous Holy Years. The event, listed on the Vatican's official calendar, symbolizes a moment of hope and celebration for many who have long sought to reconcile their faith and identity.</p>

          <p>As more states mandate limits on cellphones in schools, districts across the U.S. are adopting a system using locked magnetic pouches, such as those from the company Yondr. Students are required to place their phones in these pouches upon entering school, which they carry with them but can only unlock at designated magnetic stations at the end of the day. Educators report that the system reduces distractions and encourages more social interaction among students, though it has met with mixed reactions from the student body. The goal is to create a more focused learning environment by physically separating students from their devices during school hours.</p>

Now, a team of forensic genealogists is attempting to identify these forgotten soldiers in what they call "the ultimate cold case." By extracting DNA from the 240-year-old bones and building genetic profiles, they are searching for living descendants who can help give these men their names back. The project aims to honor the first American soldiers who were hastily buried on the battlefield and restore a lost piece of the nation's history.</p>
