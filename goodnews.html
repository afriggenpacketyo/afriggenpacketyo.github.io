          <p>Actor Dwayne Johnson has revealed that his noticeable recent weight loss is in preparation for his role in an upcoming film titled "Lizard Music." He described his character as an eccentric elderly man whose best friend is a chicken, a part he says requires a leaner physique. Johnson explained that this transformation follows another demanding role where he portrayed MMA fighter Mark Kerr, a part that he found particularly challenging and fear-inducing. Fans first noted the actor's slimmer appearance at the Venice Film Festival, sparking widespread discussion on social media about his changed look as he continues the slimming process for the new movie.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel has announced the suspension of all planned restaurant remodels after facing significant public criticism for its recent rebranding efforts. The controversy began when the company introduced a new, modernized logo that removed its iconic "Old Country Store" branding, a move that was quickly reversed after backlash from customers and public figures. The company acknowledged that customer feedback indicated the modern redesigns did not align with the brand's cherished vintage Americana aesthetic. In its statement, Cracker Barrel reassured patrons that it would continue to invest in maintaining its restaurants while preserving the traditional look and feel that customers expect.</p>

          <p>NASA is utilizing the James Webb Space Telescope to study TRAPPIST-1 e, an Earth-sized exoplanet located 40 light-years away that orbits within its star's habitable zone. This positioning makes it theoretically possible for liquid water to exist on its surface, a key ingredient for life. Scientists are using the telescope's spectrograph to analyze starlight passing through the planet's potential atmosphere, searching for chemical signatures that would confirm its existence and composition. While researchers believe any primary hydrogen-helium atmosphere has been stripped away by stellar radiation, they are hopeful that the planet may have developed a heavier, secondary atmosphere, similar to Earth's.</p>

          <p>Sixty years ago, on September 9, 1965, Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Sandy Koufax achieved one of baseball's rarest feats by throwing a perfect game against the Chicago Cubs. The performance remains a legendary moment in sports history, cementing the legacy of a pitcher widely considered to have had the most dominant five-year span ever. Koufax retired all 27 batters he faced, striking out 14, including the final six, in a masterful display of power and precision. The game's iconic status is further enhanced by the memorable radio broadcast from legendary announcer Vin Scully, whose call of the final inning immortalized the tension and triumph of the historic night.</p>

          <p>Ethiopia has officially inaugurated the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), the largest hydroelectric project in Africa, in a move celebrated domestically but viewed with alarm by downstream nations. The $5 billion dam is expected to double Ethiopia's electricity generation, fueling economic growth and enabling power exports. However, Egypt considers the dam an "existential threat," fearing it will severely restrict the flow of the Nile River, which provides nearly all of its fresh water. Despite years of diplomatic disputes and failed mediation attempts involving countries like the United States, Ethiopia completed the project, escalating geopolitical tensions over water rights in the region.</p>

          <p>In an advice column, a 26-year-old reader expresses concern that she may no longer be capable of feeling romantic sparks despite seven years of being single and intentionally dating. She describes meeting nice men with whom she aligns on priorities but feels no excitement or connection, leading her to end things. The columnist suggests that her highly rational and intentional approach to dating might be preventing genuine emotional connection, or Eros, from developing. He advises her to be more open to the unpredictable and perhaps less suitable, suggesting that her early tumultuous relationships may have led her to over-regulate her love life to avoid getting hurt.</p>

          <h2>High Income Does Not Disqualify Individuals from Medicare Eligibility, But It Does Increase Premiums</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 12:50:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While high earnings do not make an individual ineligible for Medicare, they can significantly increase the monthly premiums for certain parts of the program. Eligibility for Medicare is primarily based on age (65 or older) or disability status, not income. However, higher earners are subject to an Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA), which adds a surcharge to their Part B (medical insurance) and Part D (prescription drug) premiums. These surcharges are calculated based on modified adjusted gross income from two years prior, meaning recent retirees may face higher costs initially. Financial planning strategies, such as managing withdrawals and considering Roth conversions, can help mitigate these additional expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, NHS trusts in England have been ranked in public league tables based on performance metrics such as waiting times, A&E performance, and financial health. Specialist institutions like Moorfields Eye Hospital topped the list, while general hospitals facing structural and financial issues, such as Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn, ranked at the bottom. UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting defended the tables as a transparency tool for the public, but critics from health think tanks and trusts argue the metrics are confusing and may not accurately reflect quality of care. They also warn it could lead to managers focusing on improving scores rather than patient outcomes.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor stated that the power to create lasting change in the country rests with its citizens, not with the courts. During an interview about her new children's book, she emphasized that while she can decide individual cases, it is the public that ultimately accepts or rejects the status quo. Sotomayor declined to comment on a specific pending immigration case but encouraged Americans to read full court opinions from all sides to better understand the legal reasoning. She also discussed her book, which is inspired by her mother, highlighting the themes of caring for others and helping them see the best in themselves.</p>
