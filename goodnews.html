          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has unveiled the government's spending plans, allocating an additional ¬£29 billion per year to the NHS in England, as well as increasing funding for defense and housing.

          <p>Chinese court astronomers meticulously recorded the details of a dying star's explosion in 1408, providing valuable insights for modern astronomers. The astronomers observed a new star in the southern sky, documenting its size, color, and brightness in a formal report to Emperor Yongle. This rediscovered memorial confirms the phenomenon was a nova, a slow brightening caused by a dying star, rather than a comet or meteor. The unprecedented details have aided researchers in narrowing down the star's possible location, contributing to a better understanding of celestial events in historical records. The study highlights the importance of historical astronomical observations in modern scientific research. The optimism score for this article is 75.</p>
