          <p>A fragile peace holds in the Gaza Strip as Israel awaits the release of hostages held by Hamas, a key component of a recently brokered ceasefire agreement. Simultaneously, displaced Palestinians are beginning to return to their neighborhoods in northern Gaza, many of which have been reduced to ruins after two years of conflict. The situation remains tense, with both sides navigating the delicate initial phases of the deal while the international community monitors the humanitarian crisis. The agreement also includes provisions for increased aid to the devastated region.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans for a rapid diplomatic trip to Israel and Egypt to mark the historic peace deal secured between Israel and Hamas. He is scheduled to address Israel's Knesset and attend an international summit in Egypt with other world leaders to finalize the agreement. Following the trip, Trump will return to the White House to posthumously award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated in September.

          <p>Doncaster heavyweight boxer David Allen was defeated by Russian Arslanbek Makhmudov in a unanimous points decision at a packed Sheffield Arena. Despite strong support from a 9,000-strong home crowd, the 33-year-old could not overcome his formidable opponent in his first headline show at the venue. Allen, who had previously retired from boxing five years ago, expressed his gratitude for the incredible atmosphere and stated he is "not finished" with the sport. The fight marks another setback in a career that has seen both significant highs and lows.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom will turn its clocks back by one hour on Sunday, October 26, marking the end of British Summer Time (BST) and the return to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This annual change, a practice dating back to World War One, provides an extra hour of sleep for most but also brings sunsets forward significantly. The article discusses the history of Daylight Saving Time and the ongoing debate about its benefits and drawbacks. Arguments for year-round BST include economic boosts, while concerns focus on dark winter mornings, particularly in Scotland.</p>

          <p>The timing of Luka Doncic's first preseason appearance for the Los Angeles Lakers remains uncertain, with coach JJ Redick labeling him as "to be determined" for the upcoming game against the Golden State Warriors. While Doncic has been a full participant in practice, he indicated he will likely play in only two preseason games. The team is also navigating the absence of LeBron James, who is sidelined with a sciatica nerve issue. Doncic emphasized a "next man up" mentality, stating the team will need to adapt until James can return to the court.</p>

Initially shocked, Owen investigated the process for a documentary, gaining rare access to Cardiff University's anatomy centre where her mother's body will go.

          <p>As China prepares its 15th five-year plan, analysts anticipate a potential evolution in its infrastructure development strategy. The country's previous economic expansion was heavily fueled by massive public works projects, such as the 4-trillion-yuan stimulus package after the 2008 financial crisis. While this model spurred growth, it also created significant debt for local governments. The next phase of investment is expected to be more focused on technology-driven and people-centric projects, though economists remain bullish on the overall scale of infrastructure spending.
