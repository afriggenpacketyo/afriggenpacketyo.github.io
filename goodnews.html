          <p>China has appointed Ling Zhifeng, a public security chief with established connections to senior leadership, as the new head of the Special Service Bureau. This key agency, also known as the Eighth Bureau, is tasked with ensuring the security of top Chinese officials and high-ranking foreign dignitaries visiting the country. Ling's appointment also includes the role of vice-minister of Public Security, placing him in a critical position within China's internal security apparatus. The bureau's responsibilities extend beyond personal protection, as it has also participated in United Nations peacekeeping missions, reflecting its significant role in both domestic and international security matters.</p>

          <p>A Berlin court has acquitted German comedian Sebastian Hotz, known as "El Hotzo," of charges related to online posts he made following last year's assassination attempt on Donald Trump. The judge ruled that his posts, which included dark humor about the event, were clearly recognizable as satire and did not intend to disturb public order, despite being in bad taste. Prosecutors had argued the statements constituted a "hate crime" and sought a €6,000 fine, claiming satirists are not above the law. The verdict is being viewed as a significant moment for freedom of speech and satire in Germany's liberal democracy.</p>

          <p>George Finch, at just 19 years old, has become the youngest council leader in the United Kingdom, taking charge of the £2bn budget of Warwickshire County Council. The Reform UK councillor, who still lives at home and cannot drive, has dismissed criticism about his lack of experience as "ageist." Finch, who had originally planned to become a history teacher, stated he was inspired by Reform UK's message, which he believes gives hope to young people struggling with housing and job prospects. His appointment follows Reform UK becoming the largest party on the council after May's local elections, ousting the Conservatives.</p>

          <p>A shipwreck discovered on a remote Scottish beach has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, a vessel with a rich history as both a Revolutionary War frigate and an Arctic whaling ship. The identification was made possible through a combination of community-led research and scientific analysis, including dendrochronology, which dated its timbers to mid-18th-century England. Originally HMS Hind, the ship served in the British Royal Navy before being sold and repurposed for whaling. It ultimately wrecked off the island of Sanday in 1788, though all 56 crew members survived, adding to what one archaeologist called its story as a "lucky ship."</p>

          <h2>Convictions of Two City Traders in Libor-Rigging Scandal Overturned After 10-Year Fight</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a decade-long legal battle, former City traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo have had their convictions for rigging Libor and Euribor interest rates quashed by the Supreme Court. The two men were among 19 traders jailed in the UK and US for manipulating the key inter-bank lending rates that influence global borrowing costs. They had consistently argued they were wrongly prosecuted for what were considered normal commercial practices at the time, effectively serving as scapegoats for the 2008 financial crisis. Hayes, who served five and a half years in prison, described the feeling of being cleared as "surreal" after the conviction "destroyed" his family.</p>

          <p>Shares of major German automakers, including Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz, surged following the announcement of a new trade deal between the United States and Japan.

The Stoxx Europe autos index saw its largest daily gain since February, reflecting market hopes for a breakthrough in the ongoing tariff conflict with the U.S. Germany's auto industry association is now urging the EU to intensify its efforts to secure a negotiated solution to avoid potential deindustrialization.

          <p>The artificial intelligence sector has seen an unprecedented influx of capital, with U.S. startups raising $104.3 billion in the first half of the year, nearly matching the total for all of 2024. Giants like OpenAI and Anthropic continue to secure massive funding rounds at high valuations. However, the exit market tells a different story, with only $36 billion generated from VC-backed exits during the same period. This disparity indicates that while venture capitalists are pouring vast sums into AI, the returns through acquisitions and IPOs are lagging significantly, creating a potential imbalance in the market.

          <p>A bipartisan bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives aims to expand access to private investments, which are typically reserved for the wealthy. The Equal Opportunity for All Investors Act would direct the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to create a test that individuals could pass to qualify as an "accredited investor," regardless of their income or net worth. Currently, accreditation is based on strict financial thresholds. The bill's sponsor argues that financial knowledge is a better determinant of a person's suitability for such investments than wealth alone, potentially democratizing access to assets like private equity and venture capital.

          <p>The $100 million raised by the FireAid benefit concerts has served as a critical lifeline for Los Angeles communities devastated by wildfires six months ago. The funds have been distributed to numerous non-profits providing direct cash, food, shelter, and mental health services to displaced residents and those who lost homes and jobs. A review of the grants shows a thoughtful process that prioritized immediate needs and is now shifting toward long-term recovery, such as navigating insurance and rebuilding permits. However, grant recipients emphasize that despite the significant aid, the scale of the damage means the community's needs will require investment for years to come.</p>
