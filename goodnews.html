          <p>Eleonora Boi, the pregnant wife of former NBA player Danilo Gallinari, was attacked by a shark while swimming near the shore at a crowded beach in Puerto Rico. She described the event as the "worst day of my life" but confirmed that both she and her unborn baby are fine following the incident. Boi underwent surgery for a wound on her thigh and is now recovering from the ordeal. Local authorities are investigating to determine the species of shark involved in the attack, which is a rare occurrence in the area.</p>

          <p>A tractor-trailer crash on Interstate 83 in Shrewsbury, Pennsylvania, resulted in a massive spill of hot dogs across the highway, causing significant traffic disruptions during the morning commute. The truck experienced a mechanical failure, causing it to collide with another vehicle and rip open its trailer against a concrete divider. Cleanup crews faced a challenging and slippery situation as they worked to clear the scattered franks from the road. Four individuals sustained non-life-threatening injuries in the incident, which added a peculiar twist to the usual traffic woes.</p>

          <p>A small clinic in Buffalo, New York, named La Bodega, is achieving remarkable success in curing Hepatitis C, a disease affecting millions of Americans. By streamlining the process to a single visit for diagnosis and treatment initiation, the clinic has cured approximately 98% of its 7,000 patients. This model proves that despite the availability of curative drugs for over a decade, access and efficiency are key barriers to widespread treatment. The clinic's success is now influencing policy, with a bipartisan bill in Washington aiming to create a national program to eliminate the disease, potentially saving billions in long-term medical costs.</p>

          <p>ESPN is reportedly finalizing a deal to acquire several NFL media properties, including the popular NFL Network and RedZone channel. In exchange, the NFL will receive an equity stake in ESPN that could be worth billions and potentially reach as high as 10%. The agreement, expected to be announced soon, would also grant ESPN access to more regular-season games and the league's fantasy football operations. This move deepens the existing partnership between the two giants as ESPN prepares to launch its new direct-to-consumer streaming service, further consolidating major sports content under its brand.</p>

          <p>India and China are showing signs of normalizing relations after a five-year diplomatic freeze that followed a deadly border clash. Recent positive steps include New Delhi resuming the issuance of visas to Chinese citizens and Beijing allowing Indian pilgrims to return to Tibet. Direct flights, suspended during the pandemic, are also expected to resume shortly. While these moves signal a potential thaw, experts caution that the unresolved and contentious Himalayan border dispute remains a significant obstacle. The shifting global landscape, including trade wars and new strategic alliances, may be nudging the two Asian powers toward renewed engagement.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made several moves to strengthen their roster before the trade deadline, acquiring right-handed relievers Brock Stewart and Paul Gervase and versatile outfielder Alex Call. Stewart, a former Dodger, returns as a high-leverage reliever with increased velocity, expected to help fortify the bullpen. Call provides a right-handed bat and defensive flexibility in the outfield. Manager Dave Roberts expressed confidence that these additions raise the team's overall floor, but emphasized that the team's ultimate success depends on its existing star players performing more consistently through the rest of the season.</p>

          <p>As earnings season continues, market analyst Jim Cramer is focusing on key upcoming reports from several major corporations. Data analytics firm Palantir is expected to post strong results on Monday following a major government contract win. Later in the week, investors will be watching reports from Disney and McDonald's, both of which have seen positive momentum. A crucial report will come from pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, as investors look to see if it is gaining market share in the popular weight-loss drug sector, especially after a disappointing quarter from its main competitor, Novo Nordisk.

          <p>At an internal meeting, social media giant ByteDance disclosed that the median service length for its current 120,000 employees is 2.9 years, with an average tenure of three years. The data was shared by CEO Liang Rubo to counter online speculation that the company had a very high turnover rate. These figures suggest that ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok and Douyin, is a relatively attractive employer within China's competitive tech industry. The company notably abandoned the demanding "996" work culture in 2021 in favor of a more standard five-day work week.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Justin Bessent has indicated that recent trade negotiations with China in Stockholm have been productive, stating the talks have "advanced" and that the "makings of a deal" are in place. Writing on social media, Bessent expressed optimism about the path forward, attributing it to the strong relationship between the U.S. and Chinese presidents. However, the administration has delivered mixed messages, and there has been no official confirmation of specific agreements, such as an extension of the current pause on new tariff increases, which has been in place since May.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals who have been living and working legally in the U.S. for years. The judge found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing that the decision to end their status was "preordained" and potentially motivated by racial animus. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling and stated it would appeal.</p>

          <p>An Ohio woman, Tiah McCreary, took a creative form of revenge after a Kia dealership repossessed her car just a month after purchase. Upon discovering that Taylor Kia of Lima had let its business name registration with the state lapse, she registered the name for herself and sent the dealership a cease-and-desist letter. The dealership initially tried to force the dispute into arbitration, but an appeals court has now ruled that the fight over the trade name is a separate matter that can proceed in court. The case highlights a unique consumer-versus-corporation battle stemming from a paperwork oversight.</p>

          <p>Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit has announced his decision to end his pursuit of an NFL career and return to rugby union. After 18 months in the NFL's International Player Pathway Program with the Kansas City Chiefs and Jacksonville Jaguars, the 24-year-old winger did not play in a regular-season game. He revealed there has been "unbelievable" interest from rugby clubs and expects to sign with a team soon. Rees-Zammit, who has 32 caps for Wales, also expressed his strong desire to rekindle his international career, a potential boost for the Welsh national team.</p>

          <p>Veteran wide receiver Keenan Allen is reportedly meeting with the Los Angeles Chargers to discuss a potential reunion with his former team. Allen, a six-time Pro Bowl selection, was traded to the Chicago Bears last year as a salary-cap casualty after 11 seasons with the Chargers. A return would make sense for Los Angeles, which is in need of experienced receiving depth following the recent retirement of Mike Williams. While the 33-year-old Allen is still a free agent, he could provide a reliable and familiar target for quarterback Justin Herbert.</p>
