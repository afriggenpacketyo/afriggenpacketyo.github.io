          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang cautioned that if the U.S. continues to restrict AI semiconductor exports to China, Huawei will capitalize on its domestic market advantage. While acknowledging Nvidia's technological lead, Huang stressed the importance of global AI developers using American technology to maintain competitiveness. He also expressed confidence in President Trump's understanding of the industry and his support for Nvidia. Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei admitted that Huawei's single chip is still behind the U.S. by a generation, despite U.S. export curbs that restrict Chinese firms from buying advanced semiconductors used in the development of AI. The article underscores the delicate balance between national security concerns and the potential for unintended consequences in the global technology landscape.
