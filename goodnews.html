          <p>BBC Sport has finalized a five-year agreement to broadcast live Women's Champions League matches, running until 2030. The deal will bring up to seven live games per season, including the final, to free-to-air platforms like BBC TV, iPlayer, and the BBC Sport website. This move aims to make the competition more accessible and visible to a wider audience, building on the growing popularity of women's football. The first match under the new contract will feature Manchester United versus Paris St-Germain in November.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has ended a long-standing program that allowed solo drivers of designated clean-air vehicles to use carpool lanes, affecting over half a million motorists. The change is expected to alter commute patterns, though experts are uncertain about the immediate impact on overall traffic congestion, particularly on already gridlocked freeways. The incentive was originally created to promote the adoption of electric and low-emission vehicles, a goal officials say has been successful, with such cars now making up nearly 25% of new sales. While former decal holders face longer commutes, the move may free up space in carpool lanes and encourage more genuine carpooling.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The concept of having a "best friend" provides significant psychological benefits, offering a deeper level of trust, support, and intimacy that contributes to overall well-being and staves off emotional loneliness. Research indicates that the quality of friendships, particularly having a close confidant, is more important than the sheer number of friends. While the act of ranking friends may seem juvenile, psychologists suggest humans subconsciously categorize their social connections to manage limited emotional energy, investing more in a small inner circle. This prioritization helps maintain strong, reliable bonds that function similarly to kin, which is crucial in an era of increased mobility.</p>

          <p>Extensive vaccination of adolescents against the human papillomavirus (HPV) in the United States has been so effective that herd immunity against the primary cause of cervical cancer is now considered within reach. A new study found that high, gender-neutral vaccination rates have led to major reductions in infections from cancer-causing HPV strains, even among unvaccinated women. This community-level protection demonstrates the success of the public health program. However, experts caution that maintaining this protection is dynamic and depends on sustaining high vaccine uptake to prevent resurgence of the virus.</p>

          <p>In Kathmandu, a 2-year-old girl named Aryatara Shakya has been chosen as Nepal's new Kumari, or "living goddess." The revered tradition, shared by Hindus and Buddhists, involves selecting a young girl from the Shakya clan who meets strict criteria, including having unblemished skin and showing no fear. She will live in a temple palace until she reaches puberty, at which point she will return to mortal life and a new Kumari will be chosen. While the role brings great honor to the girl's family, former Kumaris often face challenges readjusting to a normal life after their secluded upbringing.</p>

          <p>The global real estate market is experiencing a major shift as investors increasingly prioritize "invisible" properties like data centers over traditional assets such as office towers and malls. Driven by the explosive growth of AI and cloud computing, 95% of major investors plan to increase their data center holdings. However, the immense cost of building these facilities—with hyperscale projects requiring multi-billion-dollar investments—is straining traditional lenders like banks. This is creating a significant funding gap, raising questions about whether there is enough capital available to meet the surging demand for digital infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. District Court Judge in Boston has ruled that the Trump administration abused its power by targeting non-citizens for deportation based on their political speech, violating their First Amendment rights. The 161-page decision heavily focused on the case of a Tufts University graduate student who was arrested by ICE after co-authoring an op-ed on the war in Gaza. Judge William Young stated that the government's actions had an unconstitutional chilling effect on free speech, declaring, "We are not... a nation that imprisons and deports people because we are afraid of what they have to tell us." The ruling is being hailed as a major vindication for free speech advocates.</p>

          <h2>The Word 'Hoax' Traces Its Origins to a 17th-Century Magician's Catchphrase</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The word "hoax" has a surprising origin, evolving from "hocus pocus," the famous incantation and stage name of a 17th-century English magician named William Vincent. The phrase itself may be a satirical corruption of the Latin Eucharistic prayer, "Hoc est enim corpus meum," reflecting the anti-Catholic sentiment of the era. Vincent used "Hocus Pocus" as a brand, repeating it during his tricks until it became a shorthand for magic and deception itself. Over time, the spoken phrase "hocus" was shortened to "hoax," which entered the lexicon around 1800 to describe a grander, more elaborate deception.</p>

This represents a significant shift in consumer habits, with usage growing from 34% in the previous year. The trend is most pronounced among younger demographics, with 78% of 16 to 24-year-olds using mobile payments, but adoption is increasing across all age groups. As consumers become more comfortable using their phones for transactions, the use of physical contactless cards has slightly declined, and cash has become even less common for payments.</p>
