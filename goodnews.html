          <p>German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has banned the far-right "Kingdom of Germany" group, a faction within the "Reichsb√ºrger" movement, accusing it of attempting to establish a "counter-state" within Germany. Police conducted raids on properties of key members, including the self-declared monarch, Peter Fitzek, who founded the group in 2012. Dobrindt stated that the group undermines the rule of law and uses antisemitic conspiracy narratives to support its claims.
