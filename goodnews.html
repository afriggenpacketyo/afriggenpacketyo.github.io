          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 22:00:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese technology firms are leveraging open-source AI models to compete with leading U.S. companies such as OpenAI and Google. Unlike the closed, proprietary systems common in Silicon Valley, companies like DeepSeek have released powerful large language models (LLMs) whose source code is publicly available for use and modification. This strategy has fostered global collaboration and accelerated AI development in China, presenting a significant challenge to the established order. Analysts suggest this open-source movement could redefine the global AI landscape by offering a viable alternative to American-led AI innovation.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced at the White House that ten more hostages are expected to be released from Gaza "very shortly." The statement was made during a dinner with Republican senators as the administration continues its efforts to secure a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The current ceasefire proposal reportedly includes the release of these ten living hostages and the remains of eighteen others in exchange for an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. Trump praised his Middle East envoy and expressed hope that the process would be completed quickly, building on his previous claims of progress.</p>

          <p>The Australian government has delivered M1A1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine as part of a significant military aid package to support its defense against Russia's invasion. The tanks are a component of a A$245 million ($160 million) package, with most of the 49 promised vehicles now in Ukrainian possession. As one of the largest non-NATO contributors, Australia has provided over A$1.5 billion in total aid, including ammunition and defense equipment. This move underscores Australia's continued commitment to assisting Ukraine and holding Russia accountable for the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Retired Marine Cpl. Scott Harrison, who endured the Vietnam War by envisioning a peaceful carousel, has brought that vision to life in Nederland, Colorado. During the war, a music box from his sister helped him imagine the carousel, providing a mental escape from the brutality. After struggling with PTSD, Harrison decided to build his vision, purchasing a broken-down carousel in 1986 and spending 26 years hand-carving its animals. Now a nonprofit, the Carousel of Happiness has delighted over a million visitors since 2010 and has become a source of profound healing and joy for Harrison.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States.

This warning comes as the market for digital currencies grows, spurred by the Trump administration's embrace of the technology.

          <p>President Trump was recently diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs. According to his physician, the condition is benign, common in older adults, and involves weakened veins struggling to return blood to the heart, causing it to pool. CVI affects about one in three U.S. adults and can cause aching and heaviness in the legs. Treatment typically involves lifestyle changes like exercise, leg elevation, and compression stockings. The White House physician affirmed that the president is in 'excellent health' and the condition is manageable.</p>

The move comes after significant public and political pressure for more transparency, which intensified after the administration initially stated no more files would be released.

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing a notable surge in wasp populations this summer, a trend experts attribute to the warm and dry spring weather. While scientific data is pending, pest control associations report increased callouts for nests, and entomologists agree that conditions have been ideal for social wasps. Though often disliked, experts emphasize the ecological importance of wasps as apex predators and natural pest controllers. They advise the public to avoid agitating the insects and suggest leaving a small amount of a sugary substance away from picnic areas to distract them.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered a specific interaction between a common gut bacteria molecule and a genetic variant that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. The study found that in people with a faulty version of the OTUD3 gene, a molecule produced by gut bacteria overactivates an immune protein called STING, leading to chronic inflammation. This finding helps explain why the disease varies so much between patients and why treatments can be inconsistent. The research opens the door for more personalized therapies that could target this specific pathway without broadly suppressing the immune system.</p>
