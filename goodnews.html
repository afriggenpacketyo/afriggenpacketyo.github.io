          <p>OpenAI is backing the construction of a massive AI data center in Norway, its first such project in Europe. The "Stargate" branded facility, a joint venture between British firm Nscale and Norwegian company Aker, aims to house 100,000 Nvidia GPUs by the end of 2026. This move aligns with Europe's push for "sovereign AI," which requires data to be processed on the continent. The data center will run entirely on renewable energy, addressing the growing demand for large-scale AI infrastructure in a fragmented European market.</p>

The agreement provides relief for Pakistan, which was facing a potential 29% tariff from the U.S. This development contrasts with recent U.S. actions against India, on which it imposed a 25% tariff, with Trump criticizing India's high tariffs and trade with Russia.

The company announced it will continue its share buyback program at a pace of $3.5 billion, marking the 15th consecutive quarter of significant shareholder returns. CEO Wael Sawan expressed satisfaction with the performance and highlighted progress on structural cost reductions.

          <p>Malaysian Transport Minister Anthony Loke has stated that several airlines in the country, including AirAsia and the new Air Borneo, are considering China's C919 passenger jet. The interest is driven by a desire to diversify aircraft procurement and find alternatives to the long delivery wait times from established manufacturers Boeing and Airbus. China's state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) is promoting the C919 as a more readily available and cheaper option for the growing Southeast Asian air travel market. The minister noted that while there is definite interest, no commercial negotiations have been confirmed yet.</p>

          <p>The auction house Sotheby's has returned a collection of sacred jewels, known as the Piprahwa Gems, to India after a planned auction sparked an uproar. The gems, believed to be linked to the Buddha's remains, were acquired by the Mumbai-based Godrej Industries Group, averting a controversial public sale. The Indian government and global Buddhist leaders had applied significant pressure, arguing that sacred relics should not be commoditized. The jewels, unearthed in 1898, will now be placed on permanent public display in India, a move hailed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a victory for the country's cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>Astronauts from China's Shenzhou-19 mission have revealed that their recent record-setting spacewalk included an unexpected and challenging repair task. Mission commander Cai Xuzhe explained that a payload adaptor, a key docking mechanism, became jammed during an external cargo installation. The crew had to devise an impromptu solution in coordination with ground control, as they lacked specialized tools for the unrehearsed problem. This successful improvisation highlights the crew's problem-solving skills during complex extravehicular operations aboard the Chinese space station.</p>

          <p>Despite the U.S. imposing 25% duties on its imports, India has not rushed into a trade agreement, choosing to protect key domestic sectors. A primary sticking point is India's resistance to granting greater market access for American agricultural products, a move aimed at safeguarding its large and politically significant farming population. Analysts suggest that because exports to the U.S. are a relatively small part of India's overall economy, it has more leverage to hold its ground. This strategy is part of India's broader "multi-alignment" approach, pursuing trade deals with other partners like the UK and EU while navigating its relationship with Washington.
