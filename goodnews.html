          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has rejected an offer from U.S. President Donald Trump to send U.S. troops to help fight drug cartels, reaffirming Mexico's stance on sovereignty. Sheinbaum emphasized the importance of collaboration and information sharing but insisted on maintaining territorial integrity. The White House highlighted ongoing coordinated efforts with Mexico to enhance border security and combat transnational criminal organizations. A conservative group has suggested potential unilateral U.S. military action as a last resort, but Sheinbaum maintains that Mexico will never accept the presence of the United States Army on its territory.

          <p>The 151st running of the Kentucky Derby showcased a vibrant display of hats, ranging from traditional designs to elaborate fascinators, despite heavy rain throughout the day.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Democrats are grappling with the question of whether their leaders are too old, prompting a debate about imposing a mandatory retirement age for state and local officeholders. The discussion was spurred by concerns over leaders holding onto power past their prime, referencing examples like the late Senator Dianne Feinstein and President Joseph R. Biden. A resolution calling for exploring a mandatory retirement age was passed by the San Francisco Democratic County Central Committee, but faces opposition from those who view it as ageist. While Americans generally favor age limits for elected officials, implementing such a mandate would require state legislation and faces significant hurdles. Optimism score: 65</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's election as Prime Minister of Canada marks a potential turning point in the country's approach to the ongoing trade war with the United States. Carney campaigned on a platform of standing up to Donald Trump's protectionist policies and defending Canadian sovereignty. His victory was fueled by Trump's imposition of national security tariffs and suggestions that Canada should join the USA. Carney's strategy incorporated voters from across the political spectrum who were concerned about Canada's independence and economic future, positioning him as a strong leader to navigate the challenges posed by the U.S. administration.
