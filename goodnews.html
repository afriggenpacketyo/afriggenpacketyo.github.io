          <p>House Oversight Chairman James Comer is seeking interviews with former President Biden's White House physician and aides as part of an investigation into Biden's mental fitness and use of an autopen. Comer cites concerns about the accuracy and transparency of Biden's medical assessments, particularly in light of his recent cancer diagnosis and allegations of mental impairments detailed in a new book. The committee aims to assess whether administration officials were performing presidential duties for Biden and explore potential legislation regarding presidential fitness under the Twenty-Fifth Amendment. Comer warns of decisive action if obstruction continues, referencing Biden's previous rejection of similar requests. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has suggested that Federal Reserve board members have special protection against presidential firings, while allowing President Trump to remove two members of other federal agencies' boards. The ruling stated that the President may remove executive officers who exercise power on his behalf, but the decision also strongly implied that efforts to fire Federal Reserve board members would face resistance. Justice Kagan dissented, noting the ruling's exemption for the Federal Reserve and emphasizing the importance of independence for bipartisan administrative federal bodies. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell previously stated that the president does not have the power to fire him. </p>

          <p>Despite initial interest, President Trump's proposed 'gold card' visa, offering permanent residency to wealthy individuals investing at least $5 million in the U.S., has failed to lure wealthy Chinese investors. Candice Meng, a real estate developer, cited concerns about the U.S.-China trade war and high urban crime levels as reasons for her decision to forgo applying. This trend reflects a broader reluctance among China's wealthy, who were expected to be a primary source of demand, due to economic slowdown and safety concerns in the U.S. Wealthy Chinese investors make up roughly 70 percent of applicants for the existing EB-5 visa. </p>

          <p>Hall of Famer Brian Urlacher has reiterated his stance against transgender athletes competing in women's sports, describing it as a matter of "common sense." Urlacher argues that biological differences make it unfair for men to participate in women's sports, citing examples of transgender athletes dominating competitions. He questions why more girls and women are not speaking out, noting the negative impact on those who choose to step down from competition rather than compete against men. Urlacher also highlights the potential dangers of men competing against women in sports, referencing a volleyball player injured by a spike. </p>

These announcements have surprised many, considering Trump's previous withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018.

These provisions aim to eliminate barriers for lower-income individuals, potentially doubling their annual contribution limits.

The legislation, if signed into law, would increase contribution limits for individuals and families, offering a financial tool for healthcare costs. (not investment advice) </p>
