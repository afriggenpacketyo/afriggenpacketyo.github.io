          <p>The band Haim's new album, "I Quit," delves into themes of breakups and unraveling commitments, remixing the breakup-music canon for a generation wary of marriage. The album reflects lead singer Danielle's recent split from her partner, who also produced the band's previous albums, leading to a more liberated and experimental sound. The lyrics explore ambivalence, grief, anger, and horniness, capturing the drama of experiencing life as a purely internal, self-directed struggle. The album questions societal expectations and the pursuit of self-actualization, echoing Bob Dylan's sentiment of being on one's own.</p>
