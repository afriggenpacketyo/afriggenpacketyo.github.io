The government accepted recommendations from pay review bodies that exceeded the previously budgeted 2.8%. Unions had threatened action if pay awards were not increased, arguing that 2.8% was insufficient. The Treasury stated that rises above this level would need to be funded through savings from existing budgets, potentially impacting frontline services.</p>

          <p>ASML's High NA, a $400 million chipmaking machine, is transforming microchip manufacturing with its advanced Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. The machine, larger than a double-decker bus, projects smaller chip designs with higher resolution, improving speed, performance, and yield. Intel, TSMC, and Samsung are among the first to use High NA, which reduces cycle time and allows for more devices on a single wafer. ASML, the exclusive maker of EUV machines, has reduced the power needed per wafer exposure by more than 60% since 2018.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally, hitting a new record high above $111,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership and corporate adoption. Easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, as well as the Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, have been key catalysts. Pro-crypto policies from President Trump and his AI and crypto czar David Sacks have also supported the market.
