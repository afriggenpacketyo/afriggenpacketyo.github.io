          <p>Global investment advisory Cambridge Associates suggests that global investors are re-evaluating their portfolios and considering undervalued equities in Hong Kong and mainland China. Aaron Costello, the firm‚Äôs head of Asia, noted that despite aggressive tariffs, Asian equities have outperformed, with Chinese and Hong Kong stocks remaining attractive due to compelling valuations and falling interest rates. This sentiment follows an agreement between Washington and Beijing to reduce tariffs, easing geopolitical risks. Hong Kong‚Äôs Hang Seng Index has risen significantly this year, supported by monetary easing and policy coordination between the two nations, making it an attractive alternative to expensive US stocks (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The SEC has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, concluding one of the last remaining crypto enforcement actions by the agency. The original complaint accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and unlawfully enabling trading in unregistered securities. This dismissal marks a symbolic end to an aggressive crypto crackdown, coinciding with efforts by the Trump administration to align itself with the crypto industry. Binance has recently partnered with World Liberty Financial, a crypto bank project, and Zhao has been appointed as an advisor to Pakistan's Crypto Council.</p>

          <p>After a severe spring season of toxic algae blooms that sickened numerous sea lions, experts report that the worst of the poisoning is over in Southern California. The Marine Mammal Care Center in San Pedro has not seen any new patients with domoic acid poisoning or recent signs of Pseudo-nitzschia algae. This year‚Äôs event was particularly challenging, with the center treating over 400 marine animals, including sea lions and dolphins, and experiencing reports of aggressive sea lion behavior. Researchers attribute the increased scale and frequency of these blooms to climate change and increased agricultural runoff, wastewater discharge, and urban stormwater.</p>

City leaders plan to prioritize trail segments near schools and are exploring additional ways to involve the community in the decision-making process.
