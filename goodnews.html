White received the news from head coach Andy Farrell while he was in New Zealand preparing to play for Scotland. He admitted to "non-stop shaking" since the call, calling the opportunity an incredible and dream-like honor that he never truly expected to achieve in his career.</p>

          <p>As Reddit celebrates two decades of operation, it faces a significant challenge from the rise of artificial intelligence, which threatens its core value of user-generated content. The company is actively defending its data, recently suing AI firm Anthropic for allegedly scraping content without permission to train its models. CEO Steve Huffman asserts that human interaction on the platform provides a unique value that sterile AI answers cannot replicate. Concurrently, Reddit is embracing AI on its own terms by launching "Reddit Answers," an AI tool that generates responses based solely on platform discussions, aiming to merge AI's simplicity with user authenticity.</p>

          <p>A new trade deal between the United Kingdom and the United States has come into force, cutting tariffs on key exports like cars and aerospace products. The agreement allows UK car manufacturers to sell up to 100,000 vehicles to the US with a reduced 10% tariff, while tariffs on UK aerospace exports are eliminated. In exchange, the UK has scrapped tariffs on US beef and ethanol imports, a move criticized by the British bioethanol industry. However, a significant point of contention remains, as UK steel and aluminum are still subject to a 25% US tariff, which could double if a separate deal is not reached. (not investment advice)</p>

This resurgence marks the best first-half performance since 2021 and represents a significant recovery from a recent slump.

By the end of 2024, membership reached 100.27 million, marking a 1.1% net increase from the previous year, though the growth rate has slowed slightly. This figure solidifies the CPC's position as the world's second-largest political party by membership, after India's Bharatiya Janata Party. Unlike registered voters in Western systems, CPC members are subject to strict regulations, including mandatory fees and regular participation in party activities, reflecting a much deeper level of commitment and control.</p>

          <p>A coalition of major Democratic groups, including the DNC, is launching a new summer initiative aimed at boosting voter registration and engagement ahead of the 2025 and 2026 elections. The program, dubbed "Organizing Summer," focuses on reaching voters in non-traditional settings like community groups and book clubs to rebuild support following losses in 2024. With an initial six-figure investment, the DNC aims to deploy thousands of volunteers to connect with communities and provide feedback to inform party strategy. The effort is also seen as an attempt to project unity and focus on winning elections after recent public instances of party infighting.</p>

          <p>When a friend is diagnosed with cancer, offering the right kind of support is crucial, and experts suggest that simply being present is more helpful than offering platitudes or unsolicited advice. Survivors and advocates emphasize that comparing their situation to others, especially those with negative outcomes, can be hurtful. Instead, they recommend reaching out, asking if the person wants to talk, and then actively listening without judgment. A common mistake is making vague offers of help; being specific, such as offering to bring a particular meal on a specific day, is far more effective. It is also important to continue this support even after treatment ends, as the recovery journey is often long and challenging.</p>

Both men, now approaching 100 years old, shared their harrowing wartime experiences with the USC Shoah Foundation, which is working to archive testimonies as the number of living witnesses dwindles.

          <p>Homicide rates are falling significantly across the United States, with some analyses showing a drop of at least 14% in 2024. While city officials often credit policing, crime analysts suggest a primary driver is the normalization of society after the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers theorize the 2020 crime surge was linked to the disruption of daily life and the loss of public services and community support systems for young people. As local government employment and spending have returned to pre-pandemic levels, these vital support structures have been restored, which is believed to be interrupting cycles of violence by providing constructive environments and support.</p>

          <p>The Italian luxury brand Prada has formally acknowledged the Indian origins of a new sandal design after facing accusations of cultural appropriation. The footwear, which closely resembles traditional Kolhapuri sandals from the Indian states of Maharashtra and Karnataka, was initially described simply as "leather footwear" without mentioning its roots. Following a backlash and a letter from an Indian trade body, Prada stated it recognizes the inspiration and is open to a dialogue with local Indian artisans. Kolhapuri sandals, which trace their history to the 12th century, hold a Geographical Indication (GI) tag in India, marking their regional authenticity.</p>

The system has been implemented by 530 local governments, marking a significant surge in adoption over the past three years. While this represents a major step forward for LGBT rights in Japan, the certificates are not legally binding and do not grant the same rights as marriage, such as spousal tax deductions or co-parenting rights. Advocates say that while the system has brought tangible benefits, many are still eagerly awaiting the legal recognition of same-sex marriage, which Japan has yet to formalize.</p>

          <p>China is set to play a leading role in deep-sea exploration through a new multi-country initiative that has been endorsed by the United Nations. The Global Hadal Exploration Programme (GHEP), spearheaded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was selected for inclusion in the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. As part of the project, a global research center will be established to conduct annual crewed expeditions into the hadal zone, the deepest parts of the ocean found in oceanic trenches. This UN endorsement reflects China's growing leadership and influence in the specialized field of deep-sea science and exploration.</p>

          <h2>US-Canada Trade Negotiations to Resume Following Reversal of Digital Tax</h2>

          <p>Canada has rescinded its planned digital services tax (DST) on large U.S. technology firms, a move that has cleared the way for trade talks between the two countries to restart. The 3% levy, which would have affected companies like Amazon and Meta, was called a "blatant attack" by U.S. President Donald Trump, who had halted negotiations and threatened retaliatory tariffs. Just hours before the tax was to take effect, the Canadian government reversed its position, stating a preference for a multilateral agreement. An agreement between the two major trading partners is now expected by July 21. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A field of 288 golfers, including veterans like Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood, and Graeme McDowell, are competing across four UK venues for just 20 spots in the 153rd Open Championship at Royal Portrush. The high-stakes final qualifying events represent the last chance for many to enter golf's oldest major. An intriguing storyline features Ian Poulter competing at the same venue as his son, Luke, both vying for one of the few available places. For players like McDowell, a Northern Ireland native, qualifying holds special significance, as it would allow him to compete in his hometown for the prestigious championship.</p>
