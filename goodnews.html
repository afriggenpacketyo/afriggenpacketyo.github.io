          <p>The recent exchanges between Israel and Iran have highlighted the effectiveness of Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system, reigniting discussions about the proposed Golden Dome multi-layered missile defense system in the United States. While the Iron Dome protects Israel from missile attacks, the U.S. seeks to defend its homeland from ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles through the Golden Dome project. The project faces challenges including technological obstacles and a hefty price tag, but defense companies are vying for a piece of the pie. The Golden Dome Caucus has been formed to support Trump's plans, with significant funding allocated for missile defense and space programs.</p>

          <p>Experts are raising concerns that children with lazy eyes are increasingly being missed for treatment due to the lack of early screenings in schools. Some local councils are unable to provide this service because of budget or capacity issues. The British and Irish Orthoptic Society (BIOS) advocates for universal screening in schools, similar to practices in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, as treatment is most effective before age seven. The LGA is calling for increased funding for public health to support school-based screenings, and while the government has announced a ¬£200m boost, experts emphasize the importance of regular NHS-funded eye tests for children.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have created a low-cost, edible protein-based coating that more than doubles the shelf life of various fruits by reducing moisture loss and inhibiting microbial growth. Tested on 17 types of whole and cut fruits, the coating delayed rot by nearly a week or more, costing only 9 US cents per kilogram of fruit. The researchers at Shaanxi Normal University say this eco-friendly strategy is as effective as existing preservation methods, while reducing carbon dioxide emissions and the potential for toxicity. This innovation offers a promising solution to global food waste, as approximately one-third of all food produced is wasted, mostly perishable items like fruits and vegetables.</p>

Durov, who also acknowledges being the "official father" of six other children with three different partners, plans to divide his estimated $13.9 billion fortune equally among all of his offspring. However, none of his children will have access to their inheritance for 30 years, as he wants them to live normal lives and build their own success. Durov also addressed criminal charges he faces in France, describing them as "totally absurd," and denied failing to cooperate with law enforcement.</p>

          <p>As Americans commemorate the 50th anniversary of "Jaws," recent shark attacks are grabbing headlines, even as activists emphasize the importance of shark conservation. Despite reported attacks, experts say the rise in sightings is due to more people in the water, improved technology, and successful conservation efforts, not an increase in shark populations. Shark Angels founder Julie Andersen notes that white shark populations are rebounding in areas like California and Cape Cod. In Florida, New Smyrna Beach is known as the "shark bite capital of the world," but most bites are minor. One athlete is swimming around Martha's Vineyard to raise awareness of shark protection.</p>

After a five-year suspension due to COVID-19 and border disputes, China is allowing pilgrims to return to the Tibet autonomous region this summer. The sites are sacred to Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and followers of Bon. Approximately 750 of the 5,561 applicants will be permitted to travel along two routes between June and August.

          <p>China's central bank has decided to keep its benchmark lending rates steady, following a reduction last month and a trade agreement with the United States. The People's Bank of China held the one-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the five-year LPR at 3.5%. This decision comes after China and the U.S. agreed to honor a consensus reached in Geneva, allowing for rare earth and tech trade while suspending tariffs. This trade truce has provided Beijing with some room to support its currency and has raised hopes that any economic impact will be smaller than anticipated. (not investment advice)</p>
