          <p>Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded to Tom Homan's threat to refer her to the Department of Justice for advising migrants about their rights. Ocasio-Cortez asserted that her actions, including hosting a "Know your Rights" webinar, were protected by free speech and dared Homan to take action against her. She criticized the Trump administration's immigration policies, describing deportations of Venezuelan gang members as sanctioned kidnappings and emphasized migrants' rights to demand warrants from ICE agents. The congresswoman spoke at a town hall in Queens, addressing local issues and criticizing a proposed casino at Citi Field, while also facing a disruption from a protester regarding the situation in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese secured a second term, a significant victory for his center-left Labor Party despite trailing in polls due to a cost-of-living crisis. The conservative opposition, led by Peter Dutton, suffered a resounding defeat, partly due to associations with Trump's policies. The election, influenced by global turmoil from Trump's trade and diplomatic decisions, saw younger voters expressing disaffection with both major parties. Albanese's party may need support from smaller parties to maintain a majority in Parliament, reflecting broader dissatisfaction with traditional political solutions.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that curiosity is essential for successful dating, yet dating apps and social media often hinder genuine connection by providing too much information upfront. Knowing too much about a person beforehand can lead to disinterest and unrealistic expectations, making it harder to form meaningful connections. Matchmakers suggest giving up control and trusting friends or family for setups, which can lead to more exciting and surprising encounters. Asking open-ended questions that encourage storytelling and active listening can help spark curiosity and build deeper connections.</p>

          <p>A new training program, CHAT, aims to reduce "elderspeak," a form of communication that resembles baby talk and is often used with older adults, potentially undermining their dignity. Studies show that elderspeak is common in nursing homes and can lead to resistance to care. The CHAT program, involving videos and training sessions, has proven effective in reducing elderspeak and resistant behaviors. Individuals and institutions can combat elderspeak by addressing clients respectfully and understanding cultural differences in communication styles.</p>
