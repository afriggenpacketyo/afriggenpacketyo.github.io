        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Google is overhauling its internal learning platform, Grow, to focus on training employees in artificial intelligence tools. Previously, Grow offered a wide range of courses, but now it primarily features AI-related training. This shift reflects the growing importance of AI across industries and Google's efforts to streamline operations and prioritize business-essential offerings. The company has also enacted rolling layoffs and rolled back some diversity and inclusion programs. Some employees have expressed concern that the focus on "business priorities" indicates a shift away from broader learning opportunities. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wildlife experts are warning that dirty hummingbird feeders can be harmful or even deadly to the birds. Sugar water left out too long can spoil and grow harmful microbes, leading to infections like candida, which causes tongue swelling and starvation. While not all microbes are dangerous, it's common for individual birds to get sick from dirty feeders. To prevent this, feeders should be cleaned every two to three days in spring and fall, and daily or every other day in summer. The solution is to mix one part refined white sugar with four parts water, avoid food coloring, and use purified water. </p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plans to use artificial intelligence (AI) in drug approvals to "radically increase efficiency." This move comes in response to a Trump-driven reduction of nearly 2,000 employees. Agency officials view AI as a way to expedite the process of bringing drugs to market. The integration of AI into drug approvals raises both opportunities and concerns about the future of pharmaceutical regulation. </p>

          <p>College students preparing for the fall 2025 semester are facing a challenging borrowing environment with high interest rates. Federal student loan rates have slightly decreased, with undergraduate loans at 6.39%. A good student loan rate is ideally below the national average and the lowest possible based on individual financial circumstances. Private lenders offer competitive rates, but eligibility often depends on a strong credit score or a co-signer. Federal loans offer unique borrower protections, while private loans may offer lower rates for qualified borrowers. (not investment advice) </p>
