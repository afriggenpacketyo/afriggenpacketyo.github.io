          <p>BYD has overtaken Tesla in European battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales for the first time, selling 7,231 units in April, a 169% year-on-year increase, while Tesla's sales fell by 49% to 7,165 units; this is despite the EU imposing tariffs on Chinese carmakers. This shift signifies a pivotal moment in Europe's automotive market, where BEVs accounted for 17% of new car registrations in April, up from 13.4% the previous year. Chinese firms' BEV sales surged by 59% despite the tariffs, highlighting their growing influence in the European electric vehicle sector. The article suggests that BYD's growth could be attributed to its focus on plug-in hybrids as well as BEVs.</p>
