          <p>Despite his numerous achievements, including multiple NBA championships and MVP awards, Stephen Curry admits to experiencing impostor syndrome. Curry, the son of former NBA player Dell Curry, says he didn't grow up with the expectation to play in the league due to his stature and underdog mentality. He has embraced this status and used it as motivation throughout his career. Off the court, Curry is involved in various business ventures and philanthropic efforts, including his nonprofit Eat. Learn. Play., which supports Oakland schools, and the Underrated Golf Tour, which aims to increase minority participation in golf.</p>

          <p>Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry is already considering his post-NBA career options, including broadcasting, team ownership, and potentially playing on the PGA Tour Champions. Curry is also the CEO of Thirty Ink, a mini-conglomerate of businesses, and plans to take a more active role in its management after retirement. Following in the footsteps of Michael Jordan, Curry is interested in becoming part of an NBA ownership group, but acknowledges the rising valuations of teams may make majority ownership unattainable. He also expressed interest in buying a WNBA team and has used his venture Unanimous Media to springboard a career in front of the camera.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer believes that shares of off-price retailer TJX are undervalued and represent a buying opportunity. He argues that the stock was unfairly punished despite the company's strong first-quarter performance, where it beat expectations for both revenue and earnings. Cramer highlights TJX's ability to maintain low prices even as other retailers are forced to raise them, making it a standout in a challenging retail landscape. JPMorgan analyst Matthew Boss also raised the firm's price target for TJX, citing confidence in the company's continued market share gains. (not investment advice)</p>
