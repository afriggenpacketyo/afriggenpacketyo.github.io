        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's parliament has elected ultraconservative Sanae Takaichi as the nation's first female prime minister, ending a period of political uncertainty following her predecessor's brief tenure. Her leadership was secured after her Liberal Democratic Party formed a new coalition with the right-wing Japan Innovation Party, shifting the governing bloc's political stance. A protege of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is expected to pursue a hawkish agenda, including strengthening the military and revising the pacifist constitution, though her new coalition's stability remains a challenge for passing legislation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A detailed analysis shows how Declan Rice's role at Arsenal has evolved since his £105 million transfer, transitioning from a traditional holding midfielder to a more dynamic box-to-box player. This strategic shift, further enabled by the signing of Martin Zubimendi, has allowed Rice to leverage his running power and significantly increase his attacking contributions, leading to a career-best season for goals and assists. The change has been praised by football experts and has also benefited the England national team, where he has been given similar freedom to operate in a more advanced position.</p>

He describes the British high-tech headquarters as a place where 'no stones are unturned,' contributing to his recent success, including setting a new world record in the flying 200m. As he prepares for the World Championships in Chile, Richardson believes the new environment has given him an edge in his rivalry with Dutch champion Harrie Lavreysen, stating his ambition is to win every event he competes in.</p>

          <p>The Toronto Blue Jays have secured their first World Series appearance since 1993 after a dramatic 4-3 series victory over the Seattle Mariners in the American League Championship Series. Outfielder George Springer was the hero, hitting a decisive three-run home run in the seventh inning of the final game to clinch the win. The Blue Jays will now compete against the defending champions, the Los Angeles Dodgers, in the World Series.

          <h2>Scientists Identify Protein Weakness That Could Lead to New Prostate Cancer Treatments</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative research team from China and Australia has identified a key cellular weakness that may pave the way for new therapeutic strategies against prostate cancer. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, pinpointed two protein enzymes that are crucial for the growth, survival, and treatment resistance of prostate cancer cells. By understanding how these enzymes regulate the androgen receptor protein, which fuels the disease, scientists hope to develop future treatments that can more effectively combat this common form of cancer.</p>

          <p>Australian scientists have discovered several new species, including a small, glowing lantern shark and a semi-transparent porcelain crab, during a deep-sea exploration off the coast of Western Australia. The West Australian Lantern Shark, found over 600 meters deep, is bioluminescent and grows up to 40cm. The newly found porcelain crab, about the size of an almond, uses hairs instead of claws to filter-feed on plankton. These discoveries were made during a research voyage in the Gascoyne Marine Park, highlighting how much of Australia's vast marine biodiversity remains unexplored.</p>

          <p>Exporters at China's Canton Fair are observing a growing trend of international clients requesting to use the yuan for trade settlements, particularly from Southeast Asian and Central Asian countries. One company representative noted that yuan-settled orders now constitute 10 to 20 percent of their total exports, a significant increase from last year. This shift is partly driven by Chinese suppliers leading infrastructure projects, such as data centers, in developing nations. The trend reflects a gradual but noticeable move towards the internationalization of China's currency in global trade.</p>

          <p>A new project called 'Reefline' is underway off the coast of Miami Beach, creating a seven-mile-long artificial reef and underwater art installation. The reef, composed of sculptures made from marine-grade concrete, will serve as a habitat for locally sourced, resilient corals and an ecotourism attraction accessible to swimmers. Funded by the city and private donations, the project's first phase features an installation of 22 concrete cars arranged as an underwater traffic jam. The initiative aims to restore the coral habitat that was lost decades ago and create a unique cultural and ecological landmark.</p>

          <p>A new feature-length documentary titled 'Spacewoman' chronicles the historic career of Eileen Collins, the first woman to pilot and command a NASA Space Shuttle. Collins overcame the absence of female role models in her youth to become an Air Force test pilot and eventually a trailblazing astronaut. She commanded the critical 'return to flight' mission after the 2003 Columbia disaster, a role that required immense bravery and leadership. The film explores her determination, her perspective on being a working mother in a demanding field, and her execution of a risky in-space maneuver to ensure her crew's safety.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Rossi, a US fugitive who faked his own death and fled to Scotland, has been sentenced to at least five years in prison for the sexual assault of a woman in Utah in 2008. After a lengthy extradition battle during which he falsely claimed to be an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight, Rossi was returned to the US to face justice. During the sentencing in Salt Lake City, the judge described Rossi as a 'serial abuser of women' and the 'very definition of a flight risk,' while Rossi continued to maintain his disproven claims of mistaken identity.</p>
