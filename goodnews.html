          <p>The United States and China have agreed on a framework to implement a consensus reached during May talks and reiterated in a recent phone conversation between their leaders, according to Chinese state-run media. The high-level meeting, which concluded in London, centered on easing export controls on critical sectors. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that the topic of rare earth minerals and magnets would be resolved within this framework. The agreement follows frustrations from the Trump administration regarding China's slow removal of export controls on rare earths, while China has accused the U.S. of imposing export controls on goods like semiconductors despite the deal.

          <p>President Trump has announced the restoration of several Army base names that originally honored Confederate military figures, reversing a renaming process initiated by Congress. However, the bases will now recognize other service members with similar names, rather than the original Confederate figures. The move aims to honor military history while avoiding formal recognition of Confederate leaders. Secretary of the Army Daniel Driscoll will oversee the renaming of seven bases to reflect this change. The Trump administration had already changed back the names of Fort Bragg and Fort Benning earlier this year.</p>

Meta is finalizing a deal to invest $14 billion into Scale AI and hire its CEO, Alexandr Wang, to lead a new AI research lab. This move comes after lukewarm reception to Meta's latest Llama AI models and aims to bolster the company's AI ambitions. By taking a stake in Scale AI rather than acquiring it outright, Meta appears to be mirroring strategies used by Google and Microsoft while avoiding potential antitrust concerns.</p>
