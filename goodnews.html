          <p>Tesla's stock has rebounded to show a net gain for the year, closing at $410.26 on Monday after a significant downturn in the first quarter. The shares have surged 85% from a low point in early April, boosted by news of CEO Elon Musk purchasing approximately $1 billion worth of company stock through his foundation. Despite this recovery, the electric vehicle manufacturer is still navigating a sales slump due to an aging product line and strong competition from Chinese automakers, while also trying to shift investor focus toward future projects like robotaxis and humanoid robots.</p>

          <p>U.S. stock markets continued their record-setting rally on Monday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite both closing at all-time highs. The gains were driven by strong performances in the tech sector, notably Alphabet, which surpassed a $3 trillion market capitalization, and Tesla, whose stock rose 3.6% after CEO Elon Musk disclosed a major share purchase. Investors are now keenly awaiting the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rates, with widespread expectations for the first cut of the year, which could further influence market direction and economic activity.</p>

The change, set to be implemented in the first half of 2026, will decrease the weighting of major economies like China, India, Indonesia, and Mexico. This rebalancing aims to enhance diversification and reduce concentration risk for investors, subsequently redirecting investment flows toward smaller emerging markets such as Thailand, Poland, South Africa, and Brazil, which are expected to be the primary beneficiaries of the adjustment.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has purchased approximately $1 billion worth of the company's stock, his first open-market buy since early 2020 and his largest ever by value. The move is being interpreted by investors as a strong vote of confidence in the electric vehicle maker, prompting a more than 3% rise in its share price. This significant insider acquisition comes as Tesla's stock has faced headwinds from slumping sales and controversies surrounding Musk's political activities, while the company attempts to pivot investor attention toward its ambitious artificial intelligence and robotics projects.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve's Influence on Mortgage Rates Explained Ahead of Potential Cut</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve is expected to announce its first interest rate cut since late 2024, experts clarify that the decision will not directly or immediately lower mortgage rates. The Fed controls the short-term federal funds rate, whereas fixed-rate mortgages are more closely tied to long-term instruments like the 10-year Treasury note yield. While adjustable-rate mortgages are more sensitive to the Fed's actions, lenders have largely already priced the anticipated cut into current mortgage rates, which recently fell to their lowest level in nearly a year in anticipation of the central bank's move.</p>

The announcement came after trade negotiations in Madrid, with President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping expected to finalize the agreement on Friday. This development comes ahead of a looming deadline for TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to sell its American arm or face a ban in the U.S. due to national security concerns. China confirmed the framework but stated any deal must protect the interests of Chinese companies.</p>

          <p>The IRS deadline for third-quarter estimated tax payments is September 15, a crucial date for self-employed individuals, freelancers, and those with income not subject to withholding, such as from investments. Tax professionals note that recent tax breaks enacted by President Trump could complicate calculations for some filers, who may risk overpaying if they don't adjust for the changes. To avoid underpayment penalties, taxpayers should generally pay at least 90% of their current year's tax liability or 100% of the previous year's, with a higher threshold for those with incomes over $150,000.</p>
