          <p>This article details the undercover operation that led to the capture of Bryan Patrick Miller, the "Phoenix canal killer" responsible for two murders in the early 1990s. Cold case detective Clark Schwartzkopf posed as a security consultant and met Miller at a Chili's restaurant to covertly obtain his DNA from a water glass. The DNA was a match to evidence found at the crime scenes, leading to the arrest of Miller, who was also a local personality known for dressing as a "Zombie Hunter." Miller was later convicted and sentenced to death.</p>

          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney has broken her social media silence weeks after her "Good Jeans" ad campaign for American Eagle sparked a divided public response. The campaign, which played on the words "genes" and "jeans," was criticized by some for having alleged racial undertones, while others praised it for challenging "woke" advertising. American Eagle released a statement clarifying the campaign was solely about the jeans. Despite the controversy, some public relations experts suggest the heightened attention could ultimately benefit both the brand and Sweeney's career financially and professionally.</p>

Known for its classic red-sauce dishes, checkered tablecloths, and discreet service, the restaurant has remained an enduring L.A. institution long after Tana sold it in 2009.</p>

          <p>A long-standing traffic engineering guideline known as the "85th percentile rule" is facing increased scrutiny amid rising road fatalities. The rule suggests that speed limits should be set based on the speed that 85% of drivers naturally travel at, a concept critics argue creates a dangerous feedback loop where speeding leads to higher limits. In response to safety concerns, the Federal Highway Administration has clarified that this is not a strict rule, and states and cities are now implementing lower, context-based speed limits to prioritize pedestrian and cyclist safety.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Develop New Technique for Clearer 3D Brain Imaging</h2>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new method for making biological tissues, including the brain, transparent to allow for clearer and more vivid 3D imaging. The technique creates an "ionic glassy tissue" that preserves the organ's original structure and enhances the brightness of fluorescent dyes used to highlight specific cells and molecules. This advancement provides a highly accurate view of the brain's inner workings. The process also allows the tissues to be stored long-term at low temperatures without degrading their structural integrity.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a decisive 6-0 victory over the San Diego Padres, capitalizing on a series of defensive and strategic mistakes by their division rivals. The Padres' aggressive baserunning backfired early, with Dodgers catcher Will Smith throwing out three would-be base stealers in the first two innings. A sloppy defensive error by the Padres in the second inning allowed two more runs to score, solidifying the Dodgers' lead. The win not only puts the Dodgers back in sole possession of first place but also clinches the head-to-head season series.</p>

          <p>This article explores the unique legal defense used in the trial of Bryan Patrick Miller, the "Phoenix canal killer." His attorneys admitted he committed the murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas but argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming severe childhood abuse by his mother created a dissociative personality. The defense contended that this trauma led to "bad Bryan," a violent alter ego responsible for the killings, of which Miller claimed to have no memory. Despite acknowledging the abuse, the judge ultimately found him guilty and sentenced him to death.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers are developing a concept for a hypersonic drone carrier that utilizes an innovative "scissor wing" design, an idea once explored by NASA. The design features a single, centrally mounted wing that rotates as the aircraft's speed increases, optimizing performance across subsonic, transonic, and hypersonic flight regimes. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, but at Mach 5, it aligns parallel to the body, turning the entire aircraft into an efficient "waverider." This adaptable design aims to overcome aerodynamic compromises of high-speed flight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article, written by an executive counselor and couples' therapist, explores the psychological drivers behind infidelity among otherwise "good" people. The author identifies five common pitfalls: a lifetime of repressing one's own identity to be "good," perfectionism stemming from childhood trauma, poor personal boundaries, being in an abusive marriage, and reacting to a significant loss. The piece suggests that affairs often stem from a deep-seated need to reclaim a sense of self or escape from long-term psychological pressures, rather than simple malice.</p>

          <p>A small private plane made a successful emergency landing on Interstate 805 in San Diego on Saturday afternoon after experiencing apparent mechanical issues. The aircraft was traveling from Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport to Miramar Marine Corps Air Station when the incident occurred. The landing forced the closure of several highway lanes for hours while authorities investigated and removed the plane. Remarkably, no injuries were reported to the plane's occupants or to any drivers on the busy highway, averting a potential catastrophe.</p>
