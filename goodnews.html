          <p>American Eagle Outfitters saw its stock soar after reporting second-quarter earnings that significantly beat Wall Street expectations and reissuing positive full-year guidance. The company credited its success to recent marketing campaigns featuring actress Sydney Sweeney and NFL star Travis Kelce, which it said drove an increase in customer engagement and sales. The positive results mark a turnaround for the retailer, which had previously struggled with merchandising missteps and economic uncertainty. The company's performance highlights the powerful impact of celebrity partnerships in the competitive retail apparel market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Macy's shares surged after the department store reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations and raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance. The company attributed the strong performance to improved sales trends, particularly at its 125 revamped "focus" stores, and continued strength at its Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury brands. CEO Tony Spring noted that the consumer remains resilient and that the company is successfully navigating economic headwinds like tariffs. The positive report suggests Macy's turnaround strategy is gaining traction in a challenging retail environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of gold surged to a new all-time high of approximately $3,549 per ounce, representing a significant increase from its value a year ago. The article explains that this rise enhances the value of physical gold investments, such as the one-ounce bars sold by Costco. Investors often turn to gold as a "fear hedge" during periods of economic uncertainty, falling interest rates, and geopolitical tension. However, the article notes that realizing these gains involves costs, as sellers must account for dealer fees and capital gains taxes on their profits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have unearthed more complete remains of Spicomellus, a unique species of ankylosaur that lived over 165 million years ago in what is now Morocco. The new discovery reveals that the car-sized herbivore was covered in elaborate body armor, including three-foot-long neck spikes and a club-like tail weapon. A particularly unusual feature is that its ribs were fused with outward-projecting spikes, a trait never before seen in any vertebrate. The finding provides a clearer picture of this bizarre dinosaur and challenges previous understandings of ankylosaur evolution.</p>

          <p>In a landmark decision, a Long Island judge has ruled that advanced DNA evidence can be presented at the trial of Rex Heuermann, the accused Gilgo Beach serial killer. This is the first time such cutting-edge whole genome sequencing from degraded, rootless hair samples will be admissible in a New York state court, setting a major legal precedent. Prosecutors argue the technology reliably linked Heuermann and his family to hairs found on victims' remains. The defense has challenged the ruling, but it represents a significant victory for the prosecution in this high-profile case.</p>

          <p>MediaforEurope (MFE), controlled by the family of the late Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, is taking over a majority stake in the German media company ProSiebenSat1. The move initially raised concerns in Germany about potential political influence and threats to media diversity. However, after a meeting with German officials, MFE CEO Pier Silvio Berlusconi provided assurances of editorial independence and pledged to strengthen Munich as a media hub. The takeover is part of MFE's broader strategy to build a pan-European media conglomerate to compete with global streaming giants.</p>

Mullaney died in June 1944 when his ship, the USS Glennon, struck a mine off the coast of France shortly after D-Day and was subsequently shelled by German artillery. His remains were recovered from the wreckage in 1957 but could not be identified at the time. Using modern DNA analysis, scientists finally confirmed his identity, allowing for his burial in his hometown.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan migrants accused of gang ties. The court ruled that the current situation at the border does not constitute an "invasion or predatory incursion," which is the legal standard required to invoke the wartime law. The decision is a significant setback for the administration's strategy of using the obscure statute to bypass standard immigration proceedings. The ACLU hailed the ruling as an important check on executive power.</p>

          <p>A major illegal sports streaming platform known as Streameast has been shut down following a coordinated global raid involving law enforcement from the U.S. and Europe. The network, which had accumulated 1.6 billion views in the last year, was a major source of pirated content for events like UFC pay-per-views. The raid, conducted in Egypt, resulted in two arrests and the seizure of assets, uncovering evidence of a broader money-laundering operation. The shutdown is being hailed as a significant victory for sports leagues and broadcasters in the ongoing fight against digital piracy.</p>
