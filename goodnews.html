        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The annual Perseids meteor shower, one of the most anticipated celestial events, is expected to peak on August 12-13. However, astronomers warn that a bright waning gibbous moon, which will be 84% full, will likely diminish the viewing experience this year. The moonlight is projected to reduce visibility by at least 75%, with viewers likely seeing only 10-20 meteors per hour instead of the usual 50 or more in darker conditions. For optimal viewing, NASA suggests looking towards the sky in the early morning hours from a dark, rural location, away from city lights.</p>

          <p>In the Carpathian mountains of western Ukraine, a unique summer camp provides a refuge for children whose parents are missing due to the war. Run by the charity Gen.Ukrainian, the camp offers group therapy, art sessions, and recreational activities to help children cope with the ambiguous loss and trauma. Many of these children live in a state of frozen grief, uncertain if their parents are captured, trapped, or deceased, with some scouring Russian social media for any information. The camp aims to provide a supportive environment where these children can connect with peers who share their experience and begin to heal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk's company, Tesla, has formally applied for a license to supply electricity directly to homes in Great Britain, signaling a potential disruption to the UK's established energy market. If approved by the regulator Ofgem, Tesla could begin operating as a power supplier as early as next year, leveraging its existing solar and battery storage business. The company already runs a similar service in Texas, allowing customers to charge their electric vehicles cheaply and sell surplus power back to the grid. This move comes as Tesla faces increased competition and falling sales in the European electric vehicle market.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office is expanding its policy to deport foreign criminals before their appeals can be heard by adding 15 new countries, including India, Canada, and Australia, to the program. This brings the total number of nations in the 'deport now, appeal later' scheme to 23. The government states the policy is designed to prevent offenders from exploiting the immigration system and to fast-track their removal from the country. Under the scheme, deported individuals can participate in their appeal hearings from their home countries via video link, a move the government says will enhance public safety.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning a significant overhaul of road safety laws in England and Wales, which includes mandatory eye tests for drivers over 70 every three years. The proposed strategy also aims to lower the drink-driving limit to match Scotland's stricter standard and introduce penalty points for passengers not wearing seatbelts. This initiative follows a coroner's report that criticized the UK's licensing system as the 'laxest in Europe' after several deaths were caused by drivers with poor eyesight. The government hopes these tougher measures will reduce the high number of road fatalities and serious injuries.</p>

          <p>While mature black holes are known for their silence, newly formed ones 'ring' with gravitational waves in a process that scientists describe as a form of pure music. When a black hole is created, for instance from a star's collapse, the resulting distortion in spacetime quickly settles into a stable, mathematically perfect shape. During this brief settling period, the black hole radiates energy as gravitational waves, which are akin to the fading vibrations of a struck bell. These 'good vibrations' offer a unique way for scientists to study the fundamental properties of these enigmatic cosmic objects.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 22:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has introduced a nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan (US$501) annually for each child under three to combat its declining birth rate. Analysts suggest the policy's impact will be most significant in less affluent regions where the subsidy represents a larger portion of household income. For example, the handout equates to over 13.5% of an average resident's annual income in the poor province of Gansu, compared to just 4.1% in wealthy Shanghai. This disparity could lead to a more noticeable boost in consumption and potentially birth rates in smaller cities and rural areas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son is aggressively pivoting his company's focus toward artificial intelligence, making it his biggest strategic bet. Son predicts that artificial superintelligence (ASI), which he defines as AI that is 10,000 times smarter than humans, will arrive within a decade and aims to position SoftBank at the center of this revolution. This vision drives major investments in AI-related firms, including chip designer Arm and OpenAI, as Son seeks to build a comprehensive AI ecosystem. This high-stakes strategy follows a period of significant losses for SoftBank's Vision Fund, but reflects Son's long-held belief in AI's transformative potential. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new measures to make it easier for NHS employers in England to hire newly qualified nurses and midwives, addressing a surplus of graduates compared to available vacancies. The plan aims to cut red tape, allowing trusts to recruit based on anticipated need rather than waiting for formal vacancies to arise. This move follows a surge in nursing school enrollments during the pandemic, which has led to a competitive job market for new graduates. Nursing unions have welcomed the news but stated the true test will be whether graduates can actually secure jobs.</p>

          <p>Quarterback Trey Lance is making a strong case for the backup position on the Los Angeles Chargers, closing the gap on veteran Taylor Heinicke with another solid preseason performance. In the game against the New Orleans Saints, Lance showcased his mobility, rushing for 48 yards and a touchdown, while completing seven of 14 passes for 55 yards. In contrast, Heinicke struggled in his first preseason action, completing just one of five passes. Lance's ability to extend plays with his legs has earned praise from coach Jim Harbaugh, intensifying the competition for the role behind starter Justin Herbert.</p>
