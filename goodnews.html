          <p>Archaeologists have identified the wreckage of the Koning Willem de Tweede, an 800-ton Dutch merchant ship that sank off the coast of Australia in 1857, resulting in 16 deaths. The discovery, announced by the Australian National Maritime Museum and the SilentWorld Foundation after a four-year search, reveals components of the ship, including its windlass. The ship had previously transported over 400 Chinese miners just before its sinking, connecting the find to stories of trade and migration. Future monitoring visits are planned to further assess the site and uncover more of this important piece of maritime history.</p>

          <p>Nearly 50 years after the strangulation of Jeannette Ralston in San Jose, California, authorities have arrested Willie Eugene Sims, 69, in Jefferson, Ohio. Ralston, a 24-year-old mother, was found strangled in her car in 1977, and the case went cold due to a lack of credible leads. The break came when an upgraded F.B.I. fingerprint search algorithm matched Sims' thumbprint on a cigarette carton found in the victim's car. Sims, who had a prior conviction for assault to commit murder, was linked to the crime through DNA evidence and a sketch resembling his booking photo from 1977.</p>

          <p>Fulham Football Club has opened its new Riverside Stand, an eight-tier hospitality section offering amenities such as Michelin-star menus and rooftop pool access. The design focuses on providing a luxurious experience akin to a five-star hotel or cruise ship, rather than a traditional football stadium. Architect Phillip Johnson emphasized the river view over the pitch view, drawing inspiration from rowing and boat houses.
