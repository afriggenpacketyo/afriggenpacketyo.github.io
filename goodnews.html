          <p>Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz expressed strong support for current CEO Brian Niccol's "back to Starbucks" strategy, praising Niccol's plan to revitalize the company's sales and culture.  Niccol's strategy focuses on improving the in-store experience and emphasizing coffee quality over promotions. Schultz's endorsement is significant, given his long history with Starbucks and his previous criticisms of the company's performance.  This event marks the first public appearance of Niccol and Schultz together since Niccol's appointment.</p>

          <p>Harvey Weinstein was found guilty of sexual assault in a New York retrial, following the overturning of his previous conviction.  The jury reached a unanimous verdict on one of the three counts against him, while finding him not guilty on another and failing to reach a verdict on a third. This conviction adds to Weinstein's existing 16-year sentence from a Los Angeles conviction. The case continues to highlight the ongoing struggle for justice in cases of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>The article from the New York Times reports that U.S. inflation remained muted in May, with the Consumer Price Index rising by 2.4 percent year-over-year.  This figure suggests that President Trump's tariffs have had only a limited initial impact on consumer prices. The article provides insights into the current state of the U.S. economy and the effects of trade policies. Further analysis is needed to determine the long-term effects of these tariffs.</p>

          <p>New estimates suggest a 2.5% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security benefits in 2026, based on recent inflation data. This projection is slightly higher than previous forecasts and reflects the ongoing impact of inflation on the cost of living for seniors.  The official COLA announcement is expected in October.  The potential impact of President Trump's tariff policies on inflation remains a factor in future projections (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) announced a new rule to protect the rankings of players who undergo egg freezing or embryo procedures.  This policy aims to alleviate pressure on female athletes to return to competition too quickly after fertility treatments.  The rule applies to players ranked within the top 750 and who are out of competition for over 10 weeks.  This initiative reflects a growing focus on supporting female athletes' reproductive health and career aspirations.</p>
