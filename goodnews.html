The pharmaceutical company's second-quarter earnings and revenue surpassed Wall Street expectations, with adjusted earnings per share at 78 cents against a predicted 58 cents. This positive forecast comes as the company navigates potential impacts from U.S. drug pricing pressures and tariffs, maintaining its full-year revenue guidance. The updated outlook also includes a one-time charge related to a licensing deal for a cancer treatment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco announced a decline in its second-quarter revenues, attributing the drop to lower prices for crude oil and refined chemical products. Despite the revenue fall, the company's adjusted net income of $24.5 billion exceeded analyst expectations. CEO Amin Nasser expressed optimism for the remainder of the year, anticipating that oil demand will increase by over two million barrels per day in the second half.

          <p>China's struggling property market may be approaching a turning point, according to analysts who note a resumption of credit flow to developers and a decrease in unsold home inventory. Fitch Ratings has improved its forecast for 2025, now predicting a smaller 7% decline in new home sales, revised from a 15% drop. The stabilization is partly attributed to the growing market share of state-owned developers, which has helped consolidate the sector. These indicators suggest the downturn might be less severe than previously feared by some investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Author Peter Guralnick's new book, "The Colonel and the King," uses a newly discovered trove of Colonel Tom Parker's correspondence to present a revised history of Elvis Presley's manager. Guralnick argues that the letters reveal Parker not as a cynical opportunist, but as a scrupulously honest businessman dedicated to his client's talent and independence. The book refutes the myth that Parker forced bad material on Elvis, showing he removed himself from creative decisions and defended Elvis from record and film executives. This new perspective aims to reshape a long-held narrative.</p>
