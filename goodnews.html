          <p>Corey O'Connor, son of a former Pittsburgh mayor, won the Democratic primary against incumbent Ed Gainey, signaling voter dissatisfaction with the city's current progressive leadership. O'Connor, who had support from the party's "old guard" and some Republican donors, will face Tony Moreno in the November election. Gainey, the city's first Black mayor, faced criticism over police leadership turnover and basic service issues. O'Connor campaigned on a pragmatic approach to revitalize the city's tax base and foster better relationships with local institutions.</p>
