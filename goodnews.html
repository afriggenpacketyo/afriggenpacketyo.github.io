          <p>The Bank of England has invited the public to suggest themes for the next series of banknotes, receiving thousands of responses. Ideas range from celebrating the UK's maritime heritage and famous landmarks to featuring classic TV characters and vintage trains. While some citizens advocate for retaining historical figures, others question the necessity of a redesign in an increasingly cashless society. The public consultation reflects a broad desire for the new currency to represent the entire nation's culture, history, and natural beauty.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Space Force is set to receive a substantial budget increase, potentially reaching nearly $40 billion by 2026, as part of President Trump's major tax and spending package. A significant portion of these funds, around $25 billion, is allocated for the "Golden Dome" missile defense system, a project aimed at achieving American "space superiority." This investment provides a beacon of hope for defense and space companies amid budget cuts at NASA. The funding highlights the administration's strategic shift from space exploration to defense, driven by concerns over China's growing military capabilities in space (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>China has appointed Xu Qifang, a former senior official from the Communist Party's Organisation Department, to a top position managing Hong Kong and Macau affairs.

          <p>Despite a recent editorial from Chinese state media calling for tighter regulations on "blind box" toys, analysts predict that Pop Mart International, the creator of the popular Labubu dolls, will remain a top consumer brand. The criticism, aimed at curbing spending by minors, caused a temporary dip in the company's stock, but its primary demographic of young adults with purchasing power is expected to insulate it from major regulatory impact. Furthermore, Pop Mart's significant and growing overseas revenue, particularly in Southeast Asia and North America, provides a substantial cushion against domestic pressures (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Experts from the UK Meteor Network (UKMON) believe that pieces of a small meteor have landed in the west Highlands of Scotland after it was seen streaking across the sky. The event, which produced an orange glow and a loud bang, was reported by dozens of people and captured on security cameras. UKMON calculated that the meteor, which originated from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, likely scattered fragments over a vast area near Ben Nevis.

          <p>India's securities regulator, SEBI, has temporarily banned U.S. quantitative trading firm Jane Street from its markets, accusing it of widespread manipulation. The regulator has also frozen over $566 million in alleged illegal gains, claiming the firm used a deliberate strategy to artificially influence India's benchmark Nifty 50 index for profit. SEBI's order states that Jane Street's actions continued even after a warning, demonstrating it was not a "good faith actor." The move comes as India's booming derivatives markets attract more global firms, and the regulator has expressed concerns about the impact of algorithmic trading on retail investors (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>After a strong victory against a former champion, British tennis player Emma Raducanu is preparing to face world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the third round of Wimbledon. Raducanu acknowledges the significant gap between her current ranking and the sport's top players, stating she needs to develop more "weapons" in her game to compete at the highest level. The match against the powerful Sabalenka, who is the overwhelming favorite, will be a major test of Raducanu's progress this season. Playing at home provides some comfort, but she recognizes the need to be aggressive and smart to stand a chance.</p>
