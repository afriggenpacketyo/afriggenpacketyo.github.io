        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite claims from the Trump Organization that its new T1 smartphone will be "built in the United States," tech industry experts believe the device will likely be manufactured in China. The phone, which will run Google's Android operating system and retail for $499, is expected to be designed and manufactured by a Chinese original device manufacturer (ODM). Analysts cite the lack of local manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. and the impracticality of designing the phone from scratch domestically as reasons for their skepticism. The experts also point out that large-scale manufacturing in the U.S. would take several years to establish and would substantially increase the product's price. The phone's true origin is in contradiction with Trump's desire to have more electronics manufacturing be undertaken in the U.S.</p>

After working as a single mother and caring for the sick for over a decade, Vose enlisted in the U.S. Navy Reserve at the age of 49. Despite facing initial rejections, she persevered, inspired by her family's tradition of military service and the encouragement of her colleagues. Vose's service took her to Africa, where she used her nursing skills, and she now blends her military experience with her hospital work, serving as an inspiration to others. Her story emphasizes the importance of resilience, dedication, and never giving up on one's passions.</p>

          <p>Kraft Heinz announced it will remove artificial dyes from its U.S. products by the end of 2027, and will immediately cease creating new products with these dyes. This decision follows a push from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to replace synthetic dyes with natural alternatives in the nation's food supply. The company has already replaced artificial dyes in Kraft Mac & Cheese in 2016, and some products, such as Heinz Tomato Ketchup, have never contained dyes. The FDA is also working to eliminate synthetic dyes by the end of 2026, depending on voluntary efforts from the food industry.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to maintain its benchmark interest rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5% at its meeting on Wednesday, signaling ongoing caution amid economic uncertainty. According to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool, there is a 99.9% likelihood that the Fed will hold steady, a decision influenced by the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs and a slight increase in the inflation rate. While consumer sentiment has improved, the labor market continues to hold up, with payroll gains exceeding expectations. The Fed's decision will likely keep credit card rates, auto loans, and mortgages high, benefiting savers who can capitalize on higher interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's executive order clearing the way for Nippon Steel to potentially acquire U.S. Steel includes a "golden share" provision, granting the U.S. government special rights over the company. This agreement gives Trump the power to approve major corporate decisions, potentially blocking the relocation of U.S. Steel's headquarters or the transfer of jobs outside the U.S. The golden share, described as "perpetual," allows the president to name one of the corporate board's independent directors and veto the other two choices. The full terms of the acquisition and the national security agreement remain unclear, and the U.S. Steelworkers union has expressed disappointment with the decision.</p>

          <p>Streaming services have surpassed the combined viewership of broadcast and cable TV for the first time, representing 44.8% of total TV viewership in May, according to Nielsen. This milestone is driven by the rise of free ad-supported streaming TV (FAST) channels, the growth of YouTube, and shifts within legacy media companies. YouTube's main division, excluding YouTube TV, climbed 120% since 2021, representing 12.5% of all television viewing in May. Traditional media companies are increasingly embracing streaming, with platforms like Hulu, Paramount+, and Peacock complementing linear TV, and Nielsen predicts that streaming will eventually become the dominant form of TV viewing permanently.</p>

While muscles have long been associated with male strength and power, women are increasingly engaging in strength training, driven by new scientific studies and a desire to reject the male gaze. However, the article questions whether the pursuit of muscularity could lead to new forms of body neuroses and optimization traps. It references three new books that delve into the cultural symbolism of muscles and the changing ideals of the "well" woman, who is not only thin but also relentlessly optimizes her health.</p>

The new song warns against involvement in drug trafficking, stating that the only outcomes are death or prison.
