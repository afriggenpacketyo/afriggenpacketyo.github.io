        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's upcoming Spending Review will include an ¬£86 billion package for the science and technology sector to fund research into drug treatments and longer-lasting batteries. The package includes up to ¬£500 million for regions across the UK, allowing local leaders to decide how the funds are spent. Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that investing in the sector would create jobs and boost security. Research backers have cautioned that the government needs to do more to secure the UK's global reputation for science, including a decade-long plan to train workers and address visa costs for overseas scientists. The investment aims to benefit communities across the country by directing funding to specific areas of expertise.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have excavated an ancient workshop on the Greek island of Paros, revealing unfinished marble sculptures and other artifacts. The excavation took place at the Floga archaeological site, which has been studied since the mid-1980s. The latest dig uncovered new architectural remains, eating vessels, and storage items, documenting the site's continuous use over time. Artifacts discovered include semi-finished marble sculptures of Aphrodite, clay heads of female figures, clay molds, and pottery fragments. The site was reorganized at the end of the third century B.C., serving as both a residential space and a sculpture workshop, as indicated by the discovery of a room with a pebble floor and wall paintings.</p>

          <p>Space agencies and commercial companies are increasingly interested in returning to the moon for scientific research and as a base for missions to Mars. NASA and ESA are collaborating on the Artemis program, aiming to establish a permanent base at the moon's south pole called Artemis Base Camp and launch a new space station into lunar orbit. A joint China-Russia project plans to build the International Lunar Research Station by 2035. The moon's appeal lies in its abundant resources, including iron, silicon, hydrogen, titanium, and rare earth elements, which could be used to support lunar bases and future space missions. The exploration of the moon is expected to benefit technologies on Earth, including medical equipment and health tracking methods.</p>

          <p>The Labour government's upcoming Spending Review is seen as a critical opportunity to demonstrate a confident and deliverable economic vision to the private sector and international investors. After a cautious first year, the government aims to convince investors that its economic plans are real and prioritize long-term challenges like industrial energy prices and social care costs. The chancellor's focus is on long-term capital spending, earmarking 2.7% of GDP for capital spending, the highest sustained level in nearly half a century. The review also includes increases in spending on research and development to boost science-led growth, with a marquee project being the high-speed rail line between Liverpool and Manchester. This spending is designed to boost future growth.</p>

          <p>A primary school teacher, Alice Cole, shares her experience of returning to work part-time after having her first child, highlighting the importance of flexible working arrangements for new parents. She believes offering such flexibility is crucial for addressing recruitment and retention issues in the teaching profession. The government is trying to improve flexible working as part of its pledge to recruit 6,500 new teachers, and Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has encouraged more schools to offer flexible hours. Data suggests that the number of teachers has fallen, and targets for trainee teacher recruitment were missed. However, the number of teachers leaving the profession has slightly improved compared to the previous year.</p>
