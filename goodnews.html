          <p>Construction has commenced on a new ballroom at the White House, involving the demolition of a portion of the East Wing. President Trump announced the project, which he stated is fully funded by private contributions from businesses and tech companies, costing taxpayers nothing. The new addition is planned to be over 90,000 square feet, capable of holding nearly 1,000 guests for major events and state visits. Despite initial claims that it wouldn't interfere with the existing structure, video and reports confirm demolition is underway on the wing that houses the first lady's offices.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has officially unveiled ChatGPT Atlas, a new web browser built around its generative AI chatbot, placing it in direct competition with Google's Chrome. The browser integrates ChatGPT directly, allowing users to summarize pages, ask questions, and eventually perform tasks like booking reservations across the web without switching tabs. The announcement caused shares of Google's parent company, Alphabet, to drop by approximately 3% as investors reacted to the new competitive threat in the browser and AI search market. Atlas is initially available for macOS users, with versions for other platforms planned for future release. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's commerce minister has accepted an invitation for urgent talks in Brussels to address escalating trade tensions with the European Union. The EU is seeking to reverse China's recently tightened export restrictions on rare earth minerals, which are critical for high-tech manufacturing. Another key issue is the Dutch government's recent takeover of the Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia, citing national security concerns over semiconductor supply chains. The upcoming meeting aims to find immediate solutions to these disputes, which threaten to harm the economic relationship between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>South Africa's cricket team has secured the top spot in the group stage and eliminated Pakistan from the Women's World Cup with a decisive 150-run victory in a rain-disrupted match. Played in Colombo, the game was significantly shortened by weather delays, with South Africa setting a formidable total of 312-9 in their 40 overs. Pakistan's chase was repeatedly revised due to rain, ultimately leaving them unable to meet the challenging target. With this loss, Pakistan joins Bangladesh in being knocked out of the tournament, while the already-qualified South African team continues its strong performance.</p>

          <h2>Colorado Clinic Thrives by Focusing on Medicaid Patients</h2>

          <p>A family-medicine clinic in Aurora, Colorado, known as Mango House, has developed a successful and financially sustainable model by primarily serving Medicaid patients, a demographic often considered unprofitable in the U.S. healthcare system. Founded by Dr. P. J. Parmar, the clinic operates on a walk-in basis, eliminating complex scheduling and maximizing efficiency to see around 100 patients per day with short wait times. By streamlining operations, focusing solely on Medicaid billing, and maintaining a low-cost structure, the clinic not only sustains itself but also pays its staff well without relying on grants. This innovative approach challenges conventional wisdom about serving low-income communities.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has ordered Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify in person at an upcoming trial concerning the alleged harmful effects of social media on young users. The ruling also compels Snap CEO Evan Spiegel and Instagram head Adam Mosseri to take the witness stand. The judge denied motions from the companies to prevent their CEOs from testifying, stating that their knowledge of potential harms is "uniquely relevant" to the case. This trial is one of several lawsuits accusing social media giants of designing addictive platforms that contribute to mental health issues in minors.</p>

          <p>Shares of plant-based food company Beyond Meat soared dramatically, jumping over 90% on Tuesday after a 127% surge the previous day. The rally was triggered after the stock was added to the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF, which appears to have initiated a significant short squeeze, as over 63% of the company's float had been sold short. The surge marks a stunning reversal for the former penny stock, which had fallen more than 67% just last week. The company also announced an expanded distribution deal with Walmart, further fueling the buying frenzy. (not investment advice)</p>

GM increased its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to between $12 billion and $13 billion, signaling confidence despite challenges in its EV division and a profit margin decline in its core North American business.

          <p>An American Airlines flight traveling from Omaha to Los Angeles was diverted and returned to its origin airport shortly after takeoff due to a misunderstanding caused by a faulty internal communication system.

It was later determined that the knocking was from the flight attendants who were also trying to contact the pilots. The Federal Aviation Administration and airport officials confirmed there was no security threat, and the incident was resolved safely upon landing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting its benchmark interest rate, financial advisors suggest investors can adjust their portfolios to capitalize on the changing economic environment. Unlike previous aggressive rate-slashing periods, the current cuts are happening amid a relatively strong economy, creating a unique situation. Advisors recommend strategies such as locking in yields on intermediate-term U.S. Treasury bonds and maintaining a well-diversified equity portfolio rather than chasing specific sectors like small caps. The key is to balance capturing higher yields now with managing risk in the face of ongoing economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

These V-levels are intended to simplify and replace the current landscape of nearly 900 different vocational courses available to students after their GCSEs. Alongside this, the government confirmed that both university tuition fees and maintenance loans will rise annually with inflation from 2026. The plan aims to provide more high-quality routes for young people while also addressing the financial sustainability of universities.</p>

The deal also includes the transfer of another British national serving a life sentence for drug offenses. This move is part of a recent trend by Indonesia's new administration to repatriate several high-profile foreign inmates on humanitarian grounds.</p>
