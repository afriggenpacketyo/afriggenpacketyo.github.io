          <p>Restaurant conglomerate Yum Brands, owner of KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, has become an unofficial training ground for the industry's future chief executives. The company's focus on leadership development, a legacy from its time as part of PepsiCo, has produced a notable roster of alumni who now lead rival chains like Starbucks, Brinker International, and Cracker Barrel. Experts attribute this trend to a "people first" culture and the ample opportunities for executives to gain experience across its massive global operations. The internal competition for top roles often encourages talented leaders to seek CEO positions elsewhere, spreading Yum's influence across the sector.</p>

          <p>An analysis of current interest rates reveals how much a $500 Certificate of Deposit (CD) account could earn, highlighting the potential for modest but guaranteed returns in the current economic climate. With top rates for a one-year CD around 4.40%, the account would yield approximately $22, while a five-year term at 4.15% could generate over $112. These fixed rates offer predictability, a significant advantage as potential Federal Reserve rate cuts loom, which would likely lower returns on other savings vehicles. The article suggests that while the earnings are not substantial, CDs provide a secure way to grow savings compared to traditional accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles FC has signed South Korean national team captain Son Heung-min from the English Premier League's Tottenham, a landmark acquisition for Major League Soccer. The transfer fee reportedly sets a new MLS record, exceeding $22 million, and is expected to have a massive impact on and off the field. The move is seen as a major boost for LAFC's offense, the profile of the league, and engagement with Southern California's large Korean American community. For Son, playing in the U.S. is also considered strategic preparation for the 2026 World Cup, which will be held in North America.</p>

          <p>Shares of industrial supplier Eaton fell over 6% despite the company reporting a solid second quarter and raising its full-year financial outlook. While adjusted earnings and revenue both beat analyst estimates, the results were not strong enough to satisfy Wall Street's lofty expectations for the AI data center supplier. Management's guidance for the third quarter was slightly below consensus, and they trimmed the top end of the full-year profit forecast, citing macroeconomic uncertainties. Despite the market's reaction, the company's fundamentals appear strong, with robust order growth in its data center segment and ongoing capacity expansions. (not investment advice)</p>

The company's revenue surpassed $1 billion for the first time, a 48% year-over-year increase, driven by powerful demand for its AI platforms and strong growth in U.S. government and commercial contracts. CEO Alex Karp expressed immense pride in the results, which significantly beat analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported having a "productive" phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump, covering key issues such as sanctions against Russia and a major drone production deal. The discussion occurred as Trump has reportedly given Russian President Vladimir Putin a deadline to make progress toward peace or face harsher sanctions. Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine is ready to finalize the drone agreement, which he called one of the strongest of its kind, to bolster its defense capabilities. The conversation also touched on ongoing Russian attacks, with Zelenskyy noting that economic pressure from sanctions could significantly influence Moscow's actions.</p>

          <h2>Op-Ed Argues AI Will Revolutionize Wealth Management, Creating the 'Advisory Firm of 1'</h2>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that artificial intelligence is set to fundamentally reshape the financial advisory industry, leading to the emergence of the "RIA of 1," a single advisor amplified by AI agents. This transformation will go beyond simple automation, enabling a lone advisor to manage prospecting, client onboarding, portfolio design, and reporting with unprecedented efficiency. The author predicts this will democratize access to high-quality, personalized financial advice, making it affordable for middle-income families and younger generations. This AI-driven productivity leap challenges predictions of a future advisor shortage, suggesting existing advisors will instead serve a much larger client base.</p>

          <p>Recent comments by President Donald Trump have fueled speculation on prediction markets about who will be the next Federal Reserve chair. After Trump spoke highly of National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, wagers on the Kalshi prediction market gave both men an equal 35% chance of being nominated. Trump also revealed that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is no longer in contention for the role. Both Hassett and Warsh are known to favor lower interest rates, aligning with Trump's frequent criticism of current Chair Jerome Powell's policies, whose term expires in May 2026.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has officially ended the requirement for federal employees to submit a weekly list of five accomplishments. The practice was initiated in February by Elon Musk during his time at the Department of Government Efficiency as part of an effort to reduce the federal workforce. The directive, which threatened that non-compliance would be treated as a resignation, was met with resistance, with many agencies instructing staff to ignore it from the start. OPM Director Scott Kupor stated that managers have other, better tools to stay informed about their teams' work, formally closing the controversial initiative.</p>

          <p>A new annual report from the FBI shows that crime in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024, continuing a downward trend from the spike seen after the pandemic. Violent crime, including murder, robbery, and assault, fell by an estimated 4.5%, with the murder rate dropping for the second consecutive year. Property crime also saw a significant 8.1% decrease, which included a sharp 18.6% drop in motor vehicle thefts. While experts note the positive trend, they also caution that aggravated assaults remain high compared to pre-pandemic levels and that the data only reflects crimes reported to law enforcement.</p>

          <p>James Howells, a man who inadvertently threw away a hard drive containing 8,000 Bitcoins over a decade ago, has announced a new strategy to recover his fortune, now valued at over $900 million. After the local city council repeatedly denied his requests to excavate the landfill where the drive is believed to be, Howells plans to tokenize his claim. His proposal involves creating a Bitcoin Layer 2 token representing the 8,000 BTC, effectively turning his lost wallet into a digital asset. This unconventional approach marks the latest chapter in his long-running and unfortunate saga to reclaim his massive crypto wealth.</p>
