          <h2>Tesla Sales in Norway Surge, Defying Broader European Backlash Against Elon Musk</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 03:55:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla is experiencing a significant sales boom in Norway, with a 54% year-on-year increase in June, standing in stark contrast to slumping sales and a backlash against CEO Elon Musk across much of Europe. The popularity of the revamped Model Y, which meets Norwegian consumer demands for space and features at a competitive price, is fueling this remarkable growth. This success persists despite a notable controversy surrounding Musk's political activities, which a recent survey found would deter 43% of Norwegian EV drivers from buying a Tesla. The trend highlights Norway's unique, policy-driven EV market where practical vehicle attributes can outweigh political concerns.</p>

          <p>The UK government will not proceed with immediate changes to the £20,000 tax-free allowance for cash Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs), the BBC understands. Chancellor Rachel Reeves was widely expected to announce a reduction in the allowance as a way to encourage more investment in stocks and shares. However, following a backlash and consultations, the Treasury has decided to pause the plans to allow for more discussion with banks, building societies, and investment firms. A Treasury spokesperson stated the ambition remains to ensure savings deliver better returns and drive more investment into the UK economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Boxing champions Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano are set for a third and likely final fight, headlining a historic all-female card at Madison Square Garden. The bout is being positioned as the decisive chapter in a rivalry that has significantly elevated women's boxing, following two previous close and disputed encounters both won by Taylor. Both fighters have expressed a desire for a definitive conclusion, with Taylor aiming to end the "complaining" from Serrano's team about the previous results. The event, available globally on Netflix, underscores the massive growth and mainstream appeal of women's boxing on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Doubts have been cast over Novak Djokovic's fitness for his upcoming Wimbledon semi-final after the 24-time Grand Slam champion cancelled a scheduled practice session on Thursday. Djokovic suffered an awkward fall late in his quarter-final match, raising concerns about his physical condition as he prepares to face the world number one. His opponent, Jannik Sinner, has also been dealing with an elbow injury but participated in his own practice session, appearing to be in good spirits. With fellow semi-finalist Taylor Fritz also requiring a medical timeout in his last match, the physical toll of the tournament is becoming a key factor in the men's draw.</p>

          <p>In a significant environmental restoration effort, China has demolished approximately 300 dams and shut down numerous small hydropower stations along the Red River, a key tributary of the upper Yangtze. The ambitious project aims to save the fragile habitat of rare and endemic fish species, which has been severely damaged by decades of dam construction that blocked water flow and critical migratory routes. Ecologists regard the Red River as the last major refuge for these unique species in the entire watershed. The demolitions are intended to restore natural water flows, reconnect breeding grounds, and revive the struggling aquatic ecosystem.</p>
