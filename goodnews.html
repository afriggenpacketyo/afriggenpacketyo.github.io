          <p>A new generation of Chinese restaurants is flourishing in Paris, offering authentic regional cuisine that moves beyond traditional French-Chinese fare. Establishments like Tonton Mao are catering to a younger demographic by serving specific dishes such as northeastern kaochuan skewers, prepared by chefs brought directly from China. This culinary boom is driven by new immigrants and reflects a shift in the city's dining scene. The restaurants aim to create immersive experiences, with decor that transports patrons to different eras of Chinese history, expanding the cultural footprint in the French capital.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A consortium of lenders has put forward a new rescue plan to prevent the collapse of Thames Water, the UK's largest water company. The proposal includes writing off approximately one-third of its nearly £20 billion debt and injecting an initial £5.4 billion to stabilize its finances. The investors state the plan would not require taxpayer funding and would focus on improving performance and reducing pollution. This development follows years of financial instability and fears of a potential temporary nationalization of the critically important utility.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence leader OpenAI has completed a secondary share sale totaling $6.6 billion, solidifying its valuation at a record $500 billion. The transaction allowed current and former employees to sell their stock, with major investors including Thrive Capital and SoftBank participating. Although up to $10.3 billion in shares were authorized for sale, only about two-thirds were sold, which is being interpreted internally as a sign of confidence in the company's future. This deal cements OpenAI's position as the world's most valuable private company, surpassing SpaceX.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are training four-legged robotic dogs in lava tube caves in northeast China that closely mimic underground lunar environments. These tests are in preparation for future missions to explore the moon's subsurface, a key area of interest for establishing potential human bases. The robots are designed to act as "scouts" in narrow passages where human explorers cannot fit. This research aims to advance the embodied intelligence technologies necessary for deep-space exploration, enabling the robots to reliably perform surveying tasks in challenging extraterrestrial conditions.</p>

This surge highlights the platform's growing integration into local services, as Alibaba positions it to compete more directly with Meituan, a dominant player in the sector. Amap has been enhancing its features, recently launching an AI-powered ranking system for offline destinations like restaurants and hotels.

          <p>England Roses goal shooter Liv Tchine expresses optimism about the future of professional netball in England, drawing inspiration from the success of women's football and rugby teams. Tchine, a key player for the London Pulse, who won their first Super League title, recently trained at St George's Park, the state-of-the-art facility for England's football teams. She hopes that within a decade, netball can achieve a similar level of resources and public profile as the Lionesses. The Netball Super League is growing, with average attendances up 42% in 2025.</p>

          <p>Major European defense companies, including Saab, BAE Systems, and Rheinmetall, have expressed support for a proposed "drone wall" to bolster defenses along the EU's eastern border with Russia. The initiative aims to counter the increasing threat of drone incursions, which have recently been reported by several NATO and EU member states like Poland, Lithuania, and Denmark. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has endorsed the concept as a crucial element of credible defense. Defense firms state they are ready to contribute their expertise in unmanned aerial systems and counter-drone technology.</p>

          <p>Thomas Wolf, co-founder of AI startup Hugging Face, has expressed skepticism that current generative AI models like ChatGPT will lead to Nobel Prize-level scientific breakthroughs. He argues that these models are designed to predict the most likely next word and often align with user prompts, which is contrary to the contrarian thinking that fuels scientific revolution. Wolf suggests that scientists who make major discoveries often challenge existing paradigms with unlikely but true ideas. He believes current AI will be more effective as a "co-pilot" for researchers, helping them with research and idea generation rather than making novel discoveries independently.</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has described the two-child benefit cap as having a "devastating impact," signaling that the Labour government may soon lift the policy.

Phillipson emphasized the urgency of tackling the issue to combat rising child poverty rates. The government is widely expected to announce changes in the upcoming November Budget, with potential options including a tapered system or raising the limit to three or four children.</p>
