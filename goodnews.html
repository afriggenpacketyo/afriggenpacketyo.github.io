          <p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has described the two-child benefit cap as having a "devastating impact" and indicated that the government may soon lift it. The policy, introduced by the Conservatives, restricts payments for a third or subsequent child born after April 2017 for households on universal or child tax credit. Phillipson, leading a child poverty task force, stressed the urgency of addressing rising child poverty rates linked to the cap. Campaigners and other politicians advocate for its abolition, citing its potential to lift hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty.</p>

          <p>Two regional jets operated by Endeavor Air, a Delta Air Lines subsidiary, experienced a low-speed collision on a LaGuardia Airport taxiway. The incident occurred when a departing aircraft's wing contacted the fuselage of an arriving plane. One flight attendant sustained minor injuries and was transported to a hospital as a precaution, with no other passengers harmed. Passengers were deplaned and bused back to the terminal, receiving accommodations and rebookings. Authorities, including the FAA and NTSB, are investigating the incident, which did not impact overall airport operations.</p>

          <p>China's domestically built crewed airship, the AS700, successfully completed a crucial flight test, soaring at an altitude of 1,200 meters over the world's highest bridge. Data collected during this test verified the airship's suitability for low-altitude operations, laying groundwork for its future deployment. The AS700 is being developed for various applications, including emergency rescue, aerial surveillance, and tailored flight-support missions, with a maximum altitude capability of 3,100 meters. This marks a significant step in China's airship technology development.</p>
