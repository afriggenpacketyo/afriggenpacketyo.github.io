          <p>Jack Draper, the British men's number one in tennis, has demonstrated significant progress on clay courts, reaching the final at the Madrid Open. This achievement marks a turning point for Draper, who has historically struggled on clay due to fitness issues, but after a series of grueling five-set matches at the Australian Open in January he gained greater belief in his body. With the help of physio Shane Annun and fitness trainer Matt Little, Draper has improved his physical condition and is now challenging on a surface he previously found difficult.</p>

          <h2>Learning Multiple Languages Alters Brain Structure and Enhances Cognitive Abilities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 05:10:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores how learning new languages physically changes the brain and improves cognitive skills. Neuroscientists have found that learning a new language is like exercising the brain, strengthening neural pathways and improving information processing. Studies show that multilingualism enhances connectivity between brain regions, leading to more efficient communication and improved memory. While it's unclear if polyglots are inherently smarter, learning new languages expands verbal repertoire and offers new cultural experiences, but there is no conclusive evidence to determine whether the increased verbal repertoire is due to a bigger cognitive reserve.</p>

In mouse trials, the antidote was found to be protective against venom from the black mamba, king cobra, coral snakes and tiger snakes, among others.</p>

          <p>A Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972, Kosmos 482, is expected to reenter Earth's atmosphere this coming weekend after orbiting the planet for decades. The probe, intended to reach Venus, was stranded in low Earth orbit due to an engine malfunction. While some parts of the spacecraft likely landed in New Zealand shortly after launch, the lander probe has survived in orbit and is expected to reenter essentially undamaged. There is a small chance it could damage property or hurt someone upon impact.</p>
