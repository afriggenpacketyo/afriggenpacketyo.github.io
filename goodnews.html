          <p>A former plantation in Harpersville, Alabama, is being transformed into a space for healing, art, and reparative history, with a focus on recentering the stories of Black descendant communities. The Wallace Center for Arts and Reconciliation is collaborating with a narrative studio to explore participatory forms of interpretation, inviting people to connect with the weight of the location on a deeper level. The initiative includes the creation of a site-specific sculpture memorializing "hush harbors," gathering places where enslaved people worshiped, and dialogue between descendants of enslavers and the enslaved. The new exhibit features everyday objects that tell the stories of three families of free people in post-Emancipation Alabama striving to make a place for themselves, fostering remembrance and reclamation.</p>

Chip lovers on Reddit have expressed mixed reactions, ranging from intrigue to hesitation, with some noting that the flavor tastes like a cheese chip.

          <p>Communities across the United States celebrated Juneteenth, a federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the country. The holiday, also known as Freedom Day or Emancipation Day, marks the date in 1865 when Union troops brought news of freedom to enslaved people in Galveston, Texas. Since becoming a U.S. holiday in 2021, Juneteenth celebrations have grown tremendously, ranging from small gatherings to large parades, art shows, and educational workshops. Celebrations took place in cities like Portsmouth, Chicago, New York City, Washington D.C., Galveston, and Los Angeles, among others, and the holiday has been observed with parades, concerts, and educational events.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from forcing Democratic-led states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive transportation grant funding. The judge granted the states' request for an injunction, arguing the administration was unlawfully holding federal funds hostage to coerce adherence to Trump's immigration agenda. The states contended the transportation secretary lacked authority to impose immigration-enforcement conditions on funding appropriated by Congress. The ruling comes amid ongoing legal challenges to Trump's policies targeting sanctuary jurisdictions.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that plastic bag bans and fees have been effective in reducing shoreline pollution. Local and state plastic bag policies enacted from 2016 to 2023 reduced the share of waste consisting of plastic bags collected during shoreline cleanups by up to 47%. The study found that fee-based policies were more effective than full bans, and partial bans were the least effective. California's history of plastic waste reduction efforts serves as a prime example, demonstrating that stricter laws with fewer loopholes can make a measurable difference.</p>

The film is also notable for its use of iPhones 15 Pro Max for filming, which gives the film a gritty, realistic look. The result is a film that is both exhilarating and thought-provoking, but its more impressive attributes are the sheer talent of the cast and crew.</p>
