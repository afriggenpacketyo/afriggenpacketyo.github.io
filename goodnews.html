          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that "the war is over" while traveling to Israel to oversee a hostage release as part of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. Speaking from Air Force One, he expressed confidence that the truce would hold and detailed plans for a "Board of Peace" to supervise the reconstruction of Gaza, which he described as a "demolition site." The deal involves Hamas releasing its remaining living hostages and the remains of others, in exchange for Israel freeing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Trump is also scheduled to lead an international summit in Egypt aimed at finalizing a document to formally end the conflict and address the region's severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has arrived in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, for an international summit where a peace plan for Gaza is expected to be signed. The summit, co-led by U.S. President Donald Trump, follows a ceasefire agreement he brokered between Israel and Hamas. Downing Street stated Starmer would pay tribute to Trump's role, though comments from UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson claiming a "key role" for Britain were dismissed as "delusional" by the U.S. ambassador to Israel. An Israeli official also asserted that recent UK actions, like recognizing Palestinian statehood, had actually emboldened Hamas, complicating diplomatic efforts to secure a lasting peace in the region.</p>

          <p>Eighteen-year-old darts sensation Luke Littler has won his first World Grand Prix title, defeating world number one Luke Humphries 6-1 in a decisive final in Leicester. Despite having a lower average than his opponent, Littler demonstrated ruthless precision, particularly in crucial final-leg deciders, to secure the £120,000 prize. This victory marks his seventh major PDC televised title, placing him joint seventh for the most in history. The win also significantly closes the prize money gap between him and Humphries in the PDC Order of Merit, intensifying their rivalry for the world number one spot ahead of the upcoming World Championships in December.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview, acclaimed mathematician Shing-Tung Yau discussed what China must do to achieve global leadership in science and technology, particularly as it formulates its 15th five-year plan. He emphasized the critical importance of cultivating domestic talent to innovate and break through technological choke points amid its rivalry with the United States. Yau also commented on Hong Kong's potential to become a science and technology hub and its bid to host a major mathematics conference in 2030. He acknowledged China's manufacturing prowess, built on a large pool of skilled labor, but suggested that higher-level scientific achievement requires a different strategic focus on homegrown expertise and foundational research.</p>

          <p>Paramount, with backing from billionaire Larry Ellison, has initiated talks to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery in a move that could significantly reshape the media landscape. Warner Bros. Discovery's board has reportedly rejected an initial offer of approximately $20 per share, but negotiations are said to be ongoing, with Paramount preparing a second bid. A potential merger would consolidate major assets like HBO, CNN, and the Warner Bros. film studio with Paramount's portfolio, which includes CBS News. The move is seen as an effort by Paramount, now controlled by the Ellison family, to gain the scale needed to compete with dominant tech giants like Netflix and Amazon in the streaming era.

          <p>In a significant diplomatic meeting, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have agreed that their nations should act as "partners" rather than "rivals." During Modi's first visit to China in seven years, he emphasized that differences should not become disputes and committed to a fair settlement of their long-standing border issue. Both leaders framed the relationship as a key anchor for a multipolar world, with Modi stressing the need for India to maintain "strategic autonomy" and not view its ties with China through the lens of a third country. The meeting signals a potential reset in relations, underscored by the planned resumption of direct flights after a five-year halt.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scotland's route to the 2026 World Cup has become clearer, with the team guaranteed to finish in the top two of their qualification group. A victory over Belarus, combined with Denmark's win against Greece, means Scotland and Denmark will now compete directly for the group's single automatic qualification spot. Both teams are currently tied on 10 points, but Denmark holds a significant goal-difference advantage. The decisive match will likely be the final group game at Hampden Park in November. If Scotland fails to win the group, they will still have a chance to qualify for their first men's World Cup in 28 years through the March play-offs.</p>

          <p>Scotland manager Steve Clarke expressed deep disappointment with his team's performance in their 2-1 World Cup qualifying win over Belarus. Although the victory secured at least a play-off spot for the 2026 finals, Clarke was reportedly furious with the lackluster display, a sentiment shared by the booing home crowd at Hampden Park. Midfielder John McGinn described the manager's half-time talk as the "wildest" he's seen, reflecting the frustration that the team was not playing to its potential. Despite taking maximum points from the international break, players and staff acknowledged that a significant improvement is needed for their final crucial games against Greece and Denmark to achieve automatic qualification.</p>
