          <p>A jury has awarded $19.7 million in damages to six bystanders who were injured during a 2022 Denver police shooting. The incident occurred when Officer Brandon Ramos and two others opened fire on a suspect in a crowded downtown area. Ramos, who later resigned, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault after a grand jury found he was not in immediate danger and failed to account for the crowd. Attorneys for the plaintiffs stated the verdict sends a clear message about police conduct and accountability for the safety of innocent bystanders.</p>

          <p>Indian opening batter Pratika Rawal has become a key player in the Women's World Cup, a journey that began with her father's dream and unwavering support. Pradeep Rawal, a former university-level cricketer himself, began coaching his daughter at age three, determined to help her succeed in a sport where women have long fought for recognition. Now 25, Pratika has demonstrated immense talent with a one-day international batting average near 50, fulfilling her father's aspirations. Her success, including a standout 154-run performance against Ireland, highlights a story of familial dedication and breaking gender barriers in Indian sports.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that the Galleri blood test could significantly accelerate the diagnosis of more than 50 types of cancer. Results from a North American trial of 25,000 adults showed the test successfully identified a wide range of cancers, with over half detected at an early, more treatable stage. Notably, three-quarters of the cancers found are types that currently lack any routine screening program, such as ovarian and pancreatic cancer. The NHS is currently conducting a larger trial, and if successful, this test could fundamentally change cancer screening protocols and improve patient outcomes.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Morjaria, a 31-year-old from Newport, discovered she had a large, cancerous kidney tumor following a mishap during a weekend trip to Butlin's. After being playfully picked up during a game, she felt a 'pop' and later went to the hospital suspecting a broken rib. A precautionary CT scan revealed a 7cm tumor on her kidney, which she had been unaware of as symptoms like fatigue and back pain were attributed to other causes. Following surgery to remove her kidney, she is now cancer-free but requires lifelong monitoring, crediting the accidental injury with saving her life.</p>

          <p>Finland's President, Alexander Stubb, believes that Donald Trump is the 'only one who can force' Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table to end the war in Ukraine. In an interview with the BBC, Stubb suggested that coercive measures, or 'the stick,' are more effective than incentives in bringing Russia to peace talks, a strategy he feels Trump is now employing. Stubb expressed optimism about the progress of peace negotiations under Trump's second term. He also reaffirmed Finland's position that it will never recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea and hopes to see Ukraine join the EU and NATO after the war.</p>

          <p>Antony Easton discovered a hidden suitcase after his father's death that unraveled his family's secret past as wealthy German Jews whose fortune was stolen by the Nazis. The documents revealed his father was born Peter Eisner, part of a family that owned a vast steel empire before being forced to sell their assets for a fraction of their value under the Third Reich. The investigation led Easton to trace stolen artworks and properties that were illicitly transferred to a non-Jewish associate who betrayed the family's trust. This journey has not only led to the successful restitution of some art but has also reconnected him with a lost heritage.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Cloud has introduced a new computing solution named Aegaeon that it claims can reduce the number of Nvidia GPUs required to serve AI models by up to 82 percent. The system pools GPU resources more efficiently, addressing the issue where many AI models are only used sporadically, leaving valuable hardware underutilized. During a three-month beta test in Alibaba's model marketplace, the system cut the required number of high-end GPUs from 1,192 to just 213. This innovation could lead to significant cost savings and improved resource management for cloud service providers running numerous concurrent AI workloads. (not investment advice)</p>
