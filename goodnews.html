          <p>The Justice Department is intensifying its efforts to dismantle Google's advertising technology empire, arguing that the tech giant holds an illegal monopoly over the system that places ads on websites. During a court hearing, government lawyers outlined a plan to force Google to divest tools used by online publishers to sell ad space and the technology connecting publishers with advertisers. Google's legal team contends that a breakup would contradict legal precedent and compromise privacy and security measures. The judge will convene a hearing in September to determine remedies, with the government pushing for the sale of Google's ad exchange and publisher ad tools. Optimism Score: 60</p>

          <p>U.S. employers added 177,000 jobs in April, surpassing analyst forecasts and signaling a healthy labor market despite economic uncertainty from the Trump administration's trade policies. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%.

While Finland scores high in evaluative happiness (contentment), the reality of daily life, especially during the bleak winter months, is more nuanced.
