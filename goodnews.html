          <p>Actor Steve Buscemi has revealed that his last name is commonly mispronounced, even by himself over the years. During a recent interview, he explained that while the traditional Italian way is 'Boo-shemi,' he grew up saying 'Bue-semi' and has now settled on a hybrid pronunciation. The topic arose from a running joke in his cameo on the series "The Studio," where characters struggled with how to say his name. This follows a similar revelation from Denzel Washington, who also shared that his name has been pronounced incorrectly throughout his career.</p>

          <p>Scotland's momentum in the Women's Rugby World Cup was halted by a defeat against Canada, setting them on a likely collision course with host nation England in the quarter-finals. Despite a strong effort, including tries from Rhona Lloyd and Evie Gallagher, the Scots were overpowered by the world's number two ranked team. Canada secured the top spot in Pool B with their victory in the compelling match held in Exeter. The final quarter-final matchups depend on the outcome of the game between England and Australia.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has officially launched the effort to build his presidential library in his home state of Delaware. A newly approved 13-person governance board, including former top aides and prominent Democratic fundraisers, will lead the project's fundraising and site selection. The team faces the challenge of raising significant funds in a divided political climate, with costs for such projects often running into hundreds of millions of dollars. The library is envisioned as a museum detailing his presidency and a center for civic engagement, leadership, and public service.</p>

          <p>A rare exploration of the bottom of Lake Tahoe, one of the deepest lakes in the United States, was live-streamed to thousands of viewers. A remotely operated vehicle (ROV) descended over 1,500 feet, providing a unique view of the lakebed and dispelling myths about its contents, such as preserved mafia bodies. The event, organized by environmental non-profits, aimed to raise awareness about the lake's unique ecosystem and the challenges it faces from pollution and tourism. Experts used the opportunity to discuss the lake's ancient geological history and the importance of conservation efforts to maintain its world-renowned clarity.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has taken a significant stake in PepsiCo and is pushing for substantial changes to improve the company's performance. Their plan involves refranchising the bottling network for the North American beverage unit and divesting from underperforming brands like Quaker to refocus on core products. Elliott argues these strategic shifts could unlock considerable value, potentially increasing shareholder returns by over 50%. The proposal emphasizes long-term growth through reinvestment rather than short-term measures like share buybacks (not investment advice).</p>

          <h2>Financial Coach Explains Why She Prefers Renting Despite Being Able to Buy a House with Cash</h2>

          <p>Self-made millionaire and financial coach Bernadette Joy explains her decision to rent instead of own a home, even though she could afford to buy one outright. After owning four properties, she and her husband sold them all, finding that renting offered greater financial gain and lifestyle flexibility. Joy argues that homeownership comes with significant hidden costs, such as maintenance and renovations, and being a landlord can be an emotional and time-consuming burden. By investing the proceeds from her home sales into index funds and focusing on her business, she claims her net worth grew faster than when she was a property owner.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reflects on the growing cultural trend of women publicly rejecting societal pressures, exemplified by the viral 'We Do Not Care Club' on social media. It discusses how letting go of the constant worry about others' opinions can lead to a more honest and freeing existence. Psychologically, while humans are wired to seek approval for survival, most fears of judgment are overblown. The piece suggests that not caring is not about apathy, but rather a conscious decision to choose whose approval truly matters, framing indifference as a quiet act of defiance against external expectations.</p>

          <p>A new book revives a largely unseen project by photographer Lisette Model, who documented the American jazz scene in the early 1950s. An émigré who fled the Nazis, Model captured the joy, pain, and wariness of jazz musicians and their audiences, but the project was abandoned due to FBI suspicion of her leftist politics. The collection features around 1,800 negatives, including portraits of legends like Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, and Billie Holiday. The images reflect a shared experience of persecution, highlighting the racism and violence these artists faced in America even as jazz was promoted as a symbol of the nation's freedom abroad.</p>

          <p>Following the sudden departure of executive chairman Daniel Levy, Tottenham Hotspur's leadership will now be helmed by CEO Vinai Venkatesham, a former chief executive at rival club Arsenal. Appointed in April, Venkatesham is known for his role in hiring manager Mikel Arteta and for his empathetic leadership during the pandemic. He is described as an inclusive and understated leader who will likely rely on the expertise of the club's technical staff for football-related decisions. His appointment signals a potential shift in Tottenham's boardroom dynamics, moving away from Levy's famously tough negotiation style toward a more relationship-focused approach.</p>

The U.S. POINTER study showed that a regimen of physical activity, a healthy diet, brain exercises, and social engagement led to cognitive improvements.

The mission, which officials hope to launch this year, will target a small asteroid millions of kilometers away with a 'kinetic impactor' spacecraft. The goal is to slightly alter the asteroid's orbit by 3 to 5 centimeters, demonstrating the feasibility of such a defense strategy. If successful, China would become only the second nation, after the United States, to have demonstrated this planetary defense capability.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have surged to record levels, gaining approximately 35% this year as investors seek a safe-haven asset amid economic uncertainty and potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. Financial experts suggest that the most efficient way for individuals to gain exposure is through gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) rather than owning physical bullion, which incurs higher costs. These ETFs, such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), offer liquidity and are more tax-efficient for a diversified portfolio. Advisors generally recommend limiting gold allocation to a small percentage of total investments due to its commodity-based price volatility (not investment advice).</p>
