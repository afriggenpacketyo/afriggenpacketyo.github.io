          <p>Morgan Stanley is preparing to launch direct crypto trading for its retail clients through the E-Trade division by the first half of 2026. This move signifies a major embrace of digital assets by a Wall Street giant, partnering with startup Zerohash for liquidity and custody. The firm views this offering, initially including Bitcoin, Ether, and Solana, as just the beginning of integrating traditional and digital assets within wealth management. This strategic shift follows a more favorable regulatory environment under President Donald Trump, positioning Morgan Stanley as a leader in crypto adoption among big banks.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's "big beautiful bill" temporarily increased the federal deduction limit for state and local taxes (SALT) from $10,000 to $40,000 for 2025. This change, which benefits taxpayers who itemize deductions and begins to phase out for higher earners, is projected to offer substantial savings. A Redfin report indicates New York, California, and New Jersey residents could see the largest median tax benefits, while states like South Dakota and Alaska would experience the smallest.

          <p>Amazon announced plans to close all 19 of its Fresh grocery stores in the United Kingdom, recalibrating its grocery strategy. Five of these locations are expected to be converted into Whole Foods stores, as the company focuses on online delivery growth. This decision reflects Amazon's ongoing adjustments to its physical grocery ambitions, which have also seen slowed expansion of Fresh and Go stores in the US. Despite the closures, CEO Andy Jassy remains optimistic about grocery as a significant business, with plans for same-day perishable delivery in the UK next year.</p>

          <p>African leaders at the UN General Assembly are advocating for a stronger voice in global governance, enhanced peace and security, and increased resources for sustainable development.

While offering tax benefits for home improvements, homeowners must carefully choose the right product due to the home serving as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite current mortgage rates being higher than in previous years, experts offer four key strategies for homebuyers and refinancers to find lower rates this October. These include comparing multiple lenders, as rates vary significantly, and focusing on improving one's credit score, which can substantially reduce rates on conventional loans. Borrowers should also consider adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) or shorter-term loans, which often start with lower rates, and evaluate buying mortgage points if they plan to stay in the home long enough to recoup the upfront cost. Thorough research and comparison are crucial for navigating the market effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee cautioned against overly aggressive interest rate cuts, despite the Federal Open Market Committee's recent decision to lower the benchmark rate to 4%-4.25%. While he supported the initial cut, Goolsbee emphasized that further moves depend on economic progress, especially with inflation remaining above the 2% target for an extended period. He noted that tariffs have raised costs but not significantly accelerated price increases. Goolsbee highlighted the importance of finding a "neutral" rate that neither boosts nor restricts growth, with the committee projecting further gradual reductions in the coming years.
