          <p>A CBS News analysis reveals that lawyers are increasingly seeking out federal jurisdictions with judges sympathetic to their views, a practice known as venue shopping. Conservatives often file cases in Texas, ensuring rulings from Republican appointees, while liberals have favored the 9th Circuit. The Supreme Court is now considering whether a single federal judge should be able to dictate policy for the entire country through nationwide injunctions. Critics argue this erodes confidence in the courts, making judges appear as extensions of the political process. The Judicial Conference has recommended a random case-assignment policy to limit judge selection, but some districts have yet to fully adopt it.</p>

          <p>Northern California's commercial crab season is under threat due to migrating humpback whales becoming entangled in crab fishing ropes. Traditional fishing methods have led to at least 922 humpback whales being maimed or killed since 2007. Fisherman Brand Little uses a high-tech system with remote-controlled pop-up balloons to minimize rope usage, allowing him to continue fishing. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has shortened the crab season to protect whales, but Little's experimental device allows him to fish without harming the whales.</p>

          <p>Scientists have found evidence of a massive solar event that occurred around 12350 BCE, making it the largest geomagnetic storm on record. The event, which left traces in ancient trees and ice cores, was over 500 times more intense than the largest event of the modern satellite era. Researchers used a climate-chemistry model to confirm the storm's strength and timing, highlighting its significance for understanding the risks posed by future solar storms to modern infrastructure. This discovery establishes a new worst-case scenario for solar particle events.</p>

          <p>A military parade to mark the Army's 250th anniversary next month, coinciding with President Trump's birthday, is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million. The parade in Washington, D.C., will include over 100 vehicles, thousands of soldiers, and potentially 50 helicopters. The event, part of the Army's anniversary celebrations, has drawn criticism from Democrats who view it as a wasteful display of ego. Trump has defended the cost, stating it is peanuts compared to the value of celebrating the military.</p>

          <p>China is reorganizing its military education system and establishing academies for new service branches, as the People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA) pushes hard for modernization.
