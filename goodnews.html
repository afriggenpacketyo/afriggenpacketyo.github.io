          <p>The United States has reached a new trade agreement with Vietnam, imposing a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports and a steeper 40% tariff on goods trans-shipped through the country from places like China. The deal averts a previously threatened 46% levy and, according to President Trump, grants the U.S. "TOTAL ACCESS" to Vietnam's markets with zero tariffs on American products. Vietnam has become a critical manufacturing hub for many international brands, which had moved production there to avoid tariffs on Chinese goods. The agreement provides some clarity for businesses but still introduces new costs for importers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new mural in North Hollywood celebrates Dodgers player Kik√© Hern√°ndez for his public support of the immigrant community in Los Angeles. The artwork was inspired by a recent social media post where Hern√°ndez, a native of Puerto Rico, condemned recent immigration sweeps and voiced his support for the city that adopted him. The artist, Louie Palsino, stated the mural is a tribute to Hern√°ndez "for standing up for what is right." The piece is located next to other Dodgers-themed murals, including one of legendary broadcaster Vin Scully.</p>

          <p>Edan Alexander, the 21-year-old American-Israeli citizen recently freed after being held hostage by Hamas for 19 months, will meet with President Trump and the first lady at the White House.

The White House noted that the president and first lady have met with many released hostages and look forward to meeting Alexander and his family.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's policy that effectively suspended the right of migrants to seek asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority by declaring an "invasion" and unilaterally barring asylum applications, stating the president cannot create an "alternative immigration system." The judge's order, which has been stayed for 14 days to allow for an appeal, affirms that the executive branch cannot override immigration laws passed by Congress. The ruling is a significant legal victory for immigrants' rights groups who challenged the policy.</p>
