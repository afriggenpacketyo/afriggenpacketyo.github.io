          <p>AI company Anthropic is offering its advanced Claude for Enterprise and Claude for Government models to all U.S. government branches for just $1 per agency for one year. This move mirrors a similar offer from competitor OpenAI and highlights the intense competition among AI firms to secure influential government contracts and deepen ties with policymakers. Anthropic has already developed specialized models for national security customers and is part of a broader trend of major AI companies establishing a strong presence in Washington, D.C. The initiative aims to ensure government institutions have access to secure and capable AI tools.</p>

          <p>The European team for the 2025 Ryder Cup is solidifying with a strong sense of continuity from its victorious 2023 squad, a stability the U.S. team currently lacks. Key players like Tommy Fleetwood, Rory McIlroy, and Justin Rose have already secured their spots, with others like Tyrrell Hatton and Shane Lowry expected to follow. Captain Luke Donald will likely use his picks to include established stars such as Jon Rahm, whose LIV Golf participation affects his automatic qualification. This consistent lineup is seen as a major advantage, contrasting with the uncertainty and potential for a playing captain on the American side.</p>

          <p>As college costs approach $100,000 at some U.S. institutions, The Princeton Review has released its list of the top 10 colleges for financial aid. The ranking highlights schools that are most generous with their aid packages, significantly reducing the out-of-pocket cost for students. For instance, Washington and Lee University, which tops the list, has a sticker price of over $86,000 but an average need-based scholarship of over $67,000. The report underscores that few families pay the full tuition, relying on a combination of savings, scholarships, grants, and loans to cover educational expenses.</p>

          <p>A recent U.S.-brokered peace declaration between Armenia and Azerbaijan has elicited a mixed and somewhat contradictory response from neighboring Iran. The agreement includes plans for a transit corridor through Armenian territory, named the "Trump Route," which would connect Azerbaijan to its exclave of Nakhchivan and provide a more direct trade link to Turkey and Europe. While Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian offered a measured welcome, a top advisor to the Supreme Leader vowed to block the corridor, viewing the U.S. presence in the region as a threat to Iranian interests and influence.</p>

          <h2>Data Suggests the Present is Better Than the Widely Romanticized 1990s</h2>

          <p>Despite widespread nostalgia for the 1990s, a data-driven comparison reveals significant improvements in the present day. The article argues that "nostalgia bias" obscures the negative aspects of the past, such as the historically high violent crime and murder rates of the early '90s, which were more than double today's levels. Globally, extreme poverty has plummeted from nearly 40% to just 8.5% since the 1990s, and the unchecked HIV/AIDS pandemic of that era has been brought under control with effective treatments. The piece also highlights dramatic progress in social tolerance, education levels, and income over the last three decades.</p>

          <p>In a rare comment on her personal relationships, actress Jennifer Aniston has confirmed that she and her close friend, Gwyneth Paltrow, do discuss their mutual ex, Brad Pitt. Aniston told Vanity Fair that as "girls," it's natural for them to talk about him, though she noted they more often trade wellness and health advice. Paltrow was engaged to Pitt in the late 1990s, while Aniston was married to him from 2000 to 2005. In the same interview, Aniston also reflected on the death of her "Friends" co-star Matthew Perry, stating she is glad he is now "out of that pain."</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle reported a 53% jump in second-quarter revenue to $658.1 million in its first earnings release as a public company, causing its shares to rise. The growth was fueled by a 90% year-over-year increase in the circulation of its USDC stablecoin, which now stands at $61.3 billion. Despite posting a net loss due to non-cash charges related to its IPO, the strong revenue performance reflects growing institutional interest in stablecoins, bolstered by more supportive crypto legislation in the U.S. Circle also announced a new blockchain, Arc, for stablecoin payments.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba's instant commerce platform, Taobao Shangou, has reportedly overtaken its primary competitor Meituan in daily orders, fueled by aggressive subsidies. The shift highlights the intense competition in China's on-demand delivery market, with analysts at Morgan Stanley predicting the industry is moving toward a "near-duopoly." While Meituan is expected to maintain its dominance in food delivery, its overall share of the broader instant commerce market could fall to 48% by 2030, nearly equal to Alibaba's projected 47% share. The battle for market supremacy relies heavily on lavishing discounts and incentives on all parties.</p>

          <p>Tesla is actively hiring vehicle operators in New York City to test cars with "automated driving systems," even though the company has not applied for the required permits to test autonomous vehicles on city streets. A job posting seeks drivers in Queens for data collection, suggesting plans to test its robotaxi and Full Self-Driving (FSD) systems. This move comes as Tesla pushes its AI and robotics narrative to investors amid declining EV sales. Meanwhile, Alphabet's Waymo has applied for a New York testing permit, but its application remains under review by the city's Department of Transportation.</p>

          <p>E.l.f. Beauty is navigating the impact of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods while celebrating its recent $1 billion acquisition of Hailey Bieber's popular skincare brand, Rhode. Despite a tariff-related decline in net income, E.l.f.'s CEO remains focused on the company's 26 consecutive quarters of sales growth and its successful marketing to younger consumers. The Rhode deal, financed with debt, is seen as a strategic move to enter Sephora stores and further challenge legacy beauty giants. Rhode achieved $212 million in net sales in just three years, making analysts cautiously optimistic. (not investment advice)</p>
