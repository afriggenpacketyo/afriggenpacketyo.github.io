          <p>AMC Entertainment's stock surged after the company reported better-than-expected second-quarter financial results, signaling a potential recovery for the movie theater chain. The company significantly narrowed its net loss to $4.7 million from $32.8 million a year prior, with revenues climbing 35% to nearly $1.4 billion. CEO Adam Aron attributed the performance to a recovering industry box office and a 26% increase in attendance. The company has also successfully restructured its debt, pushing maturities from 2026 to 2029, providing a more stable financial foundation. (not investment advice)</p>

The company, now owned by Yahoo, stated the decision was part of a routine evaluation of its products to meet the demands of the modern digital landscape. While only a small number of households still used the service, its distinctive screeching connection tone and "You've Got Mail" greeting are remembered by millions.

The announcement dispels rumors of a complete separation and comes ahead of the second series of Meghan's cookery show. The couple stated they are inspired to create "thoughtful content" that resonates globally, with Netflix's content chief praising their influence and storytelling.</p>

It explains that IRAs offer investment control and growth potential, making them suitable for younger savers, while annuities provide guaranteed income streams, appealing to those nearing retirement who prioritize security over growth. The piece outlines the distinct tax advantages and flexibility of each option. It also suggests a hybrid strategy, where one might use an IRA for wealth accumulation and later convert a portion to an annuity to create a stable income floor in retirement.

          <p>The White House's deal requiring Nvidia and AMD to share 15% of their China chip sales revenue with the U.S. government is seen by analysts as an unusual but characteristically transactional move by the Trump administration. While creating a strange precedent, investors view it as a net positive for the companies, as it secures access to the lucrative Chinese market. The arrangement, described as an "indirect tariff at source," is unlikely to extend to other sectors beyond the strategically critical semiconductor industry. The deal raises long-term questions about potential future government demands and China's reaction to the policy. (not investment advice)</p>

He characterized the government's motion as potentially aimed at creating an "illusion" of transparency rather than providing genuine public insight.

The shower is caused by debris from the comet Swift-Tuttle burning up in Earth's atmosphere. However, this year's peak coincides with a bright Sturgeon Moon, which will likely reduce the visibility of fainter meteors. For the best viewing experience, experts recommend finding a location away from city lights, allowing your eyes to adjust to the darkness, and being patient, with the best activity expected after midnight and before sunrise.</p>
