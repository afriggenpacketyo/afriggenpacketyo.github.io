          <p>The National Palace Museum in Taipei, which houses artifacts evacuated from mainland China, is facing a decline in visitors due to strained relations between Taiwan and Beijing. The museum's director aims for 3.5 million visitors in 2025, but lawmaker Ko Chih-en questions this target given the significant drop in visitors from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, which fell drastically to 50,000 last year due to deteriorating cross-strait relations and tourism policy changes. In 2024, the museum recorded 2.87 million visitors, with the largest overseas group coming from South Korea, followed by Japan, highlighting the impact of political factors on tourism. Cross-strait relations have declined since 2016, leading to travel restrictions between both regions.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to stabilize the Hong Kong dollar, which had risen above its trading band due to increased capital inflow. The HKMA bought US$6.005 billion and sold HK$46.539 billion in its first market intervention in two years. This action precedes the US Federal Reserve's meeting, where potential interest rate cuts are expected, which could further drive capital into Hong Kong. The HKMA stated that the Hong Kong dollar's strength is due to equity investment activities and regional currency appreciation against the US dollar, and it will continue to monitor the market to ensure stability.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is implementing significant administrative reforms aimed at modernizing the state, stimulating economic growth, and consolidating political power under Party Chief To Lam. The reforms include merging ministries, reducing public sector jobs by 15%, and streamlining local governance. This "revolution" seeks to address economic stagnation, bureaucratic dysfunction, and external pressures like potential US tariffs. By reducing the number of provinces and district-level party branches, the central government aims to exert more direct control and refocus the state on economic security, though resistance from vested interests is anticipated.</p>

          <p>The elimination of tariff exemptions for inexpensive goods has cut into advertising revenue for Meta, Alphabet, and other platforms, as companies like Temu and Shein reduce their online ad spending. President Trump eliminated the exemption that allowed goods valued at less than $800 to enter the United States without import taxes. This change has led to increased prices and a pullback in advertising by these companies, affecting their app downloads and overall presence on platforms like Google and social media networks. Meta CFO Susan Li acknowledged a reduction in advertising spending by some Asian retailers, impacting the company's revenue.</p>

          <p>With the passage of a law designed to bolster China‚Äôs private economy, Beijing‚Äôs frequent shows of rhetorical support for businesses face a litmus test as the legislation is set to come into force on May 20. Observers and entrepreneurs are closely following the implementation of the Private Economy Promotion Law to determine whether the measure has teeth. The new law has clear-cut provisions on curbing administrative powers thus, entrepreneurs can make better use of it in litigations, especially in legal cases against a local government. It‚Äôs also hoped that courts will be more willing to accept such cases and adjudicate them more fairly.</p>
