          <p>The European Union's executive arm has proposed a €2 trillion budget for the next seven years, starting in 2028, marking the largest budget in absolute terms and as a percentage of GDP. This plan significantly boosts defense and space investment to €131 billion, a fivefold increase, reflecting Europe's "era of rearmament" amid geopolitical concerns. The budget also allocates 35% to climate and biodiversity projects, streamlines funding access, and seeks new revenue streams, though it still requires unanimous approval from member states and the European Parliament.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold another 225,000 shares, totaling approximately $37 million, as part of a prearranged plan to sell up to 6 million shares. Since beginning sales this year, Huang has offloaded 1.2 million shares worth about $190 million, following over $700 million in sales last year. This comes as Nvidia's market capitalization surpassed $4 trillion due to surging AI demand, propelling Huang's net worth past Warren Buffett. The company also plans to resume H20 chip sales to China after U.S. government approval.</p>

          <p>NWA 16788, the largest known piece of Mars on Earth, was sold for nearly $5.3 million at a Sotheby's auction in New York City. Discovered in Niger's Sahara Desert in 2023, the 54-pound meteorite is one of only 400 Martian meteorites identified on Earth, representing about 6.5% of all known Martian material. Sotheby's noted the astronomical unlikelihood of its journey and its significance as a "massive dataset" for unlocking secrets of the red planet.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ether, and related stocks surged after the House approved a procedural vote to consider key crypto regulation bills, reversing earlier dips. Bitcoin rose 2% to $119,204, and Ether climbed over 8% to $3,321. The "GENIUS Act," a stablecoin bill, is expected to advance, which would reinforce Ethereum's role. Despite the rally, some analysts note that Ether's recent gains are driven by speculation rather than fundamentals, with active addresses and network revenue remaining flat.
