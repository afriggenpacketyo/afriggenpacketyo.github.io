          <p>The New York Knicks delivered a resounding 119-81 victory over the Boston Celtics in Game 6 of their Eastern Conference semi-final series, securing their place in the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 2000. Jalen Brunson and OG Anunoby each scored 23 points, leading the Knicks to a dominant performance in front of a star-studded home crowd. The Knicks will now face the Indiana Pacers in a highly anticipated conference final series, reminiscent of their classic showdowns in the 1990s. This victory marks a significant milestone in the Knicks' resurgence as a top-tier NBA team, reigniting hopes of returning to the NBA summit after decades of mediocrity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rare dust storm warning was issued for the Chicago area as high winds swept across dry farmlands, creating a wall of dust that significantly reduced visibility. The National Weather Service confirmed this was only the second time in its history that it issued a dust storm warning, and the first time including the Chicago metropolitan area. The dust storm caused near-zero visibility on major interstates and prompted ground stops at O'Hare and Midway airports. Some areas experienced "mud rain" due to the combination of dust and scattered showers. Several schools closed due to power outages from previous severe weather.</p>

          <p>Sneaker Impact, a Miami-based recycling company, is giving discarded shoes new traction by collecting used sneakers and either reusing or recycling them. Reusable shoes are shipped to developing countries where they are resold in mom-and-pop shops, creating microbusiness opportunities. Shoes that cannot be reused are crushed and repurposed into flooring, mats, tiles, and even sandals. The company processes over one million shoes per year, diverting them from landfills. The founder of Sneaker Impact hopes other companies will replicate this environmentally friendly business model.</p>

          <p>The Secret Service questioned former F.B.I. Director James Comey about a social media post that Trump administration officials claimed was a call for President Trump‚Äôs assassination.

Comey removed the post after it drew criticism, stating he didn't realize the numbers could be associated with violence. The interview highlights the ongoing tension between Comey and Trump, dating back to Comey's firing in 2017.</p>

          <p>Chinese defence scientists are working on transforming traditional rocket artillery into a system capable of striking aerial targets. The research team has developed a small rocket, Tianxing-1, which features wings and adjustable tail fins for extended range and maneuverability. Launched from ground-based platforms, the rocket transitions into a glide phase to engage targets. While similar to hypersonic glide missiles, the Tianxing-1 operates at a slower speed, potentially limiting its ability to chase high-speed aircraft or drones.</p>
