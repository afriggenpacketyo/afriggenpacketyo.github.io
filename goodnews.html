          <p>China is integrating the development of power-hungry data centers into its national energy strategy to support its growing artificial intelligence sector. Under a new action plan, Beijing will coordinate data center planning with energy infrastructure in regions rich in renewable energy resources. This initiative aims to meet the increasing electricity demands of high-performance computing facilities while easing pressure on electricity grids during peak hours. The move underscores China's ambition to dominate AI, a sector expected to significantly drive economic growth but also increase power consumption from data centers. </p>

          <p>Nintendo's new Switch 2 console launched with high demand, leading to shortages and special store opening hours in some markets. The Japanese gaming giant hopes the new console will sustain its stock rally, which has seen shares rise significantly since the original Switch's release in 2017. Analysts note strong demand for the Switch 2, attributing the original Switch's success to its innovative portable design that merged console and mobile gaming. The Switch 2 aims to match the success of its predecessor, which has sold over 152 million units.</p>

          <p>Dilly Dally, an adolescent loggerhead sea turtle, was released back into the Atlantic Ocean after having a front flipper amputated due to predator wounds. The turtle was rehabilitated at the Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, Florida, and was cheered on by beachgoers as it made its way back to the water. A satellite tracking device was attached to Dilly Dally's shell, allowing researchers and the public to monitor her journey and gather data on the migration and foraging patterns of three-flippered turtles. The release is considered a victory for the species, as all sea turtles are endangered or threatened.</p>

          <p>A private lunar lander from Japan, named Resilience, is approaching the moon, aiming to land in the unexplored far north and deploy a mini rover. This attempt by Tokyo-based ispace is the latest in the expanding commercial lunar exploration efforts. The Resilience lander carries a rover with a shovel for lunar dirt collection and a Swedish artist's miniature house for placement on the moon. This mission follows ispace's previous attempt, which ended in a crash landing, and it joins other private companies in the pursuit of lunar landings, with the goal of establishing lunar infrastructure and a permanent human presence on the moon.</p>

Other proposed legislation aims to protect homeowners from price gouging, streamline claims processes, and offer financial protections to disaster victims.

          <p>After a period of political involvement, Elon Musk is refocusing on Tesla, which faces several challenges, including rebuilding its reputation, delivering on autonomous driving technology, and keeping up with competition. Musk's association with the Trump administration damaged Tesla's brand among its largely liberal customer base. Tesla must also deliver on its promises for self-driving technology and navigate increasing competition from traditional carmakers and new EV manufacturers. The company's future success depends on addressing these challenges and adapting its business model.</p>

          <h2>Trade with China Did Not Wreck the U.S. Economy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive review challenges the narrative that trade with China significantly damaged American manufacturing. The "China shock" theory, which suggests that Chinese imports caused substantial job losses, has been exaggerated, and populist narratives blaming this trade for U.S. economic decline are not supported by rigorous evidence. While some areas were negatively affected, the overall impact on manufacturing employment was modest, and job losses were often offset by gains in other sectors. The decline in U.S. manufacturing employment began decades before China's WTO entry, primarily due to technological advances and shifting consumer demand, and protectionist policies based on a misdiagnosed problem may do more harm than good.
