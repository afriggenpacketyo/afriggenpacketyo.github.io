          <p>President Trump publicly considered raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans, while acknowledging the political challenges of such a move. He reached out to House Speaker Mike Johnson about potentially adding a tax hike on high earners to the GOP's tax and spending bill. Trump expressed willingness to accept a 'tiny' tax increase on the rich to benefit lower and middle-income workers, but voiced concern that Democrats would criticize Republicans for breaking promises, referencing George H.W. Bush's 'Read my lips' pledge.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested lowering tariffs on China to 80% ahead of trade talks in Switzerland, although it remains unclear whether this is a long-term goal or a negotiating tactic. The proposed rate is a significant reduction from the current 145% tariff on many Chinese goods, but it is still higher than the 10% baseline in the U.S.-U.K. trade agreement. Trump also stated that 'Many Trade Deals in the hopper, all good (GREAT!) ones!' China remains a key challenge in Trump's efforts to reshape the global trading environment.</p>

Patients can order the test online, consult with a telehealth doctor, collect a sample, and mail it for testing. If the test is positive, a follow-up Pap smear or colposcopy is recommended, while a negative result means no further screening is needed for three to five years.</p>
