          <p>Jake Wightman has won a silver medal in the 1500m final at the World Championships, delivering a strong performance in a highly competitive race. His achievement came as fellow British athlete Josh Kerr, the defending champion, was unfortunately forced to withdraw from the competition due to an injury. The outcome marks a significant moment in Wightman's career, placing him on the podium at a major global athletics event. The race highlights the unpredictable nature of elite sports, with both triumph and disappointment shaping the final results.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has taken down a significant Nigerian-based phishing operation by seizing 338 associated websites. The service, known as "Raccoon0365," operated through a private Telegram channel and enabled users to conduct large-scale phishing campaigns by impersonating trusted brands to steal credentials. This operation successfully compromised at least 5,000 Microsoft user accounts and generated over $100,000 for its operators. The takedown was a collaborative effort involving Microsoft, Cloudflare, and the U.S. Secret Service to disrupt the cybercrime infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Online ticket marketplace StubHub has priced its initial public offering at $23.50 per share, resulting in a company valuation of $8.6 billion. The IPO, which raised $800 million, comes after several delays, including one due to market volatility. The company, originally founded in 2000 and later reacquired by its co-founder, is re-entering a more receptive public market. Despite a 10% increase in first-quarter revenue, StubHub's net loss widened compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a late-stage clinical trial, Eli Lilly's experimental oral drug, orforglipron, demonstrated superior performance in lowering blood sugar and promoting weight loss compared to Novo Nordisk's approved pill, Rybelsus, for Type 2 diabetes. The results position Eli Lilly to compete in the lucrative market for convenient, needle-free GLP-1 medications. While the data is promising, experts note the comparison was against a lower dose of the Novo Nordisk drug, and further studies are needed to determine a clear leader in the oral obesity and diabetes treatment space.</p>

          <p>The price of gold is currently trading at $3,678.26 per ounce, reflecting its status as a safe-haven asset during periods of economic instability. The article explains that gold's value is influenced by various factors, including supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical turmoil. Investors often turn to gold to hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, as the precious metal has historically retained its value. Interest rate changes and central bank policies also play a significant role in its price fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With interest rates for personal loans and credit cards remaining high, homeowners are increasingly looking to their home equity for more affordable borrowing options. The average home equity loan rates are currently around 8.2-8.4%, while the average HELOC rate is 8.10%, significantly lower than many alternatives. The article explains the difference between the two products: fixed-rate lump-sum loans versus variable-rate lines of credit. These options are particularly attractive as rates may decrease if the Federal Reserve implements further cuts. (not investment advice)</p>
