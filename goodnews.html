        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports saw a 4.2% year-on-year increase in September, marking an end to four consecutive months of decline, primarily fueled by robust growth in shipments to Asia, especially mainland China. However, exports to the United States, Japan's second-largest trading partner, continued to tumble, dropping by 13.3%, despite a recent trade deal aimed at reducing tariffs. Semiconductor exports were a significant driver of overall growth. The article highlights that the new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's economic stance, favoring loose monetary policy and massive fiscal stimulus, is anticipated to weaken the yen, thereby making Japanese goods more competitive and benefiting exporters, which are heavyweights on the Nikkei 225.

          <p>Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is preparing for a significant transformation with the impending closure of Terminal 5 on October 28 for a "complete demolition" and extensive overhaul. This project is a key component of a massive $30-billion renovation initiative aimed at modernizing the airport ahead of the 2028 Olympics and Paralympics in Los Angeles. The renovation promises a brand new terminal and an enhanced travel experience, building on previous large-scale projects like Delta Airlines' relocation. Airlines previously operating from Terminal 5, including JetBlue and Spirit, are being relocated to other terminals to ensure continuous operations, with the new Midfield Satellite Concourse South also helping to manage capacity.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance and Jared Kushner have expressed cautious optimism regarding the U.S.-brokered Israel-Hamas ceasefire in Gaza, despite recent outbreaks of violence. Vance acknowledged the "difficulties" in recovering all hostage remains, noting some are buried under thousands of pounds of rubble and others' locations are unknown. The peace process has seen gradual progress, including the return of Palestinian bodies and the release of all 20 living Israeli hostages, along with the confirmed remains of 13 deceased captives. However, some Israeli officials remain skeptical about the long-term viability of President Trump's peace plan, questioning Prime Minister Netanyahu's commitment to a lasting peace and suggesting he may resume military operations if Hamas is not decisively defeated.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 20:50:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has unveiled new proposals designed to expedite and simplify the process of fining English water companies for raw sewage spills. These plans introduce automatic financial penalties of up to £20,000 for minor offenses, such as failing to report incidents or excessive discharges from emergency overflows. Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds stated the goal is to empower the Environment Agency with the necessary tools to address all rule-breaking, projecting annual revenues of £50m-£67m, which shareholders will cover. For more serious offenses, the government aims to lower the burden of proof from "beyond reasonable doubt" to "on the balance of probabilities," allowing for increased fines up to £500,000 without requiring court proceedings.</p>

          <h2>Haircare Experts Debunk Common Myths, Emphasize Scalp Health</h2>

          <p>Haircare experts are debunking several common myths, clarifying that rinsing hair with cold water does not enhance shine, and no product can genuinely repair damaged hair or split ends, which ultimately require a trim. Trichologists Eva Proudman and Tracey Walker emphasize that claims of products making hair grow faster are also untrue. They stress the fundamental importance of regular hair washing, as the scalp contains numerous oil glands that collect dirt and debris, which can exacerbate conditions like dandruff if not routinely cleansed. Dry shampoo is considered acceptable for occasional use between washes, but continuous reliance without proper cleansing can lead to scalp irritation and flakiness.</p>

          <p>Capital One's shares surged after the credit card issuer reported a robust third quarter, significantly exceeding revenue and earnings per share estimates, largely driven by improved credit quality performance. The company's better-than-expected net charge-offs and provisions for credit losses, despite broader market concerns about the subprime sector, resulted in a substantial allowance release. Furthermore, Capital One provided a positive update on its $35 billion acquisition of Discover, indicating that all integration synergies are on track. The company also announced a massive new share repurchase authorization of up to $16 billion and boosted its quarterly dividend, signaling strong financial health and confidence in future growth.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A groundbreaking study has produced the first comprehensive ranking of antidepressant side effects, revealing substantial differences between medications during the initial eight weeks of treatment. Researchers from King's College London and the University of Oxford analyzed 151 studies of 30 common drugs, finding some caused weight changes of up to 2kg or heart rate variations of 21 beats per minute. This vital information is crucial for patient health and adherence to prescriptions, as these differences can accumulate to become clinically significant, increasing risks like heart attack or stroke. The study advocates for a personalized approach to antidepressant selection, with a free online tool currently under development to assist doctors and patients in making informed choices.</p>

          <p>Fiona Eastwood, CEO of Merlin Entertainments, a prominent global theme park operator, has identified people choosing to stay home on their phones and other digital devices as the company's "biggest competition." She positions a day out at attractions like Legoland, Thorpe Park, and Alton Towers as the "perfect antidote" to the increasing prevalence of screen time. Despite facing challenges such as a dip in consumer confidence and a slight revenue decline, Merlin attracted nearly 63 million visitors in 2024, reflecting a public desire for shared, escapist experiences. The company is strategically investing £85 million in immersive experiences, including new Bluey and Minecraft-themed rides, and advocates for a VAT cut to support the hospitality sector.</p>

          <p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has lauded striker Viktor Gyokeres for his significant impact, despite a recent goal-scoring drought, after he netted two goals in Arsenal's commanding 4-0 Champions League victory over Atletico Madrid. Gyokeres' relief was palpable as he ended a seven-game scoreless run, and his manager believes this marks the beginning of a prolific spell. The 27-year-old has had to play more minutes than initially planned this season due to a knee injury to Kai Havertz, featuring for 90 minutes in seven of Arsenal's opening 12 matches. Arteta emphasized that Gyokeres' physical presence, pressing, and ball-holding abilities make Arsenal a "much better team," and his goals are the "icing on the cake."</p>

          <p>Newcastle's forwards delivered an outstanding performance in their 3-0 Champions League victory against Benfica, with Anthony Gordon and Harvey Barnes stepping up significantly to ease the team's goalscoring burden.

Gordon notably became the first Newcastle player to score in three consecutive Champions League matches, while Barnes, introduced as a second-half substitute, also contributed two crucial goals. Manager Eddie Howe expressed immense encouragement from his attacking players' contributions, highlighting the team's evolving potential and the importance of translating this attacking prowess into their domestic league form.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that President Donald Trump's unique position as a "paramount leader" with strong control over his administration could paradoxically serve as a "guard rail" in US-China relations. Despite ongoing trade tensions and critical rhetoric from some US officials, Trump has reportedly exercised restraint in directly antagonizing Chinese President Xi Jinping or challenging Beijing's established red lines, such as Taiwan. This dynamic implies that direct leader-to-leader diplomacy has gained heightened importance in shaping bilateral ties. Experts believe Trump's ability to rein in his team of China hawks might prevent more aggressive policy shifts, thereby introducing a degree of stability into an otherwise fraught and competitive relationship.</p>
