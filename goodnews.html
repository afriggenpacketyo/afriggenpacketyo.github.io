          <h2>Training Program Aims to Reduce 'Elderspeak' in Care Settings</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 07:34:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new training program called CHAT is designed to help caregivers avoid using "elderspeak," a form of communication resembling baby talk that can be demeaning to older adults. Elderspeak includes using overly simplistic language, inappropriate endearments, and plural pronouns that undermine an individual's autonomy. Studies show that elderspeak can lead to resistance to care among older adults, while CHAT training has been shown to reduce elderspeak and resistant behaviors. The program emphasizes addressing older adults respectfully and recognizing cultural differences in communication styles, promoting a more dignified and effective care environment.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has won a second term, marking a victory for his center-left Labor Party despite persistent cost-of-living challenges. The election saw a significant defeat for the conservative opposition led by Peter Dutton, who struggled with campaign missteps and associations with Trump-era policies. While it remains uncertain if Albanese's party will maintain its parliamentary majority, the election highlighted younger voters' disillusionment with both major parties, with many seeking bolder solutions to the country's challenges.</p>

          <p>A journalist in Valencia, Spain, reflects on a day when a massive blackout plunged the Iberian Peninsula into darkness, disrupting communication and daily life. Instead of chaos, the author observed acts of kindness and community spirit, with citizens directing traffic, providing food and water, and schools staying open late. The experience highlighted the trust and mutual support fostered by the European welfare state, contrasting with individualistic ideologies. The author concludes that embracing joy and mutual support strengthens society in the face of adversity.</p>

          <p>A Member of Parliament is advocating for a modern approach to the rules surrounding alcohol consumption in football stadiums. Current legislation prohibits fans from drinking alcohol within view of the pitch in the top five tiers of English men's football, a measure implemented in 1985 to combat hooliganism. The MP proposes trials to assess the impact of lifting these restrictions, citing the anomaly that fans of other sports can enjoy alcoholic beverages during games. The Football Supporters Association supports the MP's call for trials in the men's game.</p>

          <p>Researchers have found that captive-bred axolotls can thrive in their native Mexican wetlands, offering hope for the critically endangered species. A study tracked 18 axolotls released in restored and artificial wetlands in Mexico City, and the recaptured axolotls had gained weight, indicating they were hunting, eating, and avoiding predators. The success in both environments suggests that axolotls can adapt to man-made habitats, mitigating the effects of habitat degradation and climate change. The axolotl is important to Mexican culture and history.</p>
