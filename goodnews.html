          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang addressed the World Economic Forum, emphasizing the need for international collaboration on trade despite increasing tariffs and barriers. He stated that globalization is irreversible and cautioned against politicizing trade or turning it into a security issue. Li called for countries to adhere to the "right" path in reshaping global rules and order, advocating for more process-oriented approaches rather than focusing on who sets the order. He did not directly address U.S. trade tensions or the Israel-Iran conflict in his speech. The premier's comments highlight China's desire to maintain its role in the global economy and promote multilateralism. The remarks were made during the opening plenary of the World Economic Forum's annual conference in China.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump spoke at the NATO Summit in The Hague, adopting a surprisingly cordial tone toward the alliance he has previously criticized. During the summit, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte congratulated Trump for securing increased defense spending commitments from European members. Trump also expressed that he would likely greet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, highlighting ongoing discussions about Ukraine's potential NATO membership. Despite progress on defense spending, Trump cast doubt on the U.S. commitment to Article 5, NATO's mutual defense clause, though U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker reassured allies of continued U.S. support.</p>

          <p>A China-led study suggests that a global interconnected solar-wind energy network could meet the world's energy demands by 2050. The proposed system would produce three times the necessary power at a lower cost than independent regional systems. Researchers emphasized the importance of navigating geopolitical boundaries and crises, such as the Ukraine war, to establish such a network. Successful global interconnection could improve energy efficiency, reduce decarbonization costs, and enhance resilience against conflict and climate extremes. The study highlights the vast potential of solar and wind resources and the need for international cooperation to address energy challenges.</p>

          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Zohran Mamdani declared victory after a strong first-round showing, despite no candidate reaching the 50% threshold required for an outright win. Andrew Cuomo conceded the race before the ranked-choice votes were counted, acknowledging Mamdani's successful campaign that resonated with younger voters. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, gained momentum through social media and progressive policies, including a rent freeze and fare elimination on city buses. Cuomo, who resigned as governor in 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations, campaigned on his experience and past opposition to Donald Trump. The race will proceed to a ranked-choice count, and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams is running as an independent in the fall.</p>

          <p>Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff suggested that the leak of an initial intelligence assessment of Iran's nuclear capabilities after U.S. strikes was "treasonous." The assessment, conducted by the U.S. Central Command and the Defense Intelligence Agency, concluded that the strikes did not completely destroy Iran's nuclear program but set it back by a few months. Witkoff assured that the ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding and dismissed concerns that Iran could resume its nuclear enrichment program within months.

          <p>Two young bears escaped from their enclosure at Wildwood Devon in the U.K., consuming a week's worth of honey before falling asleep. The bears, Mish and Lucy, posed no threat to the public, and visitors were escorted to a secure building as a precaution. Keepers used recall training to return the bears to their enclosure. An investigation is underway to determine how the animals escaped, with the park citing an "operational error."</p>

          <p>The UK's Climate Change Committee reports increased adoption of electric cars and heat pumps, but emphasizes the need for further growth. The committee advises the government to ensure households benefit from the transition to cleaner technologies through lower bills. While greenhouse gas emissions have fallen by over half since 1990, transport and buildings remain significant emitters. The CCC notes progress in electric car sales and heat pump installations, but calls for cheaper electricity to incentivize further adoption.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has blocked the Trump administration from withholding funds awarded to 14 states for electric vehicle charger infrastructure. The ruling favors a lawsuit led by attorneys general in California, Colorado, and Washington. The judge found that the states were likely to succeed in their lawsuit. The Trump administration had ordered states not to spend $5 billion in funds allocated under the Biden administration's national electric vehicle infrastructure program. The White House has challenged the findings, calling them "wrong and legally indefensible."</p>

          <p>Rod Stewart is set to play the "legends" slot at Glastonbury, although he wishes it wasn't called the "tea time slot." He has secured an extended set time of 90 minutes and plans to perform as many songs as possible. Stewart reflected on his previous Glastonbury performance in 2002, which he doesn't remember, and shared anecdotes from his career. He discussed his discovery as a harmonica player and his influences, and he also talked about his family and marriage to Penny Lancaster.</p>
