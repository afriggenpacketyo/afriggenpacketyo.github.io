          <p>As "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" marks its 50th anniversary, its legacy is being kept alive by dedicated fan groups and their interactive "shadowcast" performances. These groups meticulously recreate the film live in theaters, complete with screen-accurate costumes and audience callbacks, offering an immersive experience that predates modern trends. For many, the film and its community serve as a vital safe space, particularly for queer and neurodivergent individuals, celebrating non-conformity and fostering a sense of belonging. The tradition continues to thrive, proving the film's timeless appeal as a cornerstone of cult cinema and queer history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is actively promoting an "ambitious" youth migration agreement with the European Union to enhance the country's economic prospects. She has called on the Office for Budget Responsibility to incorporate the potential positive economic impact of such a scheme into its official forecasts ahead of the autumn Budget. This move is seen as a way to potentially lessen the need for future tax increases or spending cuts to address fiscal gaps. The proposal has drawn criticism from Conservatives and Reform UK, who argue it resembles a partial return to the pre-Brexit freedom of movement.</p>

          <p>Actor Leonardo DiCaprio recently revealed that an early agent advised him to change his name to "Lenny Williams," arguing his given name was "too ethnic" for a successful career in Hollywood. This anecdote echoes a similar experience faced by his co-star Benicio del Toro, who was told to become "Benny Del." The article reflects on this past industry pressure, celebrating the fact that both actors rejected the advice and went on to achieve global stardom with their original names, underscoring a shift in cultural attitudes and the value of authenticity.</p>

          <p>The imminent expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles, a policy change under the Trump administration, has triggered a rush among consumers to buy EVs. Auto dealerships across the country have reported a significant increase in sales as the end-of-month deadline approaches, with the market share for new EVs climbing sharply in recent months. However, analysts are predicting a substantial drop in sales starting in October, cautioning that the current boom is likely to be followed by a market downturn once the financial incentive is removed.</p>

          <p>The UK government's plans for a new generation of towns in England are showing strong signs of influence from the long-held architectural philosophies of King Charles. Officials have outlined a vision for walkable, sustainable communities with "gentle density" like terraced housing, mirroring the principles of the King's projects such as Poundbury. Once criticized by the architectural establishment, the King's focus on traditional styles, local materials, and community-centric public spaces is now seen as a mainstream approach to creating more humane and desirable living environments.</p>

          <p>After more than a century, the remains of two Scottish soldiers killed during the Battle of Loos in World War I have been identified through a meticulous investigation. The Ministry of Defence's "war detectives" used a combination of historical records, battlefield artifacts, and DNA analysis to confirm the identities of Lance Corporal Gordon McPherson and Lieutenant James Grant Allan. A key breakthrough came from small tramway buttons found with McPherson, which linked him to his father's employer and ultimately to his living relatives, providing long-awaited closure for their families.</p>
