          <p>Tesla shares experienced a premarket surge following a significant drop spurred by tensions between Elon Musk and President Trump. Analysts pointed to reports suggesting Trump had scheduled a call with Musk to mediate a truce, though White House officials denied these claims. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives suggested that reconciliation between Musk and Trump would benefit Tesla's stock. The recent verbal exchanges between Musk and Trump coincided with the end of Musk's tenure as head of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency, contributing to market volatility.

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is considering reversing its ban on crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) for retail investors, aiming to boost the UK's competitiveness in the digital asset space. Crypto ETNs, which allow investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies via regulated exchanges, have been prohibited since 2019 due to consumer protection concerns. The FCA's proposal aims to rebalance risk and allow informed choices regarding high-risk investments. This move aligns the UK with the US and other regions that already offer crypto ETFs, potentially attracting more investment and innovation to the UK crypto market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The national average savings account interest rate is 0.42% as of June 6, 2025, according to the FDIC, though high-yield savings accounts offer rates between 4.10% and 4.40%. Online banks often provide the best rates due to lower overhead costs, with some accounts requiring only a $1 minimum to open and no monthly fees. Choosing a high-yield savings account and comparing different options are crucial steps to maximizing savings. These accounts provide a safe place to store an emergency fund while earning interest, helping individuals prepare for unexpected expenses. (not investment advice)</p>
