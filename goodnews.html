          <p>Indiana Fever guard Sophie Cunningham drew attention before a game against the Chicago Sky for her pregame attire, which featured a t-shirt with the message "Hot Girls Eat Arby’s." This is not the first time her fashion choices have gone viral, as she has a history of making style statements on gamedays. In the game itself, Cunningham contributed five points and two steals in the Fever's 93-78 victory. The team has been playing without star rookie Caitlin Clark, who is sidelined with a groin injury.</p>

          <p>After five days of intense fighting that resulted in at least 33 deaths and displaced over 275,000 people, Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. The agreement was mediated by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and followed pressure from the United States. The conflict, rooted in a long-standing border dispute, had escalated following a landmine explosion and involved exchanges of gunfire and rockets. Both nations have pledged to honor the ceasefire, a crucial first step toward de-escalation and restoring regional stability.</p>

          <h2>Psychologists Explain the Roots and Management of High Emotional Sensitivity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 07:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the phenomenon of being "too sensitive," where minor slights can cause significant emotional distress. Psychologists suggest this trait can stem from both genetic predisposition and past experiences like trauma or neglect, leading to heightened rejection sensitivity. While being emotionally attuned can be a strength, it can also disrupt relationships if not managed. Experts recommend coping strategies such as reality-checking negative assumptions, questioning the long-term significance of an offense, and developing healthier communication skills to express hurt feelings without escalating conflict.</p>

          <p>Germany's government is planning a "Bau-Turbo" (construction turbo) initiative to combat its severe housing crisis and rising rents. The plan involves amending the German Building Code to allow municipalities to fast-track approvals for residential construction projects, bypassing some complex regulations. The goal is to build approximately 320,000 new homes annually to meet demand, a target the previous government failed to achieve. While the construction industry welcomes the move, some economists are skeptical it will be a short-term fix, and environmentalists worry about the potential loss of green spaces.</p>

The manufacturer's stock is up over 30% this year, with aircraft production increasing and deliveries at an 18-month high. Ortberg has focused on changing the company culture and improving quality, which has earned praise from major airline customers like Ryanair's CEO.

          <p>This advice column addresses the challenge of making "hard choices," such as choosing between a high-paying corporate job and a morally fulfilling but lower-paying nonprofit career. Drawing on the work of philosopher Ruth Chang, the article argues that such choices are difficult not because one option is secretly better, but because the options are "on a par," offering different but equally valid kinds of value. Instead of searching for a non-existent correct answer, individuals must exercise their own agency to create reasons for their choice, defining who they want to be in the process.</p>

          <p>Slate Auto, an electric vehicle startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is betting on affordability with its sub-$20,000 petite pickup but faces a challenging market. The attractive price point relied on a $7,500 federal tax credit that is set to expire, potentially putting the vehicle out of budget for early reservation holders. The company aims to fill a void for affordable EVs as U.S. sales growth cools and consumer interest wanes. Slate's strategy involves a bare-bones approach, with features like a stereo and power windows offered as paid extras to keep the base price low.</p>

While Norris started on pole, a small mistake at the first corner and a less aggressive restart allowed Piastri to use the slipstream effectively.

This provides a better viewing opportunity than the more famous Perseid meteor shower in August, which will be largely washed out by a bright moon this year. The combined showers this week could produce up to 30 meteors per hour in dark skies.
