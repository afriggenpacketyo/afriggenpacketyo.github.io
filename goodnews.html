          <p>The Indiana Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder will compete in the NBA Finals, marking the end of a long championship drought for one of the teams. The Thunder, previously the Seattle SuperSonics, last won a title in 1979, while the Pacers have only reached the Finals once before in 2000. Oklahoma City had a dominant regular season with a 68-14 record, fueled by young stars like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, while the Pacers upset the New York Knicks in a tightly contested Eastern Conference Finals. This year's NBA Finals will crown the seventh different champion in as many years, highlighting the league's parity and competitive landscape.</p>

          <p>Actor George Wendt, known for his role as Norm Peterson on "Cheers," inadvertently linked himself to Ohio politics when he confused John Boehner with another politician during a late-night television appearance. Wendt, campaigning for his brother-in-law Greg Jolivette, who was running against Boehner, mistakenly accused Boehner of being involved in a scandal. Boehner's team responded, leading to a heated exchange, but Boehner ultimately won the election. Despite the initial tension, Boehner later said that Wendt apologized, and they had a friendly conversation, with Boehner remembering Wendt fondly after his death.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying bee hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. The incident prompted authorities to close the road and advise the public to avoid the area to prevent stings. Beekeepers worked to recover the hives and save as many bees as possible, with the goal of helping them re-hive and find their queen. By the next morning, most of the bees were expected to return to their hives, and the road was reopened after about 24 hours.</p>

          <p>Kyodo News reports on various topics, including Japan and the U.S. vowing to enhance cybersecurity cooperation amid growing threats. Japan's cheaper stockpiled rice is now available in stores due to rising prices, while the Pentagon chief is urging Asian allies to invest more in defense to counter China. The leader of a Japanese opposition party apologized for referring to government rice stockpiles as "animal feed." A subway fire in Seoul caused the evacuation of 400 passengers, and a museum featuring Asian works opened on Naoshima Island.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to spend ¬£1.5 billion on six new munitions and explosives factories to enhance its defense capabilities. The move aims to create approximately 1,800 jobs and support the procurement of up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons. Defence Secretary John Healey stated that the investment will strengthen the armed forces and boost the UK's industrial base. The decision follows warnings about depleted stockpiles and the need to increase weapons production, particularly in light of the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The skulls of 19 Black patients, who died in a New Orleans hospital in the 1870s and were sent to Germany for racist phrenological studies, have been repatriated and laid to rest. The University of Leipzig acknowledged the skulls were acquired unethically and returned them. The memorial included prayers from religious leaders and a jazz funeral. This repatriation represents a notable restitution and honors the lives of those whose remains were used in discriminatory research.</p>
