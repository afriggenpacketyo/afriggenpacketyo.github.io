          <h2>FAA Considers Reducing Flights at Newark Airport Following Disruptions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 11:12:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is considering reducing flights at Newark Liberty International Airport after a series of equipment failures and air traffic controller shortages led to significant flight disruptions. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated that similar issues could occur at other airports nationwide and require urgent attention and investment in modernizing U.S. aviation infrastructure. The disruptions, including a 90-second radar outage, caused hundreds of delays and cancellations, prompting discussions between U.S. airlines and the FAA to address the ongoing problems and minimize passenger impact.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced that the UK will end overseas recruitment of care workers as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration and prioritize domestic hiring. The government plans to introduce new visa and recruitment laws, aiming to decrease the number of lower-skilled workers entering the UK. The move is intended to encourage firms to hire British nationals and extend visas for overseas workers already in the country, while also addressing concerns about training and standards within the care sector.</p>
