          <p>In the small, remote village of Kwethluk, Alaska, the Orthodox Christian Church has officially canonized a local Yup'ik midwife and healer as a saint. The ceremony drew pilgrims and clergy from across the globe to the region, which has a strong Orthodox tradition. This significant event marks the first time a member of the Indigenous Yup'ik community has been recognized with sainthood within the church. The canonization honors the individual's contributions and deepens the cultural integration within the local Orthodox faith.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To keep entertainment production within the state, the California legislature has passed a measure to more than double the annual tax incentives for the film and television industry to $750 million. This increase, advocated by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to counter the trend of productions moving to other states and countries that offer more generous financial benefits. The move is seen as a crucial step to support Hollywood's local economy and workforce, which has seen job losses in recent years. Industry unions and local advocates have applauded the decision.</p>

          <p>Despite Apple's stock facing headwinds from potential tariffs and a perceived lack of groundbreaking innovation, CNBC's Jim Cramer advises investors not to lose faith in the company. He argued that historical downturns for Apple have consistently proven to be excellent buying opportunities for long-term investors. Cramer emphasized that the company's expected earnings growth rate outpaces that of the broader S&P 500. He suggested that the stock's value should be considered in the context of its growth potential rather than just its current price-to-earnings multiple. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Southern California man has been sentenced to over a year in federal prison for tax fraud connected to the sale of memorabilia signed by the late comic book creator Stan Lee. The man, who had a personal relationship with Lee, failed to report over $1.2 million in income from these sales to the IRS between 2015 and 2018. In addition to the prison sentence, he has been ordered to pay more than $480,000 in restitution. The case highlights the legal consequences of failing to report income from high-value collectibles.</p>

          <p>Wall Street has seen a significant rally, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes closing at all-time highs, marking a strong recovery from a downturn in April. The surge has been partly driven by strong performance in the media and tech sectors, with companies like Netflix, Disney, and Amazon posting substantial gains. This market rebound appears to have overcome the initial panic caused by President Trump's tariff announcements earlier in the year. The recovery suggests investor confidence has returned despite ongoing trade policy uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas could be imminent, possibly within the next week. The administration has been actively pushing for a pause in the conflict, which began after Hamas's attack on Israel in October 2023 and has led to a devastating war in the Gaza Strip. Previous efforts to secure a lasting truce have been challenging, with both sides having rejected or amended proposals. The president's optimistic statement comes as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues to worsen, increasing international pressure for a resolution.</p>

The judge stated the order was a "shocking abuse of power" that violated the First and Fifth Amendments and threatened the independence of the legal profession. This is the latest in a series of judicial defeats for the administration's orders targeting law firms.</p>

For top European clubs, the total earnings can approach ¬£100 million, enough to cover the transfer fees of major player signings.

          <p>Financial advisor Ric Edelman is now recommending that investors consider allocating between 10% and 40% of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies, a substantial increase from his previous advice of a low single-digit percentage. He attributes this shift to the maturation of the crypto market, with increased institutional adoption and regulatory clarity resolving earlier uncertainties. Edelman also argues that the traditional 60/40 stock-and-bond model is obsolete due to increased human longevity. He posits that crypto offers non-correlated, high-growth potential needed for modern long-term investment strategies. (not investment advice)</p>
