Chancellor Rachel Reeves has privately warned the Cabinet about potential tax rises to cover the costs of abandoning welfare reforms, a stance creating political tension. Meanwhile, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised Conservatives to ignore the rise of Reform UK and focus on their own platform. In other news, the media is buzzing about the highly anticipated reunion of the Britpop band Oasis.</p>

          <p>Chelsea advanced to the Club World Cup semi-finals after defeating Palmeiras 2-1 in a competitive match. A key moment featured an impressive goal from 18-year-old Estevao Willian, a Palmeiras player who has already signed a future deal with Chelsea, offering fans a glimpse of his talent. Despite his equalizer, a late own goal from Palmeiras ultimately decided the contest in Chelsea's favor. The Blues will now face Fluminense in the next round of the tournament.</p>

          <p>The militant group Hamas has announced a "positive response" to the latest ceasefire proposal mediated by the United States, indicating a readiness to enter negotiations. This development follows President Trump's announcement that Israel had agreed to a two-month ceasefire framework, though Israeli sources noted they had not yet fully committed. The proposal comes amid a devastating conflict that has resulted in over 57,000 Palestinian deaths, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. The war began after a Hamas attack on Israel that killed approximately 1,200 people.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers do not plan to alter their trade deadline strategy despite a knee injury to third baseman Max Muncy. Initially feared to be season-ending, the injury was diagnosed as a bone bruise, with an expected recovery time of about six weeks. This prognosis provides relief to the team, allowing them to rely on internal options like Tommy Edman to fill the position temporarily. The front office feels confident that Muncy will return with enough time to prepare for the playoffs, avoiding a desperate search for a replacement on the trade market.</p>

          <p>A recent emotional public appearance by UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has sparked a broader conversation about the acceptability of crying in the workplace. The article explores different perspectives on whether showing such emotion is a career liability or a sign of strength and emotional intelligence. While some still view it as unprofessional, many, including career coaches and employees, argue that it is a normal human response and that supportive work environments are more productive. The piece suggests that while a single instance is unlikely to ruin a career, perceptions can still vary depending on the workplace culture.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that tiny marine creatures called zooplankton are "unsung heroes" in the fight against climate change. These animals gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton near the ocean surface in Antarctica and then sink deep into the ocean to hibernate, locking away vast amounts of carbon. This seasonal migration process stores as much carbon as the annual emissions of approximately 55 million gasoline-powered cars, a much larger amount than previously estimated. The findings highlight the critical but often overlooked role of these small organisms in regulating the global climate.</p>

After being contacted by a senior Hamas member, Dr. Bahbah has been in Qatar, relaying messages to help facilitate ceasefire and hostage release negotiations. His involvement, which reportedly played a role in the release of an Israeli-American hostage in May, exemplifies the unconventional diplomatic methods being used. The connection was reportedly made through the widow of former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, with whom Dr. Bahbah had worked in the past.</p>

Zookeepers gave the pair one of two eggs laid by another couple to increase the chances of both chicks surviving. This event is part of a successful breeding season for the zoo's colony of Humboldt penguins, which are a vulnerable species. Same-sex penguin parenting, while not common, has been observed in several zoos worldwide, with penguin parents sharing incubation and feeding duties.</p>
