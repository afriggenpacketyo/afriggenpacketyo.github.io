          <p>Taiwan has placed China's Huawei and SMIC on its trade blacklist, further aligning with U.S. trade policy amid growing tensions with Beijing. The two Chinese chip firms, along with their international subsidiaries, have been added to Taiwan's "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List." This requires domestic firms to obtain licenses before shipping products to these entities, reinforcing existing U.S. export restrictions and tightening potential loopholes. The move aims to address concerns over arms proliferation and national security, potentially increasing penalties for future breaches.</p>

          <p>China's navy is advancing beyond the strategic island chains that have historically defined the defensive boundaries for the United States and its allies in the Western Pacific. The deployment of two Chinese aircraft carrier groups in the Pacific Ocean since late May highlights Beijing's ambition to establish a blue-water navy by 2035. The island chain strategy, conceived in 1951, uses American-aligned island bases to contain communist influence, with Taiwan playing a pivotal role. The first island chain runs along East Asia's coastline, while the second includes major US bases like Guam, marking the outer boundaries of China's near seas.</p>
