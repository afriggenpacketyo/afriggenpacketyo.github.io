          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 11:39:31 EDT</div>

          <p>James Gunn's "Superman" has provided a significant boost to Warner Bros.'s DC Studios with a $122 million domestic and $217 million global opening weekend. Despite costing an estimated $225 million to produce, the film received positive reviews from critics and audiences, securing an "A-" CinemaScore. The debut, while robust, fell slightly short of some analyst predictions, potentially due to competition and political commentary surrounding the film's themes. The movie's success is considered crucial for the planned revitalization of the DC cinematic universe under its new leadership.</p>

          <h2>FIFA Agrees to Implement Mandatory Rest Periods for Professional Football Players</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 11:32:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant development for player welfare, FIFA has agreed in principle to introduce mandatory rest periods for professional soccer players. Following discussions with the global players' union, Fifpro, the new guidelines will include a 72-hour gap between matches and a minimum three-week off-season break. This consensus was reached amid concerns over an increasingly congested fixture calendar, highlighted by the expansion of the Club World Cup. The move is seen as a crucial first step by Fifpro in its ongoing effort to protect players from burnout and injury.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders has called for the NCAA to enforce more stringent uniform standards in college football, similar to the NFL's system of fines. Speaking at Big 12 Media Days, Sanders expressed his disapproval of players wearing "biker shorts" and lacking proper knee pads, stating it shows a lack of respect for the game. He suggested that financial penalties should be implemented to ensure players adhere to traditional uniform aesthetics. Sanders also addressed questions about his health, confirming his commitment to coaching the team following a recent contract extension.</p>

          <p>Investigative genetic genealogy, a technique combining DNA analysis with traditional family tree research, is proving instrumental in solving decades-old cold cases. The article highlights the work of Barbara Rae-Venter, a patent attorney whose hobby led to the identification of the Golden State Killer. This method involves uploading crime scene DNA to public genealogy databases to find relatives of a suspect, then building family trees to pinpoint the individual. While raising privacy concerns, the technique has been successfully used by law enforcement to identify and capture perpetrators of violent crimes, including numerous sexual assaults and homicides.</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service is showcasing new security enhancements. The agency has deployed a fleet of military-grade drones to improve aerial surveillance and prevent unauthorized aircraft, a key failure during the 2024 incident. Additionally, new mobile command posts, costing up to $1.5 million each, have been established to ensure direct and reliable radio communication with local law enforcement. These upgrades are part of a broader effort to address the procedural and technological gaps identified in the wake of the Butler shooting.</p>

          <p>Australia's Grace Kim has claimed her first major golf title, winning the Evian Championship after a dramatic play-off against Thailand's Atthaya Thitikul. The victory came after Kim eagled the second play-off hole. English amateur Lottie Woad, 21, nearly made history, finishing just one shot behind the leaders and narrowly missing a chance to become the first amateur to win a major in 58 years. Woad's impressive performance, including a final-round 64, has earned her enough points to qualify for the LPGA Tour, presenting her with a significant decision about turning professional.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced that the government will introduce measures to make electric vehicles (EVs) cheaper for consumers to purchase. While not confirming reports of a £700 million subsidy plan, she guaranteed that upcoming announcements would address the high upfront cost of EVs, which is a major barrier to adoption. The government also plans to invest £88 million in charging infrastructure, including better signage for charging hubs and funding for "cross-pavement gullies" to help those without driveways. These initiatives aim to accelerate the transition to EVs ahead of the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Professor Zheng Yongnian, a prominent Beijing policy adviser, has argued that Chinese think tanks need to become more "self-centred" and develop an "indigenous knowledge system" to effectively project the country's soft power. He contends that many academic institutions are too reliant on Western frameworks and textbooks, limiting their ability to explain China's unique practices to the world. According to Zheng, think tanks should focus on empirical research grounded in China's own practical policy experiences. This approach, he believes, is essential for accurately analyzing the country's development and predicting its future trajectory on the global stage.</p>

          <p>According to a psychologist who studies relationships, couples in the happiest partnerships intentionally practice five small habits during the work week that many others neglect. These rituals include building a brief morning routine together, sending thoughtful check-in texts during the day, and taking individual time to decompress after work before reconnecting. They also prioritize a short period of daily, distraction-free "us time" and end the day with a quick, quiet check-in to stay emotionally aligned. The article suggests these simple, intentional acts are key to maintaining intimacy and connection, even amidst the chaos of a busy schedule.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese satellites, Shijian-21 and Shijian-25, appear to have successfully docked in geostationary orbit, potentially for a first-of-its-kind autonomous refueling mission. According to the US-based space awareness company COMSPOC, the satellites were observed in prolonged "rendezvous and proximity operations" in early July, during which they seemed to be visually merged. If confirmed as a refueling, this would represent a significant leap in China's space servicing capabilities, a feat the United States has not yet accomplished with autonomous systems. The maneuver was reportedly monitored by nearby US surveillance satellites, highlighting its geopolitical significance.</p>

Despite this, she has remained a beloved and interesting figure, pursuing activism, writing, and now, a respected acting career with her role in "The Last Showgirl."

          <p>This poem, titled "Buying Shrimp at Bennetts Point," captures a quiet, reflective moment between a father and his child during a trip to a local seafood seller. The scene is set with vivid imagery of the coastal environment, including men hosing oysters and a mention of the local geography and its inhabitants, like alligators. The father, a man who appreciates the "beautiful thing" in the world, shares observations with the narrator. The poem concludes with a ride home, a bag of shrimp and two beers between them, and a final, enigmatic question from the father, "Do I know the word spleenful, he asks."</p>
