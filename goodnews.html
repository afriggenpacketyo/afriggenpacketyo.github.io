          <p>The struggling Chinese city of Hegang, located in the country's rust-belt region, is gambling on a new airport to revitalize its economy and leverage trade with neighboring Russia. Facing a declining population and shrinking GDP, the city announced a 1.2 billion yuan investment in Luobei Airport, with construction slated to begin soon and an opening planned for 2027. The project aims to handle 450,000 passengers and 1,600 tonnes of cargo annually. This infrastructure investment is seen as a critical effort to overcome economic stagnation by improving connectivity and attracting new opportunities to the historically industrial area.</p>

          <p>Despite years of severe U.S. trade restrictions, Chinese tech giant Huawei has strategically pivoted to become a formidable leader across China's artificial intelligence landscape. The company has expanded beyond its telecom roots into AI chips, data centers, and large language models, effectively becoming a national champion in the tech race. Nvidia's CEO has acknowledged Huawei as a major competitor, particularly with its Ascend series AI chips and a comprehensive software ecosystem that challenges American dominance. This transformation, ironically accelerated by U.S. pressure, has positioned Huawei as a 'jack of all trades' in high-complexity tech sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Toluca secured the 2025 Campeón de Campeones trophy with a 3-1 victory over Club América at a packed Dignity Health Sports Park. Despite América scoring first with a goal from Alejandro Zendejas in the opening minute, Toluca quickly equalized through Agustín Romero. The decisive goals came in the second half, with Paulinho scoring to give Toluca the lead. The match was contentious, featuring a disallowed goal for América and a late red card for Igor Lichnovsky. This victory continues Toluca's recent success against their rivals, whom they also defeated in the Clausura 2025 final.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macías Villamar, the infamous Ecuadorean gang leader known as 'Fito,' has been extradited to the U.S. to face federal charges for drug and arms trafficking. Fito, leader of the Los Choneros gang, was recaptured in June after a year on the run from a 34-year prison sentence. His gang is linked to a surge in violence that has plagued Ecuador and is also suspected in the 2023 assassination of a presidential candidate. The extradition follows a referendum in which Ecuadoreans approved the measure, supporting President Daniel Noboa's aggressive crackdown on organized crime.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new class of drugs known as GLP-1s, including the active ingredients in Ozempic and Wegovy, are being explored as a groundbreaking treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Women with PCOS, a common hormonal disorder linked to insulin resistance, have reported significant improvements in symptoms like irregular periods, weight gain, and hair loss after using these medications. While there is no standard treatment for PCOS, researchers believe the drugs' ability to improve insulin sensitivity and promote weight loss indirectly helps rebalance hormones. Larger clinical trials are needed, but early results and anecdotal evidence suggest a major therapeutic breakthrough.</p>

          <p>In this market commentary, the author argues against the conventional wisdom that looming tariffs will harm the stock market, particularly highly valued tech stocks. The article lists ten positive factors that are currently buoying the market, including strong corporate earnings and numerous economic stimulus provisions within President Trump's 'big beautiful bill.' These provisions, such as tax cut extensions, a new deduction for tipped workers, and an increased child tax credit, are expected to inject hundreds of billions into the economy. The author suggests these tailwinds, along with other factors like infrastructure spending and deregulation, create a strong foundation for continued market growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed it will launch a national inquiry into the 'Battle of Orgreave,' one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The incident on June 18, 1984, involved violent clashes between thousands of police officers and striking miners outside a coking plant in Rotherham. The inquiry will examine the events of the day and their aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of 95 miners, which collapsed amid allegations of falsified police evidence. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that those affected have had 'unanswered questions for over 40 years,' and the inquiry aims to finally uncover the truth.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler's victory at The Open has solidified his status as the most dominant force in men's golf since the peak of Tiger Woods, drawing frequent comparisons from peers and commentators. By winning his fourth major, Scheffler has demonstrated a 'Tiger-like' consistency and an unerring ability to close out tournaments from a leading position. While Scheffler himself calls the comparisons 'silly,' his machine-like performance, unflappable demeanor, and statistical superiority from tee to green mark a new era of supremacy in the sport. A key improvement in his putting has transformed him from a top contender into an almost unbeatable force.</p>
