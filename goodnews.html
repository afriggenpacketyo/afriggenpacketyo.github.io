          <p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission plans to propose a rule change that would allow public companies to report earnings on a semiannual basis instead of quarterly. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins confirmed the move, which follows a call from President Donald Trump to encourage long-term corporate focus over short-term results. If approved, the change would be optional, letting companies decide their reporting frequency, similar to the standard for foreign private issuers. Proponents argue it would save money and promote long-term strategy, while opponents raise concerns about reduced transparency for investors.</p>

Following the discussion, Trump stated he plans to visit China early next year and will meet with Xi at the upcoming APEC Summit in South Korea. The call was intended to finalize a framework agreement that would resolve U.S. national security concerns over the popular app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. While Trump expressed appreciation for the approval, a statement from China's Foreign Ministry indicated that a final deal is still subject to further consultation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A potential deal between the U.S. and China to resolve TikTok's ownership dispute could involve a licensing agreement for the app's highly valuable algorithm. This technology, which powers TikTok's content recommendation engine, has been a major point of contention due to Chinese laws restricting its export. A licensing arrangement would allow a new U.S.-based entity to use the algorithm's technology, potentially satisfying both commercial interests and U.S. national security concerns. However, experts caution that such a deal must ensure that American user data is fully firewalled from China-based engineers to truly address the security risks that prompted the divestment law.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Governor Miran States Tariffs Are Not a Major Inflation Concern</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 12:24:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran expressed his view that President Trump's tariffs are unlikely to have a significant inflationary impact on the U.S. economy. Acknowledging he is in the minority on the Federal Open Market Committee with this stance, Miran argued that while tariffs cause relative price changes, they do not create the kind of macroeconomic inflation that requires a monetary policy response. This perspective informed his recent dissenting vote, where he advocated for a larger half-point interest rate cut instead of the quarter-point reduction approved by the committee, citing a lack of evidence that tariffs have materially driven up inflation.

          <h2>Examining the Monthly Cost of a $50,000 HELOC Following Recent Fed Rate Cut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 12:24:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve recently cutting interest rates, the cost of borrowing through a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become more affordable for homeowners. Currently, the estimated monthly payment on a $50,000 HELOC with a 10-year term at an average rate of 8.05% is approximately $608, down from about $640 last September when rates were higher. Since HELOCs have variable rates, they adjust with changes in the Fed's policy, allowing borrowers to benefit from rate cuts without refinancing. This article contrasts these costs with fixed-rate home equity loans, which offer more predictability but are slightly more expensive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran stated that he was not pressured by President Trump on how to vote during the recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Miran, who dissented from the majority by favoring a larger half-percentage-point rate cut, confirmed he had only a brief congratulatory call with the president before the decision. His comments address intensified concerns about the central bank's independence under a president who has openly criticized its policies and leadership. Miran emphasized his decision was made independently and described the atmosphere at his first FOMC meeting as collegial and welcoming.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Predict Further Decline in Mortgage Rates by End of 2025</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates have fallen to a three-year low of 6.13%, and analysts predict they could drop further by the end of 2025, potentially reaching the high 5% range. This optimism is fueled by market expectations of at least one more interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve this year, contingent on inflation continuing to cool. A decline to 5.75% on a $500,000 loan could save a borrower nearly $120 per month. While this offers relief to homebuyers and those looking to refinance, experts caution that persistent economic concerns could limit how significantly rates will fall, making it unlikely they will return to pandemic-era lows.

Created by naturally crossbreeding a sweet table grape with a nutrient-dense red wine grape, Boombites have a deep red pulp rich in anthocyanins and contain three times more resveratrol than blueberries. A dietitian highlighted their potential health benefits, including antioxidant properties that may support gut health, boost immunity, and reduce inflammation.

He also cautioned investors to monitor the 10-year Treasury yield, warning that a continued rise could negatively impact the broader stock market, similar to headwinds experienced in the past. The discussion also touched on Nvidia's recent collaboration with Intel, which Cramer views as a strategic win for the AI chipmaker. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Panama Canal Authority is implementing new strategies to win back liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade that was lost during recent years of severe drought. Officials plan to reinstate a preferred booking slot system for LNG carriers next year and are developing an "Interoceanic Energy Corridor," a 76-kilometer pipeline to transport natural gas liquids across the isthmus. This pipeline would free up canal transit slots for other vessels, including LNG tankers. The initiatives are designed to offer more flexibility and reliability to energy shippers who had diverted to longer routes, such as around Africa's Cape of Good Hope.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time in Friday practice for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, leading his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc in a one-two finish. The session was challenging for McLaren's Lando Norris, who crashed into a wall, breaking his rear suspension and ending his practice run early. Norris described the incident as "costly" as it prevented him from completing important high-fuel race simulation runs. Despite the crash, Leclerc noted that McLaren's pace appeared formidable, suggesting they could be strong contenders in qualifying. Hamilton expressed satisfaction with improvements made to his car's braking system, boosting his confidence for the race weekend.</p>
