        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Photographer Miora Rajaonary created a project called "Sahy Rano" to raise awareness of female genital schistosomiasis (FGS), a neglected tropical disease affecting millions of women and girls in Africa. The waterborne infection, spread by parasitic worms, can cause infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and genital ulcers, often leading to suspicion and shame due to its STD-like symptoms. The women in the photos wear traditional Malagasy face masks, symbolizing their courage in breaking taboos and speaking about the disease publicly. The painted backdrop and laundry rope in the photos emphasize the inescapable presence of contaminated water in the women's lives, highlighting their bravery in returning to the water for their livelihoods. The project aims to break the silence surrounding FGS and promote awareness of its devastating impact.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in public school classrooms, citing its unconstitutionality. The court sided with civil liberties groups who argued the mandate violates the separation of church and state and would isolate non-Christian students. Republicans, including President Trump, have supported the law, claiming the Ten Commandments are historical and foundational to U.S. law. Louisiana's Attorney General plans to appeal the ruling, potentially taking it to the Supreme Court. Similar laws are being challenged in Arkansas and await signature in Texas, setting the stage for further legal battles over religion in schools.</p>

          <p>The Wonder Reader, a newsletter from The Atlantic, provides advice on managing insults and anger, suggesting that being offended can make a person feel powerless, but there are ways to control our experience when we feel insulted. One simple method is to laugh it off, which allows individuals to judge the severity of the offense rather than ceding that judgment to an outside arbitrator. The newsletter includes articles on gaining strength by not taking offense, the worst insult experienced by an opera singer, and a personal experiment to change one's personality. The collection of stories aims to help readers navigate uncivil behavior and hurtful comments by choosing how to react.</p>

          <p>A relationship expert suggests that couples should take a compatibility test to identify potential deal-breakers early in their relationship. The expert and her husband, both tenured professors, created a list of questions based on relationship science to ensure they were a good match. The questions focused on critical areas of communication, such as finances, family, and lifestyle preferences, tailored to their specific circumstances. The expert advises couples to openly communicate about these key themes to determine their compatibility and avoid future conflicts. The compatibility test helps couples proactively address potential issues and build a stronger foundation for their relationship.</p>

          <p>Barington Capital, an activist investor with a history of successful engagements, is advocating for significant changes at Victoria's Secret & Co. to improve shareholder value. Barington suggests replacing most of the board with experienced directors, evaluating CEO Hillary Super's leadership, focusing on the core brand, accelerating digital and international growth, and streamlining operations. This approach contrasts with another investor's critical but less constructive letter. Barington's prior engagement with L Brands, Victoria's Secret's former parent company, resulted in a substantial increase in the stock price, indicating their potential to positively influence the company's performance. The firm's collaborative approach and retail sector expertise suggest a good opportunity to work constructively with the board to create shareholder value. (not investment advice)</p>
