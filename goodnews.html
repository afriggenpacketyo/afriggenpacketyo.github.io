          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel has endorsed President Trump's decision to temporarily federalize the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department to address crime. Patel was seen at a command post, stating his support for law enforcement and emphasizing that "when you let good cops be cops, they deliver." The move, which includes activating National Guard troops, has been heavily criticized by D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and other Democrats as an unprecedented power grab and a "manufactured intrusion on local authority."</p>

          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce, suspending planned tariff hikes for an additional 90 days until November 10. The agreement provides more time for negotiations aimed at resolving trade imbalances and other economic and national security issues. Despite the truce, trade flows between the two economic giants have been significantly impacted this year, with U.S. government data showing a nearly 15% drop in imports from China in the first half of the year. The extension averts an immediate escalation but underscores ongoing tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected a request from the U.S. Attorney's office to dismiss all charges against Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Trevor Kirk, who was already convicted of a felony for using excessive force. The judge ordered Kirk to begin his four-month prison sentence, stating that overturning the jury's conviction would be "contrary to the public interest." The case has been controversial, leading to prosecutor resignations after the U.S. Attorney, a Trump appointee, sought to unravel the conviction and reduce the felony to a misdemeanor.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Mexico City are using environmental DNA (eDNA) to track the critically endangered axolotl, a unique salamander species found only in the canals of Xochimilco. As traditional net surveys increasingly come up empty, researchers are filtering water to find genetic traces of the elusive creature. The technique has confirmed the axolotl's presence in protected refuge areas and one unprotected site, offering a glimmer of hope for its resilience. The population has plummeted from 6,000 per square kilometer in 1998 to just 36 in 2014.</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Views U.S. Deal with Nvidia and AMD as Another Form of Tariff</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer commented on the agreement requiring Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government 15% of their China sales revenue, arguing there is "nothing novel" about the arrangement. He characterized the move as "basically just another form of tariff," suggesting it is a benign way for the government to be involved in business compared to past corporate bailouts. Cramer concluded that the deal is ultimately beneficial for both the U.S. taxpayer and the chip companies, as it allows them to resume sales to the lucrative Chinese market.

          <p>The three-year-old mystery of missing cyclist Tony Parsons was solved thanks to the quick thinking of his killer's girlfriend, Dr. Caroline Muirhead. After her boyfriend, Alexander McKellar, confessed to a fatal hit-and-run, he led her to the remote shallow grave in Argyll, Scotland. Muirhead secretly dropped a Red Bull can as a marker and later alerted the police, leading to the recovery of Parsons' body and the arrest of McKellar and his twin brother.

          <p>A verification of the data behind President Trump's "crime emergency" declaration in Washington D.C. reveals a more complex picture than portrayed. While the city's homicide rate did spike in 2023, it was not the highest on record, and overall violent crime has been on a significant downward trend since, reaching a 30-year low in 2024. According to the city's police data, violent crime is down 26% so far in 2025 compared to the same period last year, a trend consistent with other major U.S. cities.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reversed his stance on Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, calling him an "amazing story" of success after a meeting at the White House. This marks a significant shift from the previous week when Trump had publicly demanded Tan's immediate resignation, citing concerns over the CEO's alleged ties to China. The meeting, which included cabinet members, signals a de-escalation of tensions between the administration and the head of the major U.S. chipmaker. The sudden change in tone reflects the administration's complex and often volatile relationship with the semiconductor industry.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved the construction of a 51-story apartment tower in the downtown South Park neighborhood. The project, proposed by a New York developer, is planned to include 536 rental units, ground-floor retail space, and parking for over 500 vehicles. While the approval is a step forward, the construction timeline remains uncertain due to a challenging financial climate for developers, marked by high interest rates and rising labor and material costs. The South Park area, however, remains a vibrant and growing residential hub.</p>
