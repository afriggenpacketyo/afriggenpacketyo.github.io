        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States government, particularly under President Trump, is increasingly embracing an interventionist industrial policy, mirroring strategies historically employed by Beijing. Experts suggest this shift stems from a recognition that relying solely on commercial market forces may not guarantee sufficient domestic supply for critical strategic industries like advanced electronics and essential minerals. Escalating geopolitical tensions, especially concerns over supply chain disruptions for semiconductors and vital resources, are identified as primary factors driving this new approach. This article highlights a significant policy pivot in the ongoing US-China economic and technological competition.</p>

          <p>The James Webb Space Telescope has delivered breathtaking and unprecedented images of Sagittarius B2, the most active star-forming region within the Milky Way galaxy. Utilizing its Mid-Infrared Instrument and Near-Infrared Camera, the telescope captured intricate details of cosmic dust, gas, and numerous stars, offering new insights into stellar birth. While these images illuminate much about star formation, they also present new mysteries, such as dense, dark regions that remain opaque even to Webb's powerful instruments, believed to be future stellar nurseries. Astronomers continue to analyze this data to understand the dynamics of star formation in the galactic center.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Initial jobless claims in the U.S. unexpectedly dropped to 218,000 last week, significantly below estimates, which helped alleviate concerns about potential labor market weakness. This positive report follows the Federal Reserve's recent decision to lower interest rates, partly citing rising "downside risks to employment." However, other economic data released concurrently reinforced underlying strength, with second-quarter Gross Domestic Product showing a robust 3.8% gain and durable goods orders increasing by 2.9% in August. Despite these solid indicators, financial markets continue to anticipate additional interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Blockchain technology is fundamentally characterized by the irreversibility of its transactions, a feature crucial for security and decentralization within the crypto ecosystem. However, Circle, the world's second-largest stablecoin issuer, is currently investigating methods to introduce reversibility for certain transactions, particularly in instances of fraud or dispute. This innovative exploration aims to foster greater integration between the stablecoin industry and traditional financial systems. The potential for such a change has ignited debate within the cryptocurrency community, with some critics arguing that it could compromise the core tenets of blockchain's immutability and decentralization.

          <p>This article delves into how Generation Z is fundamentally reshaping the landscape of sex, dating, and relationships, largely abandoning traditional linear progressions and "base" metaphors. Young people now navigate a complex lexicon of casual entanglements, from "sneaky links" to "situationships," often prioritizing autonomy and emotional detachment over conventional commitment. While this offers greater freedom to forge individual paths, it also presents challenges due to a perceived lack of guidance in navigating intimacy. The article highlights that despite trends of less sex and fewer committed relationships, many Gen Zers still engage in both, emphasizing enthusiastic consent while also grappling with issues like slut-shaming and the pervasive influence of online pornography.</p>
