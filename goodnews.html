          <p>Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang announced his departure to Meta, confirming earlier reports tied to a substantial $14.3 billion investment from the social networking giant. Meta will acquire a 49% stake in Scale AI without voting power, while Wang will contribute to Meta's superintelligence initiatives. Jason Droege, the chief strategy officer, will take over as CEO of Scale AI, and a small group of Scale AI employees will also transition to Meta as part of the agreement. Despite Meta's investment and Wang's move, Scale AI assures its customers, including rivals like Google and Microsoft, that their business information and data will remain confidential, as Zuckerberg aims to bolster his company's AI efforts amid competition. The move comes as Zuckerberg expresses frustration with his team's AI development progress and believes Wang is better suited to oversee crucial AI initiatives for the company.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump is planning a visit to the Iowa State Fairgrounds this summer, potentially in July, to shore up support in farm country and celebrate the nation's 250th anniversary. Trump last visited the fair in August 2023, attracting a record crowd despite facing legal challenges at the time, and he won the Iowa caucuses in January 2024 by a significant margin. He has expressed interest in hosting a year-long exhibition at the fairgrounds in 2026 to commemorate the nation's semiquincentennial, as the Iowa State Fair is a significant summer event showcasing agriculture and middle America. Iowa has been attracting politicians from both parties, although the Democratic National Committee stripped Iowa of its "first in the nation" status for the party's nominating process in 2023.</p>

WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert highlighted that the partnership with Scripps has expanded the league's reach and visibility, while the league also signed an 11-year media rights deal with Disney, Amazon, and NBCUniversal last July, valued at about $200 million per year.</p>

          <p>Meta's newly launched AI app has faced privacy concerns as users unknowingly share prompts publicly, including some generating controversial images. To protect privacy, users can adjust settings within the Meta AI app to prevent prompts from being shared publicly.

Additionally, users can manage their information to make all public prompts visible only to themselves and delete their prompt history, as Meta continues to invest heavily in AI to compete with rivals like Google and OpenAI.</p>

Researchers are exploring various approaches, including genetically modifying red blood cells, neutralizing blood types with gut bacteria enzymes, and creating microscopic artificial blood cells. While promising, these blood substitutes carry risks, such as triggering immune reactions, and must replicate all functions of biological blood. Several methods are nearing readiness for use, while others require further testing, emphasizing the continued importance of human blood donations.</p>

          <p>The FDA has expanded its approval of Moderna's respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, mRESVIA, to include adults under 60 at increased risk of the disease, previously only approved for those 60 and older. This approval follows a late-stage clinical trial showing the vaccine boosted immune responses in younger adults, with over one-third of adults between 18 and 59 having underlying conditions that increase RSV risk. While the FDA has approved the expansion, the CDC's vaccine advisory committee must vote to recommend the new age group's eligibility, followed by a final recommendation from the CDC director. The CDC currently recommends RSV vaccination only for those 75 and older and for those 60 and over at increased risk, and recent changes to the CDC's advisory committee may influence future recommendations.</p>

          <p>Kim Gordon, co-founder of Sonic Youth, has released a new version of her song "Bye Bye" called "Bye Bye 25," featuring terms the Trump administration has attempted to minimize from public life. Gordon drew inspiration from a list of phrases scrubbed from government websites and materials, reflecting Trump's stance on diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as policy issues. The song highlights the absurdity of controlling policy through language, avoiding direct sloganeering and presenting a jumble of terms for reflection. Gordon's effort is one of the few instances of established musicians directly responding to Trump's second term, as she aims to describe the current state through her music and lyrics.</p>

          <p>Thousands of "No Kings Day" protests are scheduled to take place in over 2,000 communities across the United States to protest President Donald Trump's administration and counterprogram the military parade in Washington, D.C. The protests, organized by Indivisible and other groups, aim to protest overreach on immigration enforcement, civil rights, and cuts to the federal government. Protests will be held across the country, with a flagship event in Philadelphia, and organizers emphasize that the protests should remain peaceful and nonviolent. Trump has stated he does not feel like a king, and at least two states are calling up the National Guard as a precaution against potential violence.</p>

          <p>Amazon is restructuring its health business into six new units, aiming to simplify the structure and accelerate innovation after a series of executive departures. The reorganization follows a decade of efforts to enter the U.S. health-care market through acquisitions and partnerships, but with some setbacks, including the shuttering of Amazon Care. The new structure will focus on areas such as clinical care delivery, operations, strategic growth, technology, compliance, and pharmacy services, as Amazon seeks to address the fragmented experience for patients and customers in healthcare.</p>
