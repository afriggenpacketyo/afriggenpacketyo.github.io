          <p>Microsoft has announced it is retiring the iconic "blue screen of death" (BSOD), a fixture of the Windows operating system since the 1990s. The error screen, which appears during unexpected system crashes, will be replaced by a black version in the upcoming Windows 11 24H2 update. This change is part of a broader effort to streamline the restart experience, reduce downtime, and align the user interface with the modern Windows 11 design. The company aims to make recovering from system failures a faster and less disruptive process for users.</p>

          <p>Anna Wintour, a dominant figure in fashion for over three decades, is stepping back from her direct editorial role at American Vogue. A new position, head of editorial content for American Vogue, will be created to handle daily operations. The 75-year-old will remain a central figure at the publisher, retaining her influential titles as Vogue's global editorial director and chief content officer for parent company Cond√© Nast. This structural change aligns the U.S. publication with other international Vogue editions and allows Wintour to focus more on her global and corporate responsibilities while still overseeing the brand.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis for savers considering where to deposit a significant sum like $10,000, weighing the benefits of short-term CDs against high-yield savings accounts. With current interest rates, 3-month and 6-month CDs offer slightly higher returns than a high-yield savings account, while a 9-month CD earns slightly less. Because the earnings are so similar, the decision depends on an individual's outlook on future interest rate movements and their need for liquidity. Locking in a CD rate can be advantageous if rates are expected to fall, whereas a savings account offers flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court of Mexico has issued a landmark ruling in favor of singer Sasha Sokol, establishing an important precedent for civil cases involving child sexual abuse. The court upheld a lower court's decision holding artistic producer Luis de Llano civilly liable for the abusive relationship he had with Sokol when she was 14 and he was 39. Crucially, the ruling determined that statutes of limitations do not apply in such cases, opening a path for other victims to seek justice regardless of how much time has passed. Sokol celebrated the decision as a victory that transcends her personal case and helps repair the truth for survivors.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has indicated that the upcoming July deadlines for imposing tariffs on the European Union and other countries are "not critical" and could be extended. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that President Trump could push back the deadlines for countries engaged in "good faith" trade negotiations. This signals a potential reprieve from the threatened 50% tariffs on the EU and the expiration of a 90-day pause on "reciprocal" tariffs for most other nations. The remarks suggest a more flexible approach as the administration continues to pursue numerous trade deals simultaneously.</p>

Warning signs include companies that guarantee specific results, demand large upfront payments before providing services, or are not transparent about their process and fees. A legitimate credit counseling agency will conduct a thorough review of your entire financial situation before recommending a plan, be honest about the potential impact on your credit score, and discuss all available options, not just their own program.
