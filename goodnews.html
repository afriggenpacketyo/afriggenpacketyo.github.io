          <p>Singapore is holding a general election amidst concerns over rising living costs, housing availability, and potential economic impacts from US tariffs. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong is facing his first major test against a strengthened opposition, with the People's Action Party (PAP) seeking a strong mandate to navigate these challenges. The opposition Workers' Party (WP) is advocating for more scrutiny of the PAP's policies and greater efforts to address the cost of living crisis. While the PAP is expected to retain power, the election serves as a gauge of Wong's leadership and the potential for a shift in Singapore's political landscape.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election to determine who will address inflation, housing affordability, and relations with the United States. Voters are primarily concerned with cost-of-living pressures, with both major parties offering limited solutions. While polls suggest Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor Party is favored, dissatisfaction with the major parties is growing, with voters increasingly turning to independent candidates and minor parties. Opposition leader Peter Dutton's attempts to align with Trump-like policies have not resonated with many voters, highlighting a shift in the political climate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Tim Friede's blood contains antibodies that have proven effective against fatal doses from a variety of venomous snakes in animal tests. This research could be a major step towards creating a universal antivenom, potentially saving thousands of lives each year. Friede's motivation stemmed from a desire to protect himself and to develop better therapies for snakebite victims worldwide, enduring over 200 bites and 700 venom injections in his pursuit.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to manage the Hong Kong dollar, which had risen above its trading band against the US dollar due to recent capital inflows. The HKMA bought US$6.005 billion and sold HK$46.539 billion to stabilize the currency ahead of a potential US Federal Reserve interest rate cut. This intervention, the first in two years, reflects the HKMA's commitment to maintaining the stability of Hong Kong's currency and financial markets amid global economic uncertainties.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is undergoing a series of administrative reforms aimed at modernizing the state, boosting economic growth, and consolidating power. These reforms include merging ministries, streamlining state-run media, and reducing the number of provinces and municipalities. The changes are expected to eliminate around 100,000 public sector jobs and address dysfunction caused by the party's anti-corruption campaign. The restructuring also allows the top leadership to exert more direct control over local affairs and appointments ahead of the Communist Party's 14th National Congress in 2026.</p>

          <p>The elimination of the tariff exemption for inexpensive goods imported into the US is affecting online retailers and advertising revenue for tech platforms. Temu and Shein, which heavily relied on the de minimis loophole to ship low-cost goods from China, are now subject to higher tariffs, causing them to raise prices and reduce advertising spending. This shift is expected to negatively impact Meta, Alphabet, and other tech companies that benefited from the surge in advertising revenue from these retailers, with some already experiencing a decline in spending. Temu has stopped shipping products directly from China to customers in the United States, and that its U.S. orders would now be shipped from local warehouses in America, as the business ‚Äútransitions to a local fulfillment model.‚Äù</p>

          <p>Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco stated that there is no indication of foul play in the death of Jeff Sperbeck, a friend and business partner of John Elway, following a golf cart incident. The investigation is nearing completion, and it appears to be a tragic accident. Sperbeck fell from the back of a moving golf cart carrying five people and hit his head. While Elway was present, the driver does not appear to be at fault, and alcohol is not believed to be a factor.</p>
