          <p>The Eastern Kentucky Remembrance Project (EKRP) is a community coalition dedicated to honoring the Black victims of historical lynchings in the region, whose stories have often been lost or ignored. The group recently placed a historical marker for Fred Shannon, a man lynched in 1924, as part of its effort to confront the area's violent past. By collecting soil from lynching sites and researching forgotten histories, the interracial group aims to foster remembrance and reconciliation. Their work continues despite the current political climate and some local resistance.</p>

          <p>In a historic reversal of its post-World War II pacifist stance, Germany is planning a massive military expansion, aiming to create the strongest armed forces in Europe. Spurred by a new Trump presidency and security concerns in Europe, the German government will increase defense spending to 3.5% of its GDP, funded by a special constitutional change. This major policy shift reflects a new sense of urgency and is intended to meet the demands of its NATO partners. The move signals a profound change in Germany's national identity and its role in global security.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the essence of the LGBTQ+ rights movement is its diversity and that attempts by some conservative gay figures to sideline more flamboyant or transgender members are misguided. The author criticizes the "respectability politics" that seeks mainstream acceptance by policing the community's own members. The article asserts that progress has always been driven by the most marginalized, from the drag queens at the Stonewall Riots to other gender-nonconforming pioneers. It concludes that the movement's strength is its inclusivity, not its ability to conform to heteronormative standards.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the 1972 wrongful conviction of Elmer "Geronimo" Pratt, a Black Panther leader framed for murder in a case that haunted his lawyer, Johnnie Cochran. Pratt was imprisoned for 27 years based on the testimony of a police informant, with authorities concealing crucial evidence that could have proven his innocence. The case exposed the extent of the FBI's COINTELPRO program aimed at dismantling Black nationalist groups. Decades of legal battles finally led to Pratt's exoneration, revealing a story of systemic corruption, betrayal, and the fight for justice.</p>

          <p>Voters in the conservative stronghold of Huntington Beach, California, delivered a significant defeat to the city's MAGA-aligned council by rejecting two controversial ballot measures. The initiatives, which were overwhelmingly defeated, would have created a parent board to review children's library books and allowed for the privatization of the library system. The victory was driven by a nonpartisan coalition of residents who felt the council had overreached with its extreme agenda. The outcome is being seen by some as a blueprint for how local, grassroots organizing can successfully push back against political extremism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Facing an onslaught of Russian Shahed drones, Ukraine is increasingly turning to interceptor drones as a key defensive strategy. These specialized, high-speed drones are a much cheaper alternative to firing expensive anti-aircraft missiles, costing around $5,000 compared to up to $1 million per missile. As Russia modernizes its attack drones to fly higher and faster, Ukraine is focusing on mass-producing its own interceptors and training pilots for aerial combat. This tactical shift is seen as essential for protecting Ukrainian cities and infrastructure from relentless airstrikes.</p>

Scholz also called for higher earners to contribute more to defense spending, criticizing talk of tax cuts. His speech marks a transition for the party following a recent change in government.</p>
