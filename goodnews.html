          <p>Adrian Ramsay, co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, has launched a joint leadership bid with Ellie Chowns, the MP for North Herefordshire, joining the race alongside deputy leader Zack Polanski. With Carla Denyer stepping down, Ramsay and Chowns aim to lead the party into its "most ambitious chapter yet," focusing on national politics in Westminster and winning power across the country. Polanski is campaigning on a platform of building a "mass movement" to counter Nigel Farage's Reform UK party. The Green Party had its best-ever result in the 2024 general election, securing seats in four constituencies.</p>

          <p>A guest essay in the New York Times describes a growing student-led movement in Serbia challenging the increasingly autocratic rule of President Aleksandar Vucic. Sparked by corruption concerns following a train station collapse that killed 16 people, the protests have grown into the largest and most extensive movement in years, uniting diverse groups across Serbian society. Despite government attempts to quell the unrest through resignations and financial incentives, protesters are demanding accountability and early elections, employing non-hierarchical, horizontal decision-making. The movement faces challenges including government intimidation and police brutality, but continues to organize and seek international awareness.</p>

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen from a Japanese temple in 2012 and taken to South Korea, has been returned to its rightful owner, resolving a long-standing dispute that had strained bilateral relations. The statue, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, was handed over to representatives of the temple in South Korea following a South Korean Supreme Court ruling in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership. The statue is expected to be stored at a museum after a ceremony at the temple.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reported making substantial progress in trade talks held in Switzerland, with both sides describing the discussions as "productive and constructive." U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced a "trade deal" but provided no details, while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng noted the talks were "in-depth" and "candid." The talks, the first face-to-face meetings since President Trump imposed steep tariffs on Chinese imports, have raised hopes of potential tariff cuts and a de-escalation of the trade war, which has caused turmoil in financial markets. Following the conclusion of the talks, U.S. trade representative ambassador Jamieson Greer said "the deal we struck with our Chinese partners" would help reduce the U.S.'s $1.2tn trade deficit.</p>

          <p>Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, facing International Criminal Court charges for crimes against humanity, remains popular in the Philippines as he runs for mayor of Davao City in the upcoming midterm elections. His arrest and extradition to The Hague have divided the country, with some polls indicating majority support for the international investigation, while many supporters view him as a victim of political persecution by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. The election could prove pivotal for Duterte's daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte, who faces impeachment charges and a potential disqualification from holding public office. The Duterte family continues to thrive in Davao, where they hold significant political power.</p>

The investment aims to address infrastructure issues, attract workers, and improve health and educational outcomes.

This "most favored nation's policy" aims to lower healthcare costs for Americans, but is expected to face strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry. The proposal, which Trump tried and failed to implement during his first term, would likely only impact drugs covered by Medicare and administered in a doctor's office, and would not cover more common prescription drugs filled at a pharmacy.</p>
