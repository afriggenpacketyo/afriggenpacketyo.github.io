          <p>Wise, a British money transfer firm, announced plans to shift its primary listing to the U.S., a move that will establish a dual listing with a secondary presence in London. This decision presents a setback for the London Stock Exchange, as Wise will move its main listing hub to the U.S. The company stated that this change would allow its shares to be traded on both a U.S. stock exchange and the LSE, potentially increasing its access to capital and investors. Shares of Wise experienced an increase of almost 11% following the announcement, reflecting positive market sentiment. </p>

          <p>Ispace, a private Japanese company, is attempting a moon landing with its Resilience lander, aiming for the unexplored far north of the moon. This mission follows the company's first moonshot, which ended in a crash landing two years prior. The Resilience lander carries a rover named Tenacious, built in Europe, equipped with a high-definition camera and a shovel to collect lunar dirt for NASA. The mission seeks to contribute to establishing lunar infrastructure, including experiments on electrolysis and food production, with plans for a larger lander by 2027 involving NASA. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A contributor challenges the narrative of the "China shock," arguing that trade with China did not wreck the U.S. economy. The author cites a comprehensive review by an American Enterprise Institute scholar, Scott Winship, who contends that the negative effects of trade with China have been significantly exaggerated. Winship's analysis suggests that even if the original estimates are accepted, the employment effects were relatively modest and do not convincingly explain community decline. The author concludes that the real "shock" America faces in 2025 is from a resurgence of misguided protectionism based on a misdiagnosed problem. </p>

          <p>In Altadena, following the Eaton fire, many burned lots are being bought up by developers, despite initial community resistance. Roughly 145 burned lots have sold, with about 100 currently listed and more in escrow, outpacing the Palisades market. Local real estate agents suggest the slow process of navigating insurance claims is the only thing keeping more lots from selling. While some fear the new builds won‚Äôt match Altadena's charm and could lead to gentrification, others argue that developers are necessary to rebuild the community, which has been devastated by the fires. </p>

          <p>California lawmakers are considering policy changes to protect the state insurance program for high-risk homes following recent wildfires. AB 226, sponsored by Assemblymembers Lisa Calderon and David A. Alvarez, would allow the FAIR Plan to access state loans and bonds to avoid financial collapse after disasters. Lawmakers are also considering bills to protect homeowners from price gouging, streamline claims processes, and offer financial protections for disaster victims. The measures aim to support rebuilding efforts and prevent future crises, but most won't directly aid survivors of the Palisades and Eaton fires. </p>

To regain momentum, Musk must rebuild Tesla‚Äôs reputation, deliver on autonomous driving technology, keep up with increasing competition, and complete a comprehensive charging network.

The study undermines claims that children are virtually impervious to COVID and cannot transmit the infection to adults. The Michigan State team documented the speed at which school mask mandates were dropped, noting that the districts that rejected the mandates tended to be "less urban, less diverse, and more likely to have voted for Trump in the 2020 election."

          <p>The UK's medicines regulator, MHRA, warns women using weight-loss jabs like Wegovy and Mounjaro to use effective contraception due to potential harm to unborn babies and reduced effectiveness of the contraceptive pill. Common side effects such as vomiting and diarrhea, as well as slowed stomach emptying, may affect pill absorption. The MHRA advises using contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward, and suggests those on Mounjaro and oral contraceptives should also use condoms or switch to another method. The warning comes amid concerns that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using the drugs safely. </p>

          <p>With an "above normal" hurricane season forecasted, experts are advising homeowners to review their insurance policies to ensure adequate coverage. This includes checking policy limits, deductibles, and assessing the need for flood insurance, as homeowners policies typically do not cover flood damage. It's important to review policy limits, which represent the highest amount the insurance company will pay for a covered loss or damage, to ensure they would cover the cost of rebuilding the home. Experts advise acting before a storm bears down, as insurers often suspend policy changes and pause issuing new policies during such times. </p>
