          <p>An Australian Cattle Dog named Doc Holliday will participate in the U.S. Army's 250th birthday celebration in Washington, D.C. Doc is part of the Army's 1st Cavalry Division Horse Cavalry Detachment at Fort Cavazos, Texas, and is accustomed to parades. The parade will include marching troops, tanks, and aircraft, and is part of a weeklong festival to mark the Army's milestone birthday. While the event is costly, Army officials emphasize the importance of strengthening the connection between America and its Army.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Children's Breakfast Cereals Becoming Less Nutritious</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in JAMA Network Open found that breakfast cereals marketed towards children have been getting sweeter, fattier, and less nutritious between 2010 and 2023. The study analyzed 1,200 cereals and found that total fat and sodium content increased significantly, while protein and dietary fiber decreased. The researchers emphasized the importance of breakfast for children's energy and concentration and hope the findings spark a conversation about creating healthier options for kids. While some cereals can be part of a nutritious diet, the trend toward lower nutritional quality is concerning.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally, hitting a new record high above $111,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership and corporate adoption. Easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China and the Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt have also been key catalysts. The price rise is taking place despite a drop in U.S. equities, suggesting investors are looking for alternative stores of value. Pro-crypto policies from the Trump administration and the advancement of crypto legislation in the Senate have further supported the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Navy has reversed its decision to ban 381 books from its libraries after a Pentagon review using standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) titles. Almost all of the books have been returned to the shelves, with only about 20 titles needing further review by a Department of Defense panel. The reversal comes after the Pentagon issued a memo standardizing search terms for DEI-related books, leading the Navy to find far fewer titles requiring removal compared to its initial search. The Pentagon memo was issued to bring the DOD into compliance with a Trump executive order to eliminate DEI programs.</p>

          <h2>Understanding the Potential Risks of Annuities Running Out of Money</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 14:49:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Annuities are often pitched as a way to ensure you won't outlive your money during retirement, but the reality is that these retirement products can also be quite confusing. Whether or not an annuity can run out of money depends heavily on the type of annuity you have. In general, immediate and lifetime annuities are designed not to run out of money as long as the issuing insurer remains solvent. However, fixed-term annuities, variable annuities, and annuities with withdrawal riders can run out of money under certain circumstances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Anthropic, the Amazon-backed OpenAI rival, launched its most powerful group of artificial intelligence models yet: Claude 4. The company said the two models, called Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4, are defining a "new standard" when it comes to AI agents and "can analyze thousands of data sources, execute long-running tasks, write human-quality content, and perform complex actions," per a release. Anthropic stopped investing in chatbots at the end of last year and has instead focused on improving Claude's ability to do complex tasks like research and coding, even writing whole code bases, according to Jared Kaplan, Anthropic's chief science officer.</p>
