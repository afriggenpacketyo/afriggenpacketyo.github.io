          <p>A growing number of singles, particularly from Gen Z, are using AI-powered dating assistants like Rizz and Keepler to improve their online dating experiences. These apps analyze conversation screenshots and suggest replies, helping users initiate chats, overcome writer's block, and even navigate being "ghosted." While some users find the technology to be a confidence booster and a useful tool for breaking the ice, it raises questions about authenticity in digital communication. Experts suggest that while AI can be a helpful supplement, it becomes problematic when used as a substitute for genuine human connection, potentially misrepresenting a user's true personality.</p>

          <h2>Sex Therapist Identifies Four Common Intimacy Blockers in Relationships</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 09:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to sex therapist Chamin Ajjan, intimacy is crucial for a thriving relationship, and its absence can negatively impact all areas of life. The article outlines four common but often overlooked "intimacy killers" that are hiding in plain sight. These include the constant distraction of phones, unresolved emotional attachments to an ex-partner, a persistent negativity bias that leads to self-rejection, and the physiological impact of stress. The author suggests practical steps for couples to address these issues, such as setting screen-free boundaries, processing past relationships, and challenging negative thoughts to foster deeper connection.</p>

          <h2>Expert Negotiator Explains Why Securing a Raise Requires a Multi-Step Process</h2>

          <p>Securing a salary increase is rarely accomplished in a single meeting, according to negotiation expert Kathryn Valentine, CEO of Worthmore Strategies. The process often takes several weeks of discussions, follow-ups, and documentation. Valentine advises initiating the conversation during a mid-year check-in rather than an annual review, as budgets are often set by year's end. The goal of the first meeting should be to open the dialogue and set the stage, not to reach a final agreement. She stresses the importance of scheduling a follow-up meeting and documenting the conversation to maintain momentum and hold both parties accountable.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has taken a 9.01% stake in Tripadvisor, with intentions to engage the company's board on value creation opportunities. Tripadvisor, which operates its core guidance platform, the Viator booking site, and TheFork reservation service, is seen by analysts as undervalued compared to its peers. Starboard's involvement could lead to several outcomes, including a push for greater operational efficiency, a strategic sale of one of its segments like TheFork, or even a sale of the entire company. The move comes after significant shareholder discontent with some board members, suggesting Starboard may leverage this to push its agenda. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Commentary Argues End of Mandatory Shoe Removal at Airports Signals a Move Beyond Post-9/11 Security Theater</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This commentary piece reflects on the evolution of airport security in the United States since the September 11th attacks. The author suggests that recent changes, such as the phasing out of mandatory shoe removal for many passengers, represent a significant shift away from what has often been described as "security theater." These measures, implemented in the wake of 9/11, have long been a source of frustration for travelers. The article implies that America is beginning to find a new balance, moving past the heightened, reactive security protocols that defined the two decades following the attacks and toward more efficient, risk-based screening methods.</p>

The match, held in Adelaide, also saw the return of Owen Farrell as a substitute. Despite the dominant performance, the team faced a setback with a head injury to Garry Ringrose, ruling him out of the upcoming Test, and a knee injury to Luke Cowan-Dickie.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering the authorization of new funding for Ukraine, a potential shift in policy since taking office. According to diplomatic sources, this move could be a signal to Russia following its recent escalation of drone and missile attacks. President Trump has recently expressed disappointment with Vladimir Putin and suggested that Russia's actions could prompt more U.S. arms transfers. While the source of funding is unclear, the administration has access to leftover presidential drawdown authority and the power to seize Russian foreign assets, though it has pushed for NATO allies to shoulder more of the financial burden.</p>

Micah was diagnosed with Danon disease, a rare genetic condition that had caused his heart to function at only 7%, putting him at risk of sudden cardiac death. After receiving a pacemaker and defibrillator, Micah was placed on the transplant list and successfully received a new heart nine months later. Inspired by the lack of resources for teenagers in his situation, Micah and his mother launched Transplant Teenz, a non-profit providing a virtual support community for young people awaiting organ transplants.</p>

          <p>One year after China's Chang'e-6 mission returned with rock samples from the far side of the moon, a scientific debate is raging over the age of the massive South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin. Chinese scientists analyzing the samples have proposed an age of 4.25 billion years, which would make it one of the oldest and largest impact craters in the solar system. However, these findings, based on what they call the only direct evidence from the basin, were reportedly rejected twice for publication by a peer-review panel at the journal Nature. This has sparked a debate over the interpretation of the data and the dynamics of international scientific validation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article advocates for allowing children more freedom for unstructured physical play, arguing that modern society increasingly restricts this vital activity. The author notes that while wild animals spend their youth honing movement skills, human children are often kept sedentary due to safety fears and social norms. This lack of free play can have negative consequences for physical health, cognitive skills, and mental well-being. Citing injury-prevention experts, the piece suggests that encouraging kids to climb, run, and wrestle helps them develop a robust "movement vocabulary," which is crucial for long-term athletic durability and injury prevention.</p>

          <p>Katie Gatti Tassin, author of "Rich Girl Nation," describes the high cost of beauty maintenance as an "insidious force" in women's financial lives, dubbing it the "hot girl hamster wheel." She argues that spending on aesthetic enhancements like hair, nails, and skincare functions as a commitment to future spending, as these are depreciating assets that require constant upkeep. Tassin suggests that while "pretty privilege" is real, women are socialized to over-invest in beauty as their primary form of social capital. She advocates for a "hot girl detox," where women critically evaluate these expenses and redirect the saved money toward building actual wealth.</p>

Another critical indicator is withdrawing more than the recently recommended safe rate of 3.7% annually. Additionally, repeatedly draining and not replenishing an emergency fund or relying solely on Social Security for income are signs that retirement savings are under significant strain.

While students are increasingly focused on the return on investment of their degrees, some employers, like BlackRock, are actively seeking graduates with liberal arts backgrounds. This demand is fueled by the rise of AI, which places a premium on creative thinking and other "soft skills." (not investment advice)</p>
