          <p>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine is visiting Berlin for his third meeting in as many weeks with Germany's new Chancellor Friedrich Merz. The visit underscores Merz‚Äôs commitment to the war in Ukraine and reestablishing German leadership among European allies, particularly in light of diminishing U.S. support for NATO. Discussions are expected to focus on continued military assistance, specifically the long-range Taurus missile system, with Merz having previously expressed openness to exporting the system. Merz has emphasized Germany's support for Ukraine and the use of sanctions to pressure Russia into a ceasefire, highlighting the critical importance of European unity in the face of the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>UFC fighter Paddy Pimblett is targeting a fight in Abu Dhabi in October, ideally against Ilia Topuria or Justin Gaethje. Pimblett earned a significant win over Michael Chandler and is seeking an opponent ranked in the top five. While he would like to fight Topuria, who is scheduled to face Charles Oliveira, Pimblett believes a fight with Gaethje is more likely, as Gaethje is currently unbooked and ranked third in the UFC lightweight rankings. Pimblett and Topuria have a history of conflict, and Pimblett feels a fight against Gaethje would be exciting and draw more public interest.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has pledged to deliver lower-priced stockpiled rice to consumers in rural areas to combat surging rice prices. This decision follows the suspension of orders from major retailers to allocate rice to smaller supermarkets and rice shops.

The government's actions aim to alleviate the financial strain on households caused by retail rice prices doubling in the past year. (not investment advice)</p>

Skomer Island's isolation protects it from predators and human impact, making it a thriving habitat for seabirds. The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales (WTSWW) manages the island and undertakes annual seabird counts to monitor the populations.</p>
