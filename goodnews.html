          <p>A federal judge partially unsealed documents in the Kilmar Abrego Garcia case, following a request from a media coalition.  The Justice Department opposed the unsealing, citing discovery materials and national security concerns.  The judge rejected these arguments, finding that the public has a presumptive right to access court records.  The unsealed documents include records related to Abrego Garcia's deportation and legal status.</p>
