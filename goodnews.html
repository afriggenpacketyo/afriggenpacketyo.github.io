          <p>A 20-year-old woman sustained minor injuries after likely being bitten by a juvenile shark while swimming in waist-deep water at Jones Beach State Park, New York. State officials reported that the woman received non-life-threatening cuts to her leg and foot. Although she did not see the creature, experts analyzed the bite marks and concluded they were most likely from a young sand tiger shark. Following the incident, swimming was temporarily suspended, but the beach reopened the next day after drone and lifeguard surveillance of the water found no further signs of dangerous marine life in the area.</p>

          <p>The global success of Chinese-made television series, such as the historical fantasy "Legend of Zang Hai," is highlighting the nation's growing influence in international entertainment. The show, which follows a protagonist's quest for revenge, has topped streaming charts in numerous regions, including on Disney+ in Taiwan and trending worldwide on the social media platform X. This success points to a broader trend of C-dramas gaining traction for their intricate plots, high production values, and integration of traditional Chinese culture. Analysts are considering whether this rising popularity represents a new form of cultural soft power for China on the world stage.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied another motion from President Donald Trump to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed by the five men who were wrongfully convicted in the 1989 Central Park jogger case. U.S. District Judge Wendy Beetlestone ruled that Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP law, which protects against lawsuits targeting free speech, does not apply in federal court. The plaintiffs sued Trump in October, alleging he defamed them during a presidential debate by falsely claiming they had killed someone and confessed. This ruling allows the case, which centers on Trump's long-standing public criticism of the men, to proceed.</p>

          <p>As the tenth anniversary of the nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage approaches, a Maryland couple, Gita Deane and Lisa Polyak, are reflecting on their pivotal role in the fight for equality. They were the lead plaintiffs in a 2004 lawsuit challenging Maryland's ban on same-sex marriage. Although their legal battle was initially unsuccessful in the state's highest court, their public campaign helped build momentum that led to Maryland legalizing marriage equality in 2012, two years before the Supreme Court's landmark decision. They express concern over current efforts to roll back these protections, emphasizing the ongoing need to defend hard-won rights.</p>

          <p>A team of mechanical engineering students from Johns Hopkins University has successfully designed and built a custom printer that adds braille to beer labels for a Maryland brewery. The project was initiated at the request of Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), the state's largest employer of blind and low-vision workers. The student-designed machine can handle materials that commercial braille printers cannot and was specifically created to be easily operated by BISM's visually impaired employees. This innovative device will streamline the production of accessible labels for a local beer that supports a fundraiser for individuals with vision loss.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes closed at record highs, capping a week that began with significant geopolitical uncertainty following U.S. military action in Iran. Initial market fears subsided as the conflict did not escalate, and a sharp drop in oil prices helped fuel the rally. Investors also grew more optimistic about potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts later this year, despite new data showing core inflation was slightly hotter than expected in May. Gains were led by technology stocks, particularly Nvidia, and financials, which benefited from a proposed easing of bank capital requirements. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research on skeletons from the ancient city of √áatalh√∂y√ºk in Turkey suggests it may have been a matriarchal society ruled by females over 9,000 years ago. By analyzing the DNA of more than 130 individuals buried under the city's homes, scientists discovered that genetic connections within households were primarily traced through the female line. This indicates that men likely moved into their wives' households upon marriage and that female offspring tended to remain in their family homes. The findings, published in the journal Science, challenge traditional assumptions about patrilineal structures in ancient societies and point to the central role of women at this well-preserved Neolithic settlement.</p>

          <p>The California Highway Patrol (CHP) responded to an unusual report of a baby tiger stranded on the side of Highway 166 in San Luis Obispo County. A driver had called in what they believed to be a tiger cub on the roadside. However, when an officer arrived to investigate the scene, they discovered the animal in question was not a large feline but a deceased hawk. The California Department of Transportation was notified to remove the bird. The incident served as a peculiar reminder that owning exotic animals like tigers is illegal in California without special permits.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people participated in the Budapest Pride march, defying legal threats and pressure from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The event proceeded despite a new "child protection" law that restricts gatherings deemed to promote homosexuality, with attendees risking fines and organizers facing potential prison sentences. The large turnout, which included EU officials and MEPs showing solidarity, was seen as a powerful symbol of civil society's resistance to the government's anti-LGBTQ policies. Protesters marched for diversity and fundamental rights in a country where they feel their freedoms are increasingly under threat.</p>

Norris described his qualifying lap as nearly perfect and said he felt a return to form after a season marked by qualifying mistakes. The strong performance was aided by recent car upgrades, including a revised front suspension designed to give him a better feel for the vehicle. His championship-leading teammate, Oscar Piastri, will start in third, while their closest rival, Red Bull's Max Verstappen, had a difficult session and qualified in seventh place.</p>
