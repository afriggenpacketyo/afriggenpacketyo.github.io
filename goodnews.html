          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang praised Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) during a visit to Taiwan, hailing it as one of humanity's greatest companies and suggesting that investing in its stock would be "very smart," particularly given the U.S. administration's interest in acquiring stakes in tech firms receiving CHIPS Act funding. Huang also announced that TSMC is producing six new products for Nvidia, including advanced AI chip components. Simultaneously, Nvidia has reportedly asked suppliers to halt production of its H20 graphics processing units designed for China, following Beijing's security concerns and a reported freeze on local company purchases. Huang acknowledged these queries and expressed optimism that the issue would be resolved, underscoring the delicate balance Nvidia must strike amid escalating U.S.-China trade tensions in the critical semiconductor sector.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thailand's former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was acquitted of a royal defamation charge by a Bangkok court, avoiding a potential 15-year prison sentence under the country's strict lese majeste law. The court found insufficient evidence and noted potential political bias among witnesses, stating the prosecution's account was incomplete and lacked context regarding the specific royal figure. This verdict marks a significant moment for Thaksin, who has faced numerous politically motivated charges and has consistently maintained his innocence since being ousted in a 2006 military coup. Despite this acquittal, his daughter, current Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, faces a separate ethics ruling that could lead to her removal from office next week.</p>

          <p>Chinese AI startup DeepSeek announced an update to its large language model V3.1, hinting that its new "UE8M0 FP8" precision format is specifically designed for China's upcoming "next generation" homegrown AI chips. This development signals DeepSeek's potential for closer collaboration with China's burgeoning domestic AI chip ecosystem, driven by Washington's advanced semiconductor export restrictions and Beijing's push for self-sufficiency. The article notes this comes after reports of Beijing urging Chinese AI developers to use local alternatives to Nvidia's GPUs. DeepSeek's previous models demonstrated advanced capabilities despite U.S. controls, underscoring China's progress in AI development amidst global tech competition.</p>

          <p>The U.S. housing market is showing tentative signs of improvement, with existing home sales rising 2% in July, though overall sales remain significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels. A key positive indicator is the increase in housing inventory, now at its highest since 2020, offering buyers more options and leverage. While nationwide median prices are still up minimally, some markets are experiencing price softening, and mortgage rates have slightly decreased, spurring refinance activity. Experts anticipate rates to remain near 6.6% through year-end, with potential dips in 2026, which could further encourage buyers and ease the "lock-in effect" that has kept many homeowners from moving.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has agreed to significantly reduce previously threatened high tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors imported from the European Union, settling on a 15% rate in line with most other sectors. This deal comes after Trump had earlier threatened tariffs as high as 250% on pharmaceuticals, aiming to boost domestic production. In exchange for the 15% tariff on most European goods, including semiconductors and lumber, the EU must pass legislation to eliminate tariffs on all U.S. industrial and agricultural goods. While the agreement offers some predictability for businesses, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association noted that the new 15% tariff on cars, down from 27.5%, is still considerably higher than the previous 2.5%, impacting consumer prices.

          <p>Shares of Chinese electric carmaker Nio surged after the company unveiled its latest ES8 SUV, aggressively priced at 308,800 yuan ($43,000) under a battery subscription plan. This strategy aims to lower upfront costs and broaden Nio's market reach beyond its traditional high-end focus, amidst fierce price competition in China's EV sector. The launch, alongside Nio's cheaper Onvo and Firefly brands, is seen as a move to counter dipping deliveries while competitors grow. Analysts believe the stock surge reflects market anticipation of strong new orders for the model, as Nio accelerates global expansion plans to mitigate domestic competition, higher tariffs, and regulatory pressures.

Under new rules, claimants residing outside the UK for over eight weeks will generally become ineligible, unless exceptional circumstances apply.
