          <p>Energy analysts are forecasting that Americans could see the lowest summer gas prices since 2021, with the national average potentially dropping below $3 per gallon by September. This expected decrease is attributed to the de-escalation of the Israel-Iran conflict, which had previously caused a spike in oil prices, as well as typical summer factors like increased refinery production. The article suggests that despite temporary shocks, the overall trend is a slow decline in fuel costs, with some experts noting that Americans are spending a smaller percentage of their income on energy compared to the past.

          <p>This opinion piece asserts that Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary is directly attributable to the grassroots power of the Palestinian liberation movement. The author contends that Mamdani's unwavering support for Palestine, long considered a political liability, became an asset thanks to years of activism that shifted public opinion. The campaign's ground game was fueled by organized groups and student activists already engaged in progressive politics, including pro-Palestinian advocacy. The article concludes that this win demonstrates how Palestine has become a central issue in domestic US politics, capable of mobilizing a powerful voting bloc.</p>
