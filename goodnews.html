          <p>Thames Water has decided to pause its "retention scheme" that would have paid substantial bonuses to senior executives, following public and governmental criticism. The company had been accused of attempting to circumvent rules against water companies paying bonuses despite poor performance. This decision comes after Downing Street stated that rewarding executives for failure was unacceptable, especially given Thames Water's financial struggles and environmental performance. The company will await guidance from the regulator Ofwat to ensure its approach aligns with public expectations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new "ultra-rapid" test has been developed to diagnose types of brain tumors in hours instead of weeks, potentially transforming patient care. The technique, developed at the University of Nottingham and Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, has a 100% success rate in diagnosing tumor types. Surgeons say the faster diagnosis enables more radical surgery during the initial procedure and quicker access to treatments like radiation or chemotherapy. Patients also experience reduced anxiety while awaiting results, making it a significant advancement in brain tumor treatment.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is considering limiting COVID-19 vaccine approvals to adults over 65 and those with certain medical conditions, potentially requiring additional studies before approving shots for healthy younger adults. This shift comes amid concerns about the uncertain benefits of additional doses for low-risk individuals who have already been vaccinated or had COVID. The agency's scientific advisors are set to meet to decide on the composition of the COVID vaccine for the fall, marking a departure from the previous policy of recommending annual shots for everyone 6 months and older.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans for the "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, an ambitious project aimed at expanding the country's air defense system to protect against foreign threats. The project, which Trump claims will be completed by the end of his term, has been a priority since he took office. Experts, however, cite logistical and financial hurdles, with cost estimates ranging from $175 billion to $542 billion. The project aims to create a next-generation military system capable of intercepting missiles launched from anywhere in the world.</p>

          <p>A recent tariff truce between the US and China has sparked cautious optimism for resolving economic tensions and addressing issues like fentanyl production. While the agreement provides a 90-day reprieve, the complex nature of their economic interdependence makes a comprehensive agreement unlikely before the deadline. Despite scaled-back tariffs, the remaining duties continue to impact bilateral trade. The truce signals a reluctance from both sides to sever economic ties completely, offering hope for future progress.</p>
