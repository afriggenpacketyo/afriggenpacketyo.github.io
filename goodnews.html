          <p>The annual Notting Hill Carnival has begun in west London, filling the streets with vibrant costumes and music for its opening children's parade. The festivities started at dawn with J'ouvert, a tradition where participants cover themselves in colorful paint and powder to mark the start of the weekend-long celebration of Caribbean culture. The event, which has been running for over five decades, maintains its historical and community roots. A 72-second silence is planned for both days to commemorate the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire and others who have died, including Kelso Cochrane, whose murder in 1959 was a catalyst for the carnival's creation.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Vence, France, have discovered an ancient baptistery dating back 1,500 years, offering new insights into early Christian rituals. The structure, found next to a previously unearthed fifth-century cathedral, features a well-preserved, cross-shaped baptismal font at its center. According to supervising archaeologist Fabien Blanc Garidel, the discovery confirms the antiquity of the bishopric of Vence and enhances understanding of religious practices in the region during the fifth and sixth centuries. The excavation also revealed several burials in the cathedral's nave, likely of religious figures from the Carolingian period, further illuminating over six centuries of the site's history.</p>

          <p>Ireland's women's rugby team began their World Cup campaign with a commanding 42-14 victory against Japan at Franklin's Gardens. The Irish team demonstrated their strength early, securing a bonus point before halftime with tries from Amee-Leigh Costigan, Neve Jones, Beibhinn Parsons, and Fiona Tuite. Two additional tries in the second half from Eve Higgins and Enya Breen, all successfully converted by Dannah O'Brien, sealed the comprehensive win. Japan managed to score a try in each half but was ultimately outmatched by Ireland's impressive and cohesive performance, marking a strong statement of intent for the rest of the tournament.</p>

          <p>Despite China's significant trade relationships with U.S. allies, such as the European Union, Beijing's recent "charm offensive" aimed at countering American pressure has failed to secure meaningful political alignment. The opinion article argues that this resistance is rooted in deep-seated factors, including shared identity, integrated security pacts, and cultural ties that bind these nations to Washington's strategic framework. While economic pragmatism is a factor, foundational security interests, like intelligence-sharing agreements and defense commitments with the U.S., remain the paramount priority. This dynamic creates an unbridgeable gap between China's global ambitions and the current geopolitical reality, where allies may seek restraint but will not support a China-led confrontation.</p>

Its path is expected to keep it well east of Bermuda, tracking across the subtropical North Atlantic. This activity aligns with NOAA's forecast for an above-normal hurricane season.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has appointed Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia to lead the newly established U.S. National Design Studio, an agency tasked with streamlining and improving federal government websites. The studio, a successor to the Department of Government Efficiency previously headed by Elon Musk, will advise on usability, aesthetics, and standardized design to enhance user experience and cut costs. Gebbia, who recently shifted his political alignment from Democrat to supporting Trump, stated his goal is to make government digital services "beautiful," reliable, and satisfying for citizens. The agency is scheduled to operate for three years before closing.</p>

          <p>A pair of coyotes, nicknamed Romeo and Juliet, have become established residents of Manhattan's Central Park, drawing the attention of photographers and wildlife enthusiasts. Having expanded their range eastward over the last century due to a decline in predators, coyotes are increasingly adapting to urban environments across the U.S., with an estimated 4,000 in the Chicago area and around 20 in New York City. Local photographers track the elusive animals to document their behavior and educate the public, emphasizing that the coyotes are not a threat to humans. City officials have also shifted their approach, now promoting coexistence rather than capture and removal.</p>

          <p>A new uncrewed naval vessel featuring significant stealth characteristics has been observed in China, likely during a rehearsal for the upcoming Victory Day parade. Photographs circulating online show a boat with angled surfaces and a faceted hull, designs intended to reduce its radar, infrared, and acoustic signatures. The vessel, which appears to be over 15 meters long, is painted in Chinese navy camouflage and lacks a hull number. While designed for uncrewed operation, the presence of cockpit windows suggests it can also be operated by a crew, indicating a versatile new addition to China's naval capabilities.</p>

          <p>A new social archetype, the "performative male," has emerged from Gen Z culture on TikTok, describing men who curate an alternative, intellectual, and "soft" aesthetic to attract progressive women. This trend, marked by interests like feminist literature, indie music, and tote bags, has inspired public contests and memes that poke fun at the persona. While often lighthearted, the term also carries a darker implication, suggesting these traits might be a deceptive performance to mask manipulative behavior. The phenomenon reflects a broader cultural conversation about authenticity, gender performance, and the persistent distrust in modern dating dynamics.</p>

          <p>A first-time Tesla owner shared an honest one-year review, revealing that while his fuel savings were a modest $334, the real financial benefit came from reduced maintenance costs. He contrasted the $1,432 spent on charging with the tens of thousands he had spent on repairs for his previous car over several years. After 15,000 miles, his only maintenance expense for the Tesla was $600 for two new tires, highlighting that long-term savings from avoiding typical engine and transmission repairs accumulate over time. The review underscores a key advantage of electric vehicles beyond just fuel, as they have fewer mechanical parts that require regular service.</p>

McCarthy highlights that states like California, Florida, and even Texas are setting records in renewable energy capacity. She asserts that this sub-national and private-sector leadership, along with international partnerships, ensures that the U.S. remains engaged in the climate fight, regardless of federal policy.</p>

Tennis provides a full-body aerobic workout that improves bone density and cardiovascular health, with one study linking it to a nearly decade-longer lifespan compared to sedentary peers. The sport's complexity, requiring rapid decision-making and motor coordination, also offers significant cognitive advantages, enhancing reaction times and potentially staving off cognitive decline. Unlike many sports, tennis has a low risk of catastrophic injury, making it a safe and engaging activity for people of all ages.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The practice of parents reading aloud to their young children is declining, with a recent survey showing a significant drop over the last decade. The article argues that this trend represents a loss not just for children's literacy development but for parents as well. Reading aloud is presented as a profound way for parents to connect with their children, guide their understanding of the world, and interpret their child's own developing personality. From sharing complex novels with a newborn to simple board books, the act of reading together creates a shared experience that helps parents learn to "read" their child's cues and expressions, fostering a deep, early bond.</p>

          <p>The discourse around artificial intelligence often focuses on its potential to automate and replace human jobs, but this article argues for a different approach: designing AI as a collaborative tool. Using examples from radiology and aviation, it explains that imperfect automation can be dangerous, as it may degrade human skills needed for critical interventions. Instead of aiming to automate entire expert roles, AI should be built to complement human strengths like context, ethics, and creativity. A collaborative AI can serve as a force multiplier, amplifying human expertise and leading to better outcomes than either humans or AI could achieve alone, especially in complex, high-stakes fields.</p>

          <p>A new book proposes a novel approach to climate change: treating excess atmospheric carbon as a sacred, priceless commodity to be sequestered, much like the U.S. hoards gold in Fort Knox. The concept, developed by an anthropologist and an artist, envisions a grassroots movement of cooperative community "carbon banks." These banks would accept organic waste, convert it into a stable form like biochar, and in return, issue depositors a local digital currency. This system aims to create both a financial and a moral incentive for carbon sequestration, operating independently of government action and building a post-carbon economy from the ground up.</p>

The state has integrated the fragrance into its marketing efforts, including scratch-and-sniff panels in travel magazines.
