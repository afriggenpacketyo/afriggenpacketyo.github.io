          <p>Texas Instruments' ambitious $60 billion U.S. manufacturing megaproject, comprising seven new chip fabrication plants, is gaining momentum with Apple's commitment to produce critical foundation semiconductors for iPhones there. This move comes amidst new tariffs on chips not manufactured in the U.S. and Apple's increased U.S. spending. While TI's shares initially dropped due to weak guidance and tariff concerns, analysts see the company as a "tariff winner" due to its U.S. foundries potentially undercutting rivals. The project, aiming to increase TI's capacity fivefold and create 60,000 U.S. jobs, is a significant bet on regaining market share and reshoring semiconductor production. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Waymo, Alphabet's autonomous vehicle subsidiary, has been granted its first permit by the New York Department of Transportation to begin testing in New York City. This marks the city's inaugural autonomous vehicle testing launch, with eight Waymo vehicles set to operate in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn through late September. New York state law mandates a human driver behind the wheel during these tests. This expansion follows Waymo's nationwide growth, including launches in Austin and Philadelphia, and reflects New York City's interest in integrating such technology, albeit with strict safety requirements and data reporting to authorities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major retailers like Walmart and Home Depot report that while tariff costs are rising, they have largely blunted the impact on consumers through creative mitigation efforts. These include diversifying sourcing, pushing costs back to vendors, and strategic price adjustments, avoiding widespread price hikes. Consumer spending has remained steady overall, though lower-income households show more sensitivity to price changes. Companies with strong brands and new revenue streams, such as advertising and third-party marketplaces, are better positioned to absorb costs. However, uncertainties persist, particularly regarding future tariffs on China and the broader economic environment, leading some to issue cautious outlooks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Poland's gaming industry is demonstrating remarkable creativity and growth, with approximately 500 studios and 15,000 employees in 2022, making it a top European player. Developers attribute this success to a "special survival gene" fostering unique and cost-effective solutions, influenced by the country's complex history. Despite a global gaming industry crisis marked by layoffs and market oversaturation post-COVID, Polish studios like Varsav Game Studios are producing innovative titles. While some indie developers face financial challenges and hope for increased government support, the sector continues to expand, benefiting from educational institutions and a strong creative talent pool.</p>

Cocoa futures have seen record highs due to adverse weather and supply tightness in West Africa, leading to significant annual inflation in chocolate products globally. While cocoa prices have eased slightly this year, manufacturers are still processing higher costs from late 2024, passing them onto consumers. However, J.P. Morgan analysts anticipate a softening of industrial demand and improving supply, suggesting cocoa prices may stabilize around $6,000 per metric ton, potentially leading to more favorable chocolate prices in the longer term.

          <p>As the U.S. retreats from global clean energy investment, with President Trump labeling wind and solar power "the scam of the century," Chinese "cleantech" firms are aggressively expanding into emerging markets. Chinese investors show renewed interest in Southeast and Central Asia and Latin America, embedding proprietary technologies into local supply chains. Through "tech diplomacy," China is promoting its technical standards in solar power, batteries, and electric vehicles, aiming to align regional energy systems with its intellectual property ecosystems. This strategic push contrasts with the U.S. stance, creating a significant shift in the global clean energy landscape and fostering China's influence.</p>
