          <p>Singapore's economy expanded by 2.9% year-on-year in the third quarter, surpassing economists' forecasts of 1.9%, although this represented a slowdown from the previous quarter's 4.5% expansion. Despite this stronger-than-expected performance, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) warned that GDP growth is projected to moderate in 2026, aligning with external developments and a normalization in trade-related sectors. Manufacturing and construction showed softening, yet global investment in artificial intelligence is expected to bolster the manufacturing sector. The MAS maintained its policy settings, anticipating core inflation to ease in the near term before gradually rising, indicating a cautious outlook amidst global trade headwinds.

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets displayed mixed trading on Tuesday, diverging from Wall Street's gains, as new trade measures between the US and China took effect. China began imposing fees on US ships docking at its ports, a retaliatory move following similar charges imposed by Washington on Chinese vessels. This development occurred despite US President Donald Trump softening his rhetoric on China, posting on Truth Social, "Don't worry about China, it will all be fine!" Japan's Nikkei 225 index declined, while South Korea's Kospi index added 1.01%, boosted by Samsung Electronics' projected 32% rise in third-quarter profit. Singapore's economy also grew faster than expected in the third quarter, further highlighting regional economic diversity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its mega Starship rocket on its 11th test flight, completing a journey halfway around the world and releasing mock satellites. The 403-foot vehicle, the largest and most powerful rocket ever built, thundered into the evening sky from southern Texas, with its booster making a controlled entry into the Gulf of Mexico. The spacecraft then skimmed space before descending into the Indian Ocean, marking another significant success for SpaceX founder Elon Musk's goal of sending people to Mars and for NASA's lunar landing missions.

Trump declared "a new dawn in the Middle East" and the end of the Gaza war, despite acknowledging remaining challenges for a lasting peace and the rebuilding efforts ahead.

This legislation was championed by Adrienne Siddens, whose husband was tragically killed by a distracted driver in 2019, highlighting the severe consequences of inattentive driving. The Department of Transportation is now utilizing anonymous smartphone and vehicle data (telematics) to identify distracted driving hot spots, revealing that such incidents may be three times higher than previously reported. This article highlights a proactive approach to road safety, combining new legislation with data-driven strategies to improve public awareness and enforcement in high-risk areas across the state.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation to substantially increase the pay for state prisoners assigned to battle wildfires, raising wages from approximately $1 an hour to the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. This bill, authored by Assemblymember Isaac Bryan, takes effect immediately and is supported by a $10 million budget allocation for incarcerated firefighters' wages. These fire crews are a crucial part of the state's wildfire suppression efforts, performing dangerous tasks like clearing brush and digging containment lines, often earning less than $30 a day previously. This article highlights a significant social justice reform, addressing the historically low wages for this high-risk, voluntary prison work and acknowledging its importance.</p>

          <p>Following the release of all 20 living Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and increased aid to Gaza, the focus now shifts to the subsequent phases of President Trump's peace plan. Major questions remain regarding Gaza's postwar governance, Israel's demand for Hamas to disarm—which the group rejects—and Palestinian demands for statehood, a concept the current Israeli government opposes. Negotiations are crucial but fragile, with Israel hinting at resuming military operations if its demands are unmet. This article details the complex challenges ahead, including the need for an Arab-led international security force and estimated $53 billion for reconstruction in the devastated Palestinian territory.</p>

          <p>The National Cyber-Security Centre (NCSC) is advising organizations to develop offline, paper-based contingency plans for potential cyberattacks, following an increase in "nationally significant" incidents. This recommendation emphasizes "resilience engineering," focusing on building systems that can anticipate, absorb, recover, and adapt from attacks without relying on compromised IT infrastructure. Recent criminal hacks on major retailers like Marks and Spencer, The Co-op, and Jaguar Land Rover caused significant disruption, highlighting the chaos that ensues when computer systems are down. The article underscores the growing threat of cybercrime and the critical need for robust, non-digital preparedness strategies to ensure operational continuity, especially as financially motivated attacks rise.</p>
