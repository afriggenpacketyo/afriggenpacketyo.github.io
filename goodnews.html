          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 08:59:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has confirmed that discussions are underway to form a new political party. This follows the announcement by ex-Labour MP Zarah Sultana that she is leaving the party to co-lead a new left-wing movement with him. Corbyn praised Sultana's decision and stated that the foundations for a "new kind of political party" are taking shape. These talks aim to formalize the group of independent, pro-Gaza MPs coordinated by Corbyn into an official party, potentially to contest local elections next year. The development signals a significant shift on the UK's political left, challenging the current Labour leadership.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 08:54:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Top European Union and German officials have proposed that the EU lead the formation of a new global trade body to function as an alternative to the struggling World Trade Organization (WTO). The initiative, floated by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, addresses the paralysis of the WTO's dispute resolution system, which has been blocked by the U.S. for years. The proposed organization would focus on partnerships with like-minded nations, potentially by joining the CPTPP trade bloc, and would initially exclude the U.S. and China. The goal is to liberalize trade and enforce fair competition rules, though some business groups caution against splintering the global trade system.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump held a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, to celebrate the congressional passage of his massive tax and policy proposal, which he dubbed the “One Big, Beautiful Bill.” He touted the legislation as delivering the largest tax and spending cuts in U.S. history. During the event, Trump also previewed plans for next year's "America 250" celebration, announcing a UFC fight on the White House lawn and a national sporting event for high school athletes. He also referenced recent U.S. strikes on Iran, describing the past two weeks as highly successful for his administration and recounting a conversation where Iranian officials purportedly gave him a respectful warning before a counterstrike.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in northern England have unearthed a collection of unusually large 2,000-year-old Roman shoes at the Magna Roman Fort, part of the Hadrian's Wall World Heritage Site. Eight of the discovered shoes are over 30cm long, with one measuring nearly 13 inches, equivalent to a modern US size 15. This proportion of large footwear is significantly higher than at other Roman sites, puzzling researchers. The shoes were found preserved in an old defensive ditch, which the Romans often used as a garbage dump. Scientists are now investigating which military regiments were stationed at Magna to understand why so many large-footed individuals might have been present there.</p>

          <p>Recently surfaced images of a prototype of China's J-20A stealth fighter have sparked speculation that the advanced aircraft will be officially unveiled at a major military parade on September 3. The parade will commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. The new photos show a J-20A variant with modified engine air intakes, known as diverterless supersonic inlets (DSI), which are optimized for the more powerful, domestically produced WS-15 engines. These design changes are expected to enhance the fighter's stealth capabilities and aerodynamic performance, representing a significant advancement in China's military aviation technology.</p>

          <h2>Essay: A Modern Reading of Virginia Woolf's 'A Room of One's Own'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 07:31:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay explores a contemporary feminist reading of Virginia Woolf's seminal work, "A Room of One's Own." The author recounts her initial reluctance to read the book, viewing it as a symbol of exclusionary white feminism, but later found a deep connection with Woolf's arguments about the necessity of financial and personal independence for women's creativity. The article draws parallels between Woolf's 1928 observations and today's world, noting persistent issues like the gender pay gap and the dismissal of women's stories. While acknowledging the book's historical limitations, the author argues that Woolf's core ideas about economic control and intellectual freedom remain profoundly relevant and intersectional.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This historical essay argues that the Continental Army, under George Washington's command, played a crucial role in building the foundations of a unified American identity during the Revolutionary War. Before the war, the colonies were disparate and competitive, lacking a shared culture. The army created this identity by establishing national symbols like a new flag, replacing the King's birthday with celebrations for Washington, and fostering a sense of shared purpose through common hardship and sacrifice. After the war, veterans continued this nation-building project through organizations like the Society of the Cincinnati and by advocating for a strong federal government, believing it essential to preserve the republic they fought to create.</p>

Jefferson expresses support for Dutch citizens demanding rights against their rulers, noting that nearly all who are able to bear arms are joining the cause. The document provides a unique insight into Jefferson's views on armed citizenry as a check on autocratic power, linking the American Revolution to broader democratic fervor.
