          <h2>Sex Therapist Identifies Four Common Obstacles to Relationship Intimacy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 09:57:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychotherapist and sex therapist with over two decades of experience outlines four common but often overlooked factors that can damage intimacy in a relationship. The article identifies excessive phone use, unresolved feelings about ex-partners, a persistent negativity bias, and unmanaged stress as key intimacy blockers. It suggests that intimacy is about more than physical connection, emphasizing vulnerability, honesty, and open communication. The therapist provides practical advice for couples to address these issues, such as setting screen-free zones and reframing negative thoughts.</p>

          <p>A communication coach and former journalist advises against using phrases like "I've been there" when trying to empathize with someone, as it can shift the focus away from their experience. Instead, the article recommends four techniques for showing genuine empathy and support. These include being fully present with open body language, repeating a key word the person used to encourage deeper reflection, embracing silence to allow space for thought, and using the phrase "Tell me more" to foster curiosity and deeper sharing. These methods help the speaker feel truly heard and understood, strengthening the connection.</p>

          <h2>Bitcoin Price Surpasses $120,000, Reaching New Record High</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 09:35:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged past $120,000 to set a new all-time high, driven by significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and anticipation of new U.S. crypto legislation. The rally is attributed to increased institutional buying, with analysts suggesting this trend could push the price even higher in the near future. This market movement coincides with the U.S. House of Representatives beginning deliberations on a series of crypto-focused bills, dubbed 'Crypto Week,' aimed at creating a clearer regulatory framework for the digital asset industry.

          <p>The British government has launched a public consultation to explore the future of the state-owned Post Office, including the possibility of a mutual ownership model run by its postmasters. The move is part of an effort to create a "fresh vision" and restore trust following the Horizon IT scandal, which led to the wrongful conviction of hundreds of sub-postmasters. While the government does not plan to reduce the current network of 11,500 branches, it is seeking input on alternative structures like a charter model. The consultation will also consider expanding services, particularly banking.</p>

Speaking during an NBA Summer League broadcast, Hield explained he was "a little disappointed" upon learning from his tour guide that Maximus, the protagonist from the movie "Gladiator," was not a real historical figure. Hield admitted he had been excitedly shouting the character's name inside the ancient amphitheater before being corrected. The lighthearted anecdote caught the attention of fans online, providing a moment of levity during the sports event.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old inmate who staged a daring escape from a prison near Lyon, France, has been recaptured by authorities. The man escaped by hiding inside a large bag that belonged to his cellmate, who was being released after completing his sentence. The escape, which officials called an "extremely rare event" resulting from "serious dysfunctions," prompted a widespread investigation. The man was found and arrested early Monday morning as he was leaving a cellar in a nearby commune; his accomplice remains at large.</p>

          <p>Following learning disruptions from the pandemic, some experts are exploring specialized "brain training" programs to improve children's cognitive skills like working memory and attention. A recent German study suggested a 12-hour program improved focus and academic outcomes, but other researchers urge caution, pointing to inconclusive evidence from larger-scale trials. Critics argue that these programs may not generalize to real-world skills and could displace valuable time for curriculum-based learning. The debate highlights the ongoing challenge of finding effective, evidence-based methods to address educational gaps in schools.</p>

The 1995 treaty aims to keep the region free of nuclear weapons while permitting civilian nuclear energy programs. Malaysia, the current ASEAN chair, announced that China has committed to signing the treaty without reservation, and there are indications that Russia may follow suit.

Future policy adjustments will be based on close monitoring of domestic and international economic conditions.
