          <p>Cognac producers in France are facing multiple challenges, including tariffs from China and the US, as well as the effects of climate change. The tariffs have significantly reduced exports to China, impacting the industry. Climate change is affecting grape quality, with grapes ripening earlier and becoming sweeter, which is not ideal for cognac production. Despite these challenges, many family-run businesses are carrying on the tradition, adapting to the changing environment and seeking new markets.</p>

          <p>Water voles are nearly extinct in Wales, prompting conservationists to use edible glitter to track them. The glitter is added to their food, allowing researchers to identify their droppings and monitor their movements. Nature Conservation Cymru hopes to use this data to improve the voles' habitat and increase their chances of survival. The team is testing the method on captive-bred voles before applying it in the wild, with early signs indicating the voles are consuming the glitter.</p>
