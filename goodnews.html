          <h2>Japan's Core Inflation Eases in June Amid Declining Rice Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 23:13:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate slowed to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, aligning with economists' expectations as soaring rice prices began to ease. Despite the cooling, this marks the 39th consecutive month that inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, with underlying price pressures persisting. The government's release of rice stockpiles has helped moderate prices, but economists remain cautious due to the yen's depreciation and potential U.S. tariffs. These economic concerns loom as the country approaches an Upper House election with political uncertainty for the ruling coalition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Therapists Note Differences in How Male and Female Patients Approach Mental Health</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 22:31:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collection of observations from therapists highlights perceived general differences between their male and female patients' approaches to therapy and emotional expression. According to the anecdotes, male patients often take longer to open up but then do so suddenly, may frame issues in practical terms, and sometimes apologize for having emotions. Conversely, female patients were noted to be more open initially, express more self-criticism, and may apologize for crying. The therapists suggest these patterns are likely influenced by societal conditioning rather than inherent gender traits, with both groups ultimately seeking to be heard and understood.</p>

        </div>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has acknowledged that European nations have historically been "free-riders" on U.S. defense and security spending, but stated they are now committed to increasing their own contributions. In an interview, Merz emphasized that Russia poses a significant threat not just to Ukraine but to the entire European order, necessitating a stronger, more independent European defense capability. He also mentioned being on good terms with President Trump, coordinating on the war in Ukraine and trade issues. The comments come as Germany, the UK, and France work to strengthen a trilateral alliance.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people across all 50 U.S. states participated in over 1,500 protests and rallies on the fifth anniversary of Congressman John Lewis's death. The "Good Trouble Lives On" day of action was organized to protest the Trump administration's policies while honoring Lewis's legacy of civil disobedience and advocacy for voting rights. The events, which included marches, vigils, and voter registration drives, demanded an end to crackdowns on civil rights and the targeting of minority groups. Organizers framed the day as a continuation of Lewis's call to speak up and act against injustice.</p>

          <p>During the first round of The Open Championship, professional golfer Jon Rahm became audibly frustrated with a spectator after a poor tee shot on the 10th hole. Rahm claimed someone in the gallery whistled during his backswing, a distraction he called out immediately after his shot landed in the rough. He later downplayed the incident to the media, attributing his emotional reaction to the "bad timing" of the noise on a difficult hole combined with wind and rain. Rahm admitted his reaction was partly to release tension, acknowledging that it was also a "bad swing" on his part.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after noting mild swelling in his lower legs. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described CVI as a benign and common condition for his age, stating that tests found no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis. A letter from the presidential physician confirmed the diagnosis and reiterated that the president "remains in excellent health." The announcement addresses recent public speculation that arose from images showing Trump with swollen legs and a bruised hand.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on social media that Coca-Cola has agreed to begin producing its signature soda with cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup, a move he championed as making the product "just better!" The announcement, which the company has not fully detailed, follows a pattern of Trump seeking populist wins and aligns with a "Make America healthy again" theme, also promoted by officials like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. However, health experts point out that from a metabolic standpoint, cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup are nearly identical. The change is seen more as a branding and taste preference move than a significant public health victory.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the current TSA restrictions on liquids in carry-on baggage may be changing soon. Speaking at a conference, Noem said she is questioning "everything TSA does" and that the rules on liquid sizes could be the next major announcement, though she did not provide specific details or a timeline. This follows her recent decision to eliminate the requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during standard security screening. The potential change is linked to the deployment of new CT scanners in airports, which provide more detailed 3-D images of bag contents.</p>

          <p>Members of the U.S. Congress set aside partisan divisions for the annual Congressional Women's Softball Game, where a single, bipartisan "Team Congress" plays against a team of journalists. The event, co-founded in 2009 by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz after her own diagnosis, raises money for the Young Survival Coalition, a charity supporting young adults with breast cancer. This year's game brought together players like Republican Rep. Kimberlyn King-Hinds, whose family has been affected by the disease, and survivor Marcella Powell, who traveled from Florida. The event highlights a rare moment of unity on Capitol Hill, having raised nearly $5 million for the cause.</p>

          <p>This week's film releases feature a variety of genres, including several with notable Latino talent. The new "I Know What You Did Last Summer" is described as a self-aware and ironic take that is superior to the 1997 original but ultimately not memorable. Ari Aster's "Eddington," starring Joaquin Phoenix and Pedro Pascal, is a pandemic-era neo-western that realistically explores a divided America through the lens of a conservative sheriff and a progressive mayor. Other releases reviewed include Albert Serra's graphic bullfighting documentary "Tardes de soledad" and two distinct LGBTQ+ dramas, "Before We Forget" and "Unicorns."</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old from Colchester, Essex, has fully immersed himself in the culture of the 1940s, a passion that grew from his childhood interest in World War II history. The teenager, named Lincoln, exclusively wears clothing from the era, listens to its music, and even rides a 1939 bicycle. He is drawn to what he describes as the period's elegance and strong sense of community, particularly during the war. His passion extends to his job at a 1940s-themed tea room, where his knowledge and style are adored by customers, and he hopes to one day decorate his own home entirely with antiques from the era.</p>

          <p>An ice core, potentially the oldest ever recovered at over 1.5 million years old, has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey in the UK for analysis. Scientists will carefully melt the cylinder, which was drilled from deep within the Antarctic ice sheet, to study the ancient air bubbles, dust, and volcanic ash trapped inside. This research aims to unlock vital information about Earth's climate history from a previously unknown period, particularly a mysterious planetary change called the Mid-Pleistocene Transition. The findings could revolutionize our understanding of climate change and help predict how our planet will respond to current warming.</p>

          <p>Shoppers in the UK using "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services will face stricter affordability checks under new regulations set to take effect next July. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) plans will require BNPL providers like Klarna and Clearpay to ensure customers can afford the repayments, which may result in some shoppers being denied credit. The move aims to protect consumers from accumulating excessive debt and provide them with rights similar to other forms of credit, such as access to the Financial Ombudsman. Debt charities have welcomed the new rules, citing a rise in people using BNPL to cover essential bills. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's women's national football team advanced to the Euro 2025 semifinals after a chaotic and dramatic penalty shootout win against Sweden. The shootout was a rollercoaster of emotions, featuring multiple saves from both goalkeepers, missed targets, and a crucial conversion by England's Lucy Bronze. Goalkeeper Hannah Hampton made two key saves, while Sweden's own keeper saved three penalties before missing her own attempt from the spot. The tense victory, which Bronze described as both "overwhelming and underwhelming," keeps the Lionesses' tournament hopes alive after a hard-fought match.</p>
