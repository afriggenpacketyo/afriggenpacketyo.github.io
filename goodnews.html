          <p>President Trump announced that Iran and Israel have agreed to a ceasefire, potentially ending a period of heightened conflict following US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. While neither Israel nor Iran has definitively confirmed the ceasefire, White House officials are touting it as a diplomatic breakthrough. The announcement followed Iranian missile attacks on a US base in Qatar, which reportedly caused no casualties or damage due to successful interception. Trump warned of a strong American response to any Iranian attacks on US interests before the ceasefire agreement.</p>

          <p>Following the announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, Republican lawmakers have lauded President Trump's negotiating skills, while Democrats are withholding congratulations. Trump announced the agreement on Truth Social, claiming a complete ceasefire after a 12-day conflict. Republicans praised Trump's foreign policy expertise, while Democrats, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, criticized the president for unilaterally engaging in war without congressional approval. Representative Thomas Massie, who had been pushing for a resolution requiring congressional approval before attacking Iran, stated that he would not advance the measure further due to the ceasefire.</p>
