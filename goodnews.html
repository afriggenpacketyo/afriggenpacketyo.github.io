Around 60 scouts, ranging from elementary to middle school age, plucked the plums from the shrine's 1,500 plum trees. The harvested plums will be pickled and dried to become Ofuku Ume, a traditional treat enjoyed on New Year's Day for good health and to ward off illness.

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has pledged that the UK will meet a new NATO target to spend 5% of its GDP on national security by 2035. The spending will be divided between core defense (3.5%) and defense-related areas like resilience and security (1.5%). This commitment aims to address concerns from US President Donald Trump while providing flexibility for EU countries. The government's National Security Strategy emphasizes the need for competitiveness in science, education, and technology, with the promise of new jobs and economic benefits.

          <p>NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, was established in 1949 to deter Soviet expansion in Europe after World War II. The alliance operates as a collective security organization, with Article 5 stating that an attack on one member is an attack on all. Russia's war against Ukraine has renewed NATO's purpose and strategic relevance. Several former Warsaw Pact countries have joined NATO, and Ukraine's ambition to join has intensified amid the ongoing conflict. NATO's open-door policy allows any European country to join if it can contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area.</p>

          <p>Global equities showed muted gains following President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, indicating a market potentially desensitized by American policymaking. The MSCI World index saw a slight increase, and U.S. futures also rose marginally. Analysts suggest that the market's muted response is due to fatigue with Trump's policy changes and the subdued Iranian response to U.S. strikes. The wild swings in tariff policy earlier in the year have diminished, leading to less market reaction to subsequent changes. The article examines the factors influencing market sentiment in the face of geopolitical events. (not investment advice)</p>
