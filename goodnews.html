          <p>People's Daily, a state media outlet in China, cautioned against local authorities implementing excessively strict austerity measures that hinder daily life and local economies. This warning comes a month after Beijing initiated its latest austerity campaign aimed at curbing corruption and wasteful spending. The commentary criticized some localities for equating the prohibition of illegal dining and drinking with a ban on all eating and drinking, which harms businesses and diminishes the vibrancy of everyday life. Beijing's austerity push includes measures like banning expensive dishes and extravagant decorations at official events, with central guidance teams dispatched to reinforce the message nationwide. The article suggests that overzealous enforcement stems from lazy governance and formalism, impacting citizens and businesses negatively. The current situation may require future adjustments to the current austerity campaign to improve the lives of citizens. </p>

          <p>Staff Sgt. Garrett Butts is leading an Army team in developing smarter, cheaper unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) in-house to cut procurement costs and timelines. The team is building 3D-printed drones and testing low-cost, first-person view aircraft to provide soldiers with enhanced situational awareness and more accurate strike capabilities. One of the biggest challenges has been navigating strict procurement rules to legally obtain the necessary drone components, which took nine months to resolve. Butts believes drones give U.S. troops a major advantage, allowing infantry units to look over obstacles and deliver targeted strikes cost-effectively. The Army must work closely with the private sector and integrate artificial intelligence to further enhance drone capabilities and reduce the need for extensive operator training.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's policy of requiring passports to reflect only the applicant's gender at birth. Judge Julia Kobick ruled that the policy likely violates the constitutional rights of transgender Americans by discriminating on the basis of sex. The ruling extends a previous injunction to include all transgender and non-binary U.S. citizens needing passport services. The policy, initiated under former President Joe Biden, allowed individuals identifying as non-binary, intersex, or gender non-conforming to select an 'X' gender marker. The Trump administration argued that the policy did not violate equal protection guarantees, but the court disagreed. The White House claimed the ruling was an attempt to thwart President Trump's agenda and push radical gender ideology.</p>

          <p>NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, was established in 1949 to deter Soviet expansion in Europe and foster political integration on the continent. The alliance operates as a collective security organization, with Article 5 of its charter stating that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all. In response to NATO, the Soviet Union created the Warsaw Pact in 1955, but the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 led to several former Warsaw Pact countries joining NATO. NATO's open-door policy allows any European country that can enhance the security of the North Atlantic area to join, with Ukraine's ambition to join gaining pace amidst the ongoing war with Russia. Russia views Ukraine joining NATO as a red line, highlighting the alliance's continued relevance in contemporary geopolitics.</p>

          <p>The Senate and House are considering changes to the child tax credit as part of President Donald Trump's spending bill. The Senate bill proposes permanently increasing the credit to $2,200 starting in 2025, indexing it for inflation thereafter. The House bill suggests boosting the credit to $2,500 from 2025 through 2028, then dropping it to $2,000 and indexing it for inflation. Some policy experts argue that the changes would primarily benefit middle and upper-income families. The final provision may change before Trump signs the package into law, with the ultimate outcome remaining uncertain.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that endangered sharks, rays, and native oysters could thrive in warmer UK waters as species shift habitats due to rising ocean temperatures. Researchers at the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change in UK seas. Many creatures could find new homes in parts of the North Sea predicted to become biodiversity hotspots within the next 50 years. However, some species, like the ocean quahog, may struggle to adapt, potentially impacting ecosystems and food chains. The analysis should help the government ensure Marine Protected Areas continue to protect species as their habitats change.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain its current interest rate policy, defying pressure from President Trump to cut rates. The Fed's decision reflects a wait-and-see approach amid uncertainty surrounding tariffs and their potential impact on the U.S. economy. Trump has repeatedly criticized the Fed and Chair Jerome Powell for not lowering rates more aggressively. The Fed is guided by a dual mandate to control inflation and maximize employment, but faces challenges in navigating the potential for stagflation caused by tariffs. Recent data shows inflation remains near its lowest level since 2021, while hiring has slowed but remains sturdy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Boeing's Turbo Sjogren is advocating for Europe to decrease its reliance on China for critical minerals, mirroring similar efforts in the United States. Sjogren emphasized the importance of a global aerospace supply chain, highlighting that no single entity can be entirely self-sufficient. He noted that both US and European programs will continue to rely on significant content from each other, regardless of sovereignty concerns. Sjogren pointed out that US legislation since 1973 has required the aerospace industry and defense sector to avoid dependence on countries like China for critical materials.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi told President Donald Trump that the ceasefire between India and Pakistan was achieved through direct talks between the militaries, not through US mediation. Modi clarified that India has never accepted third-party mediation and will not do so in the future. The phone call, lasting over half an hour, addressed Trump's previous claims of US involvement in brokering the ceasefire. Modi emphasized that India considers cross-border terrorism as an act of war. Trump reportedly understood Modi's points and extended his support to counter terrorism.</p>

          <h2>Companies Employ 'Tariff Engineering' to Avoid Higher Duties</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 03:56:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to reduce duty liabilities amid rising tariffs. This involves altering an item's materials or dimensions to fit into a different harmonized system code with lower tariff rates. Although most new tariffs are broad-based, exemptions for certain products provide opportunities for companies to benefit through strategic design choices. The practice, which is not inherently illegal, allows companies to leverage product design to create different products subject to different tariff classifications and duty rates. Companies have to tread a fine line between redesigning their products and fraudulently misrepresenting product classifications. (not investment advice)</p>
