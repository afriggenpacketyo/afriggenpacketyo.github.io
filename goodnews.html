          <p>The Japan Shogi Association named Ichiyo Shimizu as its first female chief in its 101-year history, aiming to encourage greater participation from young people and women in the traditional board game. Shimizu, a professional shogi player, succeeds Yoshiharu Habu as president for a two-year term, expressing her commitment to invigorating the shogi industry while preserving its traditions. The association also approved a new promotional rule to support women in becoming pros. Shimizu turned pro in 1985 and has won 43 championships in the women's league, holding the rank of seventh dan. This marks a significant step towards inclusivity in the traditionally male-dominated world of shogi.</p>

          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief and convicted killer known as the ‚ÄúDevil in the Ozarks,‚Äù was captured near the Arkansas prison he escaped from after a 13-day manhunt. Hardin, who was serving lengthy sentences for murder and sexual assault, escaped by impersonating a corrections officer. The search involved bloodhounds, officers on horseback, drones, and helicopters, with a border patrol team joining the effort. Hardin pleaded guilty in 2017 to first-degree murder and his DNA was matched to a 1997 sexual assault, leading to additional sentencing. His recapture brings relief to the community and ends a period of heightened alert.</p>

While some attribute the name to a substitute for rabbit meat, Graves finds no historical evidence supporting this. The dish evolved from melted cheese dishes and became popular across social classes in Wales. Despite its name, Welsh rarebit remains a cherished part of Welsh culinary heritage.</p>
