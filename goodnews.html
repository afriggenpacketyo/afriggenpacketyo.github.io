          <p>England's cricket team has named 22-year-old fast bowler Sonny Baker in the squad for his international debut in the first one-day match against South Africa. Baker's inclusion follows an impressive performance in The Hundred tournament, where he showcased high-speed bowling that caught the attention of team captain Harry Brook. This selection is part of England's strategy to build a new team dynamic for the 2027 50-over World Cup, integrating emerging talent with experienced players like Joe Root and Jofra Archer. The team is looking to establish a new era under Brook's leadership after several disappointing global events.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's leader, William Lai Ching-te, has appointed two younger officials, Lii Wen and Chao Yi-hsiang, as deputy secretaries general of the National Security Council. This move is seen as an effort to bring fresh perspectives to the council as Taiwan navigates complex relations with Beijing and potential shifts in U.S. policy. The appointments follow a drop in approval ratings for Lai and his Democratic Progressive Party, particularly among young voters. By blending veteran experience with younger figures adept at handling modern global challenges, the administration aims to bolster its national security strategy.</p>

          <p>England has launched the final phase of its largest-ever expansion of government-funded childcare, offering 30 hours of weekly support to working parents of children aged nine months to four years. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed the move as a landmark moment that will save eligible families thousands of pounds annually and ease financial pressures. However, the rollout faces significant challenges, as parents report long waiting lists and nurseries struggle with staff shortages. Some providers are also adding extra charges for consumables to cover funding shortfalls, leading to confusion about what the 'free' hours actually cover.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has initiated a significant shake-up of his Downing Street staff, aiming to establish clearer structures and improve government efficiency. The reshuffle includes creating the new role of Chief Secretary to the Prime Minister, filled by Darren Jones, to give Starmer more direct command over policy implementation. This move is an implicit acknowledgment that the first year of his premiership has not gone as planned and signals a renewed focus on economic policy ahead of the autumn Budget. The changes are designed to streamline decision-making and ensure the government can effectively deliver on its key priorities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ScotRail, the government-owned rail operator in Scotland, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares, making weekday travel significantly cheaper for many commuters. The move, which follows a year-long pilot program, is intended to encourage more people to use trains instead of cars, with fares on some key routes like Edinburgh to Glasgow falling by nearly 50%. The Scottish government expects the policy to cost between £40 million and £45 million annually, an investment aimed at promoting public transport and providing financial relief to passengers. The initiative simplifies the ticketing system and aims to grow the commuter base.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United has finalized a deal to acquire Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp for an initial fee of £18.1 million. The 23-year-old is set to sign a five-year contract, with the club viewing him as a promising talent for the future. This signing addresses ongoing goalkeeping issues at the club, following errors from current keepers Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana. The move signals United's intent to strengthen its defensive lineup and brings an end to their previous interest in Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez, providing a fresh option to bolster the team's stability in goal.</p>

          <p>South Korea's defense ministry has halted its 'Voice of Freedom' propaganda radio broadcasts into North Korea as a measure to ease military tensions on the peninsula. This is the latest de-escalation step taken by the administration of President Lee Jae Myung, which has also stopped using loudspeakers at the border. The broadcasts, which have been on and off since 1962, provided North Koreans with outside information and cultural content like K-pop music, which is strictly controlled by Pyongyang. Despite these goodwill gestures, North Korea has so far shown little interest in improving relations with the South.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Taipei, U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, head of the Senate Armed Services Committee, emphasized America's commitment to Taiwan, referring to it as a 'free country' with the 'right to remain free.' Wicker and fellow Republican Senator Deb Fischer met with Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te to understand the island's needs and reiterate U.S. support amid increasing military pressure from China. Beijing, which claims Taiwan as its territory, strongly condemned the visit and the senator's remarks, calling them a serious violation of the one-China principle. The visit underscores the delicate diplomatic balance the U.S. maintains in the region.</p>

          <p>Newcastle has reached a £55 million agreement with Brentford to sign forward Yoane Wissa, following the player's public request to leave the club. The deal, which includes an initial £50 million fee plus add-ons, came after Brentford rejected two previous offers. The move is crucial for Newcastle as they seek to strengthen their attack, especially with striker Alexander Isak set to complete a record-breaking transfer to Liverpool. Wissa, who turns 29 this week, is seen as a proven Premier League talent who can help fill the offensive void for the Magpies.</p>

          <p>A former Macy's parking structure at the once-iconic Westside Pavilion mall in Los Angeles has been transformed into a 201-unit luxury apartment complex. The project reflects a broader trend of repurposing 'dead malls,' which have struggled due to the rise of e-commerce and changing consumer habits. The new complex, named Overland & Ayres, offers high-end amenities and is situated next to the main mall building, which is being converted into a major research center by UCLA. This redevelopment highlights how developers are adapting large-scale retail spaces to meet modern demands for housing and specialized commercial use.</p>

          <p>Over 600 employees at Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon national parks have voted overwhelmingly to unionize, a move spurred by mass firings and budget cuts under the Trump administration. Staffers, including rangers, firefighters, and biologists, will now be represented by the National Federation of Federal Employees. Workers cite rock-bottom morale, fear for their job security, low pay, and poor living conditions as key reasons for organizing. The unionization effort reflects growing unrest among a depleted federal workforce tasked with managing record numbers of visitors at some of the nation's most celebrated natural landmarks.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a writer describes the profound shift in daily life after her youngest child leaves for college, marking the end of 27 years of active, in-house parenting. The once-chaotic home is now silent and orderly, a change that brings both relief and a sense of disorientation and loss. The author reflects on how parenthood provides an unintentional structure to life—a constant clock and calendar dictated by school, sports, and family needs. Facing this new chapter requires a conscious effort to create new routines and find purpose in a day that is, for the first time in decades, solely her own.</p>

          <p>Royal Mail has reported its first annual profit since 2022, marking a significant turnaround for the 500-year-old postal service under its new owner, Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky's EP Group. The company posted a £12 million profit for the year, a stark contrast to the £336 million loss from the previous year. This recovery is attributed to cost-cutting measures, such as ending Saturday second-class letter deliveries, and a strategic shift toward the more profitable parcel delivery market. The results represent an important milestone in the company's efforts to modernize and achieve financial stability amid a long-term decline in letter volumes.</p>
