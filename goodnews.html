        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a new plan aimed at accelerating the development of artificial intelligence by removing "bureaucratic red tape." The initiative, shaped by Silicon Valley executives, prioritizes U.S. dominance in the global AI race by streamlining regulations and revamping permits for essential infrastructure like data centers. The plan contrasts with the previous administration's approach by de-emphasizing risks like misinformation and job displacement, instead framing AI as a job creator that will complement human work. It also calls for eliminating DEI and climate change considerations from the national AI risk framework, drawing criticism from civil rights and environmental groups.</p>

          <p>In a pair of significant legal decisions, Kilmar Abrego Garcia has secured favorable rulings in his ongoing cases. A federal judge in Tennessee ordered his release from criminal custody while he awaits trial on human smuggling charges, which he denies. Concurrently, a federal judge in Maryland issued an order preventing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from immediately detaining him upon release and requiring 72 hours' notice for any removal proceedings. The Trump administration, which has labeled Abrego Garcia an MS-13 gang member, criticized the rulings, while his lawyers praised them as a rebuke of "lawless conduct."</p>

He argues that the party's center has become too passive, allowing a vocal minority on the far left to gain outsized influence. Torres, who grew up in public housing, advocates for a pragmatic, results-oriented approach focused on tangible issues like the affordability crisis, rather than just sloganeering. He also touches on the weaponization of foreign policy in domestic politics and the need for Democrats to build a clearer, more forceful governing agenda.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that his administration is considering the elimination of capital gains taxes on the sale of primary residences. Currently, profits from home sales are tax-exempt up to $250,000 for single filers and $500,000 for married couples, with gains above these thresholds subject to tax. The idea follows the introduction of a bill by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene aimed at achieving the same goal. Proponents argue the change would unlock equity for long-term homeowners and address housing shortages, though experts note the proposal could be costly and its congressional support is uncertain.

While some products like aircraft and spirits may receive exemptions or further reductions, the deal would be challenging for sectors like the German auto industry. In case the deal falls through, the EU is preparing significant retaliatory tariffs on up to €100 billion of U.S. imports.</p>
