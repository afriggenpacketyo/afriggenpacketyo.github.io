          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) announced its intention to divide into two separate publicly traded entities by mid-2026, marking a significant shift in the media industry as it adapts to the transition from traditional cable to streaming services. The split will create a streaming and studios company, housing movie properties and HBO Max, and a global networks company, which will include CNN, TNT Sports, and Discovery. CEO David Zaslav will lead the streaming and studios company, while CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels will head the global networks business. This strategic move aims to empower the brands with sharper focus and flexibility to compete effectively in the evolving media landscape. The announcement follows earlier reports of WBD considering such a split and comes as Comcast prepares to spin off its cable networks into a new company. The market responded positively, with Warner Bros. Discovery shares rising over 9% in premarket trading. </p>

          <p>Former Reform UK chairman Zia Yusuf dismissed a controversy surrounding a social media post where he criticized an MP's call for a burka ban as a "storm in a teacup." Yusuf, who initially resigned after criticizing MP Sarah Pochin, later returned to work for the party in a different role. The controversy began when Pochin questioned the Prime Minister about banning the burka, prompting Yusuf's critical post. Yusuf expressed regret over the post, attributing it to exhaustion, and clarified his views on face coverings, suggesting a broader ban rather than one specifically targeting the burka. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage acknowledged the incident as a "speed bump," noting Yusuf's quick regret over the comments. </p>

Cryptocurrency firms have become significant political donors, spending heavily in recent elections to support both Republican and Democratic candidates. The GENIUS Act, aimed at creating a regulatory structure for stablecoins, has garnered bipartisan support, although some Democrats are pushing for amendments to prevent Trump and his family from profiting from stablecoins.

The show has special resonance in Argentina, where the comic has near mythic status due to its political undertones and the tragic disappearance of its writer, H√©ctor Germ√°n Oesterheld, during a military dictatorship. </p>

          <h2>Can the Angels' Offense Be Saved? Mike Trout's Return Provides Hope</h2>

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels' offense has struggled, ranking near the bottom of MLB in batting average and on-base percentage. While the team showed signs of improvement during an eight-game winning streak, they have since regressed. Manager Ron Washington and hitting coach Johnny Washington are working to simplify approaches and capitalize on players' strengths. The return of Mike Trout from injury has provided a boost, but the Angels still need more consistent production from other players to close the gap in the AL West. </p>

          <h2>UK Proposes Expansion of Ocean Bottom Trawling Ban</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 06:42:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has proposed extending a ban on destructive ocean bottom trawling across English waters, increasing the protected area from 18,000km2 to 48,000km2. The proposal aims to safeguard rare marine animals and the seabed they depend on and is subject to a 12-week industry consultation. The announcement coincides with a UN Ocean Conference in France, where Sir David Attenborough warned against the damaging effects of bottom trawling. The proposed extension would cover 41 of England's 181 Marine Protected Areas, but some fishing communities argue that bottom trawling is not destructive when done responsibly. </p>
