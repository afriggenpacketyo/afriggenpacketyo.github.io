          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 23:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba Cloud has developed Aegaeon, a computing pooling solution that reportedly cut Nvidia GPU usage by 82% for its AI models. Beta-tested in Alibaba Cloud’s marketplace, the system reduced the need for H20 GPUs from 1,192 to 213 for dozens of models. This innovation addresses resource inefficiency in serving concurrent large language model (LLM) workloads, where many GPUs are underutilized. Researchers from Peking University and Alibaba Cloud presented these findings, highlighting Aegaeon's potential to optimize AI infrastructure costs.</p>

          <p>A popular Chinese spy drama, "Silent Honour," has inspired an outpouring of public praise and visits to the tomb of a real-life agent, Wu Shi, in Beijing. Wu, an underground Communist Party member, was a Kuomintang lieutenant general in Taiwan who was executed in 1950. The show's narrative, focusing on "unsung heroes" like Wu, has led to a "sudden surge" of visitors leaving flowers and thank-you notes at his grave. This cultural phenomenon highlights a growing appreciation for intelligence figures in China.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Bill Ackman has intensified his involvement in the New York City mayoral race, publicly urging Republican Curtis Sliwa to drop out. Ackman argues that Sliwa's continued candidacy is significantly boosting democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani's chances of victory, citing prediction market data. Ackman, a supporter of independent candidate Andrew Cuomo, believes a two-person race would be more competitive. Sliwa's campaign, however, rejects donor influence, insisting voters, not billionaires, should decide the outcome.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is developing an ecosystem to solidify its role as a leading offshore yuan trading center, offering easier and cheaper yuan borrowing schemes. Measures like the new Renminbi Bond Fund (RBF) and expanded direct investment schemes aim to encourage international use of the Chinese currency. These initiatives provide mainland firms with yuan loans for overseas investment and foreign firms with yuan funding for mainland expansion. Hong Kong dollar interest rates are currently more than double those of mainland yuan loan rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump signed a proclamation imposing 25% tariffs on imported medium- and heavy-duty trucks and their parts, along with 10% tariffs on imported buses. This move aims to protect U.S. companies from foreign competition and incentivize domestic manufacturing. The administration will offer credits to manufacturers who import some parts but assemble vehicles in the U.S., offsetting tariff liabilities. Officials state the program is designed to ensure American labor and domestic production remain cost-competitive and expand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli had a brief vocal stumble during an impromptu performance of "Time to Say Goodbye" in the Oval Office for President Donald Trump. The Grammy-nominated singer good-naturedly acknowledged the missed note, captured in a video shared by a Trump administration advisor. Bocelli is scheduled to return to the White House for a performance on December 5, preceding a concert in Washington, D.C. This event follows past reports of Bocelli opting out of a Trump inauguration performance to avoid backlash.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Liu Huaqing, the former commander of the Chinese navy, revered as a strategist and technocrat who modernized China’s naval forces. Often compared to American strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan, Liu's vision transformed the PLA Navy to world-class standards. Born in 1916, he joined the Red Army at 13, participated in the Long March, and later transferred to the nascent PLA Navy in 1952, marking his first encounter with the sea. His career highlights his profound influence on China's "blue sea strategy."</p>

          <p>India's traditional Diwali gold rush is seeing a shift this year, with soaring gold prices influencing buying habits. While demand for jewelry is slightly dented, a "fear of missing out" (FOMO) is driving more customers, leading to jewelers innovating with lighter, elaborate designs. A clear trend shows more gold and silver being bought for investment rather than solely jewelry, reflected in bullion market data and record high inflows into ETFs and digital gold. The Reserve Bank of India is also significantly influencing prices by diversifying its foreign exchange holdings with gold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. has experienced a remarkable 25% drop in fatal drug overdoses in 2024, largely attributed to enhanced harm reduction strategies against fentanyl. States like North Carolina, with a 35% decrease, are leading efforts through programs like law enforcement assisted diversion (LEAD), which steers users towards recovery and support. Medication-assisted treatments like methadone and widespread naloxone availability are proving critical in saving lives and reducing cravings. While challenges remain, including disparities in decrease rates among different populations, these interventions offer significant hope in combating the epidemic.</p>

The order prohibits LAPD officers from targeting journalists with crowd control weapons during protests. The council voted 12-0 against the city attorney's motion, which argued the ban was overly broad and jeopardized public safety. This strong stance follows numerous legal claims against the city for excessive force during protests and reflects growing council frustration over legal payouts and the city attorney's independent litigation actions.</p>
