          <p>The Washington Post reports that the White House National Security Council has instructed US agencies to suspend participation in this year's G20 conference in South Africa. This decision follows Donald Trump's false claim that South Africa is carrying out a "genocide" against white citizens and his declaration that he would boycott the summit unless the situation is addressed. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa stated that the group who ostensibly left the country opposed policies aimed at addressing racial inequality. The G20 comprises 19 countries with the world's largest economies, along with the African Union and the European Union.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Shara, marking the first meeting between leaders of the United States and Syria in 25 years. This meeting occurred a day after Trump announced plans to lift sanctions on Syria, a move aimed at easing the economic strain on the war-torn nation. Trump urged al-Shara to normalize relations with Israel and remove foreign terrorists from Syria. The meeting was facilitated by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia and included a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, both of whom supported lifting the sanctions.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom faces a healthcare crisis as costs spiral out of control due to Medicaid initiatives, including expanding coverage to immigrants without legal status. The state borrowed $3.4 billion to pay for Medi-Cal, and Newsom is contemplating rolling back coverage and benefits. Polling shows tepid support for providing healthcare to immigrants without legal status, complicating Newsom's political tightrope. Lawmakers are considering freezing enrollment or imposing cost-sharing measures, with Newsom proposing an enrollment freeze in 2026 and a monthly premium in 2027.</p>

          <p>US drug overdose deaths experienced the largest one-year decline ever recorded in 2024, with an estimated 80,000 deaths, a 27% decrease from 110,000 in 2023. The CDC has been collecting comparable data for 45 years, and this drop is unprecedented. Experts attribute the decline to increased availability of naloxone, expanded addiction treatment, and shifts in drug use patterns. Despite the decline, overdose deaths remain higher than pre-pandemic levels, underscoring the need for continued efforts and vigilance.</p>

Comedians are likely to be "the obvious frontrunners to go the distance", says Susie Masterson, a psychotherapist registered with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP).
