          <h2>Vinyl Records Exempt from US Tariffs Amidst Resurgence Driven by Taylor Swift and Gen Z</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-03 07:55:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Physical music formats like vinyl records, CDs, and cassettes are protected from recent U.S. tariff rollbacks due to a Cold War-era law called the Berman Amendment. This exemption prevents presidents from regulating the flow of "informational materials," which has been a significant relief for the rapidly growing vinyl industry. The resurgence in vinyl sales, largely fueled by Gen Z's interest in physical media and collecting variants from artists like Taylor Swift, accounts for nearly three-quarters of all physical music revenue. While consumers and record labels benefit from stable prices, some American manufacturers argue that tariffs would bolster domestic production and create more U.S. jobs in the sector.</p>

          <p>Dame Sarah Mullally has been named the next Archbishop of Canterbury, becoming the first woman to hold the most senior position in the Church of England. A former Chief Nursing Officer for the NHS, Mullally was ordained in 2006 and has served as the Bishop of London since 2018. Her appointment marks a historic moment nearly 500 years after the Church's establishment and follows the resignation of Justin Welby over a safeguarding scandal. In her first public statement, she condemned the recent synagogue attack in Manchester and emphasized the Church's role in standing against antisemitism. The appointment has been welcomed by political leaders but criticized by conservative Anglican groups.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos stated that while the artificial intelligence sector is currently experiencing an "industrial bubble," the underlying technology is real and will ultimately deliver significant benefits to society. Speaking at Italian Tech Week, Bezos explained that during such bubbles, stock prices often disconnect from business fundamentals, and both good and bad ideas receive funding as investors struggle to differentiate between them. Despite the speculative excitement, he emphasized that AI's transformative potential is not in doubt. He asserted that the technology is poised to fundamentally change every industry, suggesting its long-term impact will be substantial despite the current market froth.</p>

          <p>Financial personality Dave Ramsey advised a 51-year-old Arkansas mother with no retirement savings that it is still possible to accumulate a substantial nest egg. He calculated that by investing 15% of her income from age 51 to 70, she could potentially save between $600,000 and $800,000, especially by taking advantage of her employer's 401(k) match. This advice addresses a common fear among many Americans, as polls show that only half of those with retirement accounts feel confident in their savings. For those starting late, experts recommend determining a retirement goal, maximizing catch-up contributions, investing for growth in diversified stock funds, and potentially delaying retirement to allow investments more time to compound.

While acknowledging Bellingham's desire to be included and the strong form of Foden and Grealish, the manager emphasized that he wanted to reward the existing squad. The only change was Bukayo Saka replacing the injured Noni Madueke, signaling Tuchel's focus on team cohesion over individual star power.</p>

          <p>China's extended "super golden week" holiday has started with a massive surge in domestic travel, signaling a positive development for the country's efforts to boost consumer spending. On the first day of the holiday, railway travel set a new single-day record, and tickets for many popular tourist destinations were completely sold out. Major transport hubs like Guangzhou South Station also reported record passenger numbers. According to the Ministry of Transport, waterway and air travel saw significant year-on-year increases, while road travel also edged up slightly. This strong start to the holiday period provides a welcome boost to China's tourism sector and overall economy.</p>

          <p>OnePay, the financial technology company majority-owned by retail giant Walmart, is set to integrate cryptocurrency services into its mobile banking application. According to sources, the firm will allow customers to trade and hold bitcoin and ether later this year, in partnership with the startup Zerohash. This move positions OnePay to compete with other major financial apps like PayPal and Cash App, which already offer crypto services. The integration is part of OnePay's strategy to build an American "super app" for digital finance, which already includes banking, credit, and buy now, pay later options. The offering could allow users to convert crypto to cash for use at Walmart's checkout.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Boycotting Israeli Cinema Harms a Key Source of Internal Dissent</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-03 07:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues against the recent call by thousands in the film industry to boycott Israeli cinema, contending that such actions are ill-conceived and counterproductive. The author highlights that Israeli filmmaking, though partially state-funded, is a vital medium for challenging the country's policies, including militarism and the occupation. Films like "The Sea," Israel's Oscar entry which tells a Palestinian boy's story, and "Oxygen," about a mother questioning her son's military service, demonstrate cinema's power to foster critical dialogue within Israeli society. The piece concludes that instead of isolating Israeli filmmakers, who are also facing pressure from their own government, the international community should support them to ensure these important, dissenting stories continue to be told.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron gathered in Saarland to mark the 35th anniversary of German reunification. In his address, Merz celebrated the decades of unity in peace but also warned of new challenges facing the country and liberal democracies worldwide. He spoke of the need for a "new unity" to confront emerging alliances of autocratic nations, growing economic protectionism, and internal divisions exacerbated by irregular migration. Merz called on all citizens to recognize the value of democracy and the rule of law in navigating these contemporary pressures. The event underscored the strong Franco-German relationship while acknowledging the profound geopolitical shifts occurring globally.</p>

          <p>Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso surprisingly set the fastest time during the first practice session for the Singapore Grand Prix, outpacing Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Red Bull's Max Verstappen. Alonso finished 0.150 seconds ahead of Leclerc, with championship contenders Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris of McLaren finishing in fifth and sixth place, respectively. While Aston Martin is not generally considered a top contender for pole position, the team is hopeful for a strong performance on the low-speed Marina Bay street circuit, which suits their car's high-downforce design. Alonso's leading pace was likely achieved with a lower fuel load or a higher engine mode compared to his main rivals.</p>

          <p>Financial experts at a forum emphasized that Hong Kong's primary strength as a global asset and wealth management hub is its role as the gateway to mainland China. Panelists stated that as the majority of the world's new wealth is expected to originate from China this century, Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to benefit due to its proximity and deep connections. China's ongoing economic opening is anticipated to attract more high-net-worth individuals and innovative tech companies to establish a presence in the city. This influx of capital and talent is expected to enhance Hong Kong's status as a "superconnector" between the mainland and international markets, creating a favorable environment for business and finance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant victory against illegal wildlife trafficking, eleven cheetah cubs were rescued from smugglers off the coast of Somaliland. The cubs, which were found packed in bags on a small boat, were intercepted by the local coast guard in what the Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF) described as one of the largest confiscations of the species. The rescued animals were malnourished and in poor condition, with two dying shortly after the rescue. Somaliland is a major transit point for the illegal pet trade, which funnels exotic animals to Gulf countries and is driving the endangered cheetah population, now fewer than 7,000 in the wild, toward extinction.</p>

          <p>As electric air taxi services move closer to reality, a major operator of aviation landing sites has begun searching for locations in Los Angeles to build "vertiports." VertiPorts by Atlantic is looking to establish a network of landing pads on open land or on top of buildings like parking garages in congested urban areas such as Santa Monica and downtown L.A. This infrastructure is being developed in anticipation of services from companies like Archer Aviation, which plans to operate a fleet of electric air taxis during the 2028 Olympics. The goal is to offer an alternative to ground traffic with short, 10-to-20-minute flights across the sprawling metropolitan region.</p>
