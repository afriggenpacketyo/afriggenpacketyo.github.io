          <p>Rod Stewart has canceled several US concerts due to the flu as he prepares for his legends set at Glastonbury later this month. Stewart expressed his apologies to his fans for any inconvenience caused by the cancellations, which include four shows in Las Vegas and Stateline, Nevada, and two rescheduled dates in California. Despite these setbacks, Stewart affirmed his readiness to perform at Glastonbury, where he will be the first artist to have headlined the festival and played its legends slot. He also mentioned that he had requested an additional 15 minutes to his set, as he typically plays for over two hours each night.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has approved a $2.8 billion settlement allowing colleges and universities to directly pay their athletes, marking a significant shift in college sports. The settlement permits each school to share up to $20.5 million with athletes over the next year, along with $2.7 billion paid over the next decade to former players previously barred from revenue. This agreement resolves three antitrust cases challenging NCAA compensation rules dating back to 2016, addressing claims that NCAA rules denied athletes the opportunity to earn money from their name, image, and likeness. The NCAA lifted its ban on athletes earning money through endorsements and sponsorships in 2021.</p>

While Lee's progressive leanings may shift diplomatic approaches, continuity is anticipated in trilateral military cooperation with the US and Japan. This recalibration comes after Yoon Suk-yeol's impeachment, prompting speculation about changes in Seoul's foreign policy towards major global players. During his campaign, Lee faced criticism for describing US Forces Korea as occupation forces.</p>

The article highlights the rarity of such cases but notes that more are coming to light due to increased access to genetic testing.
