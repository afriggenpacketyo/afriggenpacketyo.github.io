          <p>The new German government, a coalition between the CDU/CSU and SPD, has begun its term facing significant challenges. The economy is struggling, and the far-right AfD poses a strong opposition. The government aims to strengthen the economy, limit illegal migration, and restore order, but faces resistance from within, particularly regarding social policy cuts. Chancellor Merz emphasizes closer European cooperation and plans to establish a National Security Council. The government also intends to implement stricter border controls to address asylum-seeker issues, which has already drawn criticism from neighboring countries.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is implementing a plan to encourage undocumented immigrants to self-deport, including offering $1,000 bonuses and paid travel. This initiative, dubbed "Project Homecoming," aims to make it easier for individuals to leave the U.S. voluntarily. Trump has ordered the Department of Homeland Security to add at least 20,000 officers to enforce his deportation policies, supplementing current efforts by deputizing state and local law enforcement. Trump has stated that those who stay in America illegally face punishments, including jail time, financial penalties, and deportation.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved the first at-home HPV screening test for cervical cancer, offering a potential alternative to traditional Pap smears. The Teal Wand allows women to collect a sample at home and mail it in for lab analysis. A clinical trial showed the test has a 96% accuracy rate in detecting cervical precancers, with 86% of participants indicating they'd be more likely to comply with screening recommendations if they could do it at home. The test is expected to be available first in California starting in June, with plans to expand across the country.</p>

While the United States focused on Mars, the Soviet Union dedicated resources to Venus, achieving several milestones in planetary exploration. The re-entry highlights the ongoing legacy of space exploration and the hardware still orbiting Earth.</p>

          <p>In his new memoir, "Who Knew," TV, film, and media executive Barry Diller reflects on his career, emphasizing the importance of instinct over data in decision-making. Diller argues that relying too heavily on research and structured information can stifle creativity and obscure common sense. He shares examples from his time at ABC, where he championed successful "Movie of the Week" titles based on instinct rather than extensive data analysis. Diller believes that too much information can overload and overcomplicate the essence of a good idea.</p>
