          <p>Citigroup announced second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driven by significant growth in its markets and banking divisions. The bank reported net income of $4.02 billion, a 25% increase from the previous year, with total revenue climbing 8% to $21.67 billion. CEO Jane Fraser highlighted the strong performance as evidence of the company's ongoing transformation plan, noting that market volatility has benefited trading profits. The bank raised its full-year revenue forecast, signaling confidence despite a noted deterioration in the broader economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 11,700 people from Afghanistan. The administration had planned to end the protections, arguing the security situation in Afghanistan has improved, but advocacy groups sued, stating the country remains unsafe. The ruling provides a brief reprieve for Afghan nationals who fled after the Taliban's takeover, allowing them to maintain their work permits and protection from deportation while the case proceeds. The White House criticized the court's decision.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed that the Trump administration will allow Nvidia to resume selling its H20 AI chip to China, characterizing it as the company's "4th best" available technology. The decision reverses a previous block on the sales and is reportedly linked to a deal involving rare-earth magnets. Lutnick argued that allowing China to use this less powerful American technology keeps them reliant on the U.S. "tech stack" and one step behind the latest innovations. The move is a significant win for Nvidia, which had anticipated losing billions in revenue from the Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>
