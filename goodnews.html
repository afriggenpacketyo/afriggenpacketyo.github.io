          <p>A South Texas community, largely composed of SpaceX employees, voted overwhelmingly to establish a new city called Starbase, fulfilling Elon Musk's vision. The vote, administered by Cameron County, saw 212 out of 218 voters supporting the incorporation of Starbase, which covers about 1.5 square miles near the Mexican border. SpaceX has been developing the area since 2014, making it a central hub and launch site, and home to hundreds of employees. The new municipality would be eligible for state and federal grants, would have certain immunity from lawsuits and could also condemn property.</p>

          <p>Ginzan Onsen, a popular hot spring town in Japan known for its retro charm and resemblance to settings in "Spirited Away," has begun restricting visitors to combat overtourism. The town, which sees approximately 334,000 tourists annually, implemented admission restrictions for day-trippers, requiring them to use shuttle buses and purchase advance tickets. This measure aims to alleviate congestion, protect cultural heritage, and preserve the town's serene atmosphere, especially during peak seasons. While most visitors support the restrictions, some challenges remain, such as tourists gathering before the paid admission period.</p>

          <p>China's central government has deployed inspection teams to investigate lower-level officials as part of President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign. These inspections, known as xunshi, have led to the downfall of numerous officials, including heads of provincial areas and state ministries. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) has stationed 16 disciplinary inspection teams in various regions, including Shanxi province, where a former governor soon became the target of an investigation. The CCDI now largely generates its own leads rather than relying on public tip-offs.</p>

          <p>Buffalo Trace Distillery, America's oldest-running distillery, reopened just in time for the Kentucky Derby after being severely impacted by historic floods. The distillery, located in Frankfort, Kentucky, experienced significant damage when the Kentucky River rose to over 48 feet, flooding buildings across the 400-acre campus. Despite the setback, crews worked quickly to restore the distillery, allowing for limited tours and tastings during Derby Week.</p>

          <p>Robert Harris, author of the novel "Conclave," which was adapted into an Oscar-winning film, draws parallels between the selection of a new Pope and the hit TV show "The Traitors." Harris suggests that the conclave, a secretive ritual in the Sistine Chapel, shares a similar dynamic with the show, where contestants must identify "traitors" among them. He also advocates for political parties to adopt a similar process, entrusting a select group to choose the right leader.</p>
