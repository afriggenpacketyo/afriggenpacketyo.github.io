          <p>Ten years after the Zika virus outbreak in Brazil, mothers of children born with congenital Zika syndrome continue to face immense challenges. Many of these children, now around nine years old, require constant care for severe health issues and have not met typical developmental milestones. The article highlights a community of mothers in Maceió who formed a support network to navigate these difficulties, often after being abandoned by their partners. After a long battle, they recently secured a significant increase in government compensation, offering new hope for their families' futures.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough's latest BBC series, "Parenthood," examines the diverse and often extreme ways animal parents raise their young. The show features compelling stories, such as mother spiders sacrificing themselves to be eaten by their offspring, and poison dart frogs carrying tadpoles to safety. Director Jeff Wilson notes the series aims to capture relatable parental dilemmas and the adaptability of animals in a changing world. At 99, Attenborough's narration is praised for its ability to connect with audiences of all ages, bringing emotion and wonder to these natural history sequences.</p>

          <p>As director Gurinder Chadha hints at a sequel, the 2002 film "Bend It Like Beckham" is being remembered for its significant cultural impact. The article explores how the movie's story of a Punjabi girl pursuing football against her family's wishes mirrored the real-life experiences of many South Asian women. For them, the film provided rare and positive representation, making them feel seen and inspiring some to pursue the sport professionally. While women's football has grown immensely since the film's release, the themes of overcoming cultural and gender barriers remain relevant.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 3.0 earthquake occurred in Bergen County, New Jersey, on Saturday night, with tremors felt across the region, including parts of New York City. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported the event was centered near Hasbrouck Heights at a depth of six miles. There have been no reports of damage or injuries from the minor seismic event. This follows other small earthquakes in the area in recent years, though it is smaller than the 4.8 magnitude quake that hit the region last year.</p>

In a social media post, he shared that he was diagnosed during his recent world tour and considered ending it early. However, he decided to continue performing, stating that the joy he gets from it outweighed the physical stress he was experiencing. Lyme disease can cause a range of symptoms but is typically treatable with antibiotics.</p>

Her detention occurred despite her husband's honorable military service, sparking outrage.

          <p>A decade after its launch, the Ethereum blockchain has grown from a niche experiment into a foundational technology for global finance. Initially conceived as a platform for "programmable money," it now underpins trillions of dollars in payments through stablecoins and is being integrated by major institutions for tokenized assets. Despite its success, founder Vitalik Buterin expresses concern about the risk of centralization as mainstream adoption grows. The platform's journey from a cypherpunk ideal to the plumbing of Wall Street highlights a major shift in the financial technology landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, along with fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana, is establishing a new left-wing political party in the UK. The venture, which has reportedly garnered over 600,000 registered supporters, is currently without an official name. Instead of choosing a name themselves, the founders are asking supporters to suggest one as part of a broader debate on the party's platform. This unconventional approach precedes official registration with the Electoral Commission, which is required before the party can field candidates in elections.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have signaled a definitive shift in their franchise focus by signing Luka Doncic to a three-year, $165 million contract extension. The move officially establishes the 26-year-old as the new centerpiece of the team, a transition underscored by a celebratory press conference. This raises significant questions about the future of LeBron James, who is 40 and has only one year left on his contract. With the team now clearly building around Doncic, it remains uncertain how James will adapt to a potentially secondary role.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a champion of open-source AI with its Llama models, is now signaling a more cautious approach to making its technology freely available. This shift in strategy comes as experts note that China's competitive and vibrant open-source AI ecosystem is rapidly advancing. Renowned computer scientist Andrew Ng suggests this "Darwinian" environment could be China's path to surpassing the U.S. in AI development. The contrast is highlighted by recent open-source releases from Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and Zhipu AI.</p>
