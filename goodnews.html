          <p>The Pennsylvania-based group Generation Life is engaging in "beach outreach" on the Jersey shore, attempting to promote a message of chastity before marriage to young people. The activists are adapting their message for Gen Z, framing chastity not just as abstinence but as a countercultural response to the perceived negative impacts of social media and hookup culture on relationships and self-worth. While facing skepticism, the group aims to connect with youth by discussing shared anxieties about modern dating. The article explores the challenges and strategies of promoting a traditional message in a rapidly changing social landscape.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 11:56:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Atlanta Braves outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. made a spectacular defensive play during a game against the New York Yankees, preventing a potential tying run. In the third inning, Acuña caught a deep fly ball in right field and unleashed a precise, powerful throw to third base to tag out a runner who had advanced from second. The play, which ended the inning, was lauded by his manager as a demonstration of his special talent and weapon-like arm. The Yankees manager acknowledged his runner was cleverly deceived by the Braves' third baseman, calling it a crucial mistake.</p>

          <p>Author and entrepreneur Scott Galloway argues that the worst career advice, often given by the wealthy, is to "follow your passion." Instead, he advises people to identify what they are good at, find where that skill can be profitable, and be resilient in the face of rejection. Galloway's own journey from a modest upbringing to becoming a self-made millionaire involved pivoting away from his passions when they weren't viable and embracing opportunities in marketing and entrepreneurship. The article suggests that practical self-assessment and a growth mindset are more crucial for success than blindly pursuing a passion.</p>

          <p>FC Barcelona has reportedly initiated talks to sign Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, who has expressed a desire for a new challenge. The proposed deal is structured as an initial loan with an option to buy. Rashford, who spent the latter half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, is currently training separately from the main United squad. His departure would provide Manchester United with significant wage bill savings, aiding their efforts to fund new signings after a costly summer transfer window.</p>
