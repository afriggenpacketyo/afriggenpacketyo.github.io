          <p>Britain is reportedly poised to become the first country to sign a trade deal with the U.S. after the U.S. announced tariffs against various trading partners. The New York Times reported that President Trump hinted at a forthcoming trade deal announcement, though specifics remain unclear. The deal's potential scope, whether a finalized agreement or a framework for future negotiations, is yet to be confirmed. The UK was spared reciprocal tariffs when Trump announced his 'Liberation Day' duties, although it was still hit with the baseline 10% levy.</p>

          <p>The article discusses how AI-powered code generation tools are enabling non-technical individuals to create functional apps. The author attended a two-day "vibe coding" boot camp and successfully built a negotiation training tool using AI. The process primarily involved prompt engineering rather than traditional coding. Sherry Jiang, co-founder and CEO of Peek, suggests that AI is unlocking opportunities for more people to build apps, potentially decreasing the need for extensive funding in startups.</p>

          <p>China is touting a recently passed law aimed at supporting the private economy as a means to drive growth, especially as trade tensions with the U.S. intensify. Officials say the law will address challenges faced by private enterprises, including fair competition and market access. The legislation is intended to unleash the potential of the private sector, which is becoming increasingly important as China focuses on internal economic momentum. The law defines the legal status of the private economy and the government‚Äôs support for it for the first time.</p>
