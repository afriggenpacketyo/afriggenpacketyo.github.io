        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Citing fire safety concerns, Southwest Airlines is introducing a new policy for travelers with lithium-powered wheelchairs and scooters. Effective September 25, passengers must remove detachable lithium batteries from their devices and carry them into the cabin. The airline stated that these batteries have become a common source of smoke and fire incidents on aircraft, emphasizing that quick access is crucial for safety. By 2026, a size restriction of 300 watt-hours will also be enforced, making Southwest one of the first U.S. carriers to adopt such standards.</p>

Their "BeeHome" is a robotic beehive that uses cameras and AI to monitor bee colonies and autonomously provide for their needs, such as food, medicine, and thermoregulation. The technology aims to protect bees from threats like climate change and pesticides, claiming to reduce colony collapse by 70%.

          <p>The Trump administration faced two significant legal setbacks in its immigration policies this week. A federal judge in Washington D.C. blocked the government from deporting a group of unaccompanied Guatemalan children, sharply criticizing the administration's unsubstantiated claim that the children's parents wanted them returned. Separately, a federal appeals court upheld a lower court's ruling that the administration had unlawfully tried to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans living in the U.S. These judicial decisions represent a major check on the executive branch's recent aggressive deportation efforts.</p>

          <p>Productivity software startup Notion has seen its annualized revenue climb past $500 million, largely due to its early and successful integration of artificial intelligence. The company launched its AI writing assistant just before the generative AI boom began and has continued to expand its AI offerings, including a new customizable agent. Notion reports that over half of its customers are now paying for AI add-ons, which are now being bundled into its business plans. Despite competition from giants like Microsoft and Google, the company's focus on AI has fueled rapid growth and strong demand from enterprise clients. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Google is rolling out its Gemini AI assistant to all Chrome browser users on Mac and Windows computers in the U.S., intensifying its efforts in the competitive AI landscape. This integration allows users to interact with Gemini directly within the browser to summarize webpages, work across tabs, and access other Google apps like Calendar and YouTube. The move is seen as a strategic response to emerging AI-native browsers from competitors like OpenAI and Perplexity.

          <p>Mortgage rates have fallen to their lowest level in three years, with the average 30-year rate dropping to 6.13% just before the Federal Reserve announced a quarter-point interest rate cut. This decline continues a trend seen throughout 2025, offering potential relief for homebuyers who have been sidelined by higher borrowing costs. Analysts suggest that rates could fall further depending on upcoming economic data, particularly the unemployment and inflation reports scheduled for October. The Federal Reserve's next meeting is also a key date that could influence the direction of mortgage rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A wave of youth-led protests, driven by the digitally native Gen Z, is creating significant political shifts in several Asian countries, including Nepal, Indonesia, and Bangladesh. These movements, often compared to the Arab Spring, are fueled by anger over corruption, economic inequality, and authoritarianism, and have successfully toppled governments or forced major policy changes. Using social media to organize decentralized movements, this generation has become a powerful political force. While these protests demonstrate a clear generational shift in activism, experts remain cautiously optimistic about whether these victories can be institutionalized into lasting democratic reforms.</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian government has changed its martial law policy to permit men aged 18 to 22 to travel abroad and return freely. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated the move is intended to keep more young men in the country by offering them freedom of movement, insisting it will not harm Ukraine's defense capabilities. The decision has sparked debate, with some supporting it as a positive step for youth and others deeming it unfair to older men subject to mobilization. The new rule provides young Ukrainians with opportunities for short-term work, study, or travel amid the ongoing war.</p>
