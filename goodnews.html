          <p>A 19-year-old Australian surfer who went missing has been successfully rescued after spending a night alone on an uninhabited island. The teenager, Darcy Deefholts, had gone surfing off Wooli Beach and was reported missing when he failed to return home. A large-scale search operation located him the next day on North Solitary Island, approximately seven miles offshore. His father described the rescue as a "one in a million miracle," and the surfer is now receiving medical treatment.</p>

          <p>More than 30 construction workers were successfully rescued after being trapped in a Los Angeles industrial tunnel that partially collapsed. The workers were approximately 400 feet underground when the cave-in occurred, but they managed to climb over a 12-foot pile of debris to reach a tunnel boring machine. From there, they were transported to safety with no major injuries reported. The tunnel is part of a $700 million project to carry treated wastewater to the Pacific Ocean, and work has been halted pending an investigation into the collapse.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo is experiencing a period of optimism, fueled by both diplomatic progress and football success. A recent peace deal with neighboring Rwanda, if it holds, could bring much-needed stability to the conflict-ridden eastern region, allowing for investment in infrastructure, including sports facilities. This coincides with the men's national football team leading its World Cup qualification group, putting them on track for their first appearance since 1974. Qualification could further boost the nation's morale, attract investment, and provide positive opportunities for its youth.</p>

          <p>A journalist shares a personal experience of taking his neurodivergent son to his first professional soccer match, a Club World Cup semi-final at MetLife Stadium. Initially overwhelmed by the loud noises and spectacle, the boy became distressed, but stadium staff provided noise-canceling headphones and moved the family to a quieter area. This act of kindness allowed the child to experience the game on his own terms, highlighting a moment of human empathy amid the commercialism of a major sporting event. The article reflects on how individual compassion can shine through even in highly corporatized environments.</p>

          <p>The tourism board for the Faroe Islands has launched a unique travel initiative featuring 30 self-guided road trips where the destinations are kept secret from the visitors. The "Auto Odyssey" tours, accessible by phone, guide travelers along routes designed to prevent crowding and lead them to small villages, unique restaurants, and scenic lookouts. The goal is to encourage tourists to explore beyond popular hotspots and embrace a sense of curiosity and unpredictability. Travelers must commit to completing the entire route, fostering a more immersive and less conventional experience of the remote archipelago.</p>

          <p>The UK and France are reportedly close to finalizing a new deal aimed at tackling illegal channel crossings, which would involve France taking back some migrants in exchange for the UK accepting a similar number of legitimate asylum seekers. While this marks a significant diplomatic step, the initial pilot scheme is expected to be small, returning about 50 migrants per week. Critics, including the Conservative party, question whether this limited scale will serve as an effective deterrent to break the business model of smuggling gangs. The ultimate success of the agreement will be judged by whether it leads to a significant reduction in crossing numbers.</p>

The event, co-hosted by Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, aims to foster public-private partnerships for projects in defense, energy, and mining. The goal is not only to reconstruct but also to modernize Ukraine and support the reforms necessary for its potential EU admission. With recovery costs estimated at over $500 billion, the conference serves as a platform for networking between international investors and Ukrainian businesses.</p>

          <p>Director James Gunn is positioning the hero of his new "Superman" film as a figure of "universal morality" rather than a symbol of purely American ideals. The film reportedly begins with a battered Superman, meant to symbolize a nation in a beat-up state but still striving for goodness. This interpretation has sparked debate, with some right-wing commentators criticizing it as "woke" for focusing on kindness and global protection. The article notes the character's origins, created by Jewish immigrants as a defender of the weak, and his historical identity as a "moral immigrant" and an undocumented alien from another planet.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have announced a significant advancement in autonomous surgery, with a robot successfully performing a realistic gallbladder removal with 100% accuracy. The system, powered by machine learning architecture similar to ChatGPT, operated with the skill of an expert human surgeon on a life-like model. It was able to adapt to unexpected scenarios, respond to voice commands, and learn from feedback, marking a major leap from simply executing pre-programmed tasks. This breakthrough brings clinically viable autonomous surgical systems closer to reality, though human trials are still a necessary future step.</p>

          <p>A former official from China's central bank has argued that the yuan possesses the qualities to become a safe-haven currency, citing the country's low inflation, large foreign reserves, and government commitment to stability. The assertion, made in a recent article, suggests that the yuan has already shown resilience during periods of global stress, such as the war in Ukraine and shocks from U.S. tariffs. This perspective contributes to the ongoing debate about the internationalization of the yuan, particularly as confidence in the U.S. dollar is tested by debt risks and protectionist policies.

          <p>The market for weight-loss medication in China is rapidly expanding, with projections suggesting it could become a US$150 billion industry. This growth is fueled by rising obesity rates, social pressures for svelteness, and the recent approval of more effective drugs. Dozens of domestic pharmaceutical producers are now vying for a share of this burgeoning market, with Innovent Biologics being the first to receive approval to market its weight-loss drug in the country. The trend mirrors the soaring sales of similar medications seen in Western countries, driven by a combination of health needs and cultural endorsements.</p>

          <p>Vienna is frequently cited as a "renters' utopia" due to its successful housing policies, which are centered on a large and stable social-housing sector. This sector, comprising 43% of the city's housing units, is accessible to a wide range of income levels and keeps rent significantly lower than in the private market. The system originated in the "Red Vienna" era of the 1920s and is sustained today by a levy on employee salaries. While not without challenges, such as a complex allocation system, Vienna's long-term political commitment to treating housing as a basic need offers a powerful model for other cities.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the Beijing Institute of Technology have successfully created a "cyborg bee" by equipping it with the world's lightest insect brain controller. The device, weighing just 74 milligrams, is strapped to the bee's back and uses three tiny needles to deliver electronic pulses to its brain. These pulses create illusions that can command the bee's flight, directing it to turn, advance, or retreat with a high degree of accuracy. This technological achievement opens up new possibilities for monitoring and interacting with insects for various applications, from environmental sensing to search and rescue.</p>
