          <p>The White House has withdrawn Jared Isaacman's nomination to be the next NASA administrator, just days before a scheduled Senate confirmation vote. President Trump announced the decision on Truth Social, stating that he would soon announce a new nominee who is "Mission aligned, and put America First in Space." Isaacman, a veteran private astronaut with strong ties to Elon Musk and SpaceX, had previously expressed his commitment to making America a leader in space exploration and inspiring future generations. Musk responded to the withdrawal by stating that Isaacman was both competent and good-hearted. The nomination had advanced through the Senate's Commerce Committee in April, and the Senate was set to vote after returning from the Memorial Day recess.</p>

          <p>This article recounts an incident during John Boehner's first race for Congress in 1990, when actor George Wendt, best known for his role as Norm on "Cheers," inadvertently libeled Boehner on national television. Wendt, whose brother-in-law was Boehner's opponent, Greg Jolivette, confused Boehner with another politician involved in a sex scandal. The gaffe created a stir in the campaign, with Boehner's team responding with a statement questioning Jolivette's own past. Boehner ultimately won the election, and later reconciled with Wendt, with the former Speaker explaining how Wendt was the brother-in-law of his opponent and "went on a late-night TV show and said some tough things."</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities initially reported that 250 million bees had escaped, but later corrected the number. The public was advised to avoid the area, and beekeepers assisted in recovering the hives. The road was closed for about 24 hours to allow the bees to re-hive and find their queen. By the next morning, most of the bees had returned to their hives, and those responsible for their delivery took charge.</p>

          <p>Blue Origin successfully launched six passengers on a sub-orbital trip to the edge of space, marking the company's twelfth crewed flight. The international crew experienced a few minutes of weightlessness and stunning views before returning to Earth. The New Shepard rocket climbed to nearly 65 miles above Earth, allowing passengers to float weightlessly and view the curvature of the Earth through large windows. Blue Origin has now launched 68 passengers into space since July 2021, and Jorge's seat was sponsored by Farmacias Similares, a Mexican company focused on accessible healthcare across Latin America.</p>

          <p>Wayfarers Chapel, a historic landmark in Rancho Palos Verdes, is considering a new location next to City Hall after landslides forced its disassembly. The chapel, known for its glass and wood design by Frank Lloyd Wright Jr., had been threatened by rapid land movement.

Plans for the rebuilt chapel include a visitor's center, museum, cafe, and gardens, with the rebuild expected to cost almost $20 million.</p>

          <p>A by-election in Hamilton, Larkhall, and Stonehouse is underway to elect a new MSP following the death of Christina McKelvie. The contest is seen as a significant test of voter opinion in Scotland since the UK general election, with the SNP, Labour, and Reform UK vying for power. Voters express frustration with established parties, citing issues such as rising household bills, access to healthcare, and taxes on small businesses. Reform UK is targeting Labour voters with promises of raising the tax threshold and tightening immigration controls, leading to accusations of racism from other parties.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece discusses Donald Trump's political resilience, attributing it to his willingness to swerve, backpedal, and contradict himself, which is encapsulated by the Wall Street acronym "TACO" (Trump Always Chickens Out). The author argues that this promise of chickening out reassures swing voters that anything extreme is provisional. Recent actions, such as easing on China tariffs and distancing from Elon Musk, have helped Trump's poll numbers recover. Seeing Trump check himself and be checked by others is what an important group of voters expect from his presidency.</p>
