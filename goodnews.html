          <p>European Ryder Cup team member Viktor Hovland has been forced to withdraw from his Sunday singles match against American Harris English due to a persistent neck injury. Consequently, the match was declared a half, awarding half a point to each team and adjusting the overall score to 12-5 in Europe's favor. Hovland's absence is a notable development, as Europe now requires only two more points from the remaining 11 matches to retain the Ryder Cup. This situation invoked the competition's injury protocol, known as the "envelope rule," for just the third time since its introduction.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to attend a meeting with high-ranking generals and admirals that was convened on short notice by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The gathering will take place at Quantico, and a source familiar with the plans confirmed the president's attendance. While meetings with senior military leaders are routine, the scale of this particular meeting, which calls for in-person attendance from officials worldwide, is considered unusual and potentially unprecedented. President Trump commented on the meeting, stating, "I love it," and dismissed any suggestions that there was something improper about it.</p>

          <h2>Swiss Voters Narrowly Approve Introduction of Voluntary Digital ID System</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 11:55:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a close referendum, Swiss citizens have narrowly voted in favor of a government plan to introduce a voluntary electronic identity system, with 50.4% supporting the measure. This outcome was much tighter than polls had predicted and follows the rejection of a similar proposal in 2021 over privacy concerns. The revised system ensures that all data will be stored on individual users' smartphones and managed by the state, not private companies. Proponents argue the digital ID will streamline online transactions and bureaucratic processes, while opponents remain concerned about potential data misuse and privacy erosion.</p>

          <p>In a public referendum, residents of Zurich, Switzerland, have voted to impose severe restrictions on the use of leaf blowers and leaf vacuums, with over 61% supporting the new rules. The measure aims to reduce noise and fine dust pollution in the city. Under the new regulations, gas-powered models will be completely banned, and electric devices will only be permitted for use from October to December without special permission. Supporters of the initiative argued that the devices are disruptive and harmful to microorganisms, while opponents criticized the move as an example of an excessive "culture of prohibition."</p>

          <p>The stock market's direction in the coming week will be heavily influenced by key jobs data, including the JOLTS and the September nonfarm payrolls reports. Investors are closely watching for signs of labor market weakness that could prompt the Federal Reserve to implement further interest rate cuts before the end of the year. Alongside the economic data, the bond market's reaction to inflation indicators and the potential for a government shutdown are also significant factors for traders. The market currently anticipates at least one more rate cut, but resilient economic figures could alter that expectation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Zombies, a British band from the 1960s, are finally receiving widespread recognition decades after their initial success. Their 1968 album "Odessey and Oracle," which was a commercial failure upon release, is now considered a rock classic. The band's hit song "Time of the Season" famously took a full year to climb the charts, long after the group had already disbanded due to financial struggles and a sense of stagnation. Now, the surviving members have been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, reflecting on a long and unconventional path to musical immortality.</p>

          <p>China is developing a new industrial manufacturing system to mass-produce rockets and satellites with the efficiency and consistency of automobile production. This emerging "pull" system contrasts with the traditional aerospace "push" model, where components are made based on forecasts. In the new model, the final assembly line pulls components from suppliers only as they are needed, aiming to reduce delays, lower costs, and increase flexibility. Researchers believe mastering this scalable production method will be crucial for dominating the rapidly growing global space industry.</p>

          <p>As more national chain stores close, rising vacancy rates in shopping centers are creating rare opportunities for small and local businesses to lease prime commercial real estate. Landlords are becoming more willing to negotiate flexible lease terms and lower rents to keep their properties occupied, allowing independent retailers, wellness practitioners, and service-based businesses to move into spaces they were previously priced out of. While rental rates are not necessarily decreasing, their rate of growth has slowed, creating a more favorable environment for entrepreneurs. This trend is helping to revitalize some commercial areas with unique, local offerings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, has reached a confidential settlement with Dominion Voting Systems in a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit. Dominion sued Giuliani in 2021 for repeatedly making false claims that the company's voting machines were used to rig the 2020 presidential election against Trump. This marks the third major settlement Dominion has secured from entities that promoted election lies, following substantial payouts from Fox News and Newsmax. Giuliani's involvement in efforts to overturn the election has also led to his disbarment in both New York and Washington D.C.</p>
