          <p>A growing number of consumers in China are turning to what is being called the "spiritual economy," which includes businesses offering metaphysical services like fortune-telling. Establishments such as "spiritual bars" that combine nightlife with tarot readings are becoming trendy in major cities like Shanghai. This trend is driven by younger generations seeking guidance and relief from economic pressures, such as pay cuts and career uncertainty. The rise in spending on these occult and spiritual activities reflects a broader shift in consumer behavior as people look for alternative ways to navigate life's challenges.</p>

          <p>Nearly four years after its controversial Saudi-led takeover, Newcastle United has undergone a significant transformation, though its path to success has been gradual. The club has heavily invested in upgrading its training facilities, which were previously below Premier League standards, and has seen its revenue and staff numbers more than double. On the field, the team won the Carabao Cup, ending a 70-year trophy drought, and has qualified for the Champions League twice. However, growth has been constrained by Profit and Sustainability Rules, preventing the club from simply buying its way to the top and forcing a more strategic approach to development.</p>

          <p>China is implementing a new public diplomacy strategy in Africa by sponsoring local social media influencers to visit and create positive content about the country. For the second year, the Chinese embassy in Kenya has funded a trip for popular content creators to tour provinces like Hunan, showcasing China's culture, scenery, and history to their large online followings. This approach marks a shift from traditional state-led media campaigns, aiming to connect directly with younger African audiences. Analysts view this as a significant and overdue evolution in China's soft power efforts, designed to build a more relatable and favorable public image.</p>

          <p>Music legend Lionel Richie revealed in his new memoir that he was training to become an Episcopal priest before a pivotal moment with his band, The Commodores, changed his path. Richie described himself as a shy young man who considered the clergy as a potential life direction. However, during an early performance, a woman in the audience shouted, "Sing it, baby!," which he felt was a profound acknowledgment that inspired him to pursue music instead. He subsequently informed his church that he would not be continuing his priesthood training, realizing that his songwriting was his true form of sermon.</p>

          <p>The German government has approved a "Modernization Agenda" to significantly integrate artificial intelligence into public administration and services. The plan aims to reduce bureaucracy costs by 25% by 2029 through initiatives like AI-powered visa processing and a unified online platform for export businesses. This push follows a broader "High-Tech Agenda" identifying AI as a key technology for Germany's future growth. However, some experts express concern that the government is relying on foreign technology, such as a new deal between SAP and OpenAI, potentially compromising German tech independence and data sovereignty.</p>

          <p>South Africa has secured its second consecutive Rugby Championship title after defeating Argentina in the final match, capping a tournament that highlighted both team development and surprising upsets. The Springboks' victory is notable as coach Rassie Erasmus used nearly 50 different players, successfully building squad depth while still winning the title. New Zealand finished as runner-up, with coach Scott Robertson focusing on integrating new talent ahead of the 2027 World Cup, though the team suffered a historic loss to South Africa. Australia showed improvement to finish third, while Argentina's promising campaign ended with a disappointing fourth-place finish.</p>
