          <p>San Francisco, recently lauded as the best city for dogs, is now grappling with growing resident frustration over canine behavior in public spaces. Complaints on Reddit and from locals highlight issues like dogs being present in grocery stores, a clear health code violation, and frequent off-leash incidents, with some dogs even snatching food from people. Reports of unleashed dogs have surged by 6% in the past year, prompting calls for stricter enforcement of existing leash laws and greater accountability from pet owners. The city's reputation as a dog-friendly haven is increasingly challenged by concerns impacting public hygiene, safety, and the overall quality of life for all residents, including those without pets.</p>

          <p>Hull KR secured their spot in the Super League Grand Final by defeating St Helens 20-12 in a hard-fought play-off semi-final, maintaining their impressive Treble bid. Oliver Gildart's two crucial second-half tries sealed the victory, building on an early lead established by Mikey Lewis and Joe Burgess during a powerful first-half display. Despite a strong comeback attempt from St Helens after halftime, Hull KR withstood the pressure, demonstrating resilience and tactical prowess. This victory sets up an anticipated rematch against the Wigan Warriors in next Saturday's Grand Final, a significant achievement for the Robins after their previous relegation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Acoustic piano sales have plummeted significantly since 1925, with only 17,294 units sold in 2024 compared to over 300,000 a century prior, reflecting changing cultural and economic landscapes. This decline is attributed to various factors, including geopolitical events, economic statuses making expensive instruments less accessible, and general cultural trends. However, the rise of digital and hybrid pianos offers more affordable, smaller, and accurate alternatives, enabling a new generation to learn the instrument. Experts are optimistic about a resurgence in piano playing, driven by these accessible technologies and a growing weariness of excessive screen time.</p>

          <p>Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard set an unwanted Premier League record by being substituted before half-time in three consecutive starts, highlighting a frustrating and injury-plagued start to his season. After two early withdrawals due to a recurring shoulder issue, he left Saturday's game against West Ham with a knee injury after a "knee-to-knee" collision. Manager Mikel Arteta expressed significant concern over the captain's fitness, acknowledging Odegaard's crucial role in the team's attacking dimension and the impact his absence has. The team now anxiously awaits further medical assessment on the extent of his latest injury, hoping for a swift return.</p>

          <p>Formula 1 drivers are currently divided over the mandatory use of cooling vests for the Singapore Grand Prix, which has been declared a 'heat hazard' due to extremely high temperatures and humidity. Max Verstappen strongly opposes making the vests mandatory, citing personal discomfort, design flaws in narrow cockpits, and a preference for driver choice in safety equipment. George Russell, however, plans to use the system, noting recent team improvements in car cooling to mitigate heat issues. This debate highlights ongoing challenges in ensuring driver safety and comfort in extreme racing conditions, with the effectiveness of the system under scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Costco has partnered with drugmaker Novo Nordisk to offer its members GLP-1 weight-loss medications like Ozempic and Wegovy at roughly half the usual cost, pricing a four-week supply at $499. This significant offer is specifically targeted at out-of-pocket payers, as many insurers currently do not cover these increasingly popular drugs. The move aims to enhance access and demand amidst soaring market prices and limited supply, which has led to a rise in cheaper, compounded versions and calls for tighter federal oversight. Approximately 12% of Americans have already used GLP-1 drugs for weight loss, indicating a substantial market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep III, one of the largest and most significant in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, has officially opened to the public after two decades of meticulous Japanese-led restoration. Dating back over 3,000 years, the site suffered severe deterioration since its discovery in 1799 and subsequent extensive looting of its contents. The tomb features an impressive 36-meter-long passageway and a main burial chamber, along with two other chambers for queens, all adorned with exquisite wall paintings. This opening represents a monumental cultural and historical preservation achievement, allowing broader public access to ancient Egyptian heritage.</p>

          <p>Clayton Kershaw has been officially added to the Los Angeles Dodgers' National League Division Series roster, marking his anticipated return to playoff pitching after being left off the wild-card round roster. Kershaw, who finished the season with an 11-2 record and a 3.36 ERA, will provide crucial veteran left-handed depth in the bullpen against the Philadelphia Phillies, addressing a key team need. The Dodgers also included fellow left-hander Anthony Banda, while maintaining their 15-man position player group, including Will Smith, who is recovering from a fractured hand. This strategic move aims to significantly bolster the Dodgers' pitching for the crucial series ahead.</p>
