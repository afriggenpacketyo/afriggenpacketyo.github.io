          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 07:01:00 EDT</div>

          <p>The United Kingdom has lifted a five-year ban on Pakistani airlines, enabling carriers to resume flights after significant improvements in aviation safety standards. The prohibition was enacted in 2020 following a scandal where it was revealed that nearly one-third of Pakistan's pilots held fraudulent licenses, a discovery made after a fatal crash. This decision follows a similar move by the European Union and is expected to provide a major financial boost to Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), which is currently undergoing privatization, by restoring profitable routes to London and Manchester.</p>

          <p>China is expanding the international use of its currency, the yuan, by establishing strategic partnerships with African nations, positioning the continent as a key testing ground. The central banks of China and Egypt recently signed agreements to promote the yuan in trade, investment, and electronic payments, including through China's CIPS payment system, an alternative to SWIFT. Egypt now joins other African countries like Nigeria and South Africa in adopting yuan-based financial transactions, signaling a broader push by Beijing to increase its economic influence and reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar.

          <p>Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin stated his focus is on re-earning voter trust by engaging with communities outside of election cycles, rather than on internal party disputes. The DNC's strategy for the midterms involves a grassroots "organizing summer" to highlight the negative impacts of President Trump's spending plans and policies like mass deportations. Martin emphasized that the party must build relationships based on shared values and demonstrate a genuine concern for communities to overcome voter skepticism and unify against the Trump administration's agenda.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece argues that Major League Baseball's All-Star Game needs revitalization to maintain fan interest, despite being considered the best among major sports. The author suggests creative changes, such as incorporating judged bat flips into the Home Run Derby to generate social media buzz and attract younger audiences. The article also criticizes the high number of star players, particularly pitchers, who withdraw from the game. It proposes moving the game to Wednesday to give players more rest and ensure the sport's best athletes are showcased.</p>

          <h2>Review Recommends Renaming 'Physician Associates' to 'Assistants' to Reduce Patient Confusion</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 06:47:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review in the UK has recommended that Physician Associates (PAs) and Anaesthesia Associates (AAs) be renamed "assistants" to clarify their roles and prevent confusion with doctors. The report, commissioned after concerns over patient safety and role clarity, also suggests PAs should not make new diagnoses and must wear standardized uniforms to be distinguishable from physicians. While the doctors' union believes the review should have gone further, the union representing PAs expressed concern that the new restrictions could lengthen patient waiting lists by limiting their scope of practice.</p>

          <p>Luxury goods group Richemont reported a 6% rise in quarterly sales, driven by strong performance in its jewelry division, which includes brands like Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels. However, sales in Japan saw a sharp 15% decline, ending a recent boom fueled by a weaker yen that had attracted a surge of tourist spending, particularly from Chinese shoppers. The recent strengthening of the yen has curbed this trend, while the company's specialist watchmakers division also experienced a sales drop, primarily due to weakness in the Chinese market.

          <p>The Trump administration has finalized a trade deal with Indonesia that will lower U.S. tariffs on Indonesian goods from a threatened 32% to 19%. In exchange, President Trump stated that American firms will gain "full access" to Indonesian markets and that the country has agreed to purchase billions in U.S. energy and agricultural products, as well as 50 Boeing jets. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto described the deal as a "new era of mutual benefit," marking the latest agreement to emerge from the White House's recent wave of tariff threats against global trading partners.

          <p>A nurse in Scotland, Sandie Peggie, has been cleared of gross misconduct by NHS Fife after she was suspended for complaining about sharing a changing room with a transgender doctor. Ms. Peggie had objected to Dr. Beth Upton, a transgender woman, using female facilities, leading to allegations of misgendering and failures in patient care. The health board's internal hearing found insufficient evidence to support the misconduct claims. The decision was announced as an employment tribunal, brought by Ms. Peggie against her employer under the Equality Act, resumed.</p>

          <p>Asset management firm Blackstone has been actively acquiring rental housing properties across the U.S., including apartment complexes, student housing, and single-family homes. The company's strategy focuses on areas with strong job and population growth, particularly in Sun Belt states and major cities. While Blackstone owns less than 1% of the nation's rental homes, its real estate income trust holds an interest in nearly 275,000 units. Analysts note that the current market, where buying is often cheaper than building, supports rent growth and makes these acquisitions potentially profitable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A deacon at a Michigan church is being praised as a hero for preventing a mass shooting by ramming a rifle-wielding attacker with his pickup truck. Richard Pryor saw the armed man begin firing in the church parking lot and, realizing there was no time to wait for police, drove his truck directly into the shooter. This action temporarily stopped the assailant, allowing the church's armed security team to intervene and fatally shoot the suspect. Pryor's quick thinking is credited with saving the lives of over 100 congregants, including children, who were inside.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers studying healthy brain aging have identified key lifestyle factors that can help mitigate the natural cognitive decline that begins around age 40. A study of individuals with "exceptional" cognitive performance for their age found that genetics played a role, but so did behaviors such as getting high-quality sleep and maintaining cardiovascular health. Experts recommend consistent sleep schedules, physical and social activity, and controlling vascular risk factors like high blood pressure and cholesterol, as these measures can help preserve brain structure and function later in life.</p>
