          <p>The article addresses concerns about Hong Kong's legal system after 2047, when the current arrangements are set to expire, sparked by a question from activist investor David Webb about the future of contract law and land leases. The author, reflecting on past anxieties regarding the 1997 handover, urges calm and emphasizes the need to avoid unnecessary alarm. They recount their own early concerns about the validity of property mortgages tied to the New Territories' lease, advocating for proactive discussion rather than passive acceptance of the deadline. The author now suggests that there is little to worry about.</p>

          <p>Poland began voting in a high-stakes presidential election that will significantly influence the country's political direction and its positions on critical issues like abortion rights, LGBTQ rights, and relations with the European Union. The leading candidates are Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski, the pro-EU Warsaw Mayor supported by Prime Minister Donald Tusk's centrist Civic Coalition, and Karol Nawrocki, a nationalist historian backed by the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party. The election outcome will likely determine the extent of policy gridlock between the president and the government, with potential impacts on the coalition's agenda and Poland's alignment with European norms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new internal study suggests that the German military, the Bundeswehr, does not have 'systemic' extremism within its ranks, with only a small percentage of soldiers exhibiting right-wing extremist attitudes. However, the study did reveal that some soldiers hold chauvinistic and xenophobic views. Despite these findings, some researchers remain skeptical, pointing to past incidents involving far-right networks and plots within the military, and question the effectiveness of current safeguards. The debate continues on whether the Bundeswehr is doing enough to prevent extremist attitudes, especially amid a broader societal normalization of right-wing sentiments.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times guest essay, Dan Richards compares the contrasting approaches to night train travel in Europe and the United States. Europe is experiencing a renaissance in sleeper train networks, driven by environmental concerns and plans for expanded high-speed rail. In contrast, the U.S. is criticized for underfunding public infrastructure and prioritizing cars and air travel. The author advocates for revitalized railways in America, highlighting their potential for community connection and more sustainable travel. The article suggests that trains offer a more inclusive and environmentally friendly alternative to the current car-centric model.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to fund infrastructure projects in Africa, marking a shift from direct government loans through the Belt and Road Initiative. This approach involves granting Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for financing construction, addressing African governments' debt concerns. Projects like Nairobi's mega-highway and Zambia's Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway are adopting this model. During Kenyan President William Ruto's visit to China, he sought PPP funding to extend the Standard Gauge Railway, with Chinese firms contributing 40% of the cost and gaining exclusive rights to operate the railway for at least 25 years.</p>

          <p>Germany is planning to significantly increase its defense spending to become the 'strongest conventional army in Europe,' prompting other EU countries to follow suit. The German Foreign Minister said that the government had accepted the president's demand to invest 5% of GDP in defense. France and Poland are also expanding their military capabilities, with a focus on modern equipment and increased troop numbers. While these rearmament programs will strengthen European militaries, they are unlikely to significantly alter the global ranking of military strength in the near term.</p>

          <p>Clayton Kershaw made his season debut for the Dodgers after recovering from injury, pitching four uneven innings in a loss to the Angels. Kershaw acknowledged the special significance of his return, likely marking a late-career chapter, but he struggled with command, giving up three runs in the first inning. Despite the rocky start, Kershaw showed glimpses of his old form, and the Dodgers hope he can contribute as they deal with injuries to other starting pitchers.
