        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two children and one adult were struck by a car outside a preschool at Sunrise Presbyterian Church in Sullivan's Island, South Carolina, in what authorities suspect may have been an intentional act. Police identified the suspect as Justin Collin Adams, who was apprehended after an hours-long manhunt that involved grid searches, drones, and checkpoints. One child and one adult were hospitalized, but their injuries were not as serious as initially feared, with both expected to recover fully. The Charleston County Sheriff's Office is leading the ongoing investigation to determine the charges against Adams.</p>

          <p>Migrant crossings at the U.S. southern border have remained at historically low levels in April, marking three months since President Trump's immigration crackdown began. Border Patrol agents recorded approximately 8,400 apprehensions, a slight increase from March but still among the lowest tallies in decades. The Trump administration attributes the drop to its policies, including rapid deportations and increased troop deployment, reversing many Biden-era programs. While some criticize these policies as inhumane, experts note that tougher rhetoric and actions may be deterring migrants, though migration patterns can change rapidly.</p>

          <p>A lynx born at Newquay Zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild, as part of a European breeding program to increase genetic diversity. The female lynx has been moved to an enclosure in Germany's Black Forest, where it will be monitored to assess its survival skills and ability to avoid human interaction. If successful, the lynx will be released to help control deer populations and restore the ecosystem's balance, as lynxes were driven to extinction in the UK centuries ago. The decision on the lynx's fate will be made later in the summer after close monitoring.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US is set to close the "de minimis" loophole, a trade rule that allowed retailers to ship low-value packages (under $800) to US customers without duties or taxes. This change, supported by both Presidents Trump and Biden, aims to tackle illegal imports and protect American businesses, potentially increasing prices for consumers using online retailers like Shein and Temu. While these retailers have already started raising prices, the move could also impact border authorities, as the number of packages entering the US under the loophole has surged in recent years. The UK and EU are also considering similar measures, which could lead to price increases for consumers globally.</p>

          <p>This article reviews three new film releases: "Thunderbolts*," a Marvel movie that explores the traumas of a group of imperfect antiheroes; "Rosario," a horror film drawing on Latin American traditions; and "La Balada de Hortensia," a Salvadoran comedy about a man who cross-dresses as a woman. "Thunderbolts*" is praised for its complex characters and strong performances, particularly by Florence Pugh, who plays a Russian assassin grappling with her past. "Rosario" is highlighted for its use of real-world religious elements to create a frightening atmosphere, while "La Balada de Hortensia" is noted for its positive portrayal of a cross-dressing character who helps women facing discrimination. The article emphasizes the importance of diverse voices in film and celebrates the arrival of new Latin American directors in the horror genre.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 18:50:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple expects tariffs on imported goods to add approximately $900 million to its costs in the current quarter, despite exemptions on key electronics. The company is responding by shifting production of iPhones for the American market to India, and moving production of iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and AirPods to Vietnam. While Apple is emphasizing its investments in the US, the primary beneficiaries of this supply chain shift are India and Vietnam, not the US, as China will remain the primary country of origin for products sold outside the US. Despite the anticipated financial hit, Apple's sales remain strong, with revenues up 5% year-on-year.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has received his first salary raise in a decade, bringing his base salary to $1.5 million, a 49% increase from 2024. This adjustment reflects Nvidia's exceptional growth, driven by the demand for its GPUs in artificial intelligence, which has turned it into one of the world's most valuable companies. Huang's total pay for 2025, including stock awards, amounts to $49.9 million, with the compensation committee citing internal pay equity as a factor in the decision. Huang's roughly 3.5% stake in Nvidia is currently valued at approximately $94 billion.</p>

          <p>Apple's second-quarter earnings exceeded Wall Street's expectations, but the company's stock dropped in after-hours trading due to concerns about tariffs and lower-than-expected revenue from its services division. CEO Tim Cook stated that tariffs are expected to add $900 million to costs in the upcoming quarter, assuming current rates remain unchanged. While Apple is shifting production to India and Vietnam to mitigate tariff impacts, uncertainty remains regarding future trade policies. Despite these challenges, Cook expressed confidence in the company's ability to navigate the situation and maintain its commitment to innovation.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's return to the White House is casting a shadow over the Australian federal election, forcing candidates to address international relations rather than focusing solely on domestic issues. Trump's tariffs and unpredictable foreign policy have raised concerns about Australia's relationship with the US, its key ally. While Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has criticized Trump's tariffs, the need for a strong US alliance, particularly in the face of China's growing influence, is making Australia's leaders re-evaluate their links to the US. Some analysts suggest Trump's actions may even be helping Albanese by creating a sense of crisis and rallying voters around the incumbent.</p>

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated that the cost of AI for customers will decrease over time, partially due to Amazon's custom chips that offer an alternative to Nvidia GPUs.

          <p>This article reviews Marvel's "Thunderbolts*," a film that elevates supporting characters from previous movies into a team of misfits tasked with taking down a corrupt CIA director. The film is praised for its snarky humor, messy and depressive tone, and Florence Pugh's performance as Yelena. The review notes that the film is less polished than other Marvel movies, with a plainness to the fights, but it finds inspiration in the nightmare fuel of after-school PSAs and explores themes of trust and trauma. The reviewer concludes that the movie feels like an asterisk, acknowledging its limitations while still delivering entertainment.</p>
