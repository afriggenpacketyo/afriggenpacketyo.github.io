          <p>The Indiana Pacers, despite being underdogs, defeated the top-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 2 of their second-round series, taking a surprising 2-0 lead. Tyrese Haliburton's last-second three-pointer capped a wild comeback from a 20-point deficit, securing a 120-119 victory. This marks the first time the Pacers have won the first two games of a playoff series on the road since 1994, while the Cavaliers were missing key players due to injuries.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators unveiled comprehensive measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, to bolster the economy amidst trade tensions with the United States. The government aims to support key sectors like technology and real estate, and establish a 500-billion-yuan relending tool for consumption and elderly care. These measures reflect a heightened urgency to stimulate growth, especially considering the potential impact of increased tariffs. The announcement coincided with the affirmation of upcoming trade talks between Chinese and U.S. officials in Switzerland, signaling a possible turning point in the trade war.</p>

          <p>China experienced a surge in domestic tourism during the May Labor Day holiday, with 314 million trips reported nationwide, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. This increase is attributed to rising interest in cultural and historical sites, as well as improved transportation infrastructure connecting smaller cities. While retail sales have remained tepid, the services sector, including tourism, has shown faster growth, indicating a shift in consumer spending priorities. Chinese cities are also enhancing their efforts to attract tourists through various means, including social media and virtual reality experiences, while the country is expanding its visa-free policies to attract foreign tourists.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce that the United States will officially refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia during his upcoming trip to Saudi Arabia. This decision aligns with the preference of Arab nations, who have historically pushed for the name change, while Iran maintains its ties to the historical designation of the Persian Gulf. The move has the potential to further strain relations between the U.S. and Iran, as the naming of the body of water has become an emotive issue for Iranians.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the Miami Marlins in extra innings, highlighting the team's bullpen fatigue as a growing concern. Journeyman reliever JP Feyereisen gave up a walk-off single in the 10th inning, underscoring the strain on the team's pitching staff. Manager Dave Roberts was forced to use lower-leverage arms due to the workload of his key relievers. The loss exposed the need for the Dodgers to manage their bullpen effectively throughout the long season.</p>

          <p>President Trump displayed a mix of friendly and critical sentiments towards Canada during a meeting with the new Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney. Despite previously suggesting he would like to absorb Canada into the U.S., Trump expressed his love for Canada, but the meeting was marked by underlying tensions stemming from Trump's past rhetoric. Carney firmly stated that Canada was not for sale, while Trump touched on various unrelated topics, highlighting the awkwardness of the encounter.</p>

          <p>China, a major aluminium producer and consumer, may soon reduce its reliance on imported aluminium ore thanks to French technology. A plant in Shanxi province is being upgraded with technology from IB2, a green tech company, which will enable it to produce aluminium from China's low-grade ore that was previously unusable. The process neutralises silica and sulphur, meaning high-silica bauxite can be refined using the Bayer method. IB2 signed a 22-year agreement with Chinese firm Liulin Senze Coal & Aluminum to switch over to the technology in 2023.</p>
