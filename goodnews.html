          <p>Former President Donald Trump suggested that companies should report earnings semiannually instead of quarterly, pending SEC approval, arguing it would save money and allow managers to focus on long-term strategy. Trump likened the current quarterly system to a short-sighted approach compared to China's long-term management perspective. Regulations currently mandate quarterly reports, but forecasts are voluntary and the proposal aligns with practices in the UK and EU, where semiannual reporting is standard. Norway's sovereign wealth fund also proposed a similar switch earlier this year to encourage a longer-term focus for companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently purchased nearly $1 billion worth of Tesla stock, according to a regulatory filing, signaling a move to increase his control over the electric vehicle company. Following the announcement, Tesla shares experienced a jump in premarket trading. Musk has been advocating for a larger stake and increased voting power within Tesla, even suggesting he might develop AI and robotics products outside the company if his demands aren't met. Tesla's board recently proposed a trillion-dollar compensation plan for Musk, indicating their confidence in his leadership amid growing competition and fluctuating EV demand.</p>

McEntire has expressed her commitment to Linn, despite having lost faith in marriage after two divorces. The couple credits their initial connection to texting and talking on the phone, which allowed them to build a deep bond before ever physically being together.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump criticized the NFL's "dynamic kickoff rule," calling it dangerous and detrimental to the sport. He also suggested that American corporations should switch from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports to save money and encourage long-term focus. Trump's proposal may be motivated by a desire to conceal the negative effects of his tariff policies. A federal court previously found that Trump had wrongfully invoked a law to impose his tariff agenda, a decision that is currently under appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the U.S. and China have reached a "framework" deal regarding the social media platform TikTok. According to Bessent, President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet to finalize the terms. The framework could potentially shift the platform towards U.S.-controlled ownership. ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, faces a deadline to divest the platform's U.S. business or face a ban in the country, although this deadline may be extended to finalize the deal.</p>
