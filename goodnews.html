          <p>A drug bust in Northern California resulted in the rescue of three exotic animals, including a young spider monkey named Violeta, now being cared for at the Oakland Zoo. Deputies with the Solano County Sheriff's Office arrested Clifford Vincenty and seized methamphetamine, along with two live rattlesnakes and the spider monkey from his home. Violeta is reported to be in "decent" health and is receiving specialized care at the zoo, highlighting the dangers infant spider monkeys face in the exotic pet trade. Vincenty faces charges related to drug possession and potential violations concerning the possession of exotic animals.</p>

          <p>China Vanke, an indebted property developer, has secured a 1.55 billion yuan (US$215.4 million) loan from state-owned Shenzhen Metro Group, its largest shareholder, to meet debt obligations. The loan has a 36-month term with a below-market interest rate, structured with repayments due every six months and a final installment. This financial support follows a government-led shake-up that tightened control over the developer. Despite this aid, Fitch Ratings downgraded Vanke‚Äôs bonds further into junk territory, reflecting ongoing concerns in the financial markets.</p>

          <p>Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University researcher, has been released from immigration detention after a federal judge ruled his detention violated his rights to free speech and due process. US authorities had accused him of "spreading Hamas propaganda" and having "connections to a known or suspected terrorist", but the judge refuted these claims, finding no evidence of statements supporting Hamas. The case has drawn attention amid concerns about the targeting of students and academics for expressing pro-Palestinian views. While released from detention, Mr. Suri still faces separate deportation proceedings.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after spending over three decades behind bars for the 1989 killings of their parents. The brothers claimed they acted in self-defense after years of alleged physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. The decision has been met with mixed reactions, with relatives rejoicing and the Los Angeles County District Attorney expressing opposition. The case will now go to the California Board of Parole Hearings before potentially reaching the governor's office, marking a significant turn in a case that has captivated public attention for decades.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is set to allow foreign states to own up to 15% of British newspapers and news magazines under new legislation. This decision follows a previous ban on foreign-state ownership prompted by a takeover bid for the Telegraph and the Spectator. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy stated that the changes aim to protect "media plurality" while enabling publishers to raise necessary funding. The new law sets a threshold for State Owned Investors (SOIs) at 15% of shares or voting rights, deemed the most effective and proportionate approach.</p>

Despite this positive trend, experts are concerned about proposed cuts to federal health programs, including those addressing drug addiction, which could undermine the progress made. While acknowledging the role of public health interventions, the CDC emphasized that overdose remains a leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 44.</p>

The brothers' claims of sexual abuse were often mocked, but changing attitudes and the rise of social media have fueled renewed interest in their fate.
