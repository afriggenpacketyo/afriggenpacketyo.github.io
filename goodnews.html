        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of the water sector in England and Wales has revealed significant failures, necessitating stronger regulation to safeguard billpayers and the environment. Led by former Bank of England deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe, the Water Commission's interim findings point to a crisis of public trust due to issues like pollution, financial mismanagement, and infrastructure breakdowns. The review, initiated by the government in response to public concerns about sewage spills and rising costs, has excluded nationalizing the sector as a solution, citing expense and uncertain improvements. The commission seeks to implement more effective oversight to address these systemic problems.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is set to enhance its military capabilities with new nuclear-powered attack submarines and a readiness to engage in European warfare, signaling a firm stance against potential Russian aggression and aiming to reassure allies. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced these sweeping defense changes, the most significant in over three decades, emphasizing the need to address growing threats in various domains, including cyberspace. The government plans to invest heavily in submarine production, weapons stockpiles, and drone technology, while also establishing a cyber command to defend against Russia-linked attacks. While Starmer acknowledged the need for increased defense spending, reaching the 3% GDP target remains an ambition rather than a firm commitment, given the country's strained finances.</p>

This move comes as international restrictions on Syria's financial systems begin to ease, with the United States and Europe lifting sanctions previously imposed under the Assad regime. Additionally, Syria has signed a $7 billion power deal with a consortium of companies to revitalize the country's electricity grid, indicating a broader effort to rebuild and stabilize the nation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has pardoned two Florida shark divers, John Moore Jr. and Tanner Mansell, who were convicted of theft for cutting 19 sharks and a goliath grouper free from a fisherman's longline. The divers believed the longline was illegal and pulled it ashore, but the gear belonged to a vessel permitted by NOAA to harvest sandbar sharks for research. The pardon restores their rights to vote, own firearms, and travel abroad, which they lost upon conviction. The case drew scrutiny, with some questioning the decision to prosecute the divers for attempting to save the sharks.</p>

          <p>President Trump is actively pressuring Senate Republicans to pass a massive tax bill, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which contains the bulk of his legislative agenda. With a narrow majority in both the House and Senate, Republicans are using a special process called reconciliation to pass the bill with a simple majority. Trump is engaging in an "all-out advocacy effort," with White House officials lobbying senators and Trump personally calling them to address concerns about the bill's cost and potential Medicaid cuts. The White House acknowledges that the Senate may need to make some changes to the bill to comply with the Byrd rule, but expects the House to ultimately approve the legislation.</p>
