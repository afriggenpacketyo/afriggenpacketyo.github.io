          <p>Arizona Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego introduced a border security and immigration reform plan that has garnered immediate support from several House Democrats. Gallego's "five-pillar" framework combines Republican priorities, such as increasing Border Patrol staffing, with Democratic goals like creating a "pathway to citizenship" for select migrants, particularly for economic benefit. The plan also seeks to reform the asylum process by expediting claims, enforcing fair resettlement shares among countries, and combating cartel violence, while increasing the annual green card quota and expanding the use of e-Verify.</p>
