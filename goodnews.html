          <h2>Study Suggests Male Childcare Subsidies Could Help Ease China's Demographic Issues</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 23:00:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's involvement in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates, particularly in countries like China. Researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong found that subsidies for fathers yield higher long-term fertility gains compared to solely subsidizing mothers. This innovative policy proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The study analyzed data from 23 countries and highlighted the persistence of traditional expectations that place the burden of childcare primarily on women, conflicting with rapid economic changes.</p>
