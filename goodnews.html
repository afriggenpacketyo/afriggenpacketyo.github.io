        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ExxonMobil announced second-quarter earnings that, while lower than the previous year, exceeded analyst predictions. This outperformance was largely driven by a significant increase in production, which reached its highest level since the Exxon and Mobil merger over 25 years ago, effectively offsetting the impact of declining global oil prices. The company's refining business also saw a substantial profit increase due to higher margins, and Exxon returned $9.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.

He acknowledged that while Soto had a slow start to the season, his performance leading up to the break was deserving of recognition and predicted he would still have a very successful season. </p>

          <p>China has introduced a new anti-money-laundering regulation targeting the precious metals and gems trade to close a significant loophole. Under the new rule, dealers must now report any cash transactions exceeding 100,000 yuan (approximately US$13,870) to the country's financial crime watchdog within five working days. This marks the first time China has extended such supervision beyond traditional financial institutions to a specific non-financial sector, aiming to curb illicit financial flows that exploit the high value and portability of jewels and precious metals.</p>

The cost for selecting a seat will vary based on the route, travel date, and seat location, with preferred and extra-legroom seats carrying additional fees similar to other major airlines. This change is part of a broader overhaul of its business model, which also includes new baggage fees and the introduction of a basic economy fare, moves that follow pressure from investors to increase revenue.</p>

          <p>To attract and retain top talent, family offices, the private investment firms of the ultra-wealthy, are increasingly adopting more structured, long-term incentive plans for their executives. According to a new report, nearly two-thirds of investment-focused family offices now use these plans, which tie compensation to performance and investment returns, moving away from informal handshake agreements. This trend has significantly boosted pay, with median total compensation for CEOs at larger firms exceeding $1.2 million and popular incentives now including co-investment opportunities and carried interest.</p>

          <p>The European Union is set to phase out the unpopular 100-milliliter liquid limit for carry-on luggage after approving new CT scanners capable of detecting liquid explosives. This advanced technology provides high-resolution 3D images, allowing security to thoroughly inspect bags without passengers removing liquids. While the rule change is not immediate and depends on individual airports installing the new equipment, hubs across the EU are beginning to adopt the scanners, signaling a future of more convenient and faster security procedures for air travelers.</p>

          <p>Veteran actor Brian Cox is returning to the Scottish stage in "Make It Happen," a new play at the Edinburgh International Festival about the historic collapse of the Royal Bank of Scotland. Cox, known for his role in "Succession," portrays the ghost of economist Adam Smith in the biting satire, which explores the financial crisis and its cultural impact. At 79, Cox stated his focus is on protest and advocating for better conditions for people, reflecting on his own working-class roots in Dundee as a formative influence on his perspective.</p>

The team believes a conclusive victory is necessary to solidify their legacy, especially against an Australian side that has been competitive but is considered a moderate opponent.</p>

          <p>The European Union has confirmed it will replace passport stamping with a new biometric Entry/Exit System (EES) for non-EU travelers, including those from the UK, beginning October 12.

While the EES aims to enhance security and eventually speed up border crossings, officials have warned travelers to prepare for potential delays during the initial implementation phase.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from Vanguard indicates that having an emergency fund acts as a crucial "security blanket" for retirement savings by reducing the likelihood of early 401(k) withdrawals. The study found that investors with at least $2,000 in emergency savings are significantly less likely to take out 401(k) loans or make hardship withdrawals to cover unexpected expenses. This is particularly important for hourly workers with volatile incomes, as so-called "leakage" from retirement plans can severely impede long-term financial security. (not investment advice)</p>

While hydrogen production faces controversy over its energy and water intensity, proponents see it as a vital, low-emission fuel source for decarbonizing hard-to-electrify sectors like heavy-duty trucking.</p>

          <p>A new California state law, AB 130, has unexpectedly amended the rules governing homeowners associations (HOAs), capping most fines for violations at $100. This change is a significant victory for homeowners who have long complained about aggressive and overbearing HOAs, as seen in the case of a woman facing $500 daily fines for an unapproved interior doorway. The law, which also bans interest and late fees on violations, has surprised the HOA industry, which now fears its ability to enforce community rules on issues like short-term rentals has been severely weakened.</p>
