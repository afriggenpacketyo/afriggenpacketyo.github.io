          <p>The New York Knicks rallied from a 20-point deficit to defeat the Indiana Pacers 106-100 in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals, with Karl-Anthony Towns scoring 20 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter and Jalen Brunson adding 23 points. This victory marked the Knicks' third 20-point comeback win of the playoffs, an NBA record, as they previously achieved similar comebacks against the Boston Celtics. The Pacers, led by Tyrese Haliburton with 20 points, failed to capitalize on their lead, allowing the Knicks to cut the series deficit to 2-1. The Knicks are the first team in NBA history to stage three 20-point comebacks wins in a single postseason; the Knicks also had 20-point comeback wins against the Boston Celtics in the conference semi-finals. The score was close towards the end.</p>
