It details the holiday's origins in the late 19th-century labor movement, which fought for better working conditions and fair wages. The article also serves as a practical guide for consumers, outlining which major retail stores, grocery chains, and fast-food restaurants will be open, while noting that government offices, banks, and the U.S. Postal Service will be closed. Information on typical holiday sales is also mentioned for those looking to shop over the long weekend.</p>

          <p>Shares of bitcoin miner and data center operator TeraWulf surged over 10% following an announcement that Google is increasing its stake in the company to 14%. The deal involves Google providing up to $1.4 billion in additional backstop funding, bringing its total to approximately $3.2 billion, to support the expansion of TeraWulf's facility in New York. This development follows a recent spike in the company's stock after it signed significant long-term computing deals with AI cloud provider Fluidstack. The increased investment is seen as a strategic move to build out advanced artificial intelligence infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in JAMA Network Open reveals that the availability of over-the-counter birth control pills is significantly impacting contraceptive use in the United States. Researchers found that nearly a third of people who obtained the OTC pill, Opill, had previously been using no form of contraception at all. The study highlights that the OTC option is particularly beneficial for individuals facing barriers to healthcare, such as the uninsured, younger people, and those in rural areas. The primary reason cited for choosing the OTC pill was the convenience of not needing a doctor's appointment to get a prescription.</p>

          <p>Actress Sophie Turner described kissing her "Game of Thrones" co-star Kit Harington for their new film as a "vile" experience due to their close, sibling-like relationship. Turner and Harington, who played siblings Sansa Stark and Jon Snow, have remained close friends since the show concluded. She explained on a late-night talk show that after she recommended Harington for the role in their upcoming horror movie "The Dreadful," they realized the script required them to kiss, which made them both feel like "retching" on set. Despite the awkwardness, they proceeded with the film because they felt the script was too good to refuse.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trend dubbed "job hugging" has replaced the "great resignation," with American workers now clinging to their current roles amid economic uncertainty. The rate at which employees voluntarily quit their jobs has fallen to its lowest consistent level in nearly a decade, reflecting a cooling labor market and decreased confidence in finding new employment. This stagnation is driven by factors like higher interest rates, slowing job growth, and a reduced ratio of job openings to unemployed workers. While providing stability, experts warn that job hugging could lead to wage stagnation and skill atrophy for employees. (not investment advice)</p>

This passive approach ensures that money is consistently put to work in an investment an individual already trusts. Using the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) as an example, the article notes a significant difference in cumulative returns over a decade for those who reinvested dividends versus those who did not.

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire and hostage release proposal presented by Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The deal is reportedly based on a two-stage framework that includes an initial 60-day truce in exchange for the release of some of the remaining Israeli hostages. Negotiations for a permanent ceasefire would also take place during this period. Israel's response remains uncertain, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has recently stated a preference for a deal that releases all hostages at once. This development occurs amid intense Israeli military operations in Gaza and large-scale protests in Israel demanding a deal.</p>

          <p>Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, a long-time and influential leader of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, is scheduled to enter a guilty plea in a Brooklyn federal court on drug trafficking charges. Zambada, who was arrested in Texas last year, faces accusations of orchestrating a vast and violent criminal enterprise responsible for murder, torture, and smuggling enormous quantities of illicit drugs into the United States. This development comes after federal prosecutors announced they would not seek the death penalty. The plea marks a significant moment in U.S. efforts to dismantle the leadership of one of the world's most powerful drug trafficking organizations.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Offer Guidance on the Optimal Age for a Reverse Mortgage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 13:01:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With high home values and rising retirement costs, many seniors are considering reverse mortgages to access their home equity. This article consults financial experts to determine the best age to take out such a loan, for which homeowners must typically be at least 62. Experts suggest that waiting until one's late 60s or early 70s is often ideal, as older borrowers can access a larger percentage of their home's value. The decision should also factor in long-term goals, health, plans to age in place, and other available retirement income sources, as taking a reverse mortgage too early can deplete equity needed for future expenses or inheritances.

          <p>State health officials in Texas have officially declared an end to the measles outbreak that began in January and resulted in 762 confirmed cases. The declaration was made after 42 consecutive days—double the disease's maximum incubation period—passed without a new reported case in affected counties. The outbreak, centered in West Texas, predominantly affected children and tragically led to the deaths of two unvaccinated children. The Texas Department of State Health Services credited the containment to a robust public health response, including widespread testing, vaccination efforts, and public education campaigns, but warned that new cases are still possible due to ongoing outbreaks elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Conservative media network Newsmax has agreed to a $67 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems, resolving a defamation lawsuit over the airing of false claims about the 2020 presidential election. The settlement was disclosed in an SEC filing and follows a similar, larger settlement paid by Fox News to Dominion in 2023. A Delaware judge had already ruled that Newsmax defamed Dominion, with internal communications revealed in the case showing that network officials knew the election fraud allegations were baseless. Despite the settlement, Newsmax issued a statement maintaining that its coverage was fair and within professional journalistic standards.</p>

          <p>The cable news channel MSNBC is set to change its name to MS NOW and will no longer use the iconic NBC peacock logo. This rebranding is part of a larger corporate restructuring, as the channel spins off from its parent company, Comcast's NBC Universal, into a new entity called Versant. The new name, which stands for My Source News Opinion World, is intended to create a distinct identity for the network as it becomes an independent newsgathering organization. The spinoff will also include other NBC Universal cable channels like CNBC and USA, which will also drop the peacock logo but largely retain their existing names.</p>

          <p>As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visits Washington, an analysis of international support shows that European countries combined have committed more financial aid to Ukraine than the United States. According to the Kiel Institute, European nations have provided $165.7 billion in total support, compared to $130.6 billion from the U.S. since Russia's full-scale invasion. While the U.S. remains the largest single-country donor, these figures challenge claims that Europe is not contributing its fair share. The aid from both sides consists of a mix of grants and loans, though the U.S. has provided a larger proportion as grants compared to the European Union.</p>

This price is less than half of the drug's current monthly list price of nearly $1,350. The discount will be available through various platforms, including the company's direct-to-consumer online pharmacy and the drug savings company GoodRx. This move aims to expand access for uninsured or underinsured Type 2 diabetes patients and to encourage the use of the branded medication over potentially unsafe compounded alternatives.</p>
