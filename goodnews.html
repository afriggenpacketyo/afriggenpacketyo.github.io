          <p>A 20-story New York City Housing Authority building in the Bronx experienced a partial collapse after a boiler room explosion on Wednesday morning, leaving a gaping hole on one side. Despite extensive damage to the building and surrounding area, remarkably, no injuries or fatalities were reported. Initial reports suggest the blast occurred as an individual was activating the heating system for the season, with shockwaves traveling up the chimney. Mayor Eric Adams and other officials visited the scene, expressing immense gratitude that a major disaster was averted. The article also notes the building had prior unsafe facade violations.</p>

          <p>Dame Jane Goodall, the world-renowned conservationist and pioneering primatologist, has passed away at the age of 91, drawing tributes from global figures including former US President Barack Obama and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. Her groundbreaking discoveries, such as observing chimpanzees using tools, revolutionized evolutionary science and significantly reshaped our understanding of primate behavior. Goodall's unique approach, which involved closely associating with and naming the animals she studied, humanized them for the world. Beyond her scientific contributions, she became a tireless activist for animal welfare and climate action, leaving an extraordinary legacy through her Jane Goodall Institute.</p>

          <p>Consumers in Hong Kong and mainland China are demonstrating adaptation to record-high gold prices, which have surged over 48% this year, as robust demand for wedding jewelry persists. Despite the significant increase, with gold for jewelry reaching HK$42,840 per tael, many couples are continuing to purchase traditional wedding items like dragon and phoenix bracelets as their wedding dates approach. A spokesman for Chow Tai Fook, a major jeweler, noted that consumers have gradually adjusted to these elevated price levels since March of last year. This article underscores the enduring cultural importance of gold in wedding traditions, even in the face of considerable market fluctuations.</p>

          <p>Raymond Cruz, the actor known for his role as an antagonist in "Breaking Bad," will not face criminal charges following a parking dispute where three women accused him of intentionally spraying them with water. The Los Angeles city attorney’s office announced the decision to decline criminal charges, though a specific reason was not publicly provided. Cruz's agent previously stated that the actor was washing his car when a group of women parked excessively close to his vehicle and subsequently refused his request to move. The agent maintained that any water splashing on the women was incidental, occurring as Cruz turned to ask them to cease recording the interaction. This article details the conclusion of a minor celebrity legal matter.</p>

          <p>Maxwell House coffee has launched a viral marketing campaign, playfully rebranding itself as "Maxwell Apartment Coffee" to humorously address the severe unaffordability of housing in the US. The campaign highlights stark statistics, noting that the median age of first-time homebuyers has reached an all-time high of 38, and the proportion of homes sold to this demographic is at a record low. Offering a "12-month lease" of coffee for under $40, the initiative aims to forge a connection with coffee-loving renters, a rapidly growing population across the country. This article details how a 133-year-old brand is cleverly leveraging a significant contemporary social issue for marketing relevance and brand strengthening.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit filed by Spencer Elden, who appeared as a naked four-month-old baby on Nirvana's iconic "Nevermind" album cover, has been dismissed for a second time. Elden claimed the image constituted child pornography and caused him ongoing harm, seeking damages from the band's surviving members and photographer. Judge Fernando Olguin ruled that no reasonable jury would consider the image child pornography, likening it to a "family photo of a nude child bathing." The judge also dismissed Elden's claim that his injuries extended into adulthood, which would have allowed him to bypass the statute of limitations.

          <p>A US judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the federal government from diverting or withdrawing $34 million in funding specifically designated to protect New York City's transportation system from terrorist attacks. Judge Lewis A.

New York had sued, emphasizing the critical need for these funds given the city's history as a prominent target for terrorist activities.

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders employed a unique form of silent protest, literally muting himself when asked by reporters about being passed over for the starting quarterback role. After fellow first-year QB Dillon Gabriel was promoted to starter for Week 5, Sanders responded to multiple questions with broad smiles and pantomimed answers, but uttered no actual words. This behavior is speculated to be a reaction to critical remarks made by former NFL coach Rex Ryan, who took issue with Sanders' previous comments about his own playing capabilities compared to other NFL quarterbacks.
