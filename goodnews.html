          <p>Japanese markets reacted positively to Prime Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation announcement, with the Nikkei 225 rising 1.5% and the Topix reaching a record high. Investors are eyeing potential successors like Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae, with Takaichi, known for favoring deregulation and opposing interest rate hikes, seen as a candidate to drive growth. Despite the market rally, the Japanese yen weakened, and government bond yields continued to climb due to persistent inflation and fiscal uncertainty. Analysts from BMI anticipate extended uncertainty for Japan into Q4 2025, although the market's initial response signals optimism for new leadership (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Chinese humanoid robot startup X Square Robot secured approximately $100 million in a funding round led by Alibaba Cloud, bringing its total investment to $280 million in less than two years. The Shenzhen-based company also released Wall-OSS, an open-source foundation model for embodied AI, aiming for "robotic butlers" within five years. While acknowledging that AI for robots lags behind generative AI advancements, the startup sees significant potential for integration with hardware. X Square Robot is already generating revenue from sales to schools, hotels, and retirement homes, and plans an IPO next year, expecting consumer robot prices to drop to $10,000 in three to five years.</p>

          <p>A collaborative China-U.S. study, utilizing seismic waves from marsquakes recorded by NASA's now-retired InSight lander, has unexpectedly discovered a solid inner core within Mars. This core, approximately 600km in radius, constitutes about 18% of Mars's total radius, a proportion similar to Earth's inner core. The finding challenges previous assumptions, as most solar system bodies have not cooled sufficiently fast to form a solid inner core. This significant discovery could also revive long-debated theories that Mars, like Earth and the moon, may have once developed plate tectonics, profoundly expanding our understanding of planetary evolution and internal structures.</p>

          <h2>Carlos Alcaraz Wins Second U.S. Open Title in Match Delayed by Trump's Controversial Attendance</h2>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz secured his second U.S. Open title by defeating rival Jannik Sinner in four sets, but the match was notably delayed due to enhanced security for President Trump's attendance. Trump, who watched from a luxury box, received mixed reactions from the crowd, and broadcasters were reportedly advised to edit out any crowd response. This appearance, marking the first time a sitting president attended the U.S. Open in over two decades, occurred weeks after Trump imposed tariffs on Swiss products, raising questions given Rolex's sponsorship. Alcaraz, now world No. 1, humorously acknowledged his frequent matchups with Sinner.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Robinson, 29, experienced the "biggest shock of her life" when she unexpectedly gave birth to her son, Henry, in a football club toilet, having been unaware she was pregnant. Cryptic pregnancies, where mothers are unaware until labor, affect about one in 2,500 births. Robinson reported no typical pregnancy symptoms, mistaking hip pain for a pre-existing condition. An off-duty paramedic assisted until an ambulance arrived at the Lowestoft ground, where 600 people were present. The couple named their son Henry James in memory of a family friend, adding a poignant layer to the surreal and miraculous event.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles has acquired the historic Griffith Park carousel for $1 million, a "crown jewel" where Walt Disney reportedly conceived Disneyland, with plans for its restoration and reopening. The carousel, one of California's oldest wooden merry-go-rounds and designed by Spillman Engineering Corp., ceased operation in 2022 following its previous operator's death and a need for repairs. Its purchase is part of a broader park restoration project set to be completed before the 2028 Olympic Games. Despite needing significant repairs, including being unable to move by hand, the city secured the ride for a favorable price, aiming to preserve this beloved cultural landmark for future generations.</p>

          <p>Global investors are diversifying away from U.S. equities for the first time in a decade, increasingly moving capital into Asia, according to Bank of America (BofA) research. This shift is driven by a weakening U.S. dollar, anticipated easing of Federal Reserve monetary policy, and Asia's burgeoning artificial intelligence market, which BofA expects to quadruple to nearly $1.2 trillion by 2030, with $1 trillion deployed in Asia-Pacific. While U.S. equities saw significant inflows previously, current allocations are evenly split, with Asia offering attractive valuations and substantial stimulus potential compared to expensive U.S. stocks (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Chrysler has issued a recall for over 90,000 Jeep Grand Cherokees, specifically 2022-2026 plug-in hybrid electric models, due to a software error in the hybrid control processor. This defect could lead to an unexpected "loss of drive power," significantly increasing the risk of vehicle crashes without prior warning. Fortunately, Chrysler reported no known injuries or accidents related to this issue as of mid-August, indicating the recall is a preventative measure. A remedy is currently under development, and affected vehicle owners will be notified starting October 23, with VIN checks available on the NHTSA website from September 11. This proactive recall aims to address a serious safety concern and ensure driver safety.</p>

          <p>Stargazers across Asia, and parts of Europe and Africa, witnessed a "blood moon" during a total lunar eclipse on Sunday night, a celestial event that has captivated humanity for millennia. This phenomenon occurs when the sun, Earth, and moon align, causing Earth's shadow to cast an eerie, deep red hue on the moon. The distinctive red color is attributed to sunlight reflecting and scattering through Earth's atmosphere, where shorter blue wavelengths disperse more easily, allowing red light to reach the moon. People in Asia, including India and China, had the best view, while Europeans and Africans enjoyed a partial eclipse as the moon rose, creating a spectacular display for observers.</p>

          <p>John Burton, a prominent and unabashedly liberal former U.S. congressman and California Democrat, has died at 92 from natural causes in San Francisco. Known for his fierce advocacy for the working class, foster children, and the environment, Burton mentored numerous political figures, including Nancy Pelosi. Governor Gavin Newsom praised him as a "towering figure" who shaped California politics. After stepping down from Congress in 1982 to address a cocaine addiction, Burton returned to state politics and later chaired the California Democratic Party. He also founded a nonprofit for foster youth, leaving a lasting legacy of fighting for the underdog.</p>
