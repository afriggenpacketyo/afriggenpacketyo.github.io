          <p>A recent study published in Frontiers in Psychology explored the relationship between food and sleep, finding that certain foods may influence dreams. Among over 1,000 participants, 5.5% reported that their food choices affected their dreams, with dairy products and sweets being most frequently blamed for causing nightmares. The researchers suggest that the link between dairy and bad dreams might be related to gastrointestinal distress from lactose intolerance during sleep, which could negatively impact the dreaming process.</p>

          <p>This article provides a guide to current interest rates for certificates of deposit (CDs), which offer a safe way to earn returns that can outpace inflation. While national average yields for one-year CDs are around 2.01%, top online banks are offering rates over 4.40%. The piece advises savers to look at online banks, which typically have lower overhead and higher rates, and to consider short-term CDs, as the current inverted yield curve means they often have higher rates than long-term options.

          <p>With millions of Americans burdened by medical debt, this article outlines potential pathways for relief. Options include hospital charity care, which federal law requires nonprofit hospitals to provide for low-income patients, potentially forgiving bills entirely. For those who don't qualify, debt settlement companies can negotiate to reduce balances, though this may impact credit. As a final resort, filing for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy can eliminate or restructure overwhelming medical and other unsecured debts for those who meet the criteria.</p>

The governor and housing advocates argue the changes are essential to streamline housing development and address the state's severe housing shortage and homelessness crisis. The controversial law was passed despite opposition from environmental groups, who are concerned about the potential impact of weakening the 1970s-era regulations that mandate strict environmental reviews for new projects.</p>
