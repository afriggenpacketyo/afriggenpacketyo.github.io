          <p>Amid President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies, consumers are facing potential price increases and shortages. To mitigate the impact on household budgets, experts advise looking for sales events like Memorial Day, Father's Day, and Amazon Prime Day. Consumers should also check the origin of products, prioritizing domestic goods and those exempt under agreements like the USMCA, to avoid tariffs. Electronics and toys are expected to be hit hardest by tariffs, so consider purchasing them sooner rather than later, but avoid panic buying.</p>

Smith's narrative also shares the stories of individuals and families participating in research trials, donating brains, and caring for each other while anticipating their own decline.
