          <p>Doordash has announced its acquisition of restaurant booking platform SevenRooms for $1.2 billion, a move aimed at expanding its services beyond food delivery. However, the company's first-quarter revenue fell short of expectations, reporting $3.03 billion against an expected $3.09 billion. This mixed news highlights the challenges Doordash faces in balancing growth through acquisitions with meeting financial targets in a competitive market. The acquisition of SevenRooms will allow Doordash to integrate booking services, offering a more comprehensive platform for restaurants and consumers alike. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Reddit user ignited a viral debate after sharing his discomfort with a friend of his girlfriend's request to use their kitchen for an entire week. The user, who enjoys cooking and considers the kitchen his personal space, felt the request was entitled and lacked social consideration. While some commenters sided with the user, deeming the request absurd, others viewed it as a normal request, suggesting the friend might miss cooking due to dorm living. Etiquette expert Diane Gottsman advises setting boundaries and suggests the friend should offer some form of compensation for the extended use of the kitchen.</p>

          <p>China is actively engaging in a charm offensive across Africa, aiming to rally opposition against what it describes as American ‚Äúbullying‚Äù tactics. Through diplomatic meetings, media outreach, and online campaigns, Chinese officials are positioning China as a more dependable ally for development compared to the US, especially in light of tariffs and foreign aid reductions. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi emphasized China's commitment to sharing modernization opportunities with African nations during a Brics foreign ministers' meeting. Experts suggest that the former Biden administration‚Äôs handling of the Gaza war and Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù policies have created an opening for China to strengthen its influence on the continent.</p>

          <p>Japan's former Emperor Akihito was admitted to a Tokyo hospital for a thorough medical examination following an earlier checkup that revealed potential signs of myocardial ischemia. The 91-year-old will undergo a series of tests at the University of Tokyo Hospital to assess his condition. Despite the findings, the Imperial Household Agency reports that Emperor Akihito has not exhibited any symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia, which involves reduced blood flow to the heart muscles. The hospitalization comes amid ongoing concerns about the health of the former emperor.</p>

          <p>The Taiwan dollar experienced a pullback after a historic surge that saw it reach multi-decade gains, fueled by speculation of pressure from Washington to strengthen the currency. Despite the recent volatility, the Taiwanese dollar remains significantly up against the U.S. dollar year-to-date. Experts attribute the currency's movements to exporters converting U.S. dollar reserves and life insurers hedging their U.S. dollar debt. While Taiwan's central bank denies intervening to influence exchange rates, analysts suggest that currency rates might be part of broader trade discussions with the U.S.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions with the United States, China has largely avoided measures that would significantly de-dollarize its economy, according to an Oxford Economics report. The report suggests that China's export-oriented economy necessitates substantial dollar assets, and the country lacks readily available alternatives for its vast foreign exchange reserves. Instead of selling off US Treasury assets, China is more likely to weaken the yuan to support its exporters. This approach underscores China's cautious stance in navigating the trade war and its reluctance to disrupt the global financial system.</p>

          <p>While overall inflation remains above target levels, consumers are experiencing price declines in several sectors, including airfare, produce, household goods, and electronics.

However, economists caution that these lower prices may not last, as tariffs and other factors could put upward pressure on consumer prices in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>
