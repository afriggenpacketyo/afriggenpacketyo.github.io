        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A proposal to eliminate federal income taxes on tips, championed by President Trump, is gaining bipartisan support, though concerns remain about its potential impact. While tipped workers could see an average tax cut of $1,260, some economists and restaurant groups argue that the policy could create wage disparities between tipped and non-tipped workers. The article also explores the complexities of who would truly benefit, noting that lower-income workers already owing no federal income taxes might not see additional relief. The debate highlights the challenges of crafting tax policies that benefit specific industries without creating unintended consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

The collection of 2,500 items includes photographs, letters, and information about his undercover work and final moments. The Mossad, in collaboration with an allied foreign government, retrieved the archives. Cohen's intelligence gathering in Syria in the early 1960s is credited with helping Israel win the Arab-Israeli War of 1967.

          <p>A conservative Republican representative expressed opposition to a proposal from a moderate colleague to raise taxes on high-income earners to address the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap issue. Representative Nick LaLota suggested increasing the top tax bracket to 39.6% to help pay for higher SALT deduction caps, which primarily benefit people in high-cost-of-living areas. Representative Ralph Norman argued that higher taxes on the wealthy would negatively impact the economy.

The initiative, both during his vice presidency and presidency, focused on improving cancer screening, research, and data sharing.

The 30-year Treasury yield briefly topped 5% before retreating slightly. Investors initially reacted negatively to the downgrade but later shook it off with bond buying. The downgrade puts Moody's in line with other major credit rating agencies that had already given the U.S. their second-highest available rating. (not investment advice)</p>
