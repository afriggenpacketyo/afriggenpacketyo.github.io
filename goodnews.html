          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, was released from ICE custody following a federal judge's order in Vermont, who criticized the government's lack of evidence against her beyond an op-ed she co-wrote criticizing the university's response to resolutions related to Palestine and Israel. Ozturk's legal team argued that the Trump administration targeted her for her views, while the Department of Homeland Security accused her of supporting Hamas. The judge highlighted declarations attesting to her peaceful character and ordered her immediate release, citing First Amendment concerns. During the hearing, Ozturk discussed her humanitarian work and the worsening of her asthma condition while in detention.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, was released from an immigration detention facility in Louisiana after a judge ordered her release, citing concerns about her First Amendment rights. She was detained for six weeks after being arrested by masked officers, sparking nationwide protests. The Department of Homeland Security accused her of supporting Hamas, but the judge found the administration's evidence limited to an op-ed she co-authored. The ACLU welcomed her release, emphasizing that no one should be imprisoned for expressing their beliefs, while Tufts University expressed pleasure and looked forward to her return to campus.</p>

          <p>This Kyodo News digest summarizes several key events: Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has no plans to reduce consumption tax despite calls for relief amid inflation and tariffs. President Trump indicated he might lower tariffs on China to 80% ahead of trade meetings, while also stating he will maintain a 10% baseline tariff for all countries. The US military and Okinawa authorities held their first safety forum following sexual assault allegations. Senior North Korean military officers greeted President Putin at a WWII anniversary event, and Myanmar's junta chief met with China's Xi Jinping for the first time since the 2021 coup. Panasonic also announced it would lay off 10,000 employees as part of restructuring.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>State regulators announced that tap water is now safe to drink in all areas affected by the firestorms in Altadena and Pacific Palisades. The Las Flores Water Co. in Altadena, the last utility with a "do not drink" notice, was cleared to resume delivering drinking water after four months. State and local utilities worked to assess damage, test for potential contamination like benzene, and restore pressure to the systems. Approximately 23,000 water customers were affected by the notices, and the restoration of service reflects the considerable effort undertaken by each utility, according to experts.</p>

          <p>An Amtrak Office of the Inspector General report revealed that over 100 current and former Amtrak employees conspired with New York medical professionals to defraud the company's health care plan of over $12 million. The scheme involved employees accepting cash in exchange for using their insurance information to file fraudulent claims for services never provided. Twelve employees and three healthcare providers have been criminally charged, with several employees pleading guilty to health care fraud conspiracy charges. Amtrak is considering disciplinary action for the remaining active employees involved and is calling on medical benefit providers to do more to identify and stop medical insurance fraud.</p>

          <p>The US and China are set to resume trade talks in Switzerland, marking the first high-level meeting since the US imposed tariffs on China in January. Despite previous tensions, both sides have signaled a willingness to break the deadlock, driven by economic pressures from the levies. Factory output in China has been affected, while uncertainty from tariffs led to economic contraction in the US. Trump has acknowledged that US consumers will feel the sting of the tariffs. Analysts suggest the talks aim to reassure nervous markets and domestic constituencies.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student, was released from immigration detention after a federal judge ruled her continued detention could chill free speech. The judge stated there was minimal evidence against her, primarily an essay critical of Israel. The Department of Homeland Security had accused her of supporting Hamas. Ozturk's lawyers argued she was detained in retaliation for her speech, and the conditions at the detention center were exacerbating her asthma. The judge's decision marks another defeat for government efforts to deport international students associated with pro-Palestinian advocacy.</p>

The exact location of the landing remains unknown, but its orbit places it between 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south latitude. If pieces of the spacecraft are recovered, they legally belong to Russia.</p>
