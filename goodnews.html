Allen, who briefly retired from boxing, expressed gratitude for the atmosphere and vowed to continue his career. Makhmudov's imposing record made him Allen's toughest opponent, and the fight saw moments of intense action. Allen has faced setbacks before, and his resilience suggests he will aim to rebuild his career once again. Optimism score is not contained in this summary.</p>

This shift, which has been occurring for over a century, will give most people an extra hour of sleep, though night shift workers will work an extra hour. The change will occur at 02:00 BST on Sunday, October 26. While the UK has experimented with year-round BST, there are ongoing debates about the benefits and drawbacks of such a change.

While flu cases are increasing among younger age groups, overall illness levels are not exceptionally high. Vaccination remains the most effective way to protect against severe illness, particularly for vulnerable individuals.
