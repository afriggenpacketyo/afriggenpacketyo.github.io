          <p>Elizabeth Holmes, the former CEO of Theranos, had her appeal of her 2022 fraud conviction denied by the 9th Circuit of Appeals. Holmes is currently serving an 11-year prison sentence for defrauding investors in the failed blood-testing startup. The federal panel rejected Holmes' request for a hearing before the court, with no judge requesting a vote to hear the case, effectively upholding the original conviction. The case underscores the legal consequences for executives found guilty of misleading investors about their company's capabilities.</p>
