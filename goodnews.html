        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At China's Canton Fair, exporters are observing a significant increase in yuan-denominated trade settlements, reflecting a warming trend towards the Chinese currency in international commerce. Customers from countries including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Central Asian nations like Kazakhstan are actively requesting yuan for transactions, and new clients are being encouraged to consider it. For some companies, yuan-settled orders now account for 10-20% of their total exports, a substantial rise from single-digit figures last year. This growth is partly attributed to Chinese suppliers' involvement in overseas data center projects and the ongoing demand for essential power infrastructure in developing countries, signaling a strategic shift in global payment preferences and a move away from traditional currencies.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are poised for a higher open on Tuesday, extending positive momentum from the week's start, largely driven by strong performances in the region's defense sector. Major indices like the U.K.'s FTSE, Germany's DAX, and France's CAC 40 are projected to rise. Defense companies such as Thyssenkrupp and Rheinmetall saw significant gains following the spinout and IPO of TKMS and geopolitical tensions. This article highlights that U.S. stock futures and Asia-Pacific markets also traded higher, with South Korea's Kospi index jumping over 2% to a sixth consecutive record high, spurred by optimism around an impending U.S. trade deal. Investors are now awaiting a busy earnings week from companies like Netflix and Coca-Cola, which could further inform market trajectory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sanae Takaichi has made history by winning Japan's parliamentary vote, becoming the country's first woman prime minister. Her victory, securing 237 votes in the Lower House, follows a coalition agreement between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Japan Innovation Party, though JIP may support from outside the cabinet. Domestic stock markets, particularly the Nikkei 225, cheered her ascendancy, hitting a fresh high in what experts are calling the "Takaichi trade," driven by expectations of looser monetary policy and larger fiscal stimulus. This article notes Takaichi's challenging path to power and her hardline conservative views, often labeled an apostle of "Abenomics," advocating for a tough stance on China and revising Japan's pacifist constitution, while also needing to maintain good international relations.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi has been officially appointed as Japan's first female prime minister, winning a majority in the lower house and set to meet the Emperor later on Tuesday. Her ascendancy comes amidst the ruling LDP's declining support and a recent coalition exit by the Komeito party, leading to an alliance with the right-leaning Japan Innovation Party. Takaichi, a former heavy metal drummer, has pledged to strengthen Japan's economy and form a government with "Nordic" numbers of women, while also vowing to raise awareness about women's health struggles. This article notes her conservative stance on issues like requiring married couples to share the same surname and male-only imperial succession, reflecting a complex blend of progressive and traditional views in a heavily male-dominated society.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight was diverted to Salt Lake City last week after an object struck its windshield at 36,000 feet, causing it to crack and injuring the pilot. WindBorne Systems, a smart weather balloon company, has since stated the object may have been one of their weather balloons and is cooperating with investigations by the FAA and NTSB. The company has already implemented changes to minimize time spent at high altitudes and is accelerating plans for autonomous plane avoidance, alongside new hardware designs to reduce impact force. This article notes that while aircraft windshields are designed for durability, experts consider a strike at such a high altitude by a bird to be rare, pointing instead to objects with sufficient mass like drones or weather balloons.</p>

The project, funded partly by a $5 million voter-approved bond and additional fundraising, will feature marine-grade concrete sculptures. The first phase involves 22 concrete cars, created by artist Leandro Ehrlich, arranged as an underwater traffic jam, serving as "flowerpots" for corals. Colin Foord of Coral Morphologic is cultivating resilient soft corals to be transplanted onto the structures, transforming them into living reefs visible to snorkelers just 700 feet offshore. This article highlights that the project aims to recreate the offshore coral reef that existed until the 1970s and will include an onshore marine learning center.</p>

          <p>A new theory called "winology" is gaining traction online, positing that China's economic and technological advancements are unfairly dismissed in Western nations due to hierarchical thinking. Coined by Chinese academics, "winology" explores how countries can achieve global leadership and gain recognition for it. Online discussions have interpreted this viewpoint as suggesting a class system for global citizens, with Germanic peoples as "first-class" and Chinese as "fourth-class." This article notes that the theory is attracting academic attention in China, with seminars held at major universities like Wuhan and Tsinghua, fostering intellectual debate around international perceptions and China's global standing, as discussed by Yu Liang of Fudan University.</p>
