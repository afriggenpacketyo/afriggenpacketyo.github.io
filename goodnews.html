          <p>Germany's defense minister, Boris Pistorius, has indicated that compulsory military service could be reintroduced if a new volunteer system fails to meet the army's recruitment goals. The new military service model will initially rely on voluntary enlistment, but the government is preparing legislation to make recruitment mandatory if needed. Concerns about national defense readiness and evolving security threats in Europe, particularly following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, have intensified the debate over reinstating conscription, which was suspended in 2011. The government aims to have the new bill in force by January 2026, also including efforts to reactivate more reservists.</p>

          <p>A major power outage in southeast France, suspected to be caused by arson, disrupted the final day of the Cannes Film Festival, threatening to impact the closing celebrations. Authorities are investigating a fire at an electrical substation near Cannes, which weakened the grid, as well as a collapsed high-voltage line at another location. Power was restored hours before the closing ceremony, which proceeded as planned, thanks to an independent power supply at the Palais des Festivals. The outage affected approximately 160,000 households, causing traffic jams and the closure of shops.</p>

Despite a 2010 ban on filmmaking, Panahi has continued to create acclaimed work, making his Cannes prominence a statement against theocratic disapproval. The film is about state violence and revenge, about the pain of tyranny that co-exists with ostensible everyday normality.</p>

          <p>A power cut in southern France, suspected to be caused by sabotage, disrupted screenings on the final day of the Cannes Film Festival. Approximately 160,000 homes in Cannes and surrounding areas lost power due to an electricity substation being set on fire and a pylon at another location being damaged. Despite the disruption, the festival's closing ceremony proceeded as planned, thanks to an alternative power supply. French authorities are investigating the incident as a case of sabotage.</p>

          <p>Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi's revenge thriller "It Was Just an Accident" won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, marking a significant win for the director who had been banned from leaving Iran. The film tells the story of five ordinary Iranians who are confronted with a man they believed tortured them in jail. The win extends the indie distributor Neon's unprecedented streak of backing the last six Palme d'Or winners. The Cannes closing ceremony followed a major power outage that struck southeastern France on Saturday in what police suspected was arson.</p>

          <p>In his West Point commencement address, Donald Trump told graduating cadets they were entering a defining moment in the army's history, while also weaving in political attacks and anecdotes. He criticized past leaders for involving the military in nation-building and boasted of his administration's achievements, including curbing illegal immigration. Trump also repeated a cautionary tale about the unhappy retirement of William Levitt, the developer of Levittowns. He claimed that Russia had stolen US hypersonic missile technology during Barack Obama‚Äôs presidency, a claim he has made previously.</p>

          <p>Iranian director Jafar Panahi won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for his highly political film "It Was Just an Accident," despite facing decades of state censorship and imprisonment. Panahi, who was banned from filmmaking and international travel in 2010, found creative ways to continue making films in secret. The film tells the story of ex-prisoners who confront a man they believe tortured them, drawing on Panahi's personal experiences. The award highlights Panahi's defiance and his commitment to filmmaking as a form of resistance.</p>
