          <p>The family of Army Reservist Sgt. Kennedy Sanders, who was killed in a drone attack in Jordan, has received her lost cellphone more than a year after her death. The phone, which the family believed was destroyed, was discovered in a lost and found on the base by another staff sergeant who made it his mission to return it. After charging the device and finding "Mama Bear" as an emergency contact, he successfully sent it back to her parents. The family described the return of the phone, filled with photos and videos, as a "gift" that allows them to see the world as their daughter did.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to maintain its key policy rate at 2.5%, an almost three-year low, as the country navigates economic challenges. South Korea's economy saw a slight contraction in the first quarter, influenced by weak construction and slowing exports. The central bank is also grappling with concerns over financial stability, as a recent spike in Seoul housing prices prompted new mortgage lending restrictions. Analysts suggest these measures could pave the way for a rate cut later this year, though the economy faces further uncertainty from potential U.S. tariffs on South Korean imports.

          <p>A sequel to the 2006 hit film “The Devil Wears Prada” is officially in the works and scheduled for a May 2026 release. Key original cast members including Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt, and Stanley Tucci are all set to reprise their iconic roles. Director David Frankel and screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna are also returning for the new installment.

          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, has engineered its own proprietary hardware to manage the immense heat generated by next-generation Nvidia AI processors. As demand for powerful GPUs for AI workloads surges, cooling has become a critical challenge. Instead of undertaking lengthy data center retrofits for liquid cooling, AWS developed the "In-Row Heat Exchanger" (IRHX), a solution that can be integrated into existing facilities. This allows AWS to deploy dense computing systems like Nvidia's GB200 NVL72 rack at scale. The move reflects a broader trend of major cloud providers developing custom hardware to optimize performance and control costs in the competitive AI infrastructure market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of over $112,000, with its upward momentum appearing to be linked to a strong rally in the equity markets. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also reached a record close, led by chipmaker Nvidia, which briefly touched a $4 trillion market capitalization. Although institutional adoption has been a key long-term driver for the cryptocurrency, its status as a risk asset means its price often moves in tandem with growth-oriented stocks during periods of positive investor sentiment. Analysts suggest that continued corporate buying and potential crypto-friendly legislation could fuel further gains for the digital asset. (not investment advice)</p>
