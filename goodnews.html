          <h2>Film Review Assesses Dwayne Johnson's Dramatic Turn in UFC Biopic 'The Smashing Machine'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 09:42:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This review evaluates "The Smashing Machine," a gritty A24 biopic where Dwayne Johnson portrays MMA legend Mark Kerr. The article highlights Johnson's transformative performance as Kerr, a dominant fighter in the early days of the UFC who grappled with a severe opioid addiction. While praising Johnson's dramatic range and suggesting it could earn him Oscar consideration, the review finds the overall film emotionally lacking compared to director Benny Safdie's previous work. The film is ultimately recommended as a worthwhile watch for fans of Johnson and UFC, primarily due to the strength of its lead actor's performance.</p>

          <p>David Risher, the current CEO of Lyft, recently shared the story of his decision to leave a management role at Microsoft in 1996 to join a then-fledgling online bookstore called Amazon. Despite Bill Gates calling it "the stupidest decision," Risher was convinced by Jeff Bezos's vision and customer-centric obsession. Bezos confidently predicted that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by the year 2000, a goal it ultimately surpassed a year early. Risher, who became Amazon's 37th employee, was instrumental in expanding the company into new categories like music and movies, illustrating the high-risk, high-reward nature of early tech startups.</p>

          <p>A child life specialist and therapist advocates for a simple yet profound parenting practice: creating an email address for each child at birth. She uses these inboxes to send messages, stories, and photos, capturing everything from birthday milestones to small, everyday moments and even reflections during difficult times. This practice serves as both a personal journal for the parent and a digital time capsule for the child. The expert suggests this collection of memories and expressions of love can be a powerful gift for the child to receive later in life, particularly on a milestone birthday or during a major life transition.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's new album, "The Life of A Showgirl," has ignited fan speculation that the track "Actually Romantic" is a diss track aimed at fellow pop star Charli XCX. The song's lyrics describe another singer who is obsessively critical, which fans believe is a direct response to Charli XCX's song "Sympathy is a Knife," allegedly written about Swift. In a recent cinema screening, Swift described her new song as "a love letter to someone who hates you," adding that she finds the intense focus from a critic to be flattering. Neither artist has confirmed the subject of their respective songs.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Irenic Capital Management has taken an approximate 2% stake in the cloud-based reporting software company Workiva. Irenic is urging the company to improve its operational efficiency, particularly its high sales and marketing spending, and to enhance its corporate governance by collapsing its dual-class share structure. The firm has also called for a review of strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the company, which it argues is undervalued despite strong revenue growth and high customer retention. Irenic is seeking two new board seats to help oversee these proposed changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New Mexico Uranium Plant Expands to Meet Surging Demand from AI and Nuclear Revival</h2>

          <p>The Urenco uranium enrichment facility in Eunice, New Mexico, the only commercial plant of its kind in the U.S., is rapidly expanding to meet a resurgence in demand for nuclear power. This new demand is driven by the massive electricity needs of AI data centers and a broader push for domestic energy, alongside a U.S. ban on Russian uranium imports set for 2028. After a decade of decline following the Fukushima disaster, the plant is now central to ambitious U.S. goals of tripling or quadrupling nuclear capacity by 2050. The expansion highlights the challenges facing the entire nuclear supply chain, from uranium conversion to grid capacity. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the group suggested that other elements of the deal would require further negotiation within a broader Palestinian framework. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office stated that Israel is preparing to implement the first phase of the plan. The proposal calls for an immediate end to fighting, the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and the transfer of Gaza's administration to an independent technocratic body.</p>

Her regular visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine could create diplomatic friction with Japan's Asian neighbors. As leader, she will face immediate domestic challenges, including rising prices, as well as the need to strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance amid regional security concerns.</p>

          <p>Michaela Del Barrio, a 37-year-old mother with a family history of breast cancer, was diagnosed with the disease after she proactively pushed for early screening. Despite having no symptoms, she requested a mammogram at age 36 and was referred to a high-risk clinic, which led to a breast MRI that detected two suspicious masses. The subsequent diagnosis of early-stage invasive ductal carcinoma allowed for timely treatment, including a bilateral mastectomy and chemotherapy. Her oncologist credits her self-advocacy with catching the cancer early, highlighting the importance of understanding personal risk factors and seeking appropriate screenings.</p>

          <p>This tribute reflects on the life and impact of primatologist and conservationist Jane Goodall, who passed away at the age of 91. The article recounts her groundbreaking work in the 1960s, particularly her discovery that chimpanzees make and use tools, a finding that forced a redefinition of what it means to be human. Without formal scientific training, her patient and empathetic approach earned the trust of wild chimpanzees like "David Greybeard." Her work not only revolutionized primatology but also inspired global conservation efforts through the establishment of animal sanctuaries and forest preservation programs.</p>

Koerner wanted to ensure his elderly dog could live out her final days in their familiar home. By liquidating his retirement funds to start immediately and tenaciously navigating bureaucratic hurdles, he has managed to fast-track the building process, providing a potential roadmap for other fire victims facing long delays.</p>

          <p>The long-held dominance of prestige in American higher education is weakening as families increasingly prioritize practical considerations like cost, internships, and job placement rates. With tuition prices soaring and a challenging job market, many parents are questioning the return on investment from top-ranked, high-cost institutions. This shift is reflected in data showing fewer high-income families are willing to pay full sticker price and are more open to less prestigious schools that offer significant merit aid. As a result, the traditional college hierarchy is becoming more fluid, with regional universities rising in prominence by focusing on tangible student outcomes over brand reputation.</p>

          <p>Academics in China are highlighting the growing role of science fiction and speculative fiction as a tool of national soft power. At a recent conference, Professor Du Lanlan of Nanjing University argued that the genre has historically been dominated by Western, often dystopian, perspectives rooted in capitalist anxieties. In contrast, China is fostering its own sci-fi narratives that can project a different vision of the future. By supporting this literary genre, China aims to stake a claim on future-oriented discourse, offering alternative worldviews and critiquing the present from a non-Western ideological standpoint, thereby influencing global cultural conversations.</p>

The judge went further, personally rebuking the president for ignoring the Constitution and seeking to silence dissent, arguing that freedom of speech applies to all people within the U.S., not just citizens.
