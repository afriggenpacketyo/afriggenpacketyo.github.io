          <h2>Dodgers to Maintain Trade Strategy Despite Max Muncy's Knee Injury</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 22:27:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are not planning to alter their trade deadline strategy despite an injury to third baseman Max Muncy. Initially feared to be season-ending, Muncy's injury was diagnosed as a bone bruise, with an expected recovery time of about six weeks. This timeline would allow him to return for the final month of the regular season. The team's management expressed relief at the positive diagnosis and will rely on internal options like Tommy Edman to cover third base in the interim. The front office believes the team can weather his absence without making a desperate trade.</p>

          <p>Authorities in New York City temporarily closed a section of beach in Far Rockaway, Queens, on the Fourth of July after multiple shark sightings occurred dangerously close to swimmers. Drones operated by the city's emergency management agency confirmed the sharks' proximity, leading to a swift public safety response. The closure lasted for about an hour before the beach was reopened, with officials continuing to monitor the waters. The incident occurred just days after New York's governor announced enhanced shark surveillance measures for the holiday weekend to ensure beachgoer safety.</p>

          <p>A recent online discussion has highlighted numerous under-hyped professions that offer surprisingly good pay, benefits, and a positive work-life balance. Among the jobs praised were paralegals, who can earn six-figure salaries with experience, and trade positions like plumbers and electricians, which are in high demand. Other mentioned careers included compliance specialists at banks, garbage collectors, and power line technicians, who benefit from significant overtime during storms. The conversation suggests that rewarding careers can often be found outside of traditional, degree-focused paths, offering stability and high satisfaction.</p>

          <p>As the United States increases pressure on China's dominant shipbuilding industry, regional competitors South Korea and Japan are positioning themselves to capture a larger market share. South Korea's new presidential administration has labeled the domestic shipbuilding sector as being in a "major crisis" and has pledged significant support to revitalize it. The government's new growth policy focuses on developing advanced, eco-friendly, and autonomous vessels through improved technology and better working conditions. This strategic push aims to re-establish South Korea as a global leader in maritime manufacturing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to some claims, President Trump's newly signed legislative package does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits. Instead, the bill introduces a new temporary "bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals aged 65 and older, which applies to their total income, not just Social Security payments. Policy experts clarify that this measure offers some tax relief but falls short of a full repeal of the tax on benefits. The deduction is available to seniors within certain income thresholds and is set to expire at the end of 2028. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite her third-round exit from Wimbledon, British tennis player Emma Raducanu is taking significant positives from her performance against world number one Aryna Sabalenka. Although she lost in straight sets, Raducanu pushed the three-time major champion to her limit in a tightly contested match, demonstrating a level of play that she feels closes the gap with the sport's top tier. A tearful but proud Raducanu stated the match motivates her to continue improving, signaling a renewed self-belief after a challenging period in her career. This performance is seen as a major step forward in her return to form.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent public display of emotion by a UK politician has sparked a broader conversation about the acceptability of crying in the workplace. While some traditional views hold that showing such emotion is a sign of weakness or instability, many career coaches and employees now argue it reflects emotional intelligence and humanity. The article explores different perspectives, noting that while women are often judged as 'too emotional,' men can be shamed for appearing vulnerable. Ultimately, many experts believe that a single emotional moment is unlikely to derail a career and that compassionate workplaces foster greater motivation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that tiny, migrating zooplankton in the Southern Ocean play a crucial role in combating climate change by locking away vast amounts of carbon. These minuscule creatures gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface in the spring, grow fat, and then sink deep into the ocean for the winter, where they burn this fat. This process effectively transports and stores an estimated 65 million tonnes of carbon annually, equivalent to the emissions of 55 million cars. The discovery underscores the vital, and previously underestimated, climate-regulating service provided by these often-overlooked marine animals.</p>

          <p>An Arizona-based economics professor, Dr. Bishara Bahbah, has become a key and unlikely backchannel negotiator between Hamas and the Trump administration in Gaza ceasefire talks. After receiving an unsolicited call from a senior Hamas official in April, Dr. Bahbah, who has connections to Trump's team, began relaying messages to help secure a hostage release and permanent ceasefire. This unconventional diplomatic channel reportedly played a role in the release of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander in May. The story highlights the unorthodox methods being employed to navigate the complex and delicate peace process.</p>

          <p>A same-sex pair of male Humboldt penguins, named Scampi and Flounder, are successfully raising a chick at Chester Zoo in the UK. The chick is one of ten that hatched at the zoo this year, a significant event for the species, which is listed as vulnerable to extinction. Zoo experts distributed the eggs among different nesting pairs to increase the chances of survival, entrusting one to the first-time foster parents. The successful co-parenting highlights the zoo's vital role in the international breeding program for the at-risk penguin species and offers a heartwarming story of animal care.</p>
