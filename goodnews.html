          <p>President Donald Trump met with Syrian leader Ahmed al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia, a day after the U.S. announced the lifting of sanctions on Syria. The meeting, overseen by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and joined by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan via phone, focused on opportunities for Syria to rebuild ties with the West and normalize relations with Israel by signing onto the Abraham Accords. Trump encouraged al-Sharaa to expel foreign terrorists, deport Palestinian terrorists, assist in preventing the resurgence of ISIS, and assume responsibility for ISIS detention centers in northeast Syria.</p>

          <p>In a landmark ruling, a court has stated that the European Commission should not have denied a New York Times journalist's request for text messages exchanged between Ursula von der Leyen, president of the commission, and Pfizer‚Äôs chief executive, Dr. Albert Bourla, during Covid-19 vaccine negotiations. The court rejected the commission's argument that text messages are ‚Äúshort-lived‚Äù and lack important information, emphasizing the need for credible explanations when requested documents cannot be found. This decision underscores the importance of transparency and accountability in the European Union, particularly regarding negotiations that involve taxpayer money and shape public policy.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is taking steps to end animal experimentation, including phasing out animal testing requirements for monoclonal antibodies by the FDA and reviving an EPA ban on animal testing. The NIH also plans to reduce animal use and accelerate the development of animal-free methods, citing the limited relevance of animal models to human outcomes. While animal welfare advocates celebrate these moves, scientists express skepticism due to simultaneous cuts to research budgets and a lack of new funding for animal-free research. The administration's motives are questioned, with concerns that the changes could be a way to broadly slash support for science.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite efforts towards gender equality, many people still assume mothers are the default parent, leading to frustrating experiences for fathers. Schools, pediatricians, and even strangers often contact mothers first, even when fathers are listed as the primary contact or are more available. Research supports this bias, with principals being more likely to call pretend mothers back than pretend fathers, regardless of availability. Outdated software systems in kid-related institutions also contribute to the problem, making it difficult to update contact preferences. This default parent assumption adds stress to mothers' lives and undermines fathers' active involvement in parenting.</p>

Applications for home purchases rose 2% for the week and were 18% higher than the previous year.

          <p>A landmark resources deal between the U.S. and Ukraine is expected to pave the way for more 'minerals for muscle' agreements, where minerals and geopolitics closely intertwine. The agreement, designed to deepen economic ties and bolster Ukraine's reconstruction, positions the country as a supplier of strategically important minerals to the U.S. Experts suggest that this type of deal, exchanging minerals for security or trade agreements, could expand to other countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, resource nationalism and existing trade relationships may limit the widespread adoption of such agreements.</p>

          <p>Rupert Lowe, the former Reform UK MP for Great Yarmouth, will not face criminal charges related to an allegation of threats. Lowe was suspended by the party in March amid claims of threats towards the party's chairman. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded there was insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. Lowe accused Reform of carrying out a brutal smear campaign for asking legitimate questions about the party's direction, policies, and leadership.</p>
