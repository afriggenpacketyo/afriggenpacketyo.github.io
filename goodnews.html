          <p>The federal government has released a second tranche of over 60,000 pages of records related to the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, as ordered by President Trump. These documents, which have been stored in federal facilities for decades, include details about the FBI's investigation, recordings of police interviews with Sirhan Sirhan, and witness testimonies. According to Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, the release is an important step toward transparency and uncovering the truth. While some records reference conspiracy theories, many details were already publicly known, and the documents have been digitized and made accessible on the National Archives website.</p>

          <p>Joseph Nye, a distinguished scholar of international relations known for pioneering the theory of "soft power," has passed away at the age of 88, according to Harvard University. Nye, who served as dean of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government and as assistant secretary of defense under President Bill Clinton, significantly influenced U.S.-Japan relations. He collaborated with Richard Armitage to improve the alliance between Washington and Tokyo, regularly releasing reports with proposals to bolster the bilateral relationship. Harvard's current dean, Jeremy Weinstein, noted Nye's profound intellectual contributions to understanding contemporary international relations.</p>

          <p>Canada's Foreign Minister Melanie Joly stated that Canada has been "over reliant on the US for too long" and seeks to strengthen ties with the UK, EU, and other nations. This comes after recent tensions between the US and Canada, including tariffs imposed by President Trump. Joly emphasized the importance of Canada asserting its sovereignty while negotiating a "new trade and security partnership" with the U.S. Prime Minister Mark Carney met with Trump to discuss these issues, agreeing on a "fresh start" for the relationship, although Trump did not commit to removing the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Part of a Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, is expected to crash back to Earth this week after being stuck in orbit since 1972. The spacecraft, launched as part of a mission to Venus, never escaped low Earth orbit and separated into four pieces. The lander probe is expected to re-enter the atmosphere around May 10, and parts may survive the journey due to its robust heat shield. Experts consider the risk to people on the ground to be low, as the potential landing zone covers a wide range of the inhabited world, with a high probability of landing in the ocean.</p>
