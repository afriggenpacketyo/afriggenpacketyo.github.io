          <p>The Atlantic hurricane season's peak is September 10th, with most activity between mid-August and mid-October.  Despite current inactivity, meteorologists predict a surge in storms due to increasingly favorable conditions.  Warmer sea surface temperatures provide ample fuel for tropical cyclone formation and intensification, potentially mirroring the intense activity seen in 2020 and 2005.  The National Hurricane Center forecasts above-normal activity for the remainder of the season.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 30-day takeover of D.C. police expires September 10th, with Congress unlikely to extend it.  While Trump initially considered an extension, he recently praised the decrease in crime and Mayor Bowser's cooperation.  Despite a drop in crime, Bowser maintains that federal intervention is not the solution, advocating for increased local resources and control.  Congress is considering legislation that would increase federal oversight of D.C. affairs.</p>

          <p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) proposes increasing contactless payment limits beyond £100, potentially removing limits entirely.  This would align contactless card payments with digital wallet systems.  While the FCA acknowledges increased fraud risks, they believe improved fraud detection systems mitigate these concerns.

          <p>The policing watchdog, His Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary, recommends ending the recording of non-crime hate incidents.  Sir Andy Cooke argues current legislation puts police in a difficult position and that intelligence can be gathered differently.  The Metropolitan Police chief agrees, highlighting limited officer discretion.  This follows recent police activity that sparked public debate, including a visit to a journalist over a social media post.</p>
