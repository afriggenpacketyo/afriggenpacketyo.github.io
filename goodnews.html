          <p>Ahead of their upcoming game, Baltimore Ravens running back Derrick Henry has responded to comments from Cleveland Browns defensive back Grant Delpit, who downplayed the difficulty of tackling the famously powerful player. Delpit's remarks have added fuel to the AFC North rivalry, prompting Henry to state, "We'll see on Sunday." This exchange is part of a broader series of pre-game trash talk between the two teams, with players from both sides making pointed comments about their opponents' abilities, setting the stage for a highly anticipated matchup.</p>

          <p>To help parents navigate the common challenge of fussy eating, a child nutritionist suggests several strategies to make mealtimes less stressful. Key advice includes giving children autonomy by letting them choose what to eat from the options provided and refraining from labeling foods as "good" or "bad." The expert also recommends focusing on making the dinner table a fun, engaging environment and involving children in food preparation to foster familiarity and encourage them to try new things.</p>

          <p>Ed Sheeran's eighth album, "Play," marks a strategic shift in response to the commercial underperformance of his recent introspective records. The new work infuses his signature pop formula with Asian and Middle Eastern musical elements, including collaborations with Indian superstar Arijit Singh. While some tracks are seen as culturally adventurous, the article suggests the album often defaults to familiar, radio-friendly structures rather than fully committing to its global influences, aiming to appeal to the broadest possible audience.</p>

          <p>After once lagging behind, Denmark has significantly improved its cancer survival rates over the past 25 years, surpassing the UK and other wealthy nations. Its success is attributed to a comprehensive national strategy involving major investment in diagnostic equipment, strict targets for rapid diagnosis and treatment, and an enhanced focus on the patient experience. UK policymakers, including the Health Secretary, are now studying the Danish model as a potential blueprint for a new long-term cancer plan for England.</p>

          <p>South Africa's highest court has struck down an apartheid-era law, ruling that it was unconstitutional and discriminatory to prohibit men from taking their wives' last names. The court described the previous legislation as a "colonial import" that infringed on the right to gender equality. The government has been given two years to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act, a progressive decision that has generated a mix of praise and heated debate across the country.</p>

          <p>Recent substantial gains in China's US$12 trillion stock market are presenting a challenge for regulators aiming to foster a stable, sustainable bull market rather than a volatile bubble. Beijing's long-term goal is to position the equity market as a reliable source of household income to boost consumer spending and diversify wealth away from the property sector. The current focus appears to be on guiding a measured ascent to avoid the risks of speculation-driven boom-and-bust cycles seen in the past. (not investment advice)</p>
