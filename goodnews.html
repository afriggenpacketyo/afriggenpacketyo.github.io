          <h2>China's Export Surge to Southeast Asia Offsets US Trade Decline Amid Tariff Tensions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced a notable surge in April, primarily driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian nations, which effectively compensated for a significant decrease in exports to the United States due to the implementation of prohibitive tariffs. The article highlights that while overall exports rose by 8.1%, shipments to the U.S. plummeted by over 21%. This shift indicates a strategic realignment in China's trade partnerships amid ongoing trade tensions with the U.S., with countries like Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand seeing substantial increases in Chinese imports, while experts anticipate a gradual weakening of trade data in the coming months.</p>

          <p>The Shuangjiangkou hydropower project in southwest China, poised to become the world's tallest dam upon completion, commenced water storage on May 1, marking a significant step towards its operational readiness. This ¬•36 billion (US$4.9 billion) project, located in Sichuan province, has been under construction for nearly a decade and is designed to serve the dual purpose of power generation and flood control. The dam, situated upstream of the Dadu River, will stand at an impressive 315 meters (1,033 feet) high, surpassing the current record holder, the Jinping-I dam, also in Sichuan. The initial phase of water storage has elevated the water level to 2,344 meters, approximately 80 meters above the original river level.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 19th International Architecture Exhibition in Venice addresses the escalating challenges posed by climate change, particularly the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme heat events. The article emphasizes the urgent need for architects and urban planners to develop strategies to make cities more resilient to rising temperatures, as urban areas are particularly vulnerable due to their sealed surfaces and lack of green spaces. Curator Carlo Ratti advocates for a collaborative approach, integrating diverse forms of intelligence and knowledge to rethink the built environment. Examples of climate adaptation, such as Frankfurt's redesigned Paul-Arnsberg-Platz and Paris's transportation revolution, are highlighted, alongside calls for a global "construction revolution" to create more habitable and sustainable urban environments.</p>

          <p>Country music legend Randy Travis is using artificial intelligence to create new music, following a stroke in 2013 that left him with aphasia. With the help of AI and country musician James Dupr√©, Travis has released two new songs, "Where That Came From" and "Horses in Heaven," and has extended his "More Life Tour" through fall 2025. His wife, Mary Travis, explains that the AI process involves using raw vocals from Randy's past recordings and overlaying them with a vocal line provided by Dupr√©, which are then tweaked to match Randy's tone and inflections, noting that AI has been "wonderful" for her husband.</p>

          <p>Nvidia is planning to release a modified version of its H20 chip for the Chinese market in July, aiming to circumvent U.S. export controls that restrict China's access to advanced semiconductor technology. The downgraded H20 chip will feature significantly reduced memory capacity compared to the original design. This strategic move allows Nvidia to maintain its presence in China, a crucial market, while adhering to the increasingly stringent regulations imposed by the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>Shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China's largest contract chip maker, experienced a nearly 7% drop following a first-quarter earnings miss. Despite a 28% year-over-year increase in revenue to $2.24 billion and a 162% surge in profit to $188 million, these figures fell short of analysts' expectations due to "production fluctuations" that lowered average selling prices. The company anticipates a sequential revenue decline of 4% to 6% in the current quarter, with gross margin also expected to decrease. However, SMIC's wafer shipments increased by 15% from the previous quarter, driven by geopolitical changes and government policies.</p>

The deal includes increased access for U.S. agricultural products to the U.K. market and reduced non-tariff barriers. However, the 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports will remain in place, although the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by British automakers each year are subject to that 10% rate.

          <p>China's exports grew more than expected in April despite the US tariffs, suggesting that the US tariffs are not as effective as intended. However, exports to the US did fall significantly. Some economists believe this is due to the full impact of the tariffs not yet being visible and that many exporters are finding ways around the tariffs. This gives Chinese negotiators an advantage when they hold talks with their US counterparts in Switzerland at the weekend.</p>
