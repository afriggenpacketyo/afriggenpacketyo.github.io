          <p>The Trump administration has announced a comprehensive trade deal with South Korea, establishing a 15% tariff on most South Korean exports to the U.S., a reduction from a threatened 25%. The agreement also includes a commitment from South Korea for $350 billion in U.S. investments and the purchase of $100 billion in American energy products. However, there appears to be a discrepancy between Washington and Seoul regarding the control and purpose of the investment funds. The deal aims to address the U.S. trade deficit while strengthening industrial cooperation between the two allied nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to keep its key interest rate unchanged, holding it between 4.25% and 4.5% amidst continued pressure from President Trump for a rate cut. The decision was not unanimous, with two board members dissenting in favor of a reduction, a rare occurrence signaling a potential shift in policy. Policymakers cited concerns over how new tariffs and tax cuts will affect the economy, noting that inflation remains above their 2% target. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized a cautious approach, stating there is a long way to go before the full impact of the tariffs is clear.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms reported exceptional second-quarter results, significantly surpassing Wall Street's revenue and earnings estimates, causing its stock to soar in after-hours trading. Revenue climbed 22% year-over-year, driven by strong advertising growth and a 6% increase in daily active users across its family of apps. The company also provided a robust third-quarter revenue forecast that exceeded expectations. Citing the strong performance and aggressive push into artificial intelligence, CNBC's Investing Club is raising its price target for the stock to $825 per share. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a massive earthquake off Russia's coast that triggered tsunami alerts across the Pacific, this article explains the science of how these powerful waves are generated. A tsunami typically requires a strong underwater earthquake, at least a magnitude 6.5 to 7, that causes vertical movement of the seafloor. The quake's proximity to the surface and the coast are also critical factors. While forecasting remains challenging, scientists use a network of deep-ocean pressure sensors and coastal tide gauges to detect tsunamis and predict their arrival time and potential height, offering crucial time for evacuation.</p>

          <p>A scientific expedition using a human-occupied submersible has discovered and filmed vibrant communities of life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the northwest Pacific Ocean. The Chinese-led research team found fields of tube worms, beds of clams, and bacterial mats, challenging previous assumptions about the limits of life in such extreme, high-pressure environments. These ecosystems are not powered by sunlight but by chemicals like methane seeping from the ocean floor. The findings suggest that such "chemosynthetic" communities may be more widespread in the deep ocean than previously thought.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has confirmed that the company's significant investments in artificial intelligence will extend well into 2026 as it competes with other tech giants. Following a strong quarterly earnings report, Meta raised its expense outlook, signaling that AI initiatives will drive higher spending growth next year. Zuckerberg emphasized the strategy of building an elite AI talent team and a leading computational infrastructure to integrate advanced AI across its platforms like Facebook and Instagram. For now, investors appear to support the costly strategy, given the company's strong performance and revenue growth.</p>

          <p>Microsoft delivered a powerful quarterly report, beating revenue and earnings forecasts and solidifying its status as a leader in the artificial intelligence race. Revenue grew 18% year-over-year, largely driven by its Azure cloud computing unit, which saw revenue growth accelerate to 39% and surpassed $75 billion in annual sales. The company provided an upbeat forecast for the next quarter and signaled continued heavy investment in data center capacity to meet high demand. Following the report, CNBC's Investing Club is increasing its price target for the stock to $600. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing number of scientists are challenging the widely held belief that screen time is inherently harmful to children's brains, arguing that concrete scientific evidence is lacking. This article explores the debate, noting that much of the research relies on flawed self-reporting and fails to distinguish between different types of screen use. While some studies suggest links to depression or sleep issues, others find little to no evidence of poor mental well-being, even with high usage. The debate highlights the difficulty in providing clear guidance for parents, who are caught between societal fears and an evolving, inconclusive body of scientific research.</p>

          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered tsunami warnings across the Pacific, including for Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast, but the threat has largely passed without major damage. While Russia experienced flooding from waves up to 16 feet, the impact on U.S. shores was minimal, with waves generally measuring under five feet. Evacuation orders in Hawaii were lifted, and advisories for the West Coast were canceled. The event caused widespread but temporary disruption as authorities and residents responded to the alerts, with some South American countries maintaining warnings.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a significant rebound in the second quarter of 2025, with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growing at an annual rate of 3%, according to the Commerce Department. This turnaround follows a 0.5% contraction in the first quarter and surpassed economists' forecasts. The growth was largely driven by a sharp drop in imports, a statistical quirk related to the implementation of new tariffs, rather than a fundamental surge in domestic production. While consumer spending also increased, underlying data suggests that private domestic demand is weakening, pointing to a potential economic slowdown ahead.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded, the magnitude 8.8 temblor off Russia's coast resulted in surprisingly little widespread tsunami damage. Scientists explain that the location and directionality of the quake were key factors in this best-case scenario outcome. The main energy of the resulting tsunami was projected into a relatively empty stretch of the open Pacific Ocean, between Alaska and Hawaii, allowing it to dissipate before reaching populated coastlines. This contrasts sharply with other major quakes, like the 2011 Japan event, where the energy was focused directly at land.</p>

          <p>This article explores a shift in television trends away from "comfort TV" and towards hyperrealistic, anxiety-inducing shows like "The Bear" and "The Pitt." These series use techniques like real-time storytelling and single-take sequences to immerse viewers in the high-stakes, stressful environments of their characters. Psychologists suggest this "vicarious stress" can be satisfying for audiences, as it provides a risk-free thrill and feels more relatable than fantastical escapism. The trend reflects a potential viewer appetite for stories that acknowledge the mundane, day-to-day pressures of modern work and life, offering a form of catharsis.</p>

Figma is proceeding with its public offering after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was called off in 2023 due to regulatory opposition.

Unlike a similar settlement with Columbia University, Brown's agreement involves no financial penalty.
