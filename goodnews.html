          <p>The Department of Homeland Security initiated "Project Homecoming," offering illegal immigrants financial incentives to self-deport. Participants receive travel assistance and a $1,000 stipend, preserving the possibility of legal return in the future. The program, authorized by President Trump, aims to save taxpayers billions by reducing the costs associated with arrests, detention, and deportation, which currently average over $17,000 per person. Illegal immigrants are encouraged to use the CBP Home App to arrange their departures, potentially returning legally in the future, otherwise they will be subject to fines, arrest, and deportation. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government is set to commence offshore "blue carbon" research, focusing on capturing carbon dioxide through cultivated sea plants and storing it in the deep sea, with the goal of accelerating decarbonization. The Environment Ministry will collaborate with the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology and Eneos Corp. to study seaweed behavior at significant depths and assess the environmental impact of carbon capture and storage projects. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon initiatives, enhancing its carbon capture efforts to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. This initiative is crucial given the declining CO2 absorption capacity of Japan's aging forests.</p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology, the world's largest battery manufacturer, saw its shares rise as much as 14% in their Hong Kong trading debut. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), reportedly making it the largest global listing in 2025. The company plans to allocate 90% of the raised funds to build its factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients including Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. Despite facing trade tensions and a revenue drop in 2024 due to competition, CATL's net profit increased year over year.</p>

Eric Trump, who was involved in creating the medals, noted that the idea came from a service for the officers, addressing the absence of a medal commemorating fallen law enforcement and first responders.

          <p>China's central bank reduced its key lending rates for the first time in seven months, lowering the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%. The cuts aim to stimulate the economy, supported by a stronger yuan and easing trade tensions. The move follows state-backed commercial lenders reducing deposit rates to protect their net interest margin. Economists anticipate further policy easing, with forecasts of additional lending rate reductions by year-end, forming part of a broader stimulus package announced by Beijing.
