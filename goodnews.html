          <p>President Trump met with Syria's interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former Islamist militant, after announcing the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria. The meeting marks a significant shift in U.S. policy toward Syria, as al-Sharaa's rebel forces toppled Bashar al-Assad's regime last year. Trump expressed optimism about al-Sharaa's potential to rebuild Syria and urged him to normalize ties with Israel. The move is aimed at curbing Iranian influence in the region, despite al-Sharaa's past ties to extremism.</p>

          <p>After Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced, the focus shifted to how the culture and politics of the 1990s influenced their trials, with their lawyer arguing that the era's punitive criminal justice policies led to an unfair outcome. The brothers' defense team invoked the changing attitudes toward sexual abuse and the impact of media coverage on their case. The resentencing process benefited from increased social media support and documentaries that re-examined the case. The article underscores how societal perceptions and legal strategies have evolved since the initial trials, potentially paving the way for the brothers' release.</p>

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States experienced a significant decline last year, signaling progress in combating the opioid crisis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a decrease of nearly 30,000 fatalities, driven by changes in the illicit drug supply and increased access to treatment. Despite this progress, the Trump administration's proposed cuts to federal health programs, including those addressing the drug crisis, raise concerns about sustaining these gains. Experts emphasize the need for continued investment in comprehensive care to address the complex factors contributing to addiction.</p>
