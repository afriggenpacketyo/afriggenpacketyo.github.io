          <p>Actress Candace Cameron Bure is voicing her concerns about the comeback of "scary" weight-loss trends in Hollywood, such as the use of drugs like Ozempic. In an interview, she reflected on her own past struggles with body image, contrasting it with the more body-positive outlook of the younger generation. Bure emphasized that her Christian faith helps her focus on inner worth over external appearance, stating that God's love is not dependent on one's body size. She encourages people to understand the "why" behind their health choices rather than just following fads.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 03:49:52 EDT</div>

          <p>A new gene therapy, delivered via a single injection, has successfully reversed a form of congenital deafness in a recent clinical trial. Researchers reported that all 10 participants, including children and adults, showed significant hearing improvement after a healthy copy of the OTOF gene was introduced into their inner ear. The therapy, which addresses a protein deficiency that hinders sound signal transmission to the brain, proved safe and was particularly effective in younger patients. This breakthrough opens avenues for treating other genetic forms of deafness.</p>

          <p>Thousands of followers, including actor Richard Gere, gathered in Dharamshala, India, to celebrate the 90th birthday of the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader. The event took place amidst a renewed debate over his succession, with the Dalai Lama recently confirming his intention to reincarnate, a plan rejected by Beijing which insists on approving his successor. In his birthday message, he emphasized the importance of compassion and peace of mind, assuring followers of his good health and his plan to live for many more years.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The modern business landscape, characterized by geopolitical shocks and rapid technological change, is forcing a shift in the CEO mindset away from a singular focus on winning. Leaders like McLaren Racing's Zak Brown and Nissan's Ivan Espinosa now stress the importance of learning from failure, maintaining momentum, and demonstrating agility. With a record number of CEO turnovers, the ability to navigate turbulence and remain flexible is paramount. This new leadership paradigm also involves managing government interventions and taking accountability for integrating new technologies like AI.</p>

          <p>In his final appearance for Palmeiras, 18-year-old phenom Estêvão Willian delivered a standout performance against his future club, Chelsea, during the Club World Cup. Despite being on the losing side, Estêvão scored a brilliant goal and showcased the fearless dribbling ability that prompted Chelsea to pay a £52m fee for him. The match provided a glimpse of a promising future partnership with Chelsea's Cole Palmer, who also scored in the game and shared a friendly exchange with Estêvão afterward. While he must adapt to English football, Chelsea plans to integrate the highly-touted Brazilian talent directly into their squad.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have found that genetic factors play a significant role in shaping "brain criticality," the crucial balance between neural excitation and inhibition. This balance is known to be essential for the brain's information processing capabilities and overall mental ability. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, established a link between brain criticality and cognitive functions, suggesting a shared genetic foundation. These findings open new avenues for understanding brain function and the genetic roots of potential neurological dysfunctions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new travel trend is emerging in China, with young people, particularly recent university graduates, embracing cruise ship holidays as a social and convenient way to travel. Organizers like Dong Wenxin are chartering trips for alumni groups, finding that the all-in-one environment of a cruise ship fosters bonding and community without the logistical hassles of other group travel. This demographic shift is providing a boost to the cruise industry in the region, as it taps into a desire for communal experiences among China's younger generation. The trips offer a range of recreational activities and shared spaces for groups to connect.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a £500 million plan to roll out "Best Start" family hubs to every local authority in England by 2026. These hubs are designed to provide a "lifeline" to families, especially in disadvantaged areas, by offering a wide range of services in a single location. Services will include everything from midwifery support and birth registration to debt advice and youth clubs, building on the model of the earlier Sure Start centres. The opposition Conservatives have questioned the announcement, suggesting it may be a rebranding of existing services rather than a genuinely new initiative.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered another dominant but short pitching performance for the Los Angeles Dodgers, throwing two scoreless innings and striking out the side in the second. However, the team's bullpen could not maintain the lead, as long reliever Justin Wrobleski gave up five runs in a 6-4 loss to the Houston Astros. The game highlighted the Dodgers' current pitching dynamic: immense hope for the future with the eventual return of injured stars, but continued vulnerability in their current depth. Despite a home run from Mookie Betts, the Dodgers' offense couldn't overcome the deficit.</p>
