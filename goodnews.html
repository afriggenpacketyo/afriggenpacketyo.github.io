        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Thai government has lifted a long-standing ban on work permits for Myanmar refugees residing in camps near the border, a response to significant cuts in foreign aid, especially from the United States. These refugees, some living in the camps since the 1980s, have faced limited opportunities for education and employment, relying heavily on foreign assistance. The UNHCR has welcomed the decision, viewing it as a potential benchmark for refugee solutions in the region. The Thai government may have also been influenced by a decline in migrant workers from Cambodia, with the refugees potentially filling labor shortages in sectors like agriculture and entry-level service jobs. The refugees express happiness at the opportunity to work and support their families, after years of confinement in the camps. Optimism is present as the refugees see a new lifeline and a chance for freedom. </p>

The announcement followed a meeting between Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and US Special Envoy Adam Boehler. While the Taliban released photos from the talks, the White House has not commented on the meeting or its results. The agreement, if confirmed, would involve the exchange of detainees, but details regarding the number of individuals involved, their identities, and the reasons for their imprisonment have not been disclosed. </p>

          <p>California's legislature has passed several bills that could significantly alter the school experience for students, addressing areas like reading skills, school lunches, and anti-discrimination measures. Assembly Bill 715 aims to protect students from discrimination, particularly antisemitism, by creating a state Office for Civil Rights. AB 1454 mandates phonics-based reading instruction, and AB 1264 seeks to eliminate ultra-processed foods from school meals. These measures now await approval or rejection from Governor Gavin Newsom. </p>

          <p>California is considering SB 53, a bill requiring transparency reports from developers of powerful AI models to address potential catastrophic risks. The bill focuses on preventing AI-enabled attacks and rogue systems that could cause widespread disasters. While transparency alone may not prevent such events, the bill aims to regulate AI before it outpaces oversight efforts. Industry organizations have voiced concerns about compliance costs, while others support the bill's preventative approach. </p>
