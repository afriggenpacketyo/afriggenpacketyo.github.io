          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used to help qualifying students pay for private school tuition. The bill provides most students attending an accredited private school with $10,000 per year, students with disabilities with up to $30,000 per year, and home-schooled students with $2,000 a year. Democrats argue the legislation hurts public schools, while supporters claim it ensures students have the freedom to seek the best educational option for them. The bill has sparked significant debate over the future of public education in Texas. Optimism Score: 60</p>

The creation of an official company town has drawn criticism from those who worry it will expand Musk's control over the area, with potential authority to close a popular beach and state park for launches.
