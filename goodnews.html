          <p>President Trump announced his intention to fire the head of the National Portrait Gallery, citing partisan reasons and disagreement with diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. However, the National Portrait Gallery is part of the Smithsonian Institution, which is independent of the federal government, creating a conflict of authority. The power to remove the director lies with the secretary of the Smithsonian, who is accountable to the institution's Board of Regents. This situation highlights the limits of presidential power and the independence of cultural institutions.</p>

          <p>The Stanley Cup Final between the Florida Panthers and the Edmonton Oilers has taken on added significance due to political tensions between the U.S. and Canada. The article highlights the unusual success of Florida-based hockey teams and explores the reasons behind it, including the lack of state income tax and the state's unique culture. The narrative is further fueled by Trump's strained relationship with Canada and the association of some hockey figures with the Trump administration. This convergence of sports and politics has made the final a symbolic battle between the two nations.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has proposed a significant increase in defense spending, citing the need for the U.K. to be prepared for potential conflict in Europe due to the threat posed by Russia. The move aligns with similar actions by other NATO members, such as Poland and Germany, who are also increasing military spending. Experts suggest that uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's commitment to NATO is also a factor driving the increased defense spending. The U.K. plan includes modernizing the military, developing a "hybrid navy," and increasing long-range weapons capabilities.</p>

          <h2>Tesla Sales Rebound in Australia</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 03:21:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's electric vehicle sales in Australia rebounded in May, reaching their highest level in nearly 12 months, driven by strong demand for the revamped Model Y. While Tesla faces declining sales in the U.S. and Europe, its Australian sales jumped significantly, although year-to-date sales remain down compared to the previous year. Experts attribute the rebound to the updated Model Y but caution that it does not signal a broader global recovery for Tesla. Tesla faces increased competition and reputational challenges related to CEO Elon Musk's activities.</p>
