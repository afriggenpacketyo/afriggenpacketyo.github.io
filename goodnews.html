          <p>Data from analytics firm Cotality indicates that rent growth for single-family homes in the U.S. has hit its lowest point in 15 years, with just a 1.4% annual increase in August. This slowdown continues a trend seen in the latter half of the year, with significant regional differences; Chicago saw robust growth while Dallas experienced a decline. The cooling trend also extends to multifamily apartments, where a construction boom has increased supply and pushed the national vacancy rate to a record high, providing some relief to renters.

The carrier raised its full-year earnings guidance to well above analyst projections, signaling strong confidence despite a challenging summer travel season. This optimistic forecast follows a period where airlines, including American, had scaled back growth plans to manage an oversupply of domestic flights and maintain profitability in an uncertain economic environment.

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) has issued a formal apology for a massive outage that knocked numerous major websites and services, including Snapchat, Reddit, and Lloyds Bank, offline. The company attributed the failure to a bug within its largest data center region in North Virginia, which disrupted the Domain Name System (DNS) that connects web addresses to servers. This widespread disruption has reignited concerns among experts about the internet's heavy dependence on a small number of dominant cloud computing providers and the need for greater system resilience.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly negotiating with several leading quantum-computing firms to acquire government equity stakes in exchange for federal funding, according to the Wall Street Journal. This strategy mirrors recent government investments in other critical sectors like rare earths and semiconductors, signaling a significant policy shift toward greater state intervention in industries deemed vital to national security. The move is seen as part of a broader effort to maintain a technological and economic edge over competitors, particularly China, in the race for next-generation technologies.

          <h2>Op-Ed Argues True Free Speech Requires a Foundation of Free Thought and Conscientious Learning</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-23 08:00:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the modern debate on free speech often overlooks its essential foundation: the freedom of thought. Drawing on philosopher John Stuart Mill, the author contends that speech is only truly free when it stems from a conscientious process of learning, critical thinking, and open discussion. The article suggests that the greatest threats to free speech are not censorship alone, but also systemic attacks on education, the spread of propaganda, and the consolidation of media ownership, which all undermine the public's ability to think freely.</p>

Although rates are currently near a one-year low, affordability remains the primary concern, compounded by broader economic uncertainty.

          <p>In an opinion piece for The Atlantic, a professor and linguist argues that fears about students using AI for academic work are overblown and that educators should adapt to the new technology. The author suggests that instead of banning AI, professors can evolve their teaching methods by designing assignments that AI cannot easily complete, such as those requiring personal reflection or in-class analysis. The article posits that AI can handle tedious tasks like grammar correction, thereby freeing students to focus more on developing critical thinking and argumentation skills.</p>
