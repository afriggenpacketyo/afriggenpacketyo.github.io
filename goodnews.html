          <p>The United States, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Egypt have jointly called for a three-month humanitarian truce in Sudan, aiming for a permanent ceasefire and a nine-month transition to civilian rule. This 'Quad' group seeks to end a devastating conflict that has killed tens of thousands and displaced millions, triggering one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. The statement also rejected the involvement of extremist groups in the transition process and highlighted recent US sanctions against Sudanese officials. This coordinated international effort underscores the urgent need to stabilize the war-torn nation and establish legitimate governance, despite previous truces failing.</p>

          <p>Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is implementing new road closures on its South (red) side, affecting outer lanes on the upper terminal level, primarily impacting Delta flights and passengers. The closures will occur from Friday night at 10:00 p.m. until Monday at 5:00 a.m., aiming to facilitate ongoing construction. Travelers are advised to park on the north side and use shuttles to the terminal to avoid congestion, then walk across the building for check-in and baggage claim. These temporary changes are expected to cause navigation challenges for passengers but are part of broader infrastructure improvements at the busy airport.</p>
