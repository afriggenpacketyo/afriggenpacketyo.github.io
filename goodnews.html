          <p>Coventry City has finalized the purchase of the Coventry Building Society Arena, a move the club's owner described as a "pivotal moment" ensuring its long-term stability. This acquisition ends years of uncertainty for the club and its supporters, who have experienced multiple stadium owners and ground changes since leaving their previous home in 2005. The deal, which includes the stadium's hotel and casino, is expected to open up new revenue streams and investment opportunities. This will allow the club to improve facilities and strengthen its ambition of returning to the Premier League.</p>

          <p>A central Berlin street, formerly named with a term considered racist, has been officially renamed in honor of Anton Wilhelm Amo, an 18th-century Black German philosopher. The change comes after a five-year legal battle initiated by some residents who opposed the renaming, which was first approved in 2020. Civil society groups had campaigned for decades to remove the original name, which has historical ties to enslaved Africans in Prussia. The new name, Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Strasse, was unveiled on the International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade, marking a significant step in Germany's efforts to decolonize public spaces.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has significantly expanded an order that blocks the Trump administration from withholding federal funds from municipalities with "sanctuary" policies that limit cooperation with immigration enforcement. The ruling by U.S. District Judge William Orrick now protects 34 cities and counties, including major centers like Los Angeles and Chicago. This decision reinforces the judge's previous finding that the administration's attempt to cut funding is unconstitutional. The ruling comes amid escalating confrontations between the White House and Democratic-led jurisdictions over immigration policy and federal authority.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has resumed its eruptive activity, shooting fountains of lava up to 100 feet into the air within its summit crater. This marks the 31st such episode since the current eruption period began in December, reinforcing its status as one of the world's most active volcanoes. The eruption is contained within Halemaumau crater in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and poses no threat to homes. The spectacle provides a dramatic viewing opportunity for visitors and is closely monitored by scientists at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, who use the frequent activity to better understand the volcano's complex magma system.</p>

          <p>A new medical technology, the Vivistim System, is offering hope for stroke survivors who have plateaued in their recovery. The system uses an implant to deliver gentle pulses to the vagus nerve during rehabilitation therapy, which is believed to enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself. The article profiles a 71-year-old restaurant owner who had lost all movement in his left arm and leg and saw minimal improvement from traditional therapy. After receiving the implant, he has made significant progress in just four months, regaining function and reducing pain, highlighting the potential of this first-of-its-kind technology to redefine stroke recovery.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With trillions of dollars in real estate expected to be passed down from older generations, wealth advisors are highlighting the financial and emotional complexities of such transfers. The article outlines key strategies for minimizing taxes and family conflicts when giving property, especially vacation homes, to children. Recommendations include transferring property through a will or trust at death to get a "step-up in basis" and avoid large capital gains taxes. Advisors also suggest placing homes in a Limited Liability Company (LLC) to protect assets from lawsuits and creating a detailed operating agreement to govern usage, expenses, and potential buyouts among heirs.

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Ukrainian President's Wardrobe Choices Signal a Shift in Diplomatic Strategy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 08:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece analyzes the diplomatic messaging behind Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent choice of attire during a visit to the White House. After a previous combative meeting where his casual, military-style clothing drew criticism, Zelenskyy opted for a more formal black blazer and collared shirt. This sartorial shift is interpreted as a deliberate act of "wardrobe diplomacy," intended to project seriousness and a focus on high-stakes negotiations rather than just wartime resistance. The article draws parallels to historical examples, like Winston Churchill's air-raid suit, to argue that what political leaders wear can be a powerful, non-verbal tool of communication.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest season of the animated series "South Park" is garnering significant attention and high ratings for its direct and scathing critique of the Trump administration. The show's creators have centered the new episodes on parodies of President Trump and his cabinet members, a move that is notable given the political pressure faced by its parent company, Paramount. While the White House has dismissed the show as irrelevant, analysts note that the creators are speaking truth to power in a way few other media entities are. The show's financial success, underscored by a massive new streaming deal, may be providing it with the security to be exceptionally bold in its political satire.</p>

          <p>In the face of increasingly frequent and powerful hurricanes, Florida is grappling with how to rebuild for a more resilient future. The article highlights different approaches, from residents relocating to master-planned "storm-proof" towns like Babcock Ranch, to programs helping low-income families in historic neighborhoods rebuild their homes to be stronger and more elevated. Babcock Ranch, which sustained almost no damage from Hurricane Ian, features native landscaping, advanced stormwater systems, and hurricane-resistant construction. These efforts underscore a growing recognition that proactive investment in mitigation and resilient design is essential for adapting to the escalating costs and dangers of climate change.</p>
