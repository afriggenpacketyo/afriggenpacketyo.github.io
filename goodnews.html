          <p>A record-breaking flood in Juneau, Alaska, caused by an outburst from the Mendenhall Glacier, has subsided without causing catastrophic damage thanks to newly installed temporary barriers. The Mendenhall River crested at an unprecedented 16.65 feet, but the 'Hesco' barriers successfully protected hundreds of homes that were damaged in similar events in previous years. This annual flooding event, driven by climate change melting a nearby glacier, has intensified recently. Officials expressed relief that a major disaster was avoided while noting the ongoing need for a permanent solution.</p>

The proceeds will go toward paying the $1.3 billion defamation judgment owed to the families of Sandy Hook victims, whom Jones tormented for years with false conspiracies. This move allows for the seizure of all company property, including the Infowars brand name itself, potentially ending Jones's broadcasts under that banner. The families' lawyers expressed that this will finally bring accountability for Jones's cruel harassment.</p>

          <p>Paris St-Germain head coach Luis Enrique made a significant strategic decision by replacing star goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma with newly signed Lucas Chevalier for the Super Cup final against Tottenham. The move signals a shift towards a 'modern-day keeper' who is more skilled with ball distribution, a key component of Enrique's play-from-the-back style. Despite Donnarumma's crucial role in their Champions League victory, the club is prioritizing a different profile to further refine its tactical approach. Chevalier's debut was eventful, contributing to a 2-2 draw that PSG ultimately won on penalties.</p>

          <p>A new large-scale study from Sweden suggests that drug treatments for ADHD offer wider life benefits beyond managing core symptoms. The research, published in the British Medical Journal, found that taking ADHD medication was linked to significant reductions in first-time instances of suicidal behavior, substance misuse, transport accidents, and criminal behavior. Researchers believe the medication's effect on reducing impulsivity and improving concentration contributes to these positive outcomes. The findings provide new evidence that could help patients and doctors weigh the long-term benefits of treatment.</p>

          <p>In response to U.S. efforts to curb China's dominance in shipbuilding, South Korean firms are increasing their investments in Southeast Asian countries like the Philippines. Companies such as HD Hyundai are reviving bankrupt shipyards in the region to leverage lower labor costs and expand capacity, aiming to enhance their competitive edge against Chinese rivals. This strategic shift is seen as a way to overcome domestic constraints like labor shortages. HD Hyundai plans a $550 million investment in a Philippine shipyard, expecting to create 7,000 jobs.

          <p>An essay in The Atlantic examines the shift in public trust from traditional media institutions to individual online creators, creating a challenging environment for credible information. The author, an independent journalist, argues that while social media is rife with misinformation, there is a growing ecosystem of 'evidence-based creators' fighting an uphill battle. To thrive, this new media model needs infrastructure, such as independent certification for journalistic standards and shared professional resources. The article suggests that legacy media should partner with these creators rather than view them as a threat.</p>

          <p>Marc Maron, a pioneering figure in podcasting, has criticized the current state of the medium he helped popularize, labeling much of it as 'mediocre.' As he prepares to end his long-running show 'WTF,' Maron expressed that the proliferation of podcasts has lowered the bar, comparing it to a world of uninspired 'afternoon drive-time radio.' He specifically called out the trend of hosts pandering to certain political ideologies. The comments come as Maron concludes his influential show, which began in 2009 and featured in-depth interviews with a wide range of prominent guests.</p>

This valuation, based on revenue and growth potential, places the Rams alongside the Lakers as one of L.A.'s two sports franchises valued at over $10 billion, reflecting the successful monetization of the venue.
