        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow U.S. colleges to pay athletes, marking a significant shift in college sports history. The settlement permits schools to share up to $20.5 million with athletes annually and allocates $2.7 billion over the next decade to former players previously barred from revenue. The agreement brings professionalization to college athletics, impacting recruitment, program offerings, and the overall structure of the NCAA. The deal also brings some uniformity to the rules, states still have separate laws regarding how NIL can be doled out, which could lead to legal challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge approved the House v. NCAA settlement, ushering in a new era for college sports where athletes can be directly paid by colleges. Starting this fall, NCAA's top division schools can pay athletes, capped initially at $20.5 million per school, and over $2 billion will be paid to former athletes who were not allowed to earn money while in school. The settlement arose from lawsuits challenging the NCAA's tradition of amateurism, given the exponential growth of money in college athletics. Half of the NCAA's Division I schools are expected to adopt the new framework, while a third-party clearinghouse will review licensing agreements for fair market value.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, three months after being wrongly deported to El Salvador, was flown back to the United States to face federal charges. The charges relate to alleged involvement in an alien smuggling ring, which the Trump administration had been alleging for months. The return to the U.S. follows court orders to facilitate his return after the wrongful deportation. The charges are separate from the circumstances of his deportation and will be addressed in federal court.</p>

          <p>The phone call between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could provide relief for many Asian countries caught in the rivalry between the two superpowers. The call, described as "very positive" by Trump, is seen as a diplomatic breakthrough after weeks of worsening tensions. For China‚Äôs neighbors that rely on trade with both powers, the call eases the predicament of prioritizing trade with China while navigating aggressive US policies. However, some analysts believe the relationship between the two powers has become more fragile than ever.</p>
