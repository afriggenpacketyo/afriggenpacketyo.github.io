        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have identified a new species of prehistoric whale, named Janjucetus dullardi, from fossils found on Victoria's Surf Coast in Australia. Living around 26 million years ago, this ancient relative of modern baleen whales was a compact, dolphin-sized predator with large eyes and razor-sharp teeth for hunting, unlike its filter-feeding descendants. The discovery, based on a juvenile skull found by a local resident, provides crucial insights into the early evolution of whales and their predatory adaptations. Scientists believe this finding reinforces the region's role as a key location for understanding the history of these marine mammals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Demand for mortgage refinancing in the U.S. saw a significant 23% increase last week, driven by a slight dip in interest rates. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage decreased to 6.67%, prompting many homeowners, particularly those with larger loans, to seek lower payments. The data also reveals a notable rise in demand for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which increased by 25% to their highest level since 2022 due to their more attractive initial rates. However, applications for home purchases saw only a marginal 1% rise, indicating that affordability remains a major challenge for potential buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new book, "A Marriage at Sea," details the incredible survival story of Maurice and Maralyn Bailey, who were adrift on a life raft in the Pacific Ocean for 117 days in 1973 after a whale sank their sailboat. The couple, who had set out to sail around the world, endured starvation and illness with minimal supplies before being rescued. The article explores how their shared ordeal and contrasting personalities—Maralyn's optimism balancing Maurice's negativity—strengthened their bond. Their story serves as an extreme example of how shared meaning and mutual support can be fundamental to a lasting relationship.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 06:48:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average interest rate for a two-year fixed-rate mortgage in the United Kingdom has dropped to 4.99%, marking the first time it has fallen below the 5% threshold since the market turmoil caused by the mini-budget in September 2022. Financial data company Moneyfacts described this as a "symbolic turning point," suggesting increased competition among lenders. Despite this positive development, rates remain significantly higher than the historic lows seen before the mini-budget. With 1.6 million fixed-rate deals expiring in 2025, this easing of rates offers some relief to homeowners facing remortgaging in a still-challenging economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists analyzing the destructive magnitude 7.7 earthquake that struck central Myanmar in March 2025 hope the data can improve future earthquake forecasting. The quake, which caused thousands of deaths, resulted from a rapid, "supershear" rupture along the Sagaing Fault. A new study used this data to create a model incorporating the fault's "memory effect" from past events, forecasting that the next major quake could occur around 2166. While precise earthquake prediction remains impossible, researchers believe that refining these forecasting models is crucial for enhancing disaster preparedness and creating more accurate long-term hazard assessments for vulnerable regions.</p>

          <h2>China Develops Robotic Breeding Plant to Accelerate Hybrid Crop Development</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 06:00:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in China have created a world-first intelligent breeding factory that uses a combination of gene editing and AI-driven robotics to dramatically speed up the development of new hybrid crops. By genetically modifying plants to have features more accessible to robots, the system can automate the breeding process, reducing the time to develop new varieties from five years to just one. This innovation is expected to revolutionize agriculture by enabling the rapid creation of crops with desirable traits like better flavor and disease resistance, while also cutting down on costly manual labor. The research was published in the journal Cell.</p>

          <p>A sports betting website has ranked California as the best state in the U.S. for stargazing, a conclusion that has some local astronomers questioning the methodology. The ranking by Action Network considered factors like sky visibility, elevation, and astronomical infrastructure. While experts agree that California has excellent dark sky locations like Joshua Tree and Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, they are skeptical of the website's analysis, particularly its focus on spotting asteroids, which are not visible to the naked eye. They recommend that aspiring stargazers visit local observatories or join astronomy clubs for the best viewing experiences.</p>
