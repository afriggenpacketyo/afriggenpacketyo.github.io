She has since traveled to over 20 countries, journeying down the Pan-American Highway.

          <p>French scientists have identified a new blood type, dubbed "Gwada negative," in a woman from Guadeloupe. The discovery, made by the French Blood Establishment (EFS), marks the 48th blood group system recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion. The unusual antibody was initially detected in 2011, but the genetic mutation was only identified in 2019 through high-throughput DNA sequencing. The woman, now 54, is believed to be the only known carrier of this blood type, inherited from both her parents, and scientists hope to find others with the same rare blood group to improve care for patients with rare blood types.</p>

          <p>Lemon water is a popular beverage, but its health benefits are often exaggerated on social media. While it won't "detox" your body or cause weight loss, it can be a refreshing way to stay hydrated. Lemon water contains a small amount of vitamin C and antioxidants and can be part of a soothing morning routine. However, it's important to be mindful of its acidity, which can weaken tooth enamel, and it may irritate those prone to heartburn.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave approaches, experts say US sunscreens are less effective than those available in other countries, particularly in protecting against UVA rays. Regulatory differences and the FDA's slow approval of new UV filters contribute to this disparity. A bipartisan bill aims to modernize sunscreen regulations, but dermatologists stress the importance of wearing sunscreen properly, recommending broad-spectrum options with an SPF of 30 or higher. Mineral sunscreens containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are considered the safest.</p>
