          <p>SpaceX launched its Starship rocket on its ninth test flight, achieving orbit but encountering problems that led to the loss of both stages. The Super Heavy booster suffered a catastrophic failure during its descent, while the Starship upper stage experienced a propellant leak, causing it to spin out of control and break up during reentry. Despite these setbacks, SpaceX reported progress, including a successful ascent and no significant heat shield tile loss, with plans to review the data and conduct future tests. The mission aimed to test payload deployment and gather data on extreme descent trajectories, which are critical for the development of a fully reusable spacecraft for future missions to the moon and Mars. </p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will no longer recommend routine COVID-19 shots for healthy children and pregnant women, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This marks a significant shift from the previous guidance advocating annual shots for everyone aged six months and older, citing a lack of clinical data to support the shots for healthy children. While some medical experts have expressed concern about this decision, emphasizing the risk of severe illness in infants and pregnant women, others support the change, highlighting the potential for natural immunity and longer-lasting protection in children. The decision-making process typically involves the CDC's advisory committee, which had been weighing options to narrow vaccine recommendations to high-risk groups. Optimism score is based on a relatively neutral tone and the existence of varying perspectives in the article.</p>

          <p>Onosato was promoted to sumo's highest rank of yokozuna on Wednesday, reaching the honor after just 13 professional tournaments, a record pace. The 24-year-old from Ishikawa Prefecture became the 75th yokozuna and the first Japanese-born grand champion since his stablemaster Nishonoseki in 2017. Onosato's promotion was secured by winning the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament, meeting the benchmark of consecutive championships as an ozeki.

          <p>The Fairness, Inclusion, Rehabilitation, and Expungement for Incarcerated Firefighters (FIRE) Act has been introduced to support former inmate firefighters by funding job training, workplace opportunities, and mentoring programs. The act also seeks to create a pathway for expunging the criminal records of those who successfully complete probation and reentry. Incarcerated firefighters, who make up around 30% of California's wildfire crews, currently earn low wages while risking their lives. The proposed legislation would offer incentives for other states to start their own fire camp programs, expand occupational safety coverage, and recognize incarcerated firefighters as employees entitled to wage protections.</p>

Many adults learn about their ADHD when someone else in their family has the diagnosis because ADHD is highly genetic.
