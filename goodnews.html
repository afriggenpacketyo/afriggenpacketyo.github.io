          <p>A baseball bat used by 12-year-old Marco Rocco, who was initially suspended for flipping it in celebration of a home run, has been sold at auction for $9,882. The suspension, which sparked a legal battle and drew support from major league players, was eventually overturned by a judge. All proceeds from the auction, which drew 68 bids, will be donated to the Haddonfield Little League program where Rocco plays. His father expressed Marco's happiness in being able to give back to an organization that has been a significant part of his life.</p>

          <p>A performance at the Hollywood Bowl titled “Sarabande Africaine” featured a unique collaboration between cellist Yo-Yo Ma and Afropop singer Angélique Kidjo, exploring the African origins of Baroque-era dances like the sarabande. The concert blended works from Bach and Handel with African drumming, Caribbean percussion, and interpretations of pieces by Philip Glass and George Gershwin. The review praises the show's ability to demonstrate a harmonious fusion of diverse musical traditions, though notes it could occasionally feel preachy. The event showcased how different musical languages can create a compelling and unified artistic statement.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to $1 billion for the first time in over a year after 39 consecutive drawings without a grand prize winner. This prize ranks as the sixth-largest in the game's history, with players facing odds of 1 in 292.2 million to match all six numbers. Winners can choose between a 30-year annuity or a lump-sum cash option of nearly half the advertised amount. All winnings are subject to a 24% federal tax withholding, with the total federal tax rate likely reaching 37%, in addition to state taxes where applicable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists have discovered approximately 40 ancient tombs, believed to be over 2,300 years old, in northern Iraq after a severe drought caused water levels in the Mosul Dam reservoir to drop significantly. The tombs, likely from the Hellenistic period, were unearthed in the Khanke region of Duhok province. While the prolonged drought has devastated agriculture, it has provided a unique opportunity for excavation work in areas typically submerged. The archaeological team is working to excavate and move the artifacts to a museum for preservation before the water levels rise again.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool is reportedly unwilling to include defender Joe Gomez in a loan deal to facilitate the signing of Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi. Crystal Palace had explored the possibility of taking Gomez on loan as part of a potential £30 million deal for Guehi, who has indicated he will not sign a new contract. With his current deal expiring next summer, Palace is reluctant to lose the 25-year-old on a free transfer. The club is actively seeking to sign two new central defenders before the transfer window closes, which could pave the way for Guehi's departure.</p>

The article critiques the intense media focus on the engagement, contrasting it with Swift's silence on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, arguing that choosing not to use her immense influence on such issues is a deliberate political choice.</p>
