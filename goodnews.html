          <p>President Trump is hosting a roundtable event at the White House where CEOs from Uber, Dell, Goldman Sachs, and other companies are expected to announce billions in investments into "Trump accounts" for the children of their employees. This program, previously known as "MAGA Accounts," would seed index fund accounts with $1,000 in government funds for U.S. citizens born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028. The House has already passed the provision to create these accounts as part of a larger budget bill, but it is currently facing pushback in the Senate from fiscally conservative Republicans who are demanding major changes. The event, titled "Invest America," aims to promote the pilot program. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government has largely reversed its cuts to winter fuel payments, raising questions about its spending plans and fiscal rules. Initially, the government planned to provide winter fuel payments only to pensioners receiving pension credit, but after criticism, it will now provide payments to all pensioners, clawing them back in the following tax year from individuals earning ¬£35,000 and above. This change will cost ¬£1.25bn, resulting in a saving of ¬£450m compared to the original system, but some analysts believe the net saving could be lower due to increased pension credit claims. The Treasury will address the resulting ¬£1bn gap in the next Budget in the Autumn of 2025.</p>

          <p>An article in *The Atlantic* defends the "wife guy" identity, arguing that publicly expressing love for one's wife should not be viewed with suspicion. The author reflects on how his own expressions of adoration have been noticed and judged, leading him to consider the reasons behind the skepticism towards men who openly display affection for their spouses. He suggests that the term "wife guy" has evolved into a pejorative, implying that such displays are insincere or compensatory, but argues that vulnerability and openness are essential aspects of love and marriage. The author concludes that he is content with being known as a "guy who loves his wife a lot," regardless of the nicknames it may bring.</p>

          <p>Chipotle is set to release its first new dip in five years, called Adobo Ranch, available at restaurants beginning June 17. The new dipping sauce combines adobo pepper, sour cream, and a blend of herbs and spices, aiming to tap into the ranch flavor craze with a smoky, spicy twist. Chipotle Rewards members can try the new flavor for free on launch day by enrolling before 11 p.m. local time on June 16. The company is introducing this new offering after facing criticism last year over bowl sizes, with allegations that some restaurants were skimping on portions.</p>

          <p>Chicago has implemented various strategies to resist Trump's anti-immigration policies, rooted in collaboration between organizations and a history of protecting immigrant communities. The city has implemented a Know Your Rights campaign, holds community meetings, and oversees rapid-response groups to monitor ICE activity. Volunteer interest in anti-deportation efforts has surged, but there is still a strong sense of fear among immigrants. Chicago's pro-immigrant stance is evident through its policies, including the Welcoming City ordinance, which restricts city agencies from providing information on undocumented immigrants to ICE.</p>
