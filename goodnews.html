          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has launched a new pilot program, the Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing Integration Pilot Program (eIPP), aimed at accelerating the development and use of electric air taxis. The initiative seeks to establish the U.S. as a global leader in this emerging aviation technology by creating new regulations and fostering partnerships between the FAA, private companies, and local governments. The three-year program will involve at least five pilot projects testing both piloted and unmanned aircraft for cargo delivery and emergency services like medical transport. Companies such as Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation have already announced their plans to participate in the program.</p>

          <p>In response to a historic drought that severely restricted vessel traffic, the Panama Canal Authority is moving forward with significant infrastructure investments to ensure future operational stability. The plans include constructing a new dam and tunnel project to supplement the canal's main water source, Lake Gatun, which is crucial for the lock system's operation. Additionally, a new "land bridge" featuring a natural gas pipeline is being developed to transport energy products between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, offering an alternative to the waterway itself. These projects aim to mitigate the impacts of climate change and secure the canal's role as a critical artery for global trade, particularly for the U.S. economy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's financial regulator is considering a proposal to allow banks to increase or completely remove the £100 limit on contactless card payments, prompting a debate about consumer behavior and security. Academics warn that eliminating the need to enter a PIN for larger purchases could lead to more impulsive spending and debt accumulation, particularly with credit cards. While some consumers and fintech experts argue the change is overdue, as digital wallets on smartphones already have no limit, others express concerns. Charities highlight the potential for increased financial abuse in controlling relationships and the risk of theft, advocating for consumers to have the ability to set their own personal limits.</p>

          <p>Customs officers in Hamburg, Germany, arrested two men and seized over 400 kilograms of cocaine in a significant drug bust at the city's port. The operation was initiated after vigilant dock workers noticed two men, who were not recognized as port employees, boarding a ship and later leaving with more than 20 large sports bags. The workers alerted customs officials, who intervened and stopped the suspects' vehicle. One suspect was apprehended immediately, while the other was caught after a search involving a police helicopter. The incident highlights Hamburg's status as a major entry point for cocaine into Europe, a problem that officials have described as a "cocaine surge."</p>

The team has scored seven goals from long throws since the start of last season, significantly more than any other club in the league. A recent late goal against Chelsea, originating from a Kevin Schade long throw, secured a crucial draw and highlighted the effectiveness of this direct approach. Brentford's manager, Keith Andrews, who previously served as the team's set-piece coach, defends the tactic against accusations of being unsophisticated, viewing it as a legitimate way to create chaos for defenses and gain a competitive advantage.</p>

          <p>A recent memorandum of understanding between China's Hainan province and Hong Kong signals a new era of economic cooperation rather than competition. This article argues that Hainan's development as a free trade port is not meant to replace Hong Kong but to complement its strengths, expanding China's economic toolkit. Hong Kong's world-class financial system, with its expertise in asset management, legal services, and risk management, can provide the necessary structure and global connectivity for Hainan's growth. By anchoring Hainan's cross-border capital flows, Hong Kong can lend credibility while also benefiting from new avenues of collaboration in sectors like tourism and high-end services.</p>

          <p>Earl Richardson, the former president of Morgan State University who led a landmark lawsuit against the state of Maryland for underfunding its historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), has passed away at the age of 81. The 15-year legal battle, which he helped organize in 2006, resulted in a historic $577 million settlement in 2021 for four of the state's HBCUs. Richardson's colleagues remembered him as a visionary leader "armed with history" who fought to address systemic funding disparities. During his tenure as president from 1984 to 2010, Morgan State saw its enrollment double and its campus expand significantly, a period often referred to as "Richardson's Renaissance."</p>

The 6-foot-6 German forward, signed from Stuttgart, headed in a cross to the delight of the home crowd at St. James' Park. His successful debut provided a timely boost for the club, especially after it was revealed that fellow new signing Yoane Wissa will be out with an injury until October. Manager Eddie Howe praised Woltemade as a creative and distinctive player, acknowledging that while he needs to adapt physically to the league, his performance showed promising signs for the team.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Thai government has lifted a long-standing ban and will now permit long-term refugees from Myanmar, living in border camps, to work legally in the country. This policy change affects approximately 80,000 refugees, some of whom have been in the camps since the 1980s. The decision comes after the U.S. under President Trump cut humanitarian aid programs, which were the primary source of food for the camps, leading to a precarious situation and rising malnutrition. The UN Refugee Agency has praised the move as a potential "regional benchmark" for a rights-based solution, allowing refugees to become self-sufficient while also helping to fill labor shortages in the local Thai economy.</p>
