          <p>A British-flagged luxury superyacht, the Bayesian, was successfully lifted from the seabed off Sicily after sinking in August 2024, resulting in the deaths of seven people, including British tech magnate Mike Lynch. The complex operation, led by TMC Marine, involved pumping seawater from the hull and securing it with steel lifting straps. The yacht, which was lying at a depth of 50 meters, was transported to Termini Imerese for further investigation into the cause of the sinking. Italian authorities are continuing their criminal investigation into the incident, which occurred during a violent storm as Lynch celebrated his acquittal on fraud charges. The upper decks of the Bayesian appeared badly damaged, and the blue hull was covered in mud after its time on the seabed. The captain and most of the crew survived the sinking, but the chef was among those who perished.</p>

          <p>Jobe Bellingham scored on his first start for Borussia Dortmund in a Club World Cup match, drawing inevitable comparisons to his brother Jude, who also scored in his debut for the club. The 19-year-old's goal came 45 minutes into the game against Mamelodi Sundowns, slightly later than Jude's debut goal in 2020. Jobe's goal showcased his anticipation, poise, agility, and ruthlessness, as he timed his run perfectly and fired past the goalkeeper with a slight deflection. Despite the goal, Dortmund lost the match 4-3; however, Jobe's performance on his full debut demonstrated the skill he has been working on. His contribution and the comparison to his brother are sure to continue.</p>

          <p>The UK recorded its hottest day of the year, reaching 33.2C in Charlwood, as a Met Office yellow warning for thunderstorms came into effect. The humid weather has created unstable atmospheric conditions, raising the risk of localized flash flooding, large hail, and lightning. An amber heat-health alert issued by the UK Health Security Agency remains in force until Monday, with research suggesting nearly 600 heat-related deaths could occur in England and Wales over the next four days. Passengers were evacuated from a train in south London due to a fault amid the high temperatures, and the National Fire Chiefs Council is urging caution with barbecues and flammable materials.</p>

He accused the White House of attempting to dehumanize those who disagree with the administration. New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined Khalil, stating that his release demonstrates the Trump administration is losing its legal battle to deport migrants advocating for Palestinians.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from making drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation. The ruling struck down a policy change that could have stripped universities of millions of dollars in research funding, particularly in fields like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. The judge deemed the change arbitrary and capricious, arguing it was contrary to law. The policy change would have capped indirect costs for NSF awards to universities at 15%, a move that the University of California estimated would cost it nearly $100 million annually.</p>
