          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is addressing the fallout from federal immigration raids in the city, which have sparked protests and economic concerns. Bass, a former community organizer, has denounced the Trump administration's actions as chaotic and has emphasized the importance of immigrants to Los Angeles' identity. She is working to ensure the safety of immigrant residents and has criticized the portrayal of Los Angeles as a war zone. The mayor is also grappling with the economic impact of the raids, as many immigrants are afraid to go to work, and is urging residents to support local businesses. Bass's leadership is being tested as she navigates this crisis, while also addressing ongoing issues such as homelessness and economic challenges.</p>

          <p>A 12-year-old girl sustained injuries after encountering an alligator while swimming in Lake Waccamaw, North Carolina. The girl yelled, "Something bit me!" and the other children were immediately rushed out of the water, at which point an alligator surfaced. The injuries were serious but not life-threatening, and the alligator, a 12-foot male, was subsequently euthanized according to NCWRC protocol. Officials remind residents and visitors to remain vigilant and aware of their surroundings, respecting the water and understanding that these animals are not tame or pets, and to maintain a safe distance if one is sighted.</p>

          <p>China is spearheading the construction of a comprehensive space weather monitoring network, the International Meridian Circle Programme (IMCP), comprising a vast chain of observatories across more than 10 countries. This ground-based system aims to enhance understanding and forecasting of solar activity, including solar storms, which can disrupt satellite communications and power grids. The IMCP, excluding the United States, officially launched at a forum in Chengdu, with several international organizations and research institutes joining the initiative. The project seeks to create a matrix of surveillance stations spanning a significant portion of the Earth to improve predictions and mitigate potential disruptions caused by solar events.</p>

          <p>Olga Khazan, a staff writer, embarked on a project to change aspects of her personality, challenging the long-held belief that personality is fixed after age 30. Inspired by research showing personality plasticity, Khazan consulted experts and designed an experiment to improve her extroversion and reduce her neuroticism. She engaged in activities like improv classes and meditation, tracking her progress with numerical scores. While the process was often uncomfortable, Khazan found that she could indeed shift core parts of her personality, leading to increased happiness and a greater ability to connect with others.</p>

The defect could cause the brake pedal to move side to side, potentially preventing motorists from safely stopping, and affected vehicles will display a warning light and an abnormal pedal feeling. Owners of the recalled vehicles will be contacted and instructed to take their vehicles to a dealer for brake pedal replacement, if necessary.</p>

          <p>Juneteenth, a federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the United States, derives its name from a portmanteau of June and nineteenth, the date in 1865 when enslaved people in Texas were informed of their freedom. President Abraham Lincoln had signed the Emancipation Proclamation more than two years earlier, but its implementation in Confederate territory was delayed until the Union Army's arrival. The holiday's recognition reflects a growing acknowledgment of emancipation as a critical turning point in U.S. history, and communities celebrate with parades, parties, and cultural events.</p>

If we truly want to supercharge switching to electric vehicles, both the industry and the government have to be on the side of drivers. We need policies to incentivize and reward the right behaviors, but we also need to introduce propositions that take the cost and complexity out of going electric. Solutions are emerging to help with such cost challenges and anxieties, such as subscription models to remove significant upfront costs to install a home charger.</p>

          <p>Hundreds gathered at the Minnesota capitol to honor Democratic Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, who were killed in what authorities are calling a political assassination. Mourners brought flowers and candles, while Governor Tim Walz consoled attendees and a brass band performed. Colin Hortman, the couple's son, placed a photograph of his parents on their memorial, and a large blanket was laid out for attendees to pen messages. The vigil, attended by people of diverse political backgrounds, emphasized Hortman's kindness and dedication to improving people's lives.</p>

          <p>At National History Day, students from across the U.S. presented projects on a range of historical topics, showcasing their research and analytical skills. The competition, which faced funding challenges this year, invites middle and high school students to present documentaries, performances, websites, papers, and exhibits on any topic from history, as long as it adheres to the year‚Äôs theme. This year‚Äôs theme, "Rights and Responsibilities," seemed especially prescient, with students exploring topics ranging from the Salem witch trials to the Americans with Disabilities Act. The event emphasizes active, firsthand research and encourages students to engage with history in a meaningful way.</p>
