          <h2>UK Proposes Expansion of Bottom Trawling Ban in English Waters</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 06:42:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is considering extending a ban on bottom trawling, a fishing method involving dragging large nets along the seafloor, to cover a larger area of England's Marine Protected Areas. This proposal would expand the ban from 18,000km2 to 48,000km2, aiming to protect rare marine animals and delicate seabed habitats. The decision follows warnings from environmental advocates like Sir David Attenborough about the destructive impact of bottom trawling on marine ecosystems. A 12-week consultation period will gather input from the marine and fishing industries before a final decision is made, balancing environmental concerns with the needs of fishing communities. The move aligns with international efforts to protect marine environments and promote sustainable fishing practices.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports of rare earth elements experienced a significant decline in May, with the value dropping nearly half compared to the previous year. This decrease is seen as a reflection of Beijing's ability to leverage its control over the critical mineral supply chain in trade negotiations with the United States. The data from the General Administration of Customs showed a 48.3% year-on-year decrease in the value of rare earth exports. While the cumulative amount of exported rare earths in the first five months of the year was slightly higher than the same period last year, the recent decline underscores China's strategic advantage in critical minerals. This comes ahead of anticipated talks between the US and China, highlighting the potential for trade tensions and negotiations.</p>

          <p>Faced with water scarcity and rapid population growth, St. George, Utah, is investing in wastewater reclamation to stretch its water supply. The city plans to build a new wastewater treatment plant that will clean sewage for reuse in irrigation, eventually integrating it directly into the drinking supply. This project is part of a broader effort to address water challenges in the American West, where overuse and drought are straining the Colorado River. The high cost of such infrastructure makes it a last resort, but the scarcity of water is making the option ever more attractive.</p>

          <p>As the federal government reduces its responsibilities, states are considering forming coalitions to pool resources and address challenges such as disaster relief, public health, and consumer protection. These collaborations would allow states to maintain essential services and regulatory oversight in the face of federal cutbacks. The approach could foster competition among states, with those offering better services attracting residents and businesses. While some argue that these arrangements require congressional authorization, courts have suggested that such approval is only necessary when states threaten federal supremacy. The strategy offers a potential pathway for states to rebuild a new national compact and demonstrate resourceful public service.</p>

Progressive groups are now being urged to be more transparent about their campaign efforts, including sharing details about programs that flopped. As traditional canvassing methods become less effective, the party needs to invest in deeper engagement with voters, starting long before elections, and also need to learn from the success of the well-funded MAGA movement. </p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced a goal to increase Japan's nominal GDP to 1,000 trillion yen ($7 trillion) by 2040. This target is significantly higher than the country's current nominal GDP of around 600 trillion yen in 2024. Ishiba has instructed ruling party executives to include this objective in their pledge for the upcoming nationwide election this summer. The move signals a commitment to long-term economic growth and stability in Japan. The announcement comes as Japan prepares for an election for the House of Councillors.</p>
