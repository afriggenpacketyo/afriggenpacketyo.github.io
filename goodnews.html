          <p>A court ruled that the European Union should not have denied a New York Times journalist's request for text messages exchanged between Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, and Pfizer's CEO during negotiations for coronavirus vaccines.

The New York Times hailed the ruling as a victory for transparency and accountability, emphasizing that ephemeral communications are not beyond public scrutiny.

          <p>India and Pakistan exchanged detained soldiers at the Attari-Wagah border, signaling that the cease-fire ending recent fighting between the countries is holding. An Indian Border Security Force soldier was returned after three weeks of detention, and a Pakistani Ranger was handed over in return. The soldiers had inadvertently crossed into each other's territory before the recent military confrontation. Commercial flights have resumed, and Kashmiris have started returning to their homes. </p>
