          <p>China is rapidly becoming the world's leader in green energy, particularly in solar panel and electric vehicle production. This dominance presents an opportunity for global leadership based on clean energy capability rather than traditional metrics like wealth or military power. However, the opinion piece argues that for this leadership to be beneficial for the world, China must ensure its practices are fair and its technology accessible. The article highlights the dramatic drop in solar costs, underscoring the scale of China's influence on the future of global energy and governance.</p>

          <p>German software company SAP, Europe's most valuable firm, has indicated that ongoing trade tensions with the United States are causing delays in large customer transactions. The company's CFO noted that while deals are not disappearing, approvals are facing more scrutiny, impacting sectors like manufacturing with complex global supply chains. Despite missing revenue forecasts, SAP expressed cautious optimism following the announcement of a new U.S.-Japan trade agreement, hoping it signals a reduction in global economic uncertainty. The company is navigating these challenges while continuing its focus on cloud computing and AI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an inflationary economy, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way to grow savings, with top accounts currently providing returns that outpace inflation. CDs allow savers to lock in high interest rates for a fixed term and are typically insured by the FDIC or NCUA up to $250,000. The article notes a significant difference between national average yields and the higher rates offered by online banks, which have lower overhead costs. It also explains the current inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs often have higher rates than long-term ones. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta has rolled out new safety features for its platforms, including Instagram, aimed at protecting teenage users from predatory behavior and exploitative content. The updates include enhanced direct messaging protections, providing teens with more information about accounts they interact with and simplifying the process of blocking and reporting suspicious users. This move follows increased pressure from policymakers and accusations that the company has not done enough to shield young people from harm. Meta also reported removing hundreds of thousands of accounts linked to the sexualization of children and predatory behavior.</p>

          <p>With the national average savings account interest rate remaining low, high-yield savings accounts present a significantly better option for earning interest on emergency funds and other savings. These accounts, often offered by online banks with lower overhead costs, can provide rates more than ten times higher than traditional savings accounts. The article emphasizes the importance of shopping around and comparing different accounts, considering not just the interest rates but also any potential fees. Securing a higher rate can lead to substantial growth in savings over time due to the power of compounding interest. (not investment advice)</p>

In return, Japan has committed to investing $550 billion in the U.S. to bolster supply chains in key sectors and increase purchases of American agricultural products.

          <p>Two former city traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for interest rate rigging overturned by the UK's Supreme Court after a decade-long legal battle. The men were jailed for manipulating the Libor and Euribor benchmark interest rates, which affect borrowing costs for loans worldwide. They have consistently argued they were wrongly prosecuted for what were then common commercial practices. The Supreme Court ruled that errors in the jury directions during their original trials made the convictions "unsafe," leading to their exoneration.

At 19, Choi was attacked, but the court at the time ruled her actions exceeded "reasonable bounds of self-defense," and she was given a suspended prison sentence. Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi, now 80, successfully petitioned for a retrial after years of campaigning.
