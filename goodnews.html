          <h2>Review Calls for Stronger Regulation of England and Wales Water Sector</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review has found that the water sector in England and Wales is failing, citing pollution, financial difficulties, mismanagement, and infrastructure failures as reasons for shaking public trust. Led by former Bank of England deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe, the Water Commission suggests stronger regulation to better protect billpayers and the environment. The government initiated the review in October amidst growing public concern about sewage spills and rising bills. The government has ruled out nationalizing the sector, arguing that it would be too expensive and would not necessarily lead to improvements.</p>
