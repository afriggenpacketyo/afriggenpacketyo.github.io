          <h2>Opinion: China's Commemoration of WWII Can Coexist with an Appreciation for Modern Japan</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-19 17:30:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that China's commemoration of the 80th anniversary of its victory over Japan in World War II is about historical reflection, not inciting hatred. The author contends that remembering the brutality of the Japanese invasion is a necessary act of truth-telling and is separate from perceptions of modern Japan. Drawing from personal experience growing up with Japanese pop culture like manga and anime, the writer suggests it is possible to condemn past aggression while embracing contemporary Japanese culture and people. The piece distinguishes between education about historical atrocities and the systematic cultivation of hostility.</p>

          <p>In the revamped US Open mixed doubles competition, the highly anticipated partnership of Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu was defeated in straight sets by Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula. Draper, who is childhood friends with Raducanu, played a dominant match, consistently targeting his British counterpart at the net. Despite the loss, Alcaraz produced the shot of the match with a spectacular forehand winner around the net post. The match marked a positive return for Draper, who had been sidelined with an injury, while the experienced Pegula provided a steadying presence for their successful pairing.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that President Trump's recent summits with Ukrainian and European leaders have significantly improved the prospects for ending the war in Ukraine. The author argues that despite ongoing Russian aggression, the affable tone of the meetings and the focus on security guarantees represent a positive step. However, the piece also highlights formidable obstacles, such as Vladimir Putin's potential disinterest in a genuine deal and the deep-seated opposition within Ukrainian society to ceding any territory. The author suggests Trump can maintain momentum by continuing to back Ukraine's security and leveraging strategic ambiguity with Moscow.</p>

          <p>Major food chains like McDonald's, Dunkin', and Starbucks are increasingly focusing on new and customized beverage offerings to drive sales, particularly among younger consumers. The number of drink options at top chains has risen over 9% in the past year, with a strong emphasis on cold beverages, specialty coffees, and energy drinks. This trend reflects a shift in consumer behavior, where beverages are becoming the primary reason for a visit rather than just an add-on to a meal. Companies are launching products like cereal-flavored lattes and protein-infused cold foams to capture this growing and profitable market segment.</p>

          <p>Nvidia is reportedly developing a new artificial intelligence chip for China, tentatively named the B30A, which is said to be more powerful than its current offerings for that market. This follows a deal where Nvidia and AMD agreed to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of their China sales in exchange for permission to sell chips there. The Trump administration had previously halted advanced chip sales over national security concerns. Nvidia confirmed it is evaluating various products to remain competitive within government-allowed limits, emphasizing that its offerings are for commercial use. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that Intel will be required to give the U.S. government a non-voting equity stake in the company in exchange for receiving funds from the CHIPS Act.

This development comes as the Trump administration explores greater involvement with the struggling chipmaker to bolster domestic manufacturing. Intel, which was previously awarded a nearly $8 billion grant, has recently slowed construction on its major factory complex in Ohio. (not investment advice)</p>
