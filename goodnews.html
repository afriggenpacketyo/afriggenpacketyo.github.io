          <h2>Republicans Clash Over Clean Energy Tax Credits Affecting Alaskan Communities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 09:53:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York Times article details the intraparty conflict among Republicans in Congress regarding the repeal of Biden-era clean energy tax credits, particularly concerning their impact on isolated Alaskan communities. For villages like Noatak, these tax credits are crucial for funding solar panel farms and reducing reliance on expensive diesel fuel flown in from afar, costing residents exorbitant amounts for electricity. Senator Lisa Murkowski is a key proponent of retaining these credits, emphasizing their importance for long-term energy projects and job creation in Alaska. The article highlights the financial struggles faced by Alaskans, who often have to choose between heating fuel and gasoline, and underscores the uncertainty caused by potential defunding of these credits, leaving renewable energy projects in limbo.</p>

          <p>Major League Soccer (MLS) is experiencing a surge in sponsorships and stadium attendance, buoyed by the rising popularity of soccer in the U.S. and the arrival of Lionel Messi. Sponsorship revenue is up double digits compared to 2024, with brands like Michelob Ultra and Adidas investing heavily in the league. The upcoming 2026 World Cup, to be held in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, is also contributing to this growth. The article notes that MLS's fanbase is younger and more diverse, making it an attractive demographic for advertisers, though viewership metrics remain opaque due to exclusive streaming on Apple TV's MLS Season Pass.</p>

          <p>General Motors (GM) has been engaged in a decade-long initiative to restore Cadillac's prominence as the quintessential American luxury car brand, focusing on all-electric vehicles, sporty sedans, and the iconic Escalade. GM President Mark Reuss has spearheaded this effort, aiming to compete with luxury brands like BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Tesla. The strategy involves isolating Cadillac's products from GM's other brands and prioritizing value over volume, with a focus on bespoke vehicles like the $300,000 Celestiq. While Cadillac has seen success in North America, challenges remain in China, where sales have declined amid growing competition from domestic brands.</p>
