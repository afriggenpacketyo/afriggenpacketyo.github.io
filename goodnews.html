          <p>President Trump met with South Korea's new president, Lee Jae Myung, at the White House, discussing trade and North Korea. Trump touted his "great relationship" with Kim Jong-un and expressed a desire for a future meeting, aiming for progress on the Korean Peninsula. Despite earlier social media posts from Trump suggesting turmoil in South Korea, he adopted a softer tone during the meeting, while both leaders also addressed ongoing trade negotiations. The article highlights the complex diplomatic landscape between the U.S., South Korea, and North Korea.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Metropolitan Police reported "far fewer" incidents of serious violence at this year's Notting Hill Carnival compared to previous years, despite 423 arrests over two days. There were two stabbings, neither resulting in serious injury, a notable reduction from the eight stabbings and two deaths last year. Assistant Commissioner Matt Ward attributed this improvement to the use of live facial recognition, metal detectors, and stop-and-search operations. Civil liberty groups have criticized the reintroduction of facial recognition technology, citing concerns about mass surveillance and accuracy for women and people of color.</p>

He is expected to be sentenced in January, facing a likely life imprisonment.

          <p>Warren Buffett informed CNBC that Berkshire Hathaway is not looking to acquire another railroad, despite meeting with CSX CEO Joseph Hinrichs. Instead, discussions focused on increasing cooperation to enhance freight rail efficiency. This clarification followed speculation that Berkshire might join the takeover fray after Union Pacific's bid for Norfolk Southern. Following Buffett's comments, CSX shares dropped 5%, while Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern, and Berkshire Hathaway also saw declines, reflecting the market's reaction to the news that a major acquisition by Berkshire was off the table.</p>

The company expressed gratitude for customer feedback and admitted they "could've done a better job" communicating the changes. Cracker Barrel assured customers that Uncle Herschel will remain on menus and road signs, and core values of comfort and hospitality will not change, with stores retaining their vintage Americana decor.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to roll back electric vehicle (EV) incentives and a recent slowdown in U.S. EV sales, Ford is investing $5 billion in a new EV platform to produce a four-door pickup truck priced around $30,000 by 2027. This ambitious move signals automakers' belief in the long-term growth of EVs, particularly in global markets and for cost-conscious consumers.

          <p>Netflix's "KPop Demon Hunters" achieved significant box office success with a two-day theatrical sing-along release, generating an estimated $16-20 million domestically. This performance, while notable for a re-release, is considered an "event" for Netflix rather than a shift in its core strategy. The company primarily uses theatrical runs as a marketing tool for its streaming service, not for broad cinematic distribution. Experts believe Netflix will continue its selective, one-off theatrical deals, leveraging these events to boost streaming viewership for its popular titles like "KPop Demon Hunters."</p>

This stability is attributed to consistent new organizing efforts, particularly in the medical industry and at establishments like Starbucks.
