          <p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and his British counterpart Keir Starmer held their first bilateral meeting since 2017 in London. The discussions focused on strengthening trade relations, with the UK being the largest destination for Spanish goods outside the EU, and key geopolitical issues including the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Sanchez expressed criticism of Western policy on Gaza, highlighting a perceived double standard compared to Ukraine, a point of divergence with the UK's stance. This meeting also follows a recent agreement to ease border controls at the British enclave of Gibraltar.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts anticipate that U.S. mortgage rates may begin to fall even before the Federal Reserve's expected interest rate cut on September 17. While the Fed's decisions influence borrowing costs, mortgage rates are not directly dictated by them and often move in anticipation of monetary policy shifts. Lenders may preemptively lower their rates as a Fed cut becomes more certain, a pattern observed in previous cycles. Other factors, such as the 10-year Treasury yield, also play a significant role in determining mortgage rates, which have already shown a gradual decline throughout 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Club for Growth PAC, an influential conservative organization, has officially endorsed Senator Marsha Blackburn in her 2026 bid for Tennessee governor. Blackburn is competing against Representative John Rose in the Republican primary to succeed the term-limited Governor Bill Lee. In its endorsement, the Club for Growth praised Blackburn's record on tax cuts, deregulation, and her support for "school freedom," noting she is a seven-time winner of their Defender of Economic Freedom Award. This backing provides significant support for Blackburn's campaign in the reliably Republican state.</p>

          <p>Golfer Rory McIlroy has suggested that Europe's Ryder Cup team should adopt Novak Djokovic's approach to handling hostile crowds when they compete in New York. McIlroy observed the tennis star's ability to thrive in a pro-American environment during the US Open and recalled that Djokovic had given the team a pep talk before their 2023 victory in Rome. He believes that channeling the energy from a boisterous home crowd in a positive way, as Djokovic does, will be key to their success at Bethpage. McIlroy emphasized that controlling their own reactions and emotions is the most effective strategy.</p>

          <p>On his first public engagement of the autumn, King Charles visited the Midland Metropolitan University Hospital in Birmingham, where he joked with patients about the realities of getting older. When one 85-year-old patient mentioned she was "wearing out," the King replied that he is discovering that "bits don't work so well" after the age of 70. The King, who recently received cancer treatment, also spoke with a prostate cancer patient, empathizing with the frustrations of delayed diagnoses and encouraging men to get regular check-ups. The visit had been rescheduled from March due to the King's health.</p>

          <p>The massive illegal sports streaming network known as Streameast has been shut down following a collaborative operation between Egyptian law enforcement and the global anti-piracy group, the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE). The service, which had over 1.6 billion visits in the past year, offered pirated access to major sporting events to a global audience, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Two men were arrested outside Cairo, and authorities seized equipment and funds, including cryptocurrency investments.

          <p>A federal judge's ruling in Alphabet's antitrust case is being viewed as a significant victory for Apple, potentially unlocking billions in revenue. The decision permits Google to continue paying Apple to be the default search engine on its devices, a deal estimated to be worth around $20 billion annually to Apple. While the ruling prevents exclusivity clauses, it sets a precedent that allows Apple to pursue similar lucrative payment-for-traffic agreements with AI chatbot providers for services like Siri. This outcome eases major market concerns and strengthens Apple's high-margin Services division. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For 2025, the average monthly Social Security benefit for retired workers is $1,976, though actual payments can vary significantly based on lifetime earnings and claiming age. While this income is a crucial foundation for many retirees, it is often insufficient to cover all living expenses, highlighting the need for supplemental income streams. The article suggests several strategies to boost retirement funds, such as purchasing annuities for a guaranteed income, utilizing a reverse mortgage to access home equity, or delaying the start of Social Security benefits to receive a larger monthly check.

Prosecutors used the technology to link hairs found on victims to Heuermann and his family members.

          <p>For savers looking to deposit $50,000 into a certificate of deposit (CD), determining the "best" rate involves a choice between the highest interest rate and the greatest overall return. Currently, short-term CDs of one year or less offer the highest annual percentage rates, with some exceeding 4.40%. However, longer-term CDs, despite having slightly lower rates, can generate significantly more interest over the life of the account due to the extended compounding period. Savers must therefore weigh their immediate goals against their long-term earning potential when selecting a CD. (not investment advice)</p>
