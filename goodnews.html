        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ScotRail, the government-owned rail operator in Scotland, has permanently abolished peak-time fares on its train services, making weekday travel significantly cheaper for many commuters. This move follows a pilot scheme and aims to encourage more people to switch from cars to public transportation, with some key routes like Edinburgh to Glasgow seeing prices drop by nearly 50%. First Minister John Swinney announced the policy is a sustainable investment in the rail network and a crucial saving for citizens struggling with living costs. The annual cost, estimated between £40m to £45m, will be covered by the ScotRail budget if not offset by increased passenger numbers.</p>

          <p>Sonny Baker, a 22-year-old fast bowler from Hampshire, has been named in England's squad and is set to make his debut in the first one-day international match against South Africa. Baker gained attention for his impressive performance in The Hundred, where he consistently bowled at high speeds and took nine wickets for the Manchester Originals. England captain Harry Brook highlighted Baker's skillful spells against world-class batters as a key reason for his selection. The inclusion marks a significant step in Baker's rapid career progression, joining a team that also sees the return of Jofra Archer and Brydon Carse.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te has appointed two younger figures, Lii Wen and Chao Yi-hsiang, as deputy secretaries general of the National Security Council. Both men are in their thirties and replace more seasoned officials in a move aimed at bringing fresh perspectives to Taiwan's security strategy. The appointments follow a drop in approval ratings for Lai and his Democratic Progressive Party, particularly among young voters. The reshuffle is seen as an effort to blend veteran experience with a new generation of leaders better equipped to handle the rapidly evolving geopolitical landscape, including pressures from Beijing and potential shifts in U.S. policy.</p>

          <p>The final phase of England's largest-ever expansion of funded childcare support has begun, offering working parents 30 hours of government-paid childcare per week for children aged nine months to four years. The government states the scheme could save families £7,500 annually, prompting some parents to make decisions like scheduling C-sections to meet eligibility deadlines. However, the rollout faces significant challenges, as parents report long waiting lists and nurseries struggle with staffing shortages. Providers warn that government funding rates are insufficient to cover costs, forcing them to charge for extras like meals and limiting the number of available places.</p>

          <p>Manchester United is set to sign 23-year-old Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp in a deal valued at an initial £18.1 million plus add-ons. Lammens is traveling to Manchester to finalize a five-year contract with the Old Trafford club. The signing addresses United's recent goalkeeping issues, which have seen errors from their current keepers in recent matches. The move indicates that the club has ended its pursuit of Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez and is investing in Lammens as a promising young talent for the future.</p>

          <p>In a move aimed at de-escalating military tensions, South Korea's defense ministry has suspended its long-running propaganda radio broadcast, "Voice of Freedom," which transmitted outside information and K-pop music into North Korea. This action is the latest in a series of conciliatory steps taken by the new administration of President Lee Jae Myung to improve relations with Pyongyang. The broadcast, which first aired in 1962, has been intermittently on and off depending on the state of inter-Korean affairs. Despite these gestures from Seoul, including the dismantling of border loudspeakers, North Korea has thus far shown little interest in reciprocating.</p>

          <p>Newcastle has reached a £55 million agreement with Brentford to sign forward Yoane Wissa, following the player's public statement urging his club to allow the move. The deal consists of an initial £50 million fee plus £5 million in add-ons. The 28-year-old DR Congo international is now traveling to Newcastle to finalize the transfer. The signing is a crucial move for Newcastle to strengthen its attack, especially as it comes after Liverpool agreed to a British record transfer fee to sign Newcastle's star striker, Alexander Isak, creating a significant void in their forward line.</p>

          <p>A former Macy's parking structure at the once-iconic Westside Pavilion mall in Los Angeles has been transformed into a luxury apartment complex, with residents beginning to move in this week. The project is part of a larger trend of repurposing defunct shopping malls, which have struggled against the rise of e-commerce and outdoor lifestyle centers. The new six-story building, named Overland & Ayres, features 201 units, including townhouses, and offers high-end amenities like a resort-style pool and a pet spa. This redevelopment provides much-needed housing in a prime location, conveniently situated near a new UCLA research center being built in the main mall building.</p>

          <p>In response to mass firings, budget cuts, and deteriorating working conditions under the Trump administration, employees at Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon national parks have voted overwhelmingly to unionize. More than 600 staffers, including rangers, firefighters, and biologists, will now be represented by the National Federation of Federal Employees. Organizers state that while issues like low pay and poor housing predate the current administration, recent turmoil and fear over job security spurred the successful union drive. The move comes as the National Park Service faces a quarter of its staff being cut, forcing remaining employees to take on multiple roles.</p>

          <p>The Altadena Town & Country Club, a century-old community landmark in Southern California, held its reopening celebration after being completely destroyed in the Eaton fire last January. The club served not only its members but also the wider community as a venue for fundraisers, meetings, and local events, making its loss deeply felt. Hundreds gathered for the soft launch, which saw the pool and tennis courts back in operation while construction continues on other facilities. The reopening is seen as a significant and healing step for a community where many residents lost their homes and are still displaced by the disaster.</p>

The original ship was constructed with the help of female laborers who entered the workforce to support the war effort. Now, modern-day female welders are leading the restoration of the vessel, which serves as a museum but has fallen into disrepair. The project honors the legacy of the original "Rosies" and aims to showcase the trades as viable professions for women today.</p>

          <p>California's community colleges and state universities are partnering with tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Adobe to offer free artificial intelligence training to students and faculty. The initiative aims to equip the state's future workforce with essential AI skills as the technology begins to replace many entry-level jobs. While Governor Gavin Newsom praised the deals as vital for economic development, some faculty associations express concern about the potential for over-reliance on AI as a crutch for students and the loss of educator control over classroom tools. The partnerships provide valuable resources to schools while giving tech companies access to millions of new users.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Museum of Art's new building, the David Geffen Galleries, is seeing its first piece of art installed ahead of its 2026 opening. The commissioned work is a 27-foot-long photo sculpture by Los Angeles artist Todd Gray, titled “Octavia Butler’s Gaze,” which will greet visitors at the entrance. The installation process involves drilling directly into the new building's signature concrete walls and applying unique colored glazes to gallery surfaces. This marks a major milestone in the controversial and long-awaited project, offering a first look at how art will be presented in the Peter Zumthor-designed space.</p>
