          <p>This article explores the multifaceted development of sexual orientation, emphasizing that it is not a choice but rather a complex interplay of biological and psychosocial factors during puberty. Experts highlight that sexual orientation, or 'sexual preference structure,' becomes stable in adolescence and remains consistent throughout life. The article also addresses the historical mistreatment of non-heterosexual individuals and the ongoing discrimination and persecution in many countries. It underscores the importance of societal acceptance and unprejudiced dialogue about sexual diversity, reinforcing that no sexual orientation is a disease or unnatural.</p>

          <p>Amanda Litman, co-founder of Run for Something, argues that the Democratic party's reliance on seniority is detrimental and advocates for younger leaders who are more open to change. She emphasizes the need for open conversations about retirement and encourages primaries to identify candidates with the skills and stomach to stand up to the Trump administration. Litman's new book focuses on how millennials and Gen Z leaders can improve workplaces, ultimately freeing up time for more political engagement.

          <p>Southwest Airlines will soon start charging for checked bags, ending its long-standing "two bags fly free" policy. This change, impacting customers accustomed to the airline's unique perk, comes as baggage fees become a significant revenue source for U.S. airlines. Along with the new baggage fees, Southwest is also introducing basic-economy tickets and eliminating open seating. These changes represent a major shift in Southwest's business model, aligning it more closely with competitors like Delta, American, and United Airlines.</p>

          <p>Anthropologist Sabine Hyland is studying khipus, knotted cords used by the Incas to record information, in a remote Peruvian village. These khipus, preserved through centuries, could unlock lost history of the Inca empire.

The history of khipu decipherment, the challenges of dating the cords, and the potential for artificial intelligence to aid in their interpretation are also explored.
