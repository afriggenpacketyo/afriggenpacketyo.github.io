He plans to implement gradual free-market reforms while maintaining social benefits, aiming to stabilize the economy without triggering widespread unrest. His win sets Bolivia on an uncertain path as it grapples with high inflation and fuel shortages.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a breakthrough by capturing the intricate "kiss-shrink-run" process of neuronal communication using the world's first camera with nanometer resolution and millisecond-scale imaging speed. This groundbreaking research, published in Science, resolves a half-century-old debate among neuroscientists. The findings, led by biologists from USTC and Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, shed new light on how the brain's billions of neurons efficiently transmit signals via synaptic vesicles, a process previously elusive due to its rapid and microscopic nature.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that advising early introduction of peanut products to infants has prevented peanut allergies in approximately 60,000 children. A decade after the landmark LEAP trial, updated guidelines recommending peanut introduction as early as 4 months have led to a significant decline in peanut allergies among young children. Despite initial slow adoption, the practice is now making a measurable impact. Experts emphasize consulting pediatricians and introducing major allergens between four and six months to safely expose the immune system.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have identified a version of a DNA repair protein, also present in humans, that is linked to the remarkable longevity and disease resistance of naked mole-rats. These burrowing rodents boast an extraordinary lifespan of up to 37 years for their size. Published in Science, this discovery provides a molecular basis for their exceptional lifespan during evolution. The findings suggest that understanding this protein could inspire new therapeutic anti-aging strategies to enhance human health and extend lifespan.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia-Pacific markets opened higher, with China stocks notably rising despite the release of weaker-than-expected Q3 GDP data. China's GDP grew 4.8%, in line with Reuters forecasts, and benchmark lending rates remained unchanged. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index saw over 2% gains, while Japan's Nikkei 225 hit a record high, boosted by a potential coalition government. This market performance suggests investors are looking beyond the immediate economic figures, potentially anticipating future policy support or focusing on other regional developments.

          <p>The British military is set to receive new powers allowing soldiers to shoot down drones posing a threat near military bases. Defence Secretary John Healey will unveil plans for a "kinetic option" to enable faster, more decisive action. This initiative follows multiple mystery drone sightings at UK airbases used by US forces and widespread drone disruptions across European airspace. While initially limited to military sites, these powers could extend to civilian locations like airports. Existing protocols primarily involve diverting or disrupting drones.</p>

He also notes that LiDAR costs have significantly decreased, making it a viable and critical component for advanced autonomous driving, a view shared by other auto executives.</p>

This initiative directly challenges President Trump's call to reinstall such monuments, arguing they promote the "Lost Cause" ideology and white supremacy.
