          <p>The British-flagged luxury superyacht Bayesian, which sank off Sicily in August 2024 killing tech magnate Mike Lynch and six others, has been successfully lifted from the seabed. Salvage crews completed the complex operation, using one of Europe's most powerful maritime cranes to haul the 56-meter yacht ashore. The vessel will be moved to the Sicilian port of Termini Imerese for further investigation to determine the cause of the sinking. Italian authorities are continuing to conduct a full criminal investigation into the incident which occurred during a violent storm.</p>

          <p>Jobe Bellingham scored on his first start for Borussia Dortmund in a Club World Cup match, inevitably drawing comparisons to his older brother Jude. The 19-year-old scored 45 minutes into his debut, showcasing anticipation, poise, agility, and ruthlessness. The goal in Cincinnati involved timing his run perfectly and cushioning the ball away from his marker before firing past the goalkeeper, albeit with a slight deflection. This performance capped a fine display on his full debut and is something the former Sunderland midfielder has been working on, highlighting his potential and skill.</p>

          <p>Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, recently released from immigration detention, asserts that the Trump administration failed to suppress pro-Palestinian voices.

New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who joined Khalil, stated his release indicates the Trump administration is losing its legal battle to deport migrants advocating for Palestinians.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian rights activist and Columbia University graduate, has been reunited with his family after being detained by ICE for over three months.

The Dodgers previously asked federal agents to leave stadium grounds after they gathered near one of the gates. The team's actions come after calls from fans and lawmakers to make a statement of opposition to the raids, given their significant Latino fan base.</p>

The Pakistani government credits Trump's diplomatic intervention for brokering a ceasefire between the two nations. Trump has repeatedly claimed that the U.S. brokered the ceasefire and used trade as leverage. While Pakistan corroborates U.S. statements, India denies any diplomatic intervention from a third party.</p>
