        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England defeated West Indies in the second T20 match at Bristol, securing a series win with a game to spare after chasing down a target of 197. Jos Buttler and Harry Brook contributed solid scores, but Jacob Bethell's explosive cameo and Tom Banton's unbeaten innings sealed the victory. West Indies had earlier posted a substantial total, propelled by Rovman Powell and Jason Holder's late hitting after a slow start. Adil Rashid's expensive penultimate over proved costly for England, who had chosen to field only two seamers. The series concludes at Southampton on Tuesday, with England looking to complete a series sweep.</p>

          <p>Marc-Andre ter Stegen's performance was a standout despite Germany's 2-0 loss to France in the Nations League third-placed playoff. Germany's coach Julian Nagelsmann praised ter Stegen as the team's number one goalkeeper following Manuel Neuer's retirement. However, ter Stegen faces uncertainty at Barcelona, where he has struggled to secure playing time after returning from injury. Reports suggest he may become the club's third-choice goalkeeper, potentially impacting his chances for the upcoming World Cup. Nagelsmann is likely to give ter Stegen opportunities, considering his experience and recent form, despite his lack of club games.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Naples, Italy, was diverted to Rome after the aircraft was deemed too large to land at its intended destination. Passengers on Flight 780 were subsequently transported to Naples by bus, a journey of approximately three hours. The airline attributed the diversion to "operational limitations" and apologized for the disruption. Historical flight data indicates that American Airlines typically uses a smaller Boeing 787-8 for the Naples route, while the diverted flight utilized a larger 787-9. The airline has issued a statement expressing regret for the inconvenience caused to passengers.</p>
