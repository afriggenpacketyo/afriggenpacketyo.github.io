          <p>A 66-year-old California man in urgent need of a kidney transplant discovered an incredibly rare match in his wife, with odds estimated at one in 100,000. After battling kidney disease for two decades and facing recent complications, including a cancerous tumor, his health declined rapidly. His wife, Mirna, volunteered to donate, and tests revealed she was a near-perfect genetic match. The couple is now preparing for the transplant surgery, which they hope will allow them to celebrate their ninth anniversary.</p>

          <p>Colombia's former president, Álvaro Uribe, has been sentenced to 12 years of house arrest for witness tampering and bribery, marking the first time a former head of state in the country has been convicted in a criminal trial. The court found him guilty of paying jailed paramilitaries to retract testimony linking him to the formation of right-wing militia groups during Colombia's civil war. While his supporters claim the trial was politically motivated, human rights groups have hailed the verdict as a landmark moment for accountability in a nation long plagued by impunity.</p>

          <p>This article, presented in a comic format, explores why many people feel awkward or uncomfortable when receiving compliments. It draws on insights from social psychologists and behavioral scientists to explain the science behind these reactions. The piece argues that how a person responds to praise says a lot about their self-perception and can also impact the person giving the compliment. Ultimately, the article makes a case for learning to graciously accept kind remarks from others as a healthy social practice.</p>

          <p>A new study led by Chinese scientists has traced the evolutionary origins of the potato, revealing a surprising link to an ancestor of the tomato. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, researchers found that about nine million years ago, a tomato-like plant hybridized with a tuberless, potato-like plant. This ancient event was a key driver in the development of the potato's tuber, the edible part that has made it a global food staple. The research, published in the journal Cell, provides new insight into the hybrid ancestry of this crucial crop.</p>

Despite earning two points for the shootout win, LAFC's total of three points from two matches is likely insufficient to advance to the quarterfinals.</p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld a lower court's order temporarily blocking federal agents from conducting indiscriminate immigration patrols in Southern California. The ruling affirms that agents cannot detain individuals based solely on factors like race, language, or presence in a particular location without establishing reasonable suspicion of illegal status. The court rejected the government's claim that the injunction harmed its enforcement efforts, stating there is no harm in being told not to do something that is already unconstitutional. Civil rights groups and local officials celebrated the decision as a victory for constitutional rights.</p>
