          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has stated that Europe was a "free-rider" in the past regarding its own defense and security funding but is now increasing its contributions. In an interview with the BBC, Merz affirmed that Germany is boosting its defense spending in response to the threat from Russia and is coordinating closely with the US and other European allies. The comments were made as Germany and the UK work to strengthen a friendship treaty focused on defense, migration, and economic growth. Merz also addressed trade tensions, expressing hope for a resolution to avoid threatened US tariffs on EU exports.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During the first round of The Open Championship, professional golfer Jon Rahm became visibly upset after a poor tee shot on the 10th hole, turning to confront a fan in the gallery. Rahm claimed a spectator whistled during his backswing, which he called distracting. The two-time major champion later downplayed the incident, attributing his emotional reaction to the bad timing of the noise during a difficult shot. He acknowledged that his swing was also at fault and that such distractions are a part of golf, using the moment to release some tension.</p>

          <h2>China Reveals New Military Drone with Vertical Take-Off and Landing Capability</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 22:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has unveiled a new military drone capable of taking off and landing vertically on its tail, similar to a rocket. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) demonstrated its reconnaissance and autonomous operational capabilities, including target allocation and route planning, during a recent drill in Sichuan province. Developed by the state-owned Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, the drone's design allows for high-speed flight comparable to fixed-wing models while retaining the flexibility of vertical deployment, eliminating the need for runways. Its design resembles the U.S. military's MQ-35 V-BAT drone, signaling advances in China's unmanned military technology.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common and benign vein condition, following speculation over images showing his swollen legs and a bruised hand. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the condition was identified after medical tests and is common in individuals over 70. The presidential physician confirmed the diagnosis in a letter, adding there was no evidence of more serious conditions like deep vein thrombosis and that Trump "remains in excellent health." The announcement comes amid heightened scrutiny of the health of presidential figures.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized Juul to keep its tobacco and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes on the market, reversing a previous ban from 2022. The agency stated that Juul's studies sufficiently demonstrate that its products are less harmful for adult smokers who switch completely from traditional cigarettes. This decision makes Juul one of only two companies permitted to sell menthol-flavored vapes in the U.S. The move is expected to face strong opposition from anti-tobacco groups who blame Juul for fueling the teenage vaping crisis in previous years.</p>

          <p>Members of Congress from both parties joined together as a single team to compete against female journalists in the annual Congressional Women's Softball Game. The event, which contrasts with the partisan Republican vs. Democrat men's baseball game, raises money for the Young Survival Coalition, a charity supporting young adults with breast cancer. Co-founded in 2009 by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a breast cancer survivor herself, the game provides a rare moment of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill. Over its history, the event has raised nearly $5 million for the cause.</p>

          <p>This week's film releases offer a variety of genres, including the new horror sequel "I Know What You Did Last Summer," which is described as ironically self-aware but ultimately not memorable. Also reviewed is Ari Aster's "Eddington," a neo-western set during the 2020 pandemic starring Joaquin Phoenix and Pedro Pascal, which tackles political division in a realistic yet strange manner. Other notable films include "Afternoons of Solitude," a powerful and difficult documentary about bullfighting, and two LGBTQ+ dramas, "Before We Forget" and "Unicorns," each exploring unique and sensitive romantic stories.</p>

          <p>An ice core, potentially over 1.5 million years old and drilled from deep within Antarctica, has arrived in the UK for scientific analysis. Scientists at the British Antarctic Survey will melt the ancient ice to study trapped materials like dust, ash, and air bubbles. This research aims to unlock new information about Earth's climate history, particularly a mysterious period when the planet's glacial cycles changed. The findings could provide crucial insights into how the planet responds to high levels of greenhouse gases, helping to refine future climate change models.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New UK regulations coming into force next July will require "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) providers like Klarna and Clearpay to conduct stricter affordability checks on shoppers. The move, aimed at protecting consumers from accumulating excessive debt, means some users may be refused credit. Regulators and debt charities support the new rules, which will bring the largely unregulated sector in line with other forms of credit. The changes will also grant consumers the right to complain to the Financial Ombudsman and provide clearer information on fees and cancellation rights. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Robert Ford, the CEO of Abbott Laboratories, stated that the significant drop in the company's stock price following its second-quarter earnings report was an "overreaction." While Abbott beat revenue and earnings expectations, investors were disappointed by the company's tightened full-year guidance, leading to an 8% share decline. Ford acknowledged a weaker-than-expected performance in their diagnostics business in China but emphasized the strong, double-digit growth in other areas, particularly medical devices. He expressed confidence in the company's fundamentals, framing the China issue as a temporary challenge the company is actively managing. (not investment advice)</p>

The former USC star was arrested after being found asleep in his Rolls-Royce, which was blocking traffic near LAX.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has formally responded to the White House's questions regarding cost overruns in the renovation of the Fed's headquarters. In a letter to the Office of Management and Budget, Powell directed officials to a new transparency page on the Fed's website and refuted accusations of "ostentatious" features like private elevators or rooftop gardens. The inquiry is seen as part of a broader pressure campaign by the Trump administration, which has grown increasingly critical of Powell's leadership and the Fed's refusal to lower interest rates. Powell's reply was professional and did not engage with the confrontational tone of the White House's letter.</p>
