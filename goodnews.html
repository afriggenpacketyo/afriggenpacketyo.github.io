          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 20:49:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports experienced a smaller-than-expected contraction in August, falling by only 0.1% year-on-year, an improvement from July's 2.6% decline and better than the forecasted 1.9% drop. This softer landing was largely due to a rebound in shipments to Asia and a significant jump in exports to Western Europe. However, it still marks the fourth consecutive month of negative growth for the world's fourth-largest economy, with shipments to the U.S., particularly autos, continuing to see a steep decline. The data comes as the country faces political uncertainty and ahead of a key Bank of Japan interest rate decision. (not investment advice)</p>

The pricing falls at the midpoint of its previously expected range, and shares are set to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "STUB." This public debut follows several delays, including one in April due to market volatility.

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to announce its first interest rate cut of 2025 this Wednesday, a decision complicated by conflicting economic data. While a slowing labor market suggests a need for a cut to stimulate growth, inflation has been gradually rising, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs, which argues for holding rates steady. The decision is highly anticipated by markets, with CME FedWatch indicating a 96% probability of a 0.25 percentage point reduction. Economists and investors will be closely watching for the Fed's guidance on future cuts and its assessment of the economy's direction. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following his death, Robert Redford is being remembered not just as a Hollywood star but as an actor who deliberately challenged his own image to explore complex and often flawed characters. Throughout his career, he rejected simple, heroic roles in favor of portraying selfish victors, self-destructive figures, and tragic idealists. From "The Candidate" to "All the President's Men," he used his all-American appeal to critique the nation's image of itself and uncover uncomfortable truths. This appreciation highlights how Redford's thoughtful choices as an actor, director, and founder of the Sundance Institute created a legacy of depth and substance beyond his celebrity.</p>

          <p>Five partially built, illegal homes in Los Angeles's Laurel Canyon neighborhood are set to be demolished following a plea agreement with the developers, ending a legal battle that has lasted over two decades. The city first ordered the structures torn down in 2003 after the original project stalled, but a series of subsequent owners attempted to restart construction without complying. The current owners pleaded guilty to failing to comply with lawful orders from the Department of Building and Safety. The Los Angeles City Attorney's office stated the action will finally resolve the issue of the dangerous, dilapidated structures for the community.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has suggested that JPMorgan Chase could become the next non-technology company to achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization, joining an exclusive club currently dominated by tech giants. He attributed the bank's potential to its strong performance in lending, trading, and capital markets, as well as the leadership of CEO Jamie Dimon. Cramer noted that the entire banking sector has been performing well, with financial stocks seeing both their earnings and their price-to-earnings multiples expand. JPMorgan's current valuation is approximately $850 billion, significantly higher than its competitors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New data from the UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency reveals a significant shift in driver preferences, with one in four driving tests now being conducted in automatic cars. This represents a substantial increase from just over 6% a decade ago. Insurers and driving instructors attribute the trend to the rise of electric vehicles, which do not have manual gearboxes, and the approaching 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. As learners anticipate an electric-dominant future, the skill of driving a manual car is becoming less essential for many new drivers.</p>

          <p>Under manager Thomas Frank, Tottenham Hotspur has shifted its focus to a more pragmatic, defensive style, a stark contrast to the attack-oriented approach of the previous season. This new "clean sheet mentality" was evident in their 1-0 Champions League victory against Villarreal, which marked their fourth clean sheet in five games. While the cautious style resulted in only one shot on target for Spurs, players and management praised the team's strong defensive structure. The emphasis on preventing goals, rather than outscoring opponents, is proving to be a key element of the team's early-season success.</p>

          <p>Google's AI application, Gemini, has claimed the number one spot for free apps on Apple's App Store, overtaking its main competitor, OpenAI's ChatGPT. The surge in popularity follows recent updates to Gemini, including a new image editing feature called Nano Banana that attracted 13 million new users in just four days, causing temporary usage limits due to high demand. This milestone suggests Google is gaining significant ground in the consumer generative AI race after initially lagging behind OpenAI. The app's success has also boosted investor confidence, contributing to parent company Alphabet's shares rising and joining the $3 trillion market cap club.</p>

The return was facilitated by a new agreement with the International Olympic Committee that improves commercial arrangements and player conditions.

          <p>Josh Harris, co-founder of Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, expressed skepticism about major sports teams or ownership groups going public, despite soaring valuations. Speaking at a conference, Harris argued that sports assets have been valued more highly as private entities and that public markets may not embrace the long-term, win-focused spending strategies of team owners. He noted that publicly traded sports assets, like those of Madison Square Garden, often trade below their intrinsic value. Instead, he sees the new league-approved model of allowing private equity firms to take minority stakes as a positive way to raise capital.</p>
