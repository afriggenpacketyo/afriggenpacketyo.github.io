          <p>Chrysler has issued a voluntary recall for over 250,000 Pacifica and Voyager vehicles from the 2022-2025 model years due to a potential defect with the side curtain airbags. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, improperly sealed seams might prevent the airbags from holding sufficient pressure during deployment in certain types of crashes. Chrysler's parent company stated it is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the issue and will inspect and replace the airbags free of charge.</p>

          <p>Following Andy Murray's retirement, British men's number one Jack Draper is set to lead the nation's hopes at Wimbledon, expressing confidence in his ability to manage the heightened expectations. As the fourth seed, Draper is part of the largest British contingent in the singles draws since 1984. Meanwhile, 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu is tempering expectations for her campaign, acknowledging she faces a difficult opening match against fellow Briton Mimi Xu, who she describes as a "very dangerous" opponent.</p>

          <p>An estimated 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, defying a government ban in what organizers described as the largest such event in Hungary's history. The demonstration proceeded despite a new law from Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n's government that prohibits events considered to "promote" homosexuality to minors. This large-scale act of defiance is being viewed as a significant rebuke to Orb√°n's administration, which is facing declining popularity and criticism over its crackdown on democratic rights and civil liberties.</p>

          <p>A settlement has been reached in the civil lawsuit filed by three crew members of the film "Rust" against the movie's producers, which include actor Alec Baldwin. The lawsuit claimed negligence on the set led to the 2021 fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and sought compensation for the emotional distress of those who witnessed it. This resolution is separate from the criminal cases, in which film armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed was convicted of involuntary manslaughter while a similar charge against Baldwin was previously dismissed.</p>
