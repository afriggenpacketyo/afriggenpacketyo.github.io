          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders was cited for speeding early Tuesday morning after being clocked driving 101 mph in a 60 mph zone in Strongsville, Ohio. The police records, obtained by ESPN, indicate that Sanders was driving a Dodge TRX truck northbound on Interstate 71 near Cleveland. Sanders, son of Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, faces the options of paying a fine for the fourth-degree misdemeanor or contesting the ticket in court next month. Sanders is currently competing for a starting role within the Browns' crowded quarterback room during the team's mandatory minicamp. </p>

          <p>A New Yorker known as "Streeter" earns over six figures annually by reporting idling vehicles through the city's Citizens Air Complaint Program. Streeter spends hours each day biking around the city, looking for trucks and buses that violate the city's idling law, which prohibits non-city buses and trucks from idling for more than three minutes. Reporters can keep 25% of the fines, which typically range from $350 to $600. Truck drivers, however, feel "abused" by the program, arguing that it's difficult to avoid idling due to the demands of driving in New York City. </p>
