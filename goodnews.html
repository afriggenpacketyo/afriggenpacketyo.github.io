          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled to make it easier for students with disabilities to sue schools for non-compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), and the Rehabilitation Act.  The case centered on Ava Tharpe, a student whose school failed to accommodate her epilepsy-related needs, resulting in significantly reduced class time. The Court lowered the burden of proof for students seeking compensation for damages incurred due to a school's failure to provide reasonable accommodations.</p>
