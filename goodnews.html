          <h2>Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America Releases Annual Allergy Report, Offering Tips to Manage Symptoms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 05:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) has released its annual allergy report, identifying the most challenging US cities for seasonal allergy sufferers, with Wichita, Kansas, topping the list for the third consecutive year due to high tree and grass pollen counts. Experts recommend strategies such as starting medications early, washing clothes frequently to remove pollen, and staying indoors during peak pollen times, especially in the mornings and late afternoons. Dr. Purvi Parikh advises seeking medical advice for breathing issues, as they may indicate asthma rather than allergies, and notes that allergy symptoms tend to last longer than those of colds or viruses.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 05:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While overall electric vehicle (EV) exports from China to the UK have decreased, there has been a significant surge in plug-in hybrid vehicle exports, increasing by nearly 600% in the first quarter of this year. The UK remains China's second-largest destination for EV exports, benefiting from a standard 10% import tariff, unlike the higher tariffs imposed by the European Union. This trend is driven by cost-conscious consumers seeking affordable alternatives to European marques, as one Londoner highlighted after purchasing an MG electric vehicle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article suggests that mothers should cut themselves some slack and stop striving for perfection, as being flawed is an important part of a mother's job. The author, a psychiatrist, argues that a mother's imperfections help children learn to accept their own flaws and understand that relationships are not one-way. The article also criticizes the tendency of psychiatry to blame mothers for their children's problems and encourages mothers to ignore the constant messages that they might not be doing enough.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the United States remains steady at 6.76%, close to its highest levels this year but still below the 7.09% average from a year ago. Mortgage rates are influenced by factors such as global demand for US Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve interest rate policies, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. Recent fluctuations in mortgage rates mirror the volatility in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a benchmark for pricing home loans, and elevated rates combined with rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers.</p>

          <p>China is shifting its energy investments in Africa towards renewable energy projects, with solar and wind power now accounting for 59% of its energy projects on the continent, according to a report by ODI Global. Between 2010 and 2024, China's overall energy sector investment in Africa reached US$66 billion, with the continent becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology. This shift aligns with China's commitment to halting funding for new coal-fired power plants overseas and reflects Africa's rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production.</p>
