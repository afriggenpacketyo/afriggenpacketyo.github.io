Her day typically begins with journaling and stretching, followed by a visit to the Studio City Farmers Market for specific items like kefir yogurt. Singh emphasizes solo activities, such as taking herself to brunch at Sweet Butter Kitchen and going to the movies alone at Universal CityWalk. She also dedicates time to planning her social calendar, arranging flowers, and reflecting on her monthly goals to maintain organization and well-being.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal court has sentenced Qingzhou Wang, a principal executive of the Wuhan-based company Amarvel Biotech, to 25 years in prison for trafficking fentanyl precursor chemicals. Wang and the firm's marketing manager, Yiyi Chen, were convicted in New York for their roles in a scheme that shipped hundreds of kilograms of these chemicals to the United States, disguised as everyday goods and paid for with cryptocurrency. This case marks the first time the U.S. has prosecuted Chinese companies for trafficking these chemicals directly into the country, rather than through Mexico.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent threats from the Trump administration to revoke broadcast licenses of networks like ABC have raised questions about the powers of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The FCC, an independent agency, grants licenses to local television and radio stations to use public airwaves, requiring them to operate in the "public interest." While it does not directly regulate national networks or cable channels, it can influence them through their affiliated local stations. Experts note that revoking a license is a complex process and is typically related to issues like obscenity or children's programming, not political content, making the current threats largely unprecedented.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping approved a deal regarding the future of TikTok's U.S. operations during a phone call. The agreement would reportedly involve selling TikTok's U.S. business to a consortium of American investors, including Oracle, allowing the app to continue operating in the country. However, confirmation from Beijing was less definitive, with Chinese state media quoting Xi as saying China "welcomes negotiations over TikTok." A key point of contention remains the ownership of the powerful algorithm that drives content for TikTok's 170 million American users.</p>

          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center expect the system to strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday but anticipate it will remain over open water for the next several days. The storm's current projected path shows it moving north of the Caribbean islands and away from the U.S. mainland. However, it could pass east of Bermuda early next week as it continues to intensify, potentially bringing some impacts to the island.</p>

          <p>Chinese manufacturing and export companies are increasingly turning their attention to Southeast Asia as a key growth market, using a trade fair in Nanning as a strategic entry point. Facing saturated markets and slowing demand in Europe and the United States, these firms see significant potential in the fast-growing economies and large, young consumer populations of neighboring Asian countries. An electric scooter manufacturer from Jiangxi province exemplifies this trend, stating that his company is looking to the region for new opportunities as it reaches its limits in traditional Western markets.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has dismissed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump against The New York Times, citing improper and politically motivated language in the complaint. Judge Steven Merryday ruled that the 85-page lawsuit was excessively long and resembled a "megaphone for public relations" rather than a serious legal document. While the judge did not rule on the legal merits of the case, he gave Trump's lawyers 28 days to refile an amended, more professional complaint that adheres to procedural rules. The lawsuit alleged that several articles and a book by the newspaper's reporters were intended to undermine his presidential campaign.</p>

          <p>A recent wave of multibillion-dollar investments from U.S. tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia is being positioned as a major boost for the UK economy. During President Trump's state visit, Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang declared the UK will be an "AI superpower," while Microsoft announced a £22 billion investment to expand its AI infrastructure in the country. This influx of capital is aimed at strengthening the "Golden Triangle" of Oxford, Cambridge, and London as a global tech hub. The enthusiasm from Silicon Valley contrasts with domestic pessimism and suggests a strategic alignment between the UK and US on technology policy. (not investment advice)</p>
