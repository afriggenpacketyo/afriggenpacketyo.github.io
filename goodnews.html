          <p>Canada is engaged in discussions with the United States regarding potential participation in the proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense system. These talks occur amidst ongoing trade and security negotiations between the two countries, following earlier trade disputes. The proposed system aims to counter advanced aerial threats and would include space-based sensors and interceptors. However, experts have raised doubts about the feasibility and cost of building such a comprehensive defense system, drawing comparisons to Israel's Iron Dome.</p>

          <p>A Vox editor conducted an experiment by switching from an iPhone to a flip phone for a month, aiming to reduce screen time and improve social connections. The experiment led to increased in-person interactions with friends and family, as well as a greater appreciation for off-the-cuff hangouts. While some conveniences of smartphones were missed, the overall experience resulted in a more fulfilling social life and a greater sense of spontaneity. The author found that being less reliant on social media encouraged deeper connections and improved their attention span.</p>

          <p>Kenya is aiming to increase its tea exports to China, with discussions underway to allow Kenyan tea factories to sell directly to international markets. In return, China will export tea packaging material to Kenya tax-free, with plans to establish packaging firms for the export market. This partnership seeks to improve the quality of Kenyan tea and align it with international market demands. The agreement also aims to facilitate the transfer of technology and equipment to Kenya, although some local farmers express concerns about potential disruptions to supply chains due to tax-free packaging materials from China.</p>

          <p>Bridget Read's new book, "Little Bosses Everywhere: How the Pyramid Scheme Shaped America," explores the connections between multi-level marketing schemes (MLMs) and corporate America. Read argues that corporations have adopted methods from MLM companies, including hiring contingent workforces and pushing employees to think like entrepreneurs. The book exposes how the direct selling industry has influenced the labor market, blurring the lines between legitimate jobs and shadier schemes. Read's research reveals how MLMs have exploited economic downturns and cultural trends to expand their reach.</p>
