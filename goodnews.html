        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German football club Bayern Munich has ended its controversial "Visit Rwanda" sponsorship deal following sustained pressure from fans and human rights activists. The partnership drew criticism due to Rwanda's human rights record and its alleged support for the M23 rebel group in the Democratic Republic of Congo. While the club framed the decision as a "strategic evolution" rather than a moral one, it will maintain a presence in the country through a youth football academy. Experts suggest the move highlights the growing influence of fan activism on the commercial decisions of major European sports clubs.</p>

          <p>A team of researchers in China has developed a new genomic tool that could revolutionize the early detection of pancreatic cancer, one of the most lethal forms of the disease. The technology, called "Uni-C," is a single-cell blood test that can analyze the complete DNA of rare circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in less than a day. By decoding multiple layers of genomic information from these cells, the test provides deep insights that can be used for early screening, monitoring disease progression, and developing personalized immunotherapy treatments. This breakthrough promises to overcome the challenge of analyzing the scarce number of CTCs in a patient's bloodstream.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter, a slowdown from the previous quarter's 0.7% but better than the 0.1% growth that economists had forecasted. According to the Office for National Statistics, the services and construction sectors were the primary drivers of this modest expansion. However, the data also revealed a sharp 4% drop in business investment and a dip in household spending, signaling potential caution among consumers and businesses. While the government hailed the figures as positive, some economists doubt this pace can be maintained amid global uncertainty and the potential for future tax increases.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn reported a 27% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter operating profit, significantly beating market expectations. The strong performance was primarily fueled by its rapidly growing artificial intelligence server business, which for the first time generated more revenue than its traditional smart consumer electronics division. As a key manufacturing partner for Nvidia, Foxconn's AI server revenue is projected to grow over 170% year-over-year in the next quarter. The company continues to diversify into new areas like electric vehicles and semiconductors while monitoring the potential impact of global tariffs.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has officially designated the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) as a foreign terrorist organization, a move that analysts believe could create an opportunity for counterterrorism cooperation between the U.S. and China. The BLA, a separatist group operating in Pakistan, has been responsible for attacks that have targeted Chinese nationals and economic interests in the region. By listing the group, Washington is taking action that aligns with Beijing's security concerns in Pakistan. This shared objective could potentially serve as a basis for collaboration between the two global powers on regional security issues.</p>

          <h2>A Look at How and Why the U.S. Deploys Secondary Sanctions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 03:07:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the concept of secondary sanctions, a foreign policy tool frequently used by the United States to influence third-party countries. Unlike primary sanctions that restrict a country's own citizens, secondary sanctions target foreign entities that do business with a sanctioned nation, such as Russia or Iran. Their power stems from the global dominance of the U.S. dollar and financial system, as foreign companies often comply to avoid losing access to the lucrative American market. While they can be effective in pressuring regimes, experts note they are difficult to enforce and risk alienating allies.</p>

          <p>This podcast summary explores the origins and function of the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which provides clear procedures for presidential succession and disability. The discussion highlights the work of lawyer John Feerick, who championed the amendment's creation following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The lack of explicit constitutional guidance on what to do if a president becomes unable to serve was seen as a critical vulnerability. The amendment, ratified in 1967, clarifies the transfer of power to the Vice President in such scenarios, a crucial mechanism for ensuring governmental stability.</p>

          <p>South Korea's Supreme Court has dismissed a copyright infringement lawsuit concerning the viral children's song "Baby Shark." An American composer had claimed that the 2015 hit by The Pinkfong Company was a copy of his 2011 version of the song. However, the court upheld lower court rulings, stating that the composer's rendition was not original enough to warrant copyright protection. The judgment concluded that both versions were based on a traditional singalong chant popular at U.S. summer camps, which has long been in the public domain.</p>

          <p>The NBA's Board of Governors has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group led by private equity mogul Bill Chisholm for a record-breaking $6.1 billion. This transaction marks the largest price ever paid for an American professional sports franchise, surpassing the $6.05 billion paid for the NFL's Washington Commanders. The new ownership group will acquire at least 51% of the team, which recently won its record 18th NBA championship. The previous ownership group, led by Wyc Grousbeck, had purchased the team in 2002 for $360 million.</p>

          <p>A startup named Voltify is pursuing an ambitious plan to convert the $80-billion U.S. freight railroad industry from diesel to battery power. The company's model involves using mobile battery units, called "VoltCars," that connect to existing locomotives, alongside a network of solar-powered microgrids for recharging. By offering a solution that avoids lengthy charging times and integrates with current operations, Voltify aims to convince the six largest U.S. railroad companies to make the switch. The transition could save the industry billions in fuel costs and significantly reduce carbon emissions.</p>

          <p>A growing number of professionals are blending work trips with personal leisure by bringing family, friends, or partners along, a trend known as "bleisure." A recent survey found that over half of business travelers have had loved ones join them, with the practice being even more common among C-suite executives. The motivations include saving money on a potential vacation and reclaiming family time that would otherwise be lost to work. While many companies quietly permit this, it often operates in a policy gray area, requiring employees to clearly separate business and personal expenses.</p>

          <p>Researchers exploring the deepwater regions of Papahānaumokuākea, a vast marine conservation area near Hawaii, have discovered an enormous, monolith-like geological feature. The structure is a volcanic dike, formed when magma filled a crack in older rock, and stands nearly 50 feet tall. Found at a depth of almost 7,000 feet, the sheer vertical wall was an unexpected discovery for the scientific mission, which was mapping the unexplored area. The dike was observed to be teeming with marine life, including large coral colonies, highlighting the rich biodiversity of the protected region.</p>
