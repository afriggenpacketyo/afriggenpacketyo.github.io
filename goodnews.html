          <p>The series finale of "And Just Like That" concludes with protagonist Carrie Bradshaw single once again, an ending the article argues is more fitting than the original "Sex and the City" conclusion. While the revival series has faced criticism for its writing, it ultimately honors the original show's core theme: the enduring power of female friendship over romantic love. After a series of late-life indignities, including widowhood and a failed romance, Carrie realizes that a life without a male partner is not a tragedy. The finale emphasizes that finding fulfillment in friendships can be more profound than the fairytale romance the original series provided for all its heroines.</p>

          <p>Guangzhou Innogen Pharmaceutical Group experienced a massive surge in its stock price during its Hong Kong trading debut, with shares soaring to nearly four times their initial public offering price. The successful IPO reflects strong investor confidence in China's booming pharmaceutical and biotech sectors, which have seen rising valuations throughout the year. Innogen, which develops drugs for diabetes and metabolic diseases, raised approximately $87.2 million. The company's performance follows a trend of successful listings for pre-revenue biotech firms under Hong Kong's specialized Chapter 18A rule, indicating a robust market for pharmaceutical investments.

          <p>Japan's economy grew by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing economists' forecasts despite trade pressures from the United States. This expansion was primarily driven by a rebound in net exports, which contributed significantly to the GDP after contracting in the previous quarter. On an annualized basis, the economy expanded by 1%, also beating expectations. The positive economic data comes even as Japan navigated a challenging trade environment, ultimately reaching a deal with the U.S. that imposes a 15% blanket tariff on its exports.

          <p>China has unveiled a new high-speed jet drone with vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities, a technological breakthrough that could significantly enhance its naval power. The runway-independent drone is designed to launch from the decks of various warships, including destroyers and frigates, effectively turning them into small aircraft carriers. A project team behind the drone claims it is far superior in speed compared to other mainstream VTOL drones. This innovation would allow for rapid deployment and long-range cruise flights even in rough sea conditions, expanding the operational reach of the Chinese navy.</p>

          <p>President Trump downplayed the significance of Latin American countries strengthening ties with China, asserting the United States' economic dominance. Speaking at the White House, Trump stated that the U.S. economy is "blowing everyone away, including China," and suggested that nations aligning with Beijing are not performing well. His comments come as Brazil increases its coordination with China to form a multilateral response to tariffs the U.S. imposed in late July. The tariffs, which target a wide range of Brazilian exports, have prompted affected nations to seek alternative economic partnerships.</p>

          <p>Youngstown, Ohio, once a powerhouse of the American steel industry that suffered a severe economic collapse, is now experiencing a gradual revival. Local entrepreneurs are repurposing abandoned industrial spaces, like a former factory floor that is now a brewery and a historic building turned into a bustling flea market. These efforts are part of a broader revitalization aimed at diversifying the city's economy beyond its steel-making past. While the comeback is not flashy, the city's population has stabilized, and its unemployment rate is now only slightly above the national average, signaling a slow but steady recovery.</p>

          <p>The UK government is collaborating with medical content creators on TikTok to raise awareness about the dangers of traveling abroad for cosmetic procedures. This initiative addresses growing concerns over Britons seeking cheaper treatments like hair implants and dental work overseas, which can lead to life-altering injuries and botched results. The campaign will feature influencers urging their followers to consult with a UK doctor, secure proper travel insurance, and avoid package deals that include surgeries. The goal is to help potential patients make more informed and safer choices, reducing the burden on the NHS to correct procedures gone wrong.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama held a virtual meeting with Texas House Democrats who fled the state to block a Republican-led redistricting plan, praising their courage and emphasizing the importance of their actions. Obama stated that their stand against partisan gerrymandering has prompted responses from other states like California and has helped set the tone for a longer struggle to protect democracy. The Texas Democrats, who have been staying in Illinois to deny the state legislature a quorum, said Obama's support shows that their fight has backing at every level of the party.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new AI-driven dubbing system called DeepEditor is helping international films break into the challenging U.S. market by seamlessly altering actors' lip movements to match a new language. Developed by the company Flawless, the technology manipulates video to create the illusion that actors are genuinely speaking the dubbed language, overcoming the awkwardness of traditional dubbing. The system was successfully used on the Swedish sci-fi film "Watch the Skies," enabling a theatrical release in the U.S. that would have been otherwise unlikely. This innovation could significantly expand the global audience for foreign-language films and television shows.</p>

As part of the partnership, toy maker Mattel will donate £20,000 to the Rugby Football Union to help increase girls' access to clubs and coaching. While Barbie has previously been criticized for promoting unrealistic body types, the brand has since diversified and partnered with numerous female athletes.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors not to exit the market despite signs of frothiness, arguing that rational, positive stock stories currently outweigh irrational exuberance. He contrasted the current environment with the dot-com bubble, noting that while some recent IPOs and speculative stocks show irrational gains, strong fundamentals from major companies like Amazon and Eli Lilly provide stability. Cramer suggests that the market's "magical thinking" phase affects both speculative and fundamentally sound stocks, and investors should not sell their positions in rational companies due to widespread irrationality.

          <p>Facing an existential threat from affordable and technologically advanced Chinese electric vehicles, Ford is overhauling its manufacturing process to produce cheaper EVs. CEO Jim Farley announced that a new electric pickup truck, starting at $30,000, will be produced in 2027 at a retooled Kentucky plant using a more efficient "assembly tree" system with fewer parts. This move is a direct response to Chinese competitors like Xiaomi, whose advanced EVs could dominate the market if not for current U.S. tariffs.

Ouattara had a productive season last year, scoring nine goals in 37 appearances for his former club.
