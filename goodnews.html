        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the complexities of Battle Damage Assessment (BDA), using historical examples like World War II and the first Gulf War to contextualize the dispute over the effectiveness of recent U.S. strikes on Iran. It argues that preliminary assessments are often incomplete and that the true impact involves not just physical destruction but also functional and indirect effects. Given the use of advanced precision-guided munitions like the 15-ton GBU-57 bunker-busters and ideal delivery conditions, the author suggests the damage to Iran's nuclear program was likely severe and lasting, aligning more with White House claims than with early critical reports.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has revealed that he has found a buyer for the popular video-sharing app TikTok, which faces a potential ban in the U.S. over national security concerns. In a Fox News interview, Trump mentioned a group of "very wealthy people" are prepared to acquire the platform from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, and suggested a deal could be finalized within weeks. The sale, which requires approval from the Chinese government, comes after Trump repeatedly extended the deadline for ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations, with the latest deadline set for September 17.</p>

          <p>The Brad Pitt-led racing film "F1 The Movie" debuted at the top of the box office with an impressive $55.6 million in North America, exceeding analysts' expectations. Directed by Joseph Kosinski, the big-budget movie also brought in $88 million internationally, marking a significant theatrical success for Apple, which has previously struggled to produce box office hits. The film's strong opening was bolstered by positive reviews, an "A" grade from audiences via CinemaScore, and a heavy promotional focus on premium formats like Imax, which accounted for a substantial portion of its revenue.</p>
