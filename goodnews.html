          <p>Ford Motor is attempting to boost sales of its F-150 pickup trucks by offering promotional financing to consumers with subprime credit scores, typically below 620. This move aims to make the vehicles more affordable and reduce inventory levels ahead of the third quarter's end. While not unprecedented, offering lower interest rates to higher-risk borrowers raises concerns about potential defaults, especially in an uncertain economy. Ford Credit stated it only finances customers it deems creditworthy, using a proprietary scoring model beyond just the FICO score. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shanaz Hemmati, co-founder of the $1.7 billion startup ZenBusiness, advises that the most critical first step for any new entrepreneur is to thoroughly research their market and get feedback from prospective customers. Before launching their AI-powered software to help small businesses with legal compliance, she and her partner spent nearly 10 months interviewing potential clients. This process revealed that they should target first-time business owners, a pivot from their original plan, which proved invaluable to their success. Hemmati stresses that entrepreneurs must be open to adapting their ideas based on this feedback to avoid a "fatal mistake" that could doom their venture.</p>

          <p>In response to a dangerous trend known as "subway surfing," which has led to 16 deaths in three years, the New York City Police Department is using drones to monitor moving trains. When a drone spots someone on top of a train, a ground team is dispatched to intercept the individual at the next station. The program, which officials say has already saved over 200 people, aims to prevent further tragedies like the 2023 death of 15-year-old Zackery Nazario. The victim's mother is now suing social media companies, alleging their platforms allowed the deadly trend to go viral.</p>

          <p>The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has approved a proposal to remove the $25,000 minimum equity rule for pattern day traders, a move that would make active trading more accessible to retail investors with smaller accounts. The long-standing rule, established during the dot-com bubble, required traders making four or more day trades in five days to maintain this minimum balance. It will be replaced by an intraday margin rule based on the positions taken, reflecting modern shifts in technology and market access. The change is now pending approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission. (not investment advice)</p>

He highlighted the dangers of a new global arms race and criticized international institutions as being too weak to guarantee Ukraine's safety. His address came as U.S. President Donald Trump signaled a major shift in his position, stating for the first time that Ukraine could win back all its territory with support from its allies.

          <h2>Federal Reserve Rate Cut Lowers Monthly Payments on a $250,000 Mortgage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 14:22:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut, the average 30-year mortgage rate has dropped to 6.13%, its lowest point in three years, providing relief for potential homebuyers. For a $250,000 loan, this new rate translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $1,520, which is about $150 less per month compared to rates at the beginning of the year. This reduction not only makes homeownership more accessible but also results in significant long-term savings, potentially saving a borrower over $54,000 in total interest over the life of the loan.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recently retired Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce has voiced his dislike for the NFL's expanded jersey number rules, which allow more positions, particularly on defense, to wear single-digit numbers. Speaking on his "New Heights" podcast, Kelce expressed a preference for the traditional system where a player's number immediately signified their position. He argued that seeing defensive linemen or linebackers wearing numbers like 1 or 11 feels wrong, stating that "big body" players on the line of scrimmage should have "big" numbers. Kelce lamented that defensive numbers now "mean nothing" while offensive linemen remain restricted.</p>

          <p>Researchers are studying leucovorin, a generic drug derived from folic acid and typically used to treat chemotherapy side effects, as a potential treatment for some children with autism. The theory suggests that the drug can bypass a blockage that prevents folate from reaching the brain, which may contribute to neurological issues like speech delays. Several small-scale clinical trials have shown positive effects on speech, and some parents report dramatic improvements in their nonverbal children. While more research and funding are needed for FDA approval, the off-label use highlights a potential breakthrough for a subset of the autism community.</p>

These candidates hope to leverage their name recognition and public profiles, following in the footsteps of predecessors like Senator Bill Bradley.

          <p>Honda has announced it will stop producing the Acura ZDX electric vehicle, which was being assembled by General Motors at its plant in Tennessee. The decision to cancel future production was attributed to changing market conditions and a desire to align its product portfolio with customer needs and long-term goals. While the ZDX is being discontinued, Honda will continue its partnership with GM on another EV, the Honda Prologue, and plans to produce a new all-electric Acura RSX at its own facility in Ohio. GM stated the move does not reflect on the workforce and will not alter its employment plans for the Tennessee plant.</p>

          <p>For homeowners considering an $80,000 home equity loan, the recent Federal Reserve interest rate cut has resulted in slightly lower monthly payments. A 15-year loan at the current average rate of 8.31% would cost approximately $779 per month, a modest decrease of about $10 compared to rates at the beginning of 2025. While the savings are not dramatic, the article notes that borrowing costs are now marginally more favorable for consumers looking to leverage their home's equity. This provides a small but tangible benefit for those needing access to a large sum of money. (not investment advice)</p>

The judge ruled that while consumers may have been disappointed, they failed to show economic harm, as the products were not rendered worthless by the lack of artistic detail. The attorney for the consumers stated they plan to amend and refile the complaint, arguing that companies shouldn't profit from false representations.</p>

While previous studies showed AI could pass the first two levels, the ability to clear the final, most difficult stage marks a significant leap in the technology's capabilities.

          <p>The City of Inglewood, California, has agreed to a $25 million settlement with Maurice Hastings, a 72-year-old man who was exonerated after spending 38 years in prison for a 1983 murder he did not commit. Hastings was freed in 2022 after new DNA evidence identified a different suspect, who had died in prison in 2020. A subsequent civil rights lawsuit demonstrated that an Inglewood police detective had allegedly falsified evidence and buried information that supported Hastings' alibi. The settlement is believed to be the largest of its kind in California's history for a wrongful conviction case.</p>

          <p>Sales of new single-family homes in the U.S. rose by 20.5% in August, reaching the fastest pace since early 2022, according to the Census Bureau. This unexpected surge is attributed to builders offering significant price discounts and other incentives to attract buyers who have been hesitant due to affordability challenges. Easing mortgage rates in anticipation of the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut also contributed to the increase in activity. However, analysts caution that the new home market represents only a small fraction of total sales and that the broader housing market remains constrained. (not investment advice)</p>

The team's preparation involves a multi-million-dollar budget for sports science, data analytics, and even virtual reality headsets to acclimate players to the hostile crowd environment expected at Bethpage.
