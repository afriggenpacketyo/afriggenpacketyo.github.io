          <p>South Korea is positioning itself as a leader in naval warfare by unveiling a model of a 15,000-tonne drone carrier, the HCX-23 Plus, at the 2025 International Maritime Defence Industry Exhibition. The design, which lacks a traditional command island, signals a shift towards unmanned maritime power projection. The HCX-23 Plus is designed to be a compact, drone-optimized asset tailored for modern grey-zone and near-sea operations. This move places South Korea among the first nations to explore and potentially deploy such advanced maritime technology.</p>

          <p>A team in Japan has created a device to measure symptoms of orthostatic dysregulation in children, a condition causing dizziness when standing. The device, called the OD Checker, measures heart rate changes when transitioning from lying down to standing, providing clear results similar to a thermometer. The goal is to help children communicate their symptoms when they need to miss classes. The team, including students with medical and electronics backgrounds, aims to market the device as medical equipment, seeking private-sector support for further development and clinical testing.</p>
