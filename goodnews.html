          <p>Following Swedish payments group Klarna's successful $17 billion initial public offering, the fintech industry is keenly watching for the next major company to go public. Klarna's positive market reception, alongside other recent fintech listings like eToro and Gemini, signals a more welcoming environment on Wall Street for such debuts. Companies like Stripe, Revolut, Monzo, Starling Bank, and Payhawk are identified as strong contenders, each having achieved significant private valuations or demonstrating strong growth. While some have opted for secondary share sales recently, the success of Klarna's IPO provides a positive indicator for future listings in the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's Kospi index surged to a record high of 3,420.23, marking its tenth consecutive session of gains, after the Finance Minister announced the government would scrap plans to raise taxes on stock investments. The market closed 0.35% higher, with the small-cap Kosdaq also seeing gains. This positive movement occurred amidst mixed trading in other Asia-Pacific markets, as investors monitored ongoing US-China talks in Madrid and assessed recent economic data from Beijing. US equity futures remained largely unchanged as markets anticipated a potential interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve later in the week, fueled by hopes from weakening labor market data.

If confirmed, Xi's attendance at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders' summit would mark his first visit to South Korea since 2014. The election of President Lee Jae-myung in South Korea has created an opportunity for Beijing and Seoul to recalibrate their relationship, which had strained under Lee's predecessor, Yoon Suk-yeol, who had aligned more closely with Washington.

Quarterback Russell Wilson delivered a sensational performance with 450 passing yards and three touchdowns, forging a strong connection with rookie wide receiver Malik Nabers. While persistent penalties plagued the team, young talents like offensive tackle Marcus Mbow and running back Cam Skattebo emerged as promising contributors. Despite slim playoff hopes and a tough upcoming schedule, the Giants' competitive spirit and offensive firepower are offering fans a rare sense of optimism for the season.</p>

          <p>China's $12.7 trillion stock market is experiencing a sustained rally, driven by a significant shift of household savings into equities. Data from the People's Bank of China shows deposits at non-banking financial institutions increased for a second consecutive month in August, indicating a growing trend of capital moving towards higher returns. This shift is largely attributed to low-interest-rate policies that are diminishing the attractiveness of traditional banking deposits. With the earnings yield of China's largest listed companies at 5.5%, significantly higher than government bonds or demand deposits, the stock market is becoming an increasingly appealing investment avenue.

          <p>China is actively exploring a "Coal-to-Nuclear" (C2N) initiative to convert existing coal-fired power plants into nuclear facilities, particularly utilizing fourth-generation reactors. This strategy, proposed by China Energy Engineering Group Co., Ltd (CEEC), aims to decarbonize the energy sector while preserving valuable infrastructure, especially in coastal regions. With over 1.19 terawatts of coal capacity and approximately 100 gigawatts expected to retire by 2030, this conversion could offer a direct and efficient path to reducing carbon emissions. Researchers involved believe these advanced reactors also have a greater chance of meeting safety requirements and gaining public acceptance, facilitating a significant energy transition.</p>

Falcons running back Bijan Robinson was a standout, rushing for 143 yards on 22 carries, while kicker Parker Romo successfully converted all five of his field goal attempts.
