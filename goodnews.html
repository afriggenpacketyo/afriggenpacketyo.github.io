        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Artificial intelligence cloud provider CoreWeave has announced it will acquire data center infrastructure company Core Scientific in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $9 billion. The deal is expected to expand CoreWeave's access to power and real estate, giving it ownership of 1.3 gigawatts of capacity across Core Scientific's U.S. data centers. CoreWeave executives stated the acquisition will eliminate $10 billion in future lease obligations and improve operating efficiency. The transaction, which is pending regulatory and shareholder approval, is anticipated to close in the fourth quarter of 2025.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team at the University of Tartu in Estonia is pioneering a sustainable technology solution by turning old smartphones into small-scale data centers. By removing the batteries and connecting the devices to an external power source, researchers can link them together to process and store data for various projects. This innovative approach aims to reduce electronic waste, as over a billion new smartphones are produced annually, with many ending up in landfills. The repurposed phone clusters have already been tested in real-world applications, such as underwater marine life monitoring, offering an affordable alternative to expensive traditional equipment.</p>

          <h2>Oldest Known Pterosaur in North America Discovered in Arizona</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 15:00:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have identified the fossil of North America's oldest known pterosaur, a flying reptile approximately the size of a small seagull that lived 209.2 million years ago. The discovery, detailed in a Smithsonian-led paper, was made from a fragile jawbone unearthed at a fossil site in Arizona's Petrified Forest National Park. The new species, named Eotephradactylus mcintireae, helps fill a significant gap in the fossil record from the late Triassic period. The finding provides valuable new insights into the evolution of pterosaurs, which were close cousins of dinosaurs and the first animals after insects to evolve powered flight.</p>

          <p>This article profiles 21-year-old boxing prospect Sam Contreras Jr., a Californian with Salvadoran roots who is currently a sparring partner for the legendary Manny Pacquiao. With a professional record of 2-0 and 14 national amateur titles, Contreras is considered a major talent in the super lightweight division. He has chosen to represent El Salvador to honor his heritage and bring visibility to a country with few boxing figures. The article delves into his disciplined training, his family's sacrifices to protect him from gang violence, and the profound influence of his father and coach, who is driven by the memory of a previous promising boxer he trained who died tragically.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The film 'F1' has become Apple's most successful theatrical release, speeding past $293 million at the global box office. Distributed by Warner Bros. Discovery, the movie has surpassed the earnings of previous Apple-produced films like 'Napoleon' and 'Killers of the Flower Moon'. A significant portion of its success is attributed to a partnership with IMAX, which accounted for over 20% of its total gross. While the film still has a way to go to become profitable due to its high production and marketing costs, its box office performance is considered a major milestone for the tech giant's growing entertainment division.</p>

          <p>Actor and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger visited Mount Vernon on July 4th to congratulate 100 new American citizens during a naturalization ceremony. In his remarks, Schwarzenegger reflected on George Washington's legacy, particularly his willingness to relinquish power, a trait he finds to be the ultimate sign of greatness. The article draws parallels between historical visitors to Mount Vernon, like the Marquis de Lafayette, and modern leaders who admire Washington's civic stewardship. For Schwarzenegger, an immigrant from Austria, participating in the ceremony at the home of the nation's first president was a profoundly meaningful experience he never imagined possible.</p>

          <p>A recent report highlights two heartwarming stories of generosity from across the United States. In Wyoming, a man whose car was hit by a 16-year-old on an icy road launched a fundraiser that collected nearly $14,000 to buy the teen a replacement vehicle. Meanwhile, in Washington, two young chess champion brothers, Vivaan and Sarang Sankrithi, donated their tournament winnings to help a 10-year-old boy suffering from chronic pancreatitis. The brothers' donation went to Mission: Cure, an organization working to find a cure for the disease, providing a spark of hope for the recipient and his family.</p>

          <p>French Olympic fencer Ysaora Thibus has been cleared of a doping violation after successfully arguing she was contaminated with a banned substance by kissing her partner. Thibus tested positive for ostarine, a muscle-growth agent, but a tribunal accepted her defense that the substance was transferred through bodily fluids from her partner, former U.S. Olympian Race Imboden, who had taken it. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) appealed the initial decision, but the Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld the ruling. The court determined it was scientifically established that such contamination was possible, allowing Thibus to avoid a potential four-year ban.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An exhaustive review by the Justice Department and the FBI has concluded that Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide and that there is no evidence of a "client list" or of him blackmailing prominent individuals. A two-page memo detailing the findings states that a systematic search of all files related to the case revealed no credible evidence that could lead to investigations against uncharged third parties. The conclusion about his death aligns with previous findings and is supported by video footage showing no one entered his cell tier. The memo aims to dispel widespread conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein's 2019 death in federal custody.</p>

          <p>Jack Dorsey, CEO of Block and co-founder of Twitter, has launched a beta version of Bitchat, a new peer-to-peer messaging app that operates without the internet. The app uses Bluetooth mesh networks to allow nearby devices to communicate directly, forming local clusters to pass along encrypted, ephemeral messages. The decentralized design requires no phone numbers or emails and does not use central servers, aiming to provide a censorship-resistant communication tool during internet outages or surveillance. The project reflects Dorsey's ongoing interest in developing privacy-focused, user-owned technologies that challenge the models of mainstream platforms like WhatsApp.</p>

          <p>The United States is scheduled to remove the Syrian Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) from its list of foreign terrorist organizations, according to a state department memo. The group, formerly an al-Qaeda affiliate, led the rebel offensive that recently toppled the Assad regime, and its leader is now Syria's interim president. This move is part of a broader effort by Western nations to reset relations with Syria following the end of its 13-year civil war. The U.S. recently ended sanctions against the country, and the UK has resumed diplomatic visits and increased aid to support long-term recovery.</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic fought back from a set down to defeat Australian Alex de Minaur and advance to the quarter-finals at Wimbledon. Playing in front of his former rival and eight-time champion Roger Federer, Djokovic had an uncharacteristically difficult start, losing the first set 1-6. He recovered his form to win the match in four sets, later joking that he had finally broken the "curse" of losing when Federer was watching. The seven-time champion is now just three wins away from a record-tying eighth Wimbledon title and a record 25th Grand Slam overall. He will face Italy's Flavio Cobolli in the next round.</p>
