          <p>US Vice President JD Vance stated that the US is at war with Iran's nuclear program, not with Iran itself, following US airstrikes ordered by President Trump. Vance believes the strikes have significantly delayed Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons. He accused Iran of not negotiating in good faith during diplomatic talks, which prompted the US strikes. Vance expressed hope that the strikes would provide an opportunity to reset the relationship and negotiations, leading to a long-term settlement. He also mentioned that Washington has received "indirect" messages from Tehran since the strikes, but did not elaborate on the content.</p>
