          <h2>Nike Announces Corporate Staff Layoffs as Part of Restructuring</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nike is implementing another round of layoffs, impacting less than 1% of its corporate staff, as part of CEO Elliott Hill's realignment strategy to refocus on sports and culture. This follows a previous layoff of 2% of staff in February, with the current changes aimed at restructuring teams within the corporation and reversing adjustments made under the former CEO. The company is shifting its business segmentation back to sport-focused teams, aiming to reignite innovation and improve sales. Staff will be notified of their status by September 8, with most new roles taking effect on September 21. The company expects sales and profit declines to moderate in the coming quarters, signaling potential improvements ahead. Optimism score is based on Nike's expectation that sales and profit declines will moderate in the coming quarters. </p>

          <p>South Carolina women's basketball coach Dawn Staley stated that she would have accepted the New York Knicks head coaching position if offered, emphasizing the significance for women in sports. Staley interviewed for the role before the Knicks hired Mike Brown and believed she performed well, but questioned if her inquiries about the impact of hiring the NBA's first female head coach affected her chances. She felt a shift in energy after posing these questions, suggesting her inquisitiveness might have been a setback. Staley has an impressive coaching record, including three national championships and a .773 winning percentage, making her a notable figure in college basketball. </p>

          <h2>Nvidia's Earnings Report Highlights Strong AI Demand Amid China Uncertainty</h2>

          <p>Nvidia's latest earnings report revealed a surge in sales driven by robust AI demand, but concerns remain over the company's future in China due to regulatory challenges. Despite better-than-expected results, investors are wary of restrictions on Nvidia's H20 chip sales in China, a potentially significant market. CEO Jensen Huang has secured a tentative deal to restart sales by sharing a percentage of revenue with the Chinese government, but the fate of the H20 chip remains uncertain. Huang projected substantial AI infrastructure spending in the coming years, indicating a massive opportunity for Nvidia, with analysts remaining optimistic about the company's growth potential.

          <p>The government's grant scheme for electric vehicles (EVs) has announced the first eligible models, with Ford's Puma Gen-E and e-Tourneo Courier qualifying for a £3,750 discount. Other models are eligible for a £1,500 discount, as part of plans to encourage drivers to switch from petrol and diesel vehicles. The scheme aims to lower the cost of EVs, bringing prices closer to their petrol and diesel counterparts, and is funded through a £650m initiative available for three years. While many drivers cite upfront costs as a barrier to buying an EV, the government has pledged to ban the sale of new fully petrol or diesel cars from 2030. </p>

Pure began recognizing revenue from Meta deployments in the second quarter and is increasingly confident about deploying 1 to 2 exabytes with Meta by the end of the fiscal year. The company is also seeing increased interest from other hyperscalers looking to replace traditional storage with Pure's technology, with Pure's ability to efficiently manage space, power and cooling being a key factor. Pure's rally lifted its market cap to $26 billion, with analysts praising the company's growth potential. (not investment advice)</p>

Investors are increasingly focused on energy infrastructure, nuclear power, and electrification technologies, as demand surges from AI data centers, electric vehicles, and large factories. The trend is expected to continue, with electricity prices outpacing general inflation in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union has formally proposed removing tariffs on American industrial goods, fulfilling a key element of the U.S.-EU trade agreement. This move will ensure lower automobile tariffs retroactive to the beginning of August, contributing to stability in EU-US trade relations. The proposal needs approval from the European Parliament and Council, with the U.S. expecting the EU's legislative proposals to be enacted. The U.S. and EU reached a trade deal at the end of July, with President Trump stating a 15% tariff would be imposed on most European goods to the U.S., including cars. </p>

Trump has criticized trade “loopholes” in the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement allowing Chinese goods to enter the U.S., and has threatened tariffs on Chinese carmakers building plants in Mexico to export cars to the U.S. Mexico’s imports from China exceeded US$51 billion last year.

While demographic diversity has been the focus of many DEI programs, cognitive and creative diversity, as well as ideological diversity, are key to driving innovation and protecting against groupthink. Achieving ideological diversity can be challenging due to growing political intolerance, but companies can prioritize it by looking for people with high openness to new ideas and by encouraging civility and tolerance at work. Companies need to identify different kinds of thinkers without relying on demographic categories as a shortcut to do the sorting. </p>
