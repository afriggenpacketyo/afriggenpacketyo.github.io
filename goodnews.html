          <p>Amazon is shutting down its free, ad-supported streaming service, Freevee, in August. The service, which launched in 2019, offered original series and other content through a standalone app. Following the shutdown, Freevee's shows and movies will be integrated into Prime Video, where they will be available to watch for free with ads, even without a Prime membership. This move aims to consolidate Amazon's video offerings and simplify the viewing experience for customers, coming after the company introduced an ad-supported tier to Prime Video earlier this year.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has established a new trade deal with Vietnam, which will impose a 20% tariff on all Vietnamese imports, as announced by President Donald Trump. This rate is a reduction from a potential 46% but higher than a temporary 10% rate. The agreement also includes a 40% tariff on goods transshipped through Vietnam from other countries to prevent circumvention of trade barriers, a practice reportedly used by China. In exchange, the deal reportedly grants U.S. products tariff-free access to Vietnam's markets, aiming to rebalance the trade relationship between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article champions President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," framing it as a landmark achievement that will fundamentally strengthen the U.S. economy. The author argues that making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, especially the provision for 100% business expensing, will unleash significant investment, job creation, and wage growth. The piece contrasts this pro-growth agenda with the Democratic opposition, which it characterizes as a vote for higher taxes. The legislation is presented as a critical tool for ensuring American competitiveness and securing a prosperous future for all citizens. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked a Trump administration plan that aimed to severely restrict access to the U.S. asylum system for migrants crossing the southern border. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president does not have the unilateral authority to supplant immigration laws enacted by Congress. The decision came in a lawsuit filed by asylum seekers and immigrant rights groups who argued the president's proclamation was unlawful. The judge's order halts a key pillar of the administration's immigration agenda, though its effective date was postponed for 14 days to allow for an appeal.</p>

The move is intended to make California more competitive and prevent productions from relocating to other states and countries that offer more lucrative incentives. This boost aims to stimulate an industry that has slowed due to strikes, spending cutbacks, and other recent challenges. A related bill is also under consideration to expand the types of productions eligible for the credit, further strengthening the state's effort to keep Hollywood jobs at home.</p>

Additionally, HELOCs can come with closing costs similar to a mortgage, including title work and attorney fees.
