          <p>A new study indicates that while parents in Europe find greater meaning in life, they often experience lower life satisfaction compared to their child-free counterparts. The study, based on data from the European Social Survey, highlights that mothers' life satisfaction is particularly affected. However, Scandinavian countries show less disparity due to robust family policies, including childcare and parental leave. The study suggests that societal support and gender equality play significant roles in parental well-being.</p>

          <p>Japan's Penal Code has been amended to prioritize rehabilitation efforts in prisons, marking the first changes to punishment forms in over a century. Imprisonment is no longer divided into categories with and without labor, and prison work is not mandatory. This allows more time for rehabilitative guidance and education to reduce recidivism. The revised law stipulates that inmates can undertake "necessary work" or undergo "necessary guidance" tailored to their age, characteristics, and other factors, with reviews every six months.</p>

          <p>Perth-based AVZ Minerals has suspended its arbitration case against the Democratic Republic of Congo, following US encouragement to resolve a dispute over the Manono lithium project. The US is backing KoBold Metals, funded by tech billionaires, to acquire AVZ‚Äôs stake in Manono, pledging US$1 billion to develop the project. This move directly challenges China‚Äôs Zijin Mining, which controls the northern section after Congo revoked AVZ‚Äôs rights in 2023. The legal action is on hold as the US seeks to secure critical minerals in Congo.</p>
