          <p>Gulf markets ended mostly higher after the United States struck three key Iranian nuclear sites, with Tel Aviv stocks reaching an all-time high on hopes that Washington's intervention would help resolve the conflict. Saudi Arabia's Tadawul closed slightly down, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains. Bahrain issued a "work from home mandate" to ensure public safety. An expert noted that the Gulf states have distanced themselves from the conflict, supporting a peaceful resolution and condemning Israeli aggression, which has helped isolate them from significant market impact. The market might be pricing in the removal of the Iranian threat, which international investors may view positively (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska discusses her role as a moderate in a polarized Washington and her new memoir, "Far from Home: An Alaskan Senator Faces the Extreme Climate of Washington, D.C." She emphasizes the importance of staying connected to her constituents and doing what she thinks is morally right. Murkowski, who never voted for Donald Trump, warned her Republican Senate colleagues against ceding congressional authority over government spending to the president. She expressed concern that Congress is not doing its job by providing adequate oversight and is allowing the executive branch to overreach. The senator's effectiveness is tied to relationships, even with those she doesn't support.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships reveals that certain phrases can hinder cooperation and trigger a child's fight-or-flight response. The article suggests alternative phrases that honor a child's autonomy while setting boundaries, such as explaining decisions instead of saying "Because I said so," and offering agency instead of making threats. Dismissing a child's emotions or assuming intentional difficulty can also be counterproductive. The key is to create an environment where cooperation feels natural by respecting the child's feelings, providing emotional safety, and involving them in the process. This approach promotes trust, self-regulation, and emotional resilience.</p>

Recent surveys indicate that many small businesses are experiencing business growth and maintaining or growing their workforce. However, optimism is tempered by a weakening outlook on future economic growth and concerns about financial health. While some surveys report revenue growth and confidence, others highlight flat job growth and decreasing hourly earnings. Despite headwinds, small businesses remain optimistic about the future and are maintaining employment levels, indicating a degree of resilience (not investment advice).</p>

It helps candidates showcase their value to potential employers and prepare for interviews. The recruiter emphasizes that hiring managers are looking for what candidates will bring to a new company and how they will make a significant impact.
