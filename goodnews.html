          <p>Shanghai is set to launch a comprehensive urban village redevelopment project in 2026 as part of a broader three-year action plan to upgrade its housing infrastructure. This initiative, one of the city's most ambitious renewal campaigns, also includes renovating older residential neighborhoods and thin-walled housing by 2027. The plan aligns with China's national strategy of shifting focus from large-scale expansion to improving existing urban areas. City officials announced the project as a way to boost both consumption and investment, reflecting a strategic move to enhance living conditions while stimulating economic activity.</p>

          <p>Everton is reportedly in advanced talks to sign Manchester City winger Jack Grealish on a season-long loan. The 29-year-old, who joined City for a record £100 million in 2021, has seen his role diminish, making only seven league starts last season. Grealish was a key player in City's historic Treble-winning 2022-23 season but has since struggled for form and playing time under manager Pep Guardiola. A move to Everton could provide the English playmaker with an opportunity to revitalize his career after a difficult period at the Manchester club.</p>

Bell was working for the organization that would become the British Antarctic Survey. His 86-year-old brother, David Bell, expressed astonishment and relief at the discovery, stating it provides a sense of closure his family, particularly his mother, never had.</p>

          <p>The Boston Public Library is collaborating with OpenAI and Harvard Law School to use artificial intelligence to digitize and enhance public access to its vast collection of historic government documents. This project aims to make thousands of fragile documents, some dating back to the early 1800s, searchable and accessible online for the first time. The partnership involves Harvard researchers training AI models on the library's high-quality, out-of-copyright materials, which in turn helps AI companies improve their systems. While the collaboration promises greater public access, some library professionals express caution about the cultural differences between public institutions and tech corporations.</p>

          <p>The British government is considering a major overhaul of driving laws in England and Wales, which could include compulsory eye tests for drivers over the age of 70. The proposed road safety strategy also includes reducing the drink-driving limit to match Scotland's stricter laws and introducing penalty points for passengers not wearing seatbelts. The move follows a coroner's report that labeled the UK's licensing system the "laxest in Europe" after an inquest into deaths caused by drivers with poor eyesight. The government believes current safety messaging is insufficient and aims to restore order to the roads.</p>

          <p>With high UV levels expected across the UK, understanding sunscreen labels is crucial for skin protection. The Sun Protection Factor (SPF) indicates how much UVB radiation, which causes sunburn, is blocked; SPF 30 is recommended and filters about 97% of UVB rays. The star rating, from one to five, measures protection against UVA radiation, which is associated with skin aging and cancer. For optimal safety, experts advise choosing a sunscreen with both a high SPF and a high star rating. Sunscreen should be reapplied at least every two hours, as its effectiveness diminishes with sweat and water exposure.</p>

          <p>Gary Grant, founder of The Entertainer, the UK's largest independent toy retailer, is handing over 100% ownership of the company to his 1,900 employees. The business, which Grant started with his wife in 1981, will be managed by an employee ownership trust, allowing staff to receive a share of the profits. Grant stated the decision was made to preserve the company's family-oriented values and legacy, which includes donating 10% of profits to charity and not opening on Sundays. This move ensures the business continues its operations without being sold to a firm with a different ethos.</p>

          <p>Shares of Dutch Bros have soared after the drive-thru coffee chain reported strong second-quarter results and raised its full-year guidance. The company saw a 28% increase in total revenue to $415.8 million, driven by robust comparable sales and new store openings. Adjusted earnings per share jumped 67% year over year, and the company now projects full-year revenue between $1.59 billion and $1.6 billion. Analysts see continued growth potential from its expanding store footprint, cost-efficient model, and early-stage initiatives like mobile ordering and food offerings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A small, cherry tomato-sized object that crashed through the roof of a house in McDonough, Georgia, has been identified as a 4.56-billion-year-old meteorite. A University of Georgia geologist confirmed its origin after examining fragments, noting it is about 20 million years older than Earth itself. The meteorite likely originated from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. This event marks the 27th recovered meteorite in Georgia's history and highlights how modern technology and public attentiveness are aiding in the recovery and study of such space rocks.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's company, Tesla, has formally applied for a license to supply electricity directly to consumers in the United Kingdom. The application, submitted by Tesla Energy Ventures to the regulator Ofgem, could position the company to compete with major UK energy firms starting next year. While known for its electric vehicles, Tesla also has a significant energy division that develops solar systems and battery storage, and it already operates as an electricity supplier in Texas. This move into the UK energy market comes as the company faces a significant slump in its European car sales.</p>

          <p>In a surprise move, Beijing has relaxed its home-buying restrictions, allowing eligible families to purchase properties outside the city's Fifth Ring Road. This policy change, which came earlier than many market analysts expected, is seen as a proactive step by the government to bolster the struggling property sector and strengthen market confidence. The move has led to speculation that other tier-one cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen could soon follow with their own stimulus measures. Analysts view this as part of a broader central government strategy to remove purchasing curbs in non-central urban areas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The origin of life on Earth remains a profound scientific mystery, with leading hypotheses centering on two aquatic environments: deep-sea hydrothermal vents and shallow tide pools. The presence of abundant water is considered a key ingredient, which is why scientists are also investigating so-called "water worlds" like the moons of Jupiter and Saturn for potential extraterrestrial life. This article explores the scientific reasoning behind both the hydrothermal vent and tide pool theories. These competing ideas drive research into how non-living matter could have transitioned into the first living organisms on our planet.</p>

          <p>Biddy Baxter, the long-serving and formidable editor who transformed the BBC children's show 'Blue Peter' into a cultural institution, has died at the age of 92. During her tenure from 1965 to 1988, she introduced iconic elements like on-screen pets, charity appeals, and the famous Blue Peter badge, fostering deep viewer engagement. While celebrated as a creative force, she was also known as a demanding and controlling figure who clashed with presenters like John Noakes and Peter Purves. Baxter's vision and passion were instrumental in shaping the program's enduring legacy for generations of children.</p>
