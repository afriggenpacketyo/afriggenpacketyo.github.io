          <p>The Trump administration has released a vast collection of previously classified federal documents related to the 1968 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The files, sourced from agencies like the FBI and CIA, detail the government's investigation into the killing and the preceding years of surveillance on Dr. King. While the release aims for transparency, much of the information confirms long-established facts, such as the FBI's intense and legally questionable monitoring of the civil rights leader. Dr. King's family expressed mixed feelings, supporting accountability while urging the public to view the files with respect for their ongoing grief.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced it has reached trade agreements with both the Philippines and Indonesia, establishing a 19% tariff rate on goods imported into the U.S. from both nations. According to President Trump, the deals will see the Philippines and Indonesia eliminate tariffs on nearly all U.S. goods, creating more open markets for American products. The agreements were finalized ahead of an August 1 deadline, after which countries without a deal faced the prospect of higher U.S. tariffs. The announcement for the Philippines came after a White House meeting with its president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's women's cricket team secured a 2-1 series victory over England by winning the final One-Day International (ODI) by 13 runs in a hard-fought match. Despite a strong performance from England's captain Nat Sciver-Brunt, who scored 98, the hosts fell short of the record 319-run target set by India. India's total was powered by a century from captain Harmanpreet Kaur, while their 21-year-old bowler Kranti Goud delivered a star performance, taking six wickets. The result marks a significant series win for the tourists and leaves England with issues to address before the World Cup.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has stated that the current 90-day suspension of heavy tariffs between the U.S. and China is likely to be extended. The current truce, which paused a significant escalation in the trade war, is set to expire in mid-August. Bessent expressed optimism about the state of trade relations, suggesting that upcoming talks in Stockholm will formalize the extension and could address other key issues. These include China's manufacturing surplus and its economic support for Russia, signaling a move towards more constructive dialogue between the two economic powers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of DuPont saw a positive turn after China's market regulator announced it was suspending an antitrust investigation into the company's Chinese operations.

Although the business in question represents a small fraction of DuPont's total sales, the investigation had created a significant overhang for the stock.
