          <p>The Los Angeles Rams secured a 31-21 preseason win against the Dallas Cowboys, highlighting promising performances from their backup players. Rookie running back Blake Corum demonstrated his potential to share the workload with Kyren Williams by scoring two touchdowns. Quarterback Stetson Bennett also had a solid outing, completing 16 of 24 passes for 188 yards and two touchdowns, though he did throw one interception. The game provided a valuable look at the team's depth as they prepare for the upcoming NFL season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The luxury fashion industry is shifting away from the subtle "quiet luxury" trend toward more visible and bold "loud luxury" designs. This change, marked by large logos and statement pieces, is an effort by major brands like Gucci and Burberry to re-engage consumers amid slowing sales. Analysts suggest this pivot is a natural cycle in fashion, driven by the need for novelty and a desire to reignite brand desirability after a period of significant price hikes. The success of this strategy may further divide the market between ultra-luxe brands and more accessible labels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jen Pawol made Major League Baseball history on Saturday, becoming the first woman to umpire a regular-season game. She served as the first base umpire during the doubleheader between the Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins, receiving a warm ovation from the crowd. After a largely uneventful debut, the 48-year-old donated the cap she wore to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Her milestone achievement is seen as a significant moment for baseball and for women aspiring to roles on the field.</p>

Pawol, who has a 30-year umpiring career, was celebrated with a standing ovation in Atlanta. After the game, she donated her cap to the Baseball Hall of Fame to commemorate the historic occasion.</p>

          <p>The market for "functional beverages" that promise stress relief and other health benefits is growing rapidly, but nutritionists and dietitians are skeptical of their claims. While brands advertise ingredients like Lion's Mane and Ashwagandha, experts point out that the quantities in these drinks are often far too small to have a proven effect. An ad from a leading brand was recently banned for making unsubstantiated health claims. Psychologists suggest any calming effect may be psychological, stemming from the ritual of taking a moment for oneself rather than the ingredients themselves.</p>

          <p>Ali Akbar, believed to be the last traditional newspaper hawker in Paris, is being honored by the French government for his 50 years of service. President Emmanuel Macron will award the 72-year-old with the Order of Merit, one of the nation's highest honors. Mr. Akbar has been a beloved figure in the Saint-Germain neighborhood since 1973, witnessing the area's transformation and the decline of print media. Despite selling far fewer papers now than in his heyday, he continues his work for the independence and joy it brings him.</p>

          <p>A dog named Petunia has been crowned the winner of the "World's Ugliest Dog Contest" at the Sonoma County Fair in California. The annual event, which has run for nearly 50 years, celebrates the unconventional beauty of dogs and promotes adoption, as many contestants are rescues from shelters. Petunia and her owner, Shannon Nyman, received a $5,000 prize for winning the title. The contest serves as a reminder that a dog's pedigree does not define its value as a pet.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Musician Ed Sheeran's recent statement describing himself as "culturally Irish" has ignited a debate about identity in the modern era. While some criticized the English-born singer, whose grandparents are Irish, others see it as a reflection of the complex, blended identities common today, especially for second-generation immigrants. This article explores the evolving nature of what it means to be Irish, moving beyond simple geography or citizenship. It touches on the varied identities within Northern Ireland and the rich cross-fertilization of culture between Ireland and Britain over centuries.</p>

          <p>A new adaptation of "War of the Worlds," starring Ice Cube, has been widely panned by critics, initially earning a 0% score on Rotten Tomatoes. However, the overwhelmingly negative reviews have paradoxically generated interest, attracting viewers curious to experience a film deemed "one of the worst ever made." This phenomenon reflects a love for "junk film," where movies that are earnestly made but fail spectacularly become more entertaining than bland, forgettable blockbusters. Some find charm in the film's pandemic-era production constraints and unintentional humor, proving that a rock-bottom rating can be its own form of appeal.</p>

          <p>When Chinese AI app DeepSeek-R1 launched six months ago, its claimed high performance at a low development cost stunned Silicon Valley and briefly tanked Nvidia's stock. It challenged the "bigger is better" approach to AI development championed by US firms. While no longer a headline topic, DeepSeek's arrival spurred a shift toward creating smaller, more efficient models, as seen in OpenAI's recent free model releases. However, concerns over data security and its ties to Beijing persist, and the American tech giants have largely resumed their high-spending race for AI dominance.</p>

          <p>Apple shares experienced their largest weekly gain since July 2020, rising 13% and adding over $400 billion to its market capitalization. The surge followed a White House meeting where CEO Tim Cook and President Donald Trump announced Apple's plan to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts. President Trump stated that because of this domestic investment, Apple would be exempt from potential future tariffs on imported chips. This news eased investor fears that tariffs could significantly impact the company's profitability, leading to a strong rally in its stock. (not investment advice)</p>

She credited Roig with already making a positive impact on her game, focusing on improving the overall quality and movement of her shots. Her win sets up a more difficult third-round match against either world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka or former Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova.</p>

          <h2>Neurologist Recommends Pomegranates for Brain Health in Adults Over 50</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A neurologist is highlighting the cognitive benefits of pomegranates, recommending them particularly for people over the age of 50. The fruit is rich in polyphenols, which have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that can enhance learning and memory. Studies suggest these properties may also help protect the brain from the amyloid protein buildup associated with Alzheimer's disease. While fresh pomegranates can be costly and seasonal, the article notes that pomegranate extract can be a year-round alternative, though consumers should watch out for added sugars.</p>
