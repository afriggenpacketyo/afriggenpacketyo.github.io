          <p>Allied Materials, a Kansas City-based flag manufacturer, is preparing for a surge in demand as the United States approaches its 250th anniversary in 2026. The company produces about 1,000 American flags per day, with all components sourced domestically, supplying federal agencies, the military, and the public. For the employees, many of whom have personal connections to the military, producing a perfect flag is a matter of honor, particularly for those used in veterans' funerals. The company is proud of its American-made status, which has insulated it from global supply chain disruptions.</p>

          <p>The market for initial public offerings is showing signs of recovery after a prolonged downturn, sparked by the successful debut of crypto company Circle, whose stock has surged since its June IPO. This positive momentum, along with the performance of companies like CoreWeave, is providing much-needed returns for venture capital firms that have faced a liquidity drought since early 2022. While major players like SpaceX remain private, the increased activity has venture capitalists cautiously optimistic that the backlog of private companies waiting to go public may soon begin to clear.

          <p>An interventional cardiologist has shared dietary advice for parents, highlighting five "toxic" foods he avoids giving his own children to promote lifelong health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like hot dogs and deli meats because of nitrates and sodium. He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which can contribute to inflammation and chronic disease. The article suggests healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn and plain yogurt with fresh fruit.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the nation's 250th birthday, filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as one of the most important events in world history for creating the concept of a "citizen." In an interview, Burns argued that before 1776, all people were subjects, and the revolution's ideals set in motion movements for equality and self-governance worldwide. He emphasized the importance of telling America's complex stories, including its contradictions, as this enriches history and allows everyone to find a place within it. His new film on the topic is set to air in November.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force has suspended a proposed project with SpaceX to test hypersonic rocket cargo deliveries from the Johnston Atoll in the Pacific. The decision follows reports and opposition from environmental groups and biologists who warned the project would harm numerous nesting seabirds at the remote wildlife refuge. The program aims to use commercial rockets to deliver up to 100 tons of cargo anywhere on Earth in about 90 minutes. The Air Force is now reportedly exploring alternative locations for the military logistics program.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cars manufactured in China accounted for a record 10% of all new vehicles sold in the UK in June, a significant increase from previous years. The growth is driven by new brands like BYD and Omoda, alongside established Chinese-owned brands such as MG. This surge comes as other Western countries, including the U.S. and EU member states, have imposed steep tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports, a measure the UK has not yet adopted. The trend highlights the growing competitiveness of Chinese automakers in the global market, particularly in the electric vehicle sector. (not investment advice)</p>
