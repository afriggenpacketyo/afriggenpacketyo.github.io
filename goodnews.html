          <p>An immigrant father from Uganda shares his emotional experience watching his son begin kindergarten in a well-resourced American school. He contrasts his son's comfortable classroom with his own starkly different first day of school in a rural Ugandan church with a dirt floor. The author reflects on the sacrifices made and the generosity of others that led to this moment, viewing his son's opportunity as the fulfillment of a long-held dream. This personal milestone underscores his gratitude for being a present father, a role his own absent father could not fill.</p>

Despite an early morning start, which he admitted is not his preference, Alcaraz dominated the match with a 6-2, 6-4, 6-0 win. He briefly received medical attention for his knee in the second set but stated it was not a cause for concern and quickly recovered. Alcaraz, the 2022 US Open champion, is aiming to reclaim the world number one ranking during the tournament.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve signals potential interest rate cuts, seniors have several methods to borrow from their home equity without refinancing their existing low-rate mortgages. One key option available only to those 62 and older is a reverse mortgage, which converts equity into payments for the homeowner without requiring monthly repayments. Other accessible methods include home equity loans, which offer fixed rates that are currently declining, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which provide flexible borrowing with variable rates. These alternatives allow homeowners to tap into record-high equity levels amid a challenging economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders commented on a surprising and consistent aspect of home games at Folsom Field: the distinct smell of marijuana. In an interview, Sanders noted that the scent reliably appears during a TV timeout in the second quarter of every game, which he humorously dubbed the "light-up quarter." As someone who has never been high, he described the experience as new and unexpected. Sanders is entering his third season as head coach, with the team set to open its season at home against Georgia Tech.</p>

          <p>A growing number of large, historic "trophy" ranches in the American West are being listed for sale as the next generation of heirs often prefers to cash out rather than manage the properties. Brokers report that families with too many descendants, many of whom live far away and have little interest in ranching, are choosing to sell these legacy estates. These properties are in high demand from wealthy buyers seeking privacy and a rural lifestyle, partly fueled by the "Yellowstone" effect. For example, the 7,600-acre Reynolds Ranch in California is on the market for the first time in 116 years.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris set the fastest time in both Friday practice sessions for the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort. Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso finished second, splitting the two McLarens, but he dismissed the idea of competing with them for a front-row start in Saturday's qualifying. Norris expressed little surprise at Aston Martin's pace, noting their recent improvements. The practice sessions saw several incidents, including crashes by Aston Martin's Lance Stroll and Williams' Alex Albon, as teams prepared for a weekend where rain is expected to affect Saturday's events.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 people from Venezuela. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's injunction, finding that the Department of Homeland Security likely lacked the authority to end the protections. The court noted that Congress designed the TPS system to be predictable and insulated from political shifts. This ruling provides relief for Venezuelans who fled political unrest and economic collapse, allowing them to continue living and working in the United States while the case proceeds.</p>

Ernst's decision adds her to a growing list of Senate Republicans not seeking reelection.

The deal allows drivers to maintain their status as independent contractors while gaining the right to negotiate pay and working conditions. In exchange, a separate bill will advance that significantly lowers the insurance coverage requirements for the rideshare companies. This agreement marks a significant turning point in the long-running conflict between labor unions and gig economy companies in California over worker classification and rights.</p>

The defeat highlights Raducanu's ongoing challenge against top-10 opponents and serves as a reality check despite her recent progress and return to form. Rybakina's aggressive play, marked by 23 winners, effectively neutralized Raducanu's game and secured her a spot in the fourth round for the first time at Flushing Meadows.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.2 trillion, many consumers are seeking debt relief. Qualifying for these programs depends on the specific option and an individual's financial situation. Traditional debt consolidation loans typically require a credit score above 650, while debt relief company programs may have more lenient requirements. For those facing severe hardship, debt forgiveness programs can negotiate to reduce the total amount owed, and debt management plans can lower interest rates. Other options include temporary forbearance from card issuers or, as a last resort, bankruptcy. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers seeking stable returns, a certificate of deposit (CD) offers a predictable way to earn interest, with current rates providing significant gains. A $30,000 CD could earn between approximately $317 for a 3-month term and over $6,700 for a 5-year term, based on today's average rates. Opening a CD now allows savers to lock in these high rates before the Federal Reserve implements expected rate cuts. However, this option requires giving up liquidity, as funds cannot be withdrawn before the term ends without incurring a penalty, making it crucial to weigh against more flexible options like high-yield savings accounts.
