          <p>Shares of USA Rare Earth experienced a notable increase following CEO Barbara Humpton's confirmation of ongoing discussions with the Trump administration regarding the rare earth supply chain. These talks are part of a broader federal effort to bolster the domestic rare earth supply chain and lessen U.S. reliance on China for critical minerals. The administration has previously invested in other rare earth and lithium miners, underscoring its commitment to this strategic industry. Humpton highlighted that developing this marketplace will require many participants, as USA Rare Earth advances its mine in Texas and a magnet production facility in Oklahoma, contributing to national security and economic independence.</p>

          <p>Chinese investors are seeing substantial returns from gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with holdings valued at US$21 billion, as the precious metal experiences a significant rally. Major financial institutions like Julius Baer, Lombard Odier, and JPMorgan Private Bank forecast continued price appreciation, with some predicting gold could reach US$4,000-$4,150 an ounce in the coming year. This upward trend is driven by gold's perceived value as a portfolio diversifier and a hedge against political and economic uncertainties, alongside robust central bank demand and worries about government debt. The article highlights how gold's strong performance contrasts with a declining US dollar, making it an attractive asset. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two Delta Air Lines planes, operated by its subsidiary Endeavor Air, experienced a low-speed collision on a taxiway at New York's LaGuardia Airport. Endeavor Air Flight 5047, arriving from Charlotte, struck the fuselage of Endeavor Flight 5155, which was preparing for departure to Roanoke. A flight attendant suffered a minor injury and received medical attention, but the incident did not disrupt overall airport operations. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are actively investigating the cause, with flight recorders already recovered for analysis.

          <p>The EAT-Lancet Commission has released a major update to its 2019 report, advocating for a "planetary health diet" rich in nuts, legumes, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, with significantly less meat and dairy. This article highlights the report's findings that such a diet could drastically reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and prevent up to 15 million premature deaths annually. Despite widespread scientific acceptance, the original report faced a "coordinated campaign" of misinformation, traced to the meat and dairy industry, which disparaged its findings as "dangerous, elitist, and anti-science." The commission is prepared to counter renewed misinformation, emphasizing that their recommendations are not prescriptive but aim for global health and environmental benefits.</p>

          <p>California has rolled out a newly redesigned driver's license and identification card, integrating advanced security features, notably a first-in-the-nation digital signature. The new aesthetic showcases iconic California imagery like redwoods, poppies, and the coastline, while maintaining the familiar REAL ID golden bear symbol. These enhancements are part of an ongoing effort to bolster security against counterfeiting, including the removal of the traditional magnetic strip and the addition of a digital signature to a barcode on the card's reverse. Existing licenses will remain valid until their expiration, ensuring a gradual transition for residents as the Department of Motor Vehicles regularly updates its documents to improve public safety and identification integrity.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has secured a significant deal with Pfizer, compelling the pharmaceutical giant to lower the prices of its drugs in the United States to match those charged in other developed countries. This article details President Trump's long-standing obsession with reducing drug costs, a goal that previously eluded his administration. Pfizer also agreed to participate in TrumpRx, a new website offering discounted drugs directly to consumers, though the immediate financial relief for patients remains unclear. The deal, spurred by the administration's threat of 100% tariffs on drugs not manufactured in the U.S., marks a collapse of the industry's united front against Trump's "America First" pricing policies.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>College rankings, now an ingrained feature of the higher education landscape, originated as a controversial and "shocking experiment," as this article thoroughly explains. Early attempts, such as Edwin Embree's 1934 informal list and Kendric Babcock's 1911 study, were met with intense backlash and even suppression due to the contentious nature of categorizing institutional quality. The article traces the evolution of these lists from mere curiosities to a powerful "map of the American meritocracy" by the 1980s, fueled by growing consumer demand and institutional anxieties. It highlights how rankings, initially influenced by societal prejudices, have profoundly shaped public perception and continue to influence university strategies and operations today.</p>

          <p>This essay delves into Lucumí, also known as Santería, an Afro-Caribbean spirituality rooted in Yoruba cosmology that emerged as a means of survival for enslaved Africans in Cuba. The article highlights how practitioners, like Francisco Álvarez León, find grounding and connection through its emphasis on character, balance, and connection to divine orishas. Scholars are actively working to destigmatize Lucumí, which is often misunderstood and demonized as "witchcraft" due to anti-Black beliefs and its resistance to white supremacy. It explains how early rituals, adapted from forced Catholic gatherings, became spaces for reconnection and reimagination, underscoring the religion's core values of protection, healing, and community survival.</p>
