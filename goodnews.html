        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bank of America is preparing to release its second-quarter earnings, with Wall Street analysts closely monitoring key financial metrics. Projections from LSEG and StreetAccount anticipate earnings of 86 cents per share on revenue of $26.72 billion. The bank is expected to have benefited from an increase in net interest income and robust trading revenues, potentially signaling a positive trend for the latter half of the year. While the company previously guided for a decline in investment banking fees, strong performance from competitors like JPMorgan Chase suggests a possibility for an upside surprise.

          <p>Alternative asset manager Blackstone is significantly increasing its investment in the U.S. rental housing market, acquiring brands like Tricon Residential and AIR Communities. The company's strategy focuses on markets with strong job and population growth, particularly in Sun Belt states, and includes apartments, student housing, and single-family homes. Blackstone states it owns less than 1% of the nation's rental homes, but its real estate income trust (BREIT) holds an interest in nearly 275,000 units. Analysts suggest that with construction costs high, buying existing properties is a strategic move that could support rent growth and benefit the firm in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A church deacon in Wayne, Michigan, is being praised as a hero for preventing a mass shooting by ramming a rifle-wielding attacker with his pickup truck. Richard Pryor saw the armed man advancing on the CrossPointe Community Church and decided to intervene, striking the shooter despite his truck being hit by gunfire. This action gave the church's armed security team time to respond and fatally shoot the assailant, who had already wounded one person. Over 100 congregants, including children, were inside at the time, and officials credit Pryor's quick thinking with preventing a far greater tragedy.</p>

          <p>A new messaging app called Bitchat, developed with backing from Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, allows users to communicate without an internet connection. The app functions by creating a decentralized mesh network using Bluetooth, connecting nearby devices directly to send and receive messages. It is designed with privacy as a priority, featuring disappearing messages by default and not requiring personal identifiers like a phone number or email. Currently in its early testing phase on iOS, Bitchat aims to solve connectivity issues in areas with poor service or government restrictions, offering a potential model for more autonomous and private communication.</p>

          <h2>Even Healthy Brains Experience Age-Related Decline, But Lifestyle Changes Can Help</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cognitive functions such as memory and reaction time naturally begin to decline after age 40, even in healthy individuals. However, researchers are studying "exceptional performers" whose brains function like those of people 30 years younger to understand how to mitigate this decline. Early findings from projects like MindCrowd emphasize the importance of non-genetic factors, including high-quality sleep, cardiovascular health, regular exercise, and avoiding smoking. Experts stress that managing vascular risk factors like blood pressure and cholesterol can result in a younger-looking brain, suggesting that proactive lifestyle choices can significantly preserve cognitive function in later life.</p>

          <p>A 3-year-old pit bull named Chuco, who was separated from his owner during an ICE raid in Barstow, has been found at the Baldwin Park animal shelter in Los Angeles County. The dog's owner was deported, and the dog was later taken to a shelter by a landlord, sparking fears among animal advocates that he might be euthanized due to overcrowding. Volunteers successfully located him, offering a chance for adoption. The case highlights the growing issue of pets being left behind due to immigration enforcement and the severe overcrowding crisis facing local animal shelters.</p>

          <p>The 2026 race for California governor is in a state of suspended animation as candidates and donors await a decision from former Vice President Kamala Harris on whether she will run. Since losing the presidential election, Harris's potential candidacy has caused uncertainty, with several prominent Democrats trying to plan their campaigns without knowing if they will face her. While some candidates like Antonio Villaraigosa and Xavier Becerra have pledged to stay in the race regardless, many major donors are holding back contributions. Harris is expected to announce her decision by the end of summer, which will significantly reshape the political landscape.</p>

          <p>Chip maker Nvidia has become the world's first publicly traded company to achieve a $4 trillion market capitalization, driven by the global boom in artificial intelligence. The company's value surged further after receiving U.S. government approval to sell some of its AI chips in China. Originally known for gaming graphics cards, Nvidia's powerful processors are now essential for AI applications like ChatGPT and self-driving cars, making it a dominant force in the industry. While facing challenges from geopolitical trade tensions and growing competition, analysts believe Nvidia's significant lead in the foundational AI infrastructure positions it for continued growth.

          <p>Germany is examining how to encourage more young people to start businesses, as studies show significant untapped entrepreneurial potential. While 40% of Germans aged 14-25 express interest in entrepreneurship, only 11% actually do so, a rate far below that of other developed nations. Key barriers identified include financial insecurity, lack of networks, and limited access to capital. Researchers and young founders, like the creators of the successful education app Knowunity, suggest that providing basic income security in the initial phase, mentorship, and better integrating entrepreneurship into school curricula could help unlock this potential.</p>

          <p>U.S. law enforcement officials have seized over $10 million in cryptocurrency connected to Mexico's Sinaloa cartel as part of a nationwide operation targeting drug trafficking. The announcement from the Justice Department on Tuesday detailed that the crypto seizure was part of broader raids since January that also netted 44 million fentanyl pills and thousands of pounds of fentanyl powder and methamphetamine. This financial blow to the cartel comes shortly after Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of kingpin 'El Chapo,' pleaded guilty to drug charges in a U.S. court, signaling continued pressure on the powerful criminal organization.</p>

Furthermore, a rebound in investment banking activities like mergers and debt issuance, as seen with rivals, is also projected to contribute positively. The recovery in stock prices is also expected to bolster the firm's asset and wealth management division, setting the stage for potentially outsized returns. (not investment advice)</p>
