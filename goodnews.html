          <p>The former Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania may restart in 2027, a year earlier than initially projected.  This expedited timeline is due to a power purchase agreement with Microsoft for its data centers.  The restart reflects the growing interest in nuclear power to meet increasing energy demands, particularly from the technology sector.  The project's success is not guaranteed, given the history of delays and cost overruns in similar projects.</p>
