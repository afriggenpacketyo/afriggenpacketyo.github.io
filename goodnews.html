          <p>The UK government has announced a £500 million plan to establish "Best Start" family hubs in every local authority in England by April 2026. These hubs are designed to provide a wide range of services, including midwifery support, parenting advice, youth clubs, and debt counseling, to support families in disadvantaged areas. The initiative builds upon previous models like "Sure Start" centres, with the current government pledging to expand the program to up to 1,000 hubs by the end of 2028.</p>

          <p>The 18-year-old case of Jennifer Kesse, who vanished from her Orlando condo in 2006, is no longer considered cold after the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) obtained new DNA evidence. Her father, Drew Kesse, who has long pursued the investigation with his own team, credits new technology for the breakthrough. Investigators are re-examining security footage and witness accounts, including signs of a struggle on her car and a person of interest seen driving it, which has renewed hope for answers in the long-unsolved disappearance.</p>

          <p>Boaters and rafting businesses are demanding that Southern California Edison leave more water in the Kern River, a popular whitewater destination. A protest involved participants carrying a raft for 16 miles alongside a section of the river that has been dewatered by diversions to the Kern River No. 3 hydropower plant. As Edison seeks to renew its federal license for the facility, advocates are pushing for new requirements to ensure sufficient flows for both recreation and the local tourism economy.</p>

          <p>This article explores the long-standing, two-way relationship between the Central Intelligence Agency and the entertainment industry. The CIA has historically relied on Hollywood talent, such as makeup artists and magicians, for operational support in missions like the "Argo" rescue in Iran. In turn, Hollywood productions often consult with the agency for accuracy, a collaboration that also serves as a powerful recruitment tool, inspiring individuals with creative and unconventional skills to consider a career in intelligence.</p>

          <p>A new gene therapy has successfully reversed a form of congenital deafness in a clinical trial, with some participants regaining significant hearing within weeks of a single injection. The therapy, detailed in Nature Medicine, delivers a healthy copy of the OTOF gene to the inner ear, which is crucial for transmitting sound signals to the brain. All 10 participants, including children and adults, showed marked improvement, with one seven-year-old girl recovering almost full hearing, offering profound hope for treating various genetic forms of deafness.</p>
