          <h2>China to Resume Seafood Imports from Japan</h2>

          <p>China has agreed to lift its two-year ban on seafood imports from Japan, which was imposed following the discharge of wastewater from the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The agreement was reached during a meeting in Beijing, with exports set to resume once China completes necessary procedures. The agreement is based on China's participation in water sampling missions as part of the International Atomic Energy Agency. This decision marks a significant step in normalizing trade relations between the two countries after a period of tension.</p>

          <p>Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Allen, Texas, has won the 100th Scripps National Spelling Bee, triumphing over eight other finalists to claim more than $50,000 in prizes. Zaki, who was last year's runner-up, secured the victory by correctly spelling '√©claircissement' in the final round. The competition was marked by late-round drama, with multiple finalists misspelling words before Zaki's winning moment. This year's bee celebrated its 100th anniversary, highlighting a long-standing tradition of academic excellence and linguistic skill.</p>

          <p>Japan has stated it will not purchase defense equipment from the United States in exchange for eased tariff measures, according to a minister's statement ahead of bilateral trade talks. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani emphasized that tariff negotiations and security issues are separate matters, with equipment purchases based on national security needs. This stance contrasts with earlier suggestions that defense purchases could help reduce the trade deficit and serve as a bargaining chip in tariff discussions. Japan's focus remains on strengthening its defense capabilities independently of trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>An Alaska man, Kell Morris, survived after being pinned facedown in an icy creek by a 700-pound boulder for three hours, sustaining only minor injuries. His wife, Jo Roop, held his head above water while waiting for rescuers, and a sled dog tourism company provided a helicopter to transport rescuers to the remote location. Firefighters used inflatable airbags to lift the boulder, and Morris was airlifted to a hospital. Morris attributes his survival to luck, his wife's quick thinking, and the assistance of the rescue team.</p>

          <p>The coastal rail service connecting Orange and San Diego counties is scheduled to resume on June 7 after nearly six weeks of repairs to reinforce tracks vulnerable to landslides and coastal erosion. Crews have placed thousands of tons of boulders along the rail line to stabilize potential runoff and are preparing to construct a 1,400-foot-long catchment. The California Coastal Commission approved the emergency construction after sections of the rail were deemed unstable. The Orange County Transportation Authority acknowledged the recurring interruptions to passenger rail service due to eroding bluffs.</p>

This AI system could strengthen Beijing‚Äôs position in international disarmament talks, although it also raises questions about the role of AI in managing weapons of mass destruction. The project faced challenges including training the AI with sensitive nuclear data and convincing military leaders of its security. So far, only the initial step of training the AI has been completed, with further progress pending.</p>
