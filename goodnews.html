          <p>Shanghai's high-end property market continues to thrive despite a national downturn, with wealthy buyers investing in luxury homes. One Central Park, a luxury development in the Huangpu district, sold all 64 units for 4 billion yuan. The project's year-to-date sales have exceeded 10.8 billion yuan, making it the first residential project in China to surpass 10 billion yuan in 2025. New home prices in Shanghai have risen, outpacing national averages, with premium projects selling out quickly on launch days.</p>

Visitors entering Yosemite between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. this holiday weekend will need a reservation, and park officials urge visitors to be patient and courteous to staff due to potential staffing shortages.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study in Scientific Reports reveals that a dog owner's work-related stress can transfer to their dog at home. The research found that when owners dwell on work problems, their pets show more signs of stress. The connection is driven by "work-related rumination," which spreads stress from humans to pets. Dogs are sensitive to their owners‚Äô moods and may become stressed due to changes in care routines, such as less patience or inconsistent walks and feeding schedules.</p>

The author suggests that China should adopt more aggressive measures to boost consumption to absorb its excess production.
