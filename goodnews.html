          <p>Serbian students, facing increasing pressure from authorities, have issued an ultimatum to the government, demanding snap elections and urging citizens to continue pushing for change. A major protest is scheduled for Saturday, a date of particular significance in Serbian history, as students demand political and criminal accountability for a tragic incident from the previous November. The government has intensified pressure on universities, withholding professors' salaries for the period of student blockades, while high school seniors face uncertainty regarding university entrance exams.

          <p>Thomas Robinson, also known as Tam O' Braan, has been sentenced to three-and-a-half years in jail for defrauding luxury hotels and stores by selling them tea falsely advertised as "Scottish-grown."

Trading as The Wee Tea Plantation, Robinson claimed his tea was grown in Scotland, but it was actually bought from a wholesaler in Oxford and resold at inflated prices. His elaborate scam, which spanned five years, involved fabricating stories about his background and embellishing the credentials of his tea.</p>

Trump announced that NATO allies have committed to increasing defense spending to 5% of their GDP, an agreement to be known as "The Hague Defense Commitment." This commitment is expected to add over $1 trillion a year toward common defense, which Trump hailed as a monumental win for the United States and for Europe, as it signifies a more equitable distribution of the financial burden.

The meeting occurred shortly after Israel and Iran agreed to a cease-fire following recent strikes, with the agreement coming after direct U.S. strikes on key Iranian nuclear facilities.

McGowan argues that using bland and boring words and phrases in an attempt to sound smart often confuses people and comes across as inauthentic. He suggests that individuals should avoid writing for the eye and instead write for the ear, using language that is more conversational and relatable. By avoiding jargon and focusing on clear, authentic communication, individuals can better connect with their audience and convey their message effectively.</p>

          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, State Rep. Zohran Mamdani declared victory over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who conceded earlier, despite no candidate reaching the 50% threshold needed for an outright win. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, led with 44% of the first-choice votes, while Cuomo had about 36%. The race will proceed to a ranked-choice count to determine the official winner, but Cuomo's campaign announced he was conceding the primary and considering an independent run in the general election. The results reflect Mamdani's momentum among younger voters and his focus on progressive economic policies.</p>
