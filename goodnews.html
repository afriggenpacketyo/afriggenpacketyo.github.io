          <p>Google introduced AI Mode, a new artificial intelligence feature designed to provide users with more detailed and tailored responses to search queries, at its annual Google I/O developer conference. CEO Sundar Pichai described AI Mode as a "total reimagining of Search" that will gradually roll out to all Google users. The technology summarizes information from multiple sources and presents it alongside links to relevant sites. While Google anticipates increased user satisfaction, concerns remain about potential inaccuracies and the impact on website traffic, given the possibility that AI-generated summaries may reduce the need to click on source links.

Lim's band, Chthonic, has used its music to raise awareness about Taiwan's struggles for international recognition. Some legislators have expressed concerns about Lim's suitability for the position, given his lack of military service due to an anxiety disorder. (optimism_score: 70)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his administration's plan for a multilayered missile defense system, dubbed the "Golden Dome for America," which aims to protect the U.S. from foreign missile threats. The system would incorporate space-based sensors and interceptors to detect and destroy missiles before launch, during flight, and upon approach. China has criticized the plan, stating that it could lead to the militarization of space and a global arms race. The initiative, still in the conceptual stage, would involve multiple American defense and technology companies and could cost hundreds of billions of dollars. (optimism_score: 60)</p>
