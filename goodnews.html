          <p>Japan and the United States held a second round of tariff talks, with discussions centered on Japan's proposals to increase imports of American agricultural products. Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, aimed to narrow the scope of the talks and sought details about U.S. priorities. He was expected to urge the Trump administration to eliminate auto and other tariffs that have disrupted the global trading order. Akazawa offered a package of proposals, including increased purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans, to help counteract the decline of U.S. exports to China. Japan is also considering expanding tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mike Waltz is departing from his role as National Security Advisor, with President Trump planning to nominate him as the U.N. Ambassador. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as the interim National Security Advisor. The decision to nominate Waltz came after a last-minute decision by Trump, following scrutiny over Waltz's Signal chat incident. While Trump respects Waltz, factors such as inadequate vetting of NSC staff and a lack of fit with the senior team contributed to the change. Waltz will face Senate confirmation for the ambassador role, with potential challenges due to the Signal incident.</p>

          <p>Amid declining birth rates, more couples are choosing a life without children, influenced by factors such as high costs, climate change fears, and career priorities. Some couples value their relationships and personal freedom, while others question the societal expectation that parenthood is a destiny. The U.S. fertility rate is at record lows, prompting discussions about the reasons behind this trend. While some express confidence in their decision, others acknowledge occasional thoughts about the future and family dynamics.

          <p>Venmo is gaining momentum in the competitive peer-to-peer payments market while Cash App is facing challenges. PayPal, the parent company of Venmo, reported strong quarterly results, highlighting Venmo's revenue growth of 20%. This growth is attributed to increased adoption of features like the Venmo debit card, instant transfers, and integration into online checkout. In contrast, Block, the parent company of Cash App, experienced a stock plummet after missing revenue targets and issuing disappointing guidance. Venmo's success underscores its ability to monetize its user base and contribute to PayPal's broader e-commerce strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

The company's sales in China have declined amid fierce competition from domestic brands.

          <p>Santa Cruz implemented a 2-cents-per-ounce tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, defying a statewide ban on such taxes. The tax applies to nonalcoholic beverages with added sweeteners and 40 or more calories per 12 fluid ounces. Voters approved the measure in November, framing it as a battle against the American Beverage Assn. The tax aims to combat the dangers of sugary drinks, according to the American Heart Assn. The American Beverage Assn. decried the measure as an unfair burden on working families already struggling with high prices. The tax does not apply to certain beverages, such as those for medical use, infant drinks, and 100% natural juices.</p>
