          <p>Liverpool has finalized the acquisition of French striker Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt in a deal initially valued at £69 million, with potential add-ons increasing the total to £79 million. The 23-year-old has successfully completed his medical examination and agreed to personal terms with the club. Ekitike is scheduled to join his new team for their pre-season tour in Asia later this week. This high-profile transfer elevates Liverpool's total summer spending to over £250 million, following other significant signings.</p>

          <p>In a dual legal development, Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia was ordered to be released from criminal custody by a federal judge in Tennessee. Concurrently, another federal judge, Paula Xinis, issued an order barring immigration authorities from immediately detaining him for deportation upon his release. The ruling mandates a 72-hour notice period before any removal proceedings can begin, ensuring he has time to seek legal counsel. Abrego Garcia, who faces human smuggling charges to which he has pleaded not guilty, will be released under conditions set by a magistrate judge.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 climbed to a record high, buoyed by optimism surrounding international trade agreements, including a new deal between the U.S. and Japan. This positive market sentiment persisted despite a report that Meta Platforms may be shifting a custom chip contract from Broadcom to MediaTek, a development that Broadcom's stock eventually overcame. The market appears to be responding favorably to reduced tariff rates and foreign investment pledges, even as tariffs remain a feature of U.S. trade policy. Broadcom's long-term AI prospects are still viewed as strong despite the potential shift with Meta. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has unveiled a comprehensive AI Action Plan designed to ensure the United States wins the global race in artificial intelligence. The plan includes over 90 federal policy actions, such as supporting the construction of data centers and semiconductor plants, and modernizing the electric grid. It also aims to set guardrails on government contracts to prevent "ideological bias" in AI chatbots and compel federal agencies to remove regulations that hinder AI development. A key component involves establishing a program to export AI packages to U.S. allies to bolster international diplomacy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which includes a Japanese commitment to invest $550 billion in the United States. The agreement sets a 15% tariff on most Japanese imports, a reduction from the 25% rate previously threatened by the administration. The deal is also expected to open Japanese markets to U.S. products like cars and agricultural goods. This development comes as Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces political pressure at home, with reports suggesting the resolution of trade negotiations could influence his political future.</p>

          <p>The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) detected and tracked four Russian military aircraft, including two fighter jets and two strategic bombers, near the Alaskan coast. The planes entered the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), an area of international airspace monitored for national security, but did not enter U.S. or Canadian sovereign airspace. NORAD stated the aircraft were not considered a threat and that such activity occurs regularly. U.S. jets were dispatched to escort the Russian planes out of the area in a routine operation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners needing to borrow a large sum like $100,000, a home equity loan currently presents a more affordable option compared to a personal loan due to lower interest rates. With average home equity loan rates sitting around 8.3%, compared to an average personal loan rate of 12.65%, the potential savings are substantial. Over a 15-year term, for example, choosing a home equity loan could save a borrower over $47,000 in total interest charges. However, it's crucial to remember that home equity loans are secured by your property, adding a layer of risk not present with unsecured personal loans. (not investment advice)</p>

Revenue from its Wizards of the Coast and digital gaming segment, which includes popular titles like Magic: The Gathering and Monopoly Go!, grew by 16%. This success helped to offset a 16% decline in its consumer products segment, which has been negatively affected by tariffs and shifting retailer orders. The company reported a significant net loss primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge related to its toy business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that his administration is considering the elimination of capital gains taxes on profits from the sale of primary residences. Currently, profits exceeding $250,000 for single filers or $500,000 for married couples are subject to this tax. The proposal, which aligns with a bill introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, is intended to boost the housing market and provide relief to long-term homeowners, especially seniors in areas with high property value appreciation. Experts note the proposal could be costly and may face challenges in gaining broad congressional support. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union are reportedly close to finalizing a trade agreement that would impose a 15% tariff on most goods imported from the EU. This rate would be similar to the one in the recent U.S.-Japan deal but higher than the 10% baseline agreed upon with the UK. While some products like aircraft and medical devices may be exempt, the deal would be a blow to sectors like the German auto industry. In response to potential U.S. reluctance, the EU is also preparing retaliatory measures, threatening nearly €100 billion in tariffs on American imports.</p>

          <p>A debate is underway in Germany regarding the potential reintroduction of compulsory military service, with concerns being raised about its economic impact. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has proposed a selective service model to bolster the armed forces amid growing security threats in Europe. However, the Confederation of German Employers' Associations argues that taking young people out of the labor force for military service could harm the economy. Economists suggest the impact depends on the scale of conscription, noting that a smaller, selective draft would have a minimal effect compared to drafting an entire age group.</p>
