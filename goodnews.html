          <p>The Liberal Democrats are proposing a ¬£10,000 bonus for new army recruits after completing training and serving for two years, aiming to boost troop numbers amidst concerns over global instability. Former armed services personnel would receive ¬£20,000 for returning to serve two additional years. The party argues this scheme would increase the number of trained UK regular soldiers to 73,000, funded by an increase in the Digital Services Tax. Sir Ed Davey emphasized the need for Britain to be "war-ready" given threats from Russia and challenges posed by the United States, also suggesting public awareness campaigns to prepare households for potential conflicts or cyber-attacks. The starting salary for new recruits is ¬£26,334 a year.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian rights activist and Columbia University graduate, has reunited with his family after being detained by ICE for over three months. After his release from a Louisiana detention facility, Khalil arrived in New Jersey, accompanied by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. He vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights and criticized the administration's actions. Khalil's detention, part of a crackdown on pro-Palestinian activists, has been widely condemned, and he was released after a judge ruled that punishing someone over a civil immigration matter was unconstitutional.</p>
