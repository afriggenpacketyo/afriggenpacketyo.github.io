          <p>English golfer Tommy Fleetwood established a significant four-shot lead at the St. Jude Championship in Memphis before severe weather suspended the second round. After an opening round of 63, Fleetwood shot a six-under 64, bringing his total to 13 under par, with his only blemish being a bogey on the 18th hole. His strong performance positions him well for a potential first-ever PGA Tour victory. American Collin Morikawa and others are tied for second at nine under, while 21 players, including Justin Rose, were still on the course when lightning forced the suspension of play in the FedExCup playoff event.</p>

          <p>The city of Seoul has introduced "warm-hearted convenience stores" as an innovative initiative to combat rising social isolation and loneliness among its residents. These centers offer a welcoming, cafe-like atmosphere with free ramen noodles, massage chairs, and communal activities like movie days. The program has been surprisingly popular, attracting 20,000 visitors since March, far exceeding expectations. It targets a growing demographic of single-person households, including both the elderly and socially withdrawn young people, aiming to provide a low-stigma space for connection. The initiative reflects a broader government effort to address the societal challenges posed by rapid urbanization and changing family structures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new documentary "It’s Never Over, Jeff Buckley," directed by Amy Berg, provides an intimate and honest look at the life of the late musician, who died in 1997 at age 30. The film moves beyond the typical narrative of a doomed artist, instead focusing on his complex personality, creative process, and conflicting feelings about fame. Through archival footage and interviews with his mother, former bandmates, and romantic partners, the documentary paints a picture of a turbulent but gifted individual. It thoughtfully handles the circumstances of his death, presenting it as a tragic accident rather than a suicide, and successfully dimensionalizes the artist behind the iconic album "Grace."</p>

          <p>Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a landmark peace deal at the White House, formally ending nearly four decades of conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Hosted by President Donald Trump, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev praised the agreement as the start of a new chapter of peace. The deal includes establishing diplomatic relations and creating a transit corridor, to be named after Trump, connecting Azerbaijan with its Nakhchivan exclave through Armenian territory. This agreement marks a significant geopolitical shift, diminishing Russia's long-held influence in the South Caucasus region, with both leaders nominating Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the NASA astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97. Lovell is celebrated for his calm leadership during the 1970 flight, which suffered an in-flight explosion but returned its crew safely to Earth, becoming known as a "successful failure." He was also part of the historic Apollo 8 mission, the first to orbit the Moon, during which the crew captured the iconic "Earthrise" photograph. Lovell's life and courage, immortalized in the film "Apollo 13," inspired millions and demonstrated remarkable ingenuity under pressure, leaving a lasting legacy in space exploration.</p>

          <p>The recent death of Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell reduces the number of living astronauts who have traveled to the Moon to just five. This article reflects on the legacies of these pioneers, including Buzz Aldrin and the four surviving moonwalkers: Charles Duke, Harrison Schmitt, and David Scott. Their stories highlight the immense achievements and personal challenges associated with the Apollo program. As NASA's Artemis program aims to return humans to the lunar surface, the dwindling number of original Moon voyagers serves as a poignant reminder of a historic era in space exploration and the difficulties of venturing beyond Earth's orbit.</p>

          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe admitted he mistakenly identified a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as potential "illegal migrants" in a social media post. Lowe alerted authorities and demanded deportations before it was revealed the boat contained a crew rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for motor neurone disease research. The crew, which includes a former Royal Marine, found the incident hilarious. After learning the truth, Lowe apologized for the false alarm and pledged a £1,000 donation to their charity, while maintaining his stance on needing mass deportations for actual illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>Apple shares experienced their largest weekly gain in over five years, rising 13% and adding over $400 billion to its market capitalization. The surge followed CEO Tim Cook's appearance with President Donald Trump, where he announced plans to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts. During the meeting, Trump stated that Apple would be exempt from future tariffs on imported chips due to its increased investment in the U.S., easing investor fears about potential impacts on profitability. This positive news comes shortly after Apple reported strong quarterly earnings, with significant growth in both overall revenue and iPhone sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Home Prices Are Declining in Southern and Western US Cities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-08 16:41:27 EDT</div>

          <p>A new report from Realtor.com indicates that home prices are falling in some U.S. regions, particularly in the South and West, offering some relief in a tight housing market. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen the most significant drops from their 2022 peaks, with declines of nearly 15% and 19% respectively. This trend is attributed to higher housing inventory in these areas, partly due to a pandemic-era construction boom. Conversely, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to see rising prices and limited supply, with cities like Milwaukee experiencing a 26% price increase since 2022, creating a divided national housing landscape.
