          <p>Goldman Sachs reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst expectations, with earnings of $10.91 per share against a forecast of $9.53. The bank's revenue climbed 15% to $14.58 billion, largely driven by its trading operations, which generated $840 million more in revenue than anticipated. The equities trading division was particularly strong, seeing a 36% jump in revenue due to market volatility spurred by U.S. tariff policies. While the asset and wealth management division saw a slight decline, the overall strong performance reflects the bank's ability to capitalize on turbulent market conditions.

          <p>The European Commission has unveiled a proposal for a seven-year, €2 trillion budget that includes a substantial increase in defense and space funding to €131 billion. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated the budget addresses both current realities and future challenges, with about 35% allocated to climate and biodiversity projects. To fund the plan without increasing member state contributions, the EU is looking to five new revenue streams, including duties on tobacco and a levy on corporate profits. The proposal, which requires approval from the European Parliament and member states, has already faced criticism from some nations as being "too high." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump has emerged as a surprising advocate for Ukraine within the White House, according to President Donald Trump. He revealed that she has repeatedly pointed out the contradictions between his friendly calls with Vladimir Putin and Russia's subsequent missile attacks on Ukrainian cities. This revelation has led to a wave of praise on Ukrainian social media, where she has been dubbed "Agent Melania Trumpenko." The article suggests her perspective, shaped by her upbringing in the former Yugoslavia, may be influencing the President's tougher stance, which recently included setting a deadline for a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>A nurse in Scotland, Sandie Peggie, has been cleared of gross misconduct by NHS Fife following a complaint she made about sharing a changing room with a transgender doctor. Peggie was suspended last year after objecting to the colleague, a trans woman, using female facilities, and she faced allegations including misgendering. An internal hearing found insufficient evidence for misconduct, a decision that came as her separate employment tribunal against the health board resumed. The case highlights the ongoing and complex debate surrounding transgender rights and single-sex spaces in the UK.</p>

          <p>In a significant reversal, Republican senators have decided to protect the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (PEPFAR) from budget cuts. The move spares $400 million in funding for the globally recognized HIV/Aids program, which was initially targeted in a broader Republican effort to reduce government spending by $9 billion. The decision followed concerns from multiple senators in both parties about the impact of cutting a program credited with saving tens of millions of lives, particularly in Africa. The development was welcomed by public health experts who had warned of the devastating consequences of the proposed cuts.</p>

          <p>A man in Wisconsin, initially the prime suspect in his girlfriend's 2016 murder, was ultimately cleared by data from his Fitbit fitness tracker. Investigators arrested Doug Detrie after his girlfriend, Nicole Vander Heyden, was found dead, but the data from his device corroborated his story that he was home asleep. The information showed only minimal footsteps during the night, consistent with his account. This case was one of the first to prominently feature wearable technology as a key piece of evidence, demonstrating how personal tech can provide a powerful alibi and play a crucial role in criminal justice.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Gdańsk, Poland, have discovered the complete, well-preserved skeleton of a medieval knight buried beneath a limestone tombstone. The remarkable find was made at a site that was, until recently, home to a famous ice cream parlor that had operated there since 1962. Initial analysis suggests the knight, who was around 40 years old at his death, was buried in the 13th or 14th century. Researchers will conduct further analysis on the skeleton and the engraved tombstone to learn more about the individual and the historical context of his burial in the coastal city.</p>

A key factor was the bank's net interest income, which missed estimates, as growth in loans and deposits was offset by the impact of lower interest rates compared to the previous year. Despite the revenue miss, CEO Brian Moynihan pointed to the resilience of consumers and good momentum in the bank's markets businesses. (not investment advice)</p>
