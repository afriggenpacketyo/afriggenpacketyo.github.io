          <p>Figma, the design software developer previously targeted for acquisition by Adobe, has successfully priced its Initial Public Offering (IPO) at $33 per share, exceeding its anticipated range. The company's stock is set to debut on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "FIG," raising $1.2 billion primarily for existing stockholders. This move capitalizes on a gradually reopening tech IPO market, with Figma now valued at $19.3 billion after its $20 billion Adobe acquisition deal collapsed due to regulatory objections. The article highlights Figma's strong financial performance, with significant revenue growth and a shift towards profitability, indicating investor confidence in its market position.

          <p>The number of Americans filing for jobless benefits saw a modest increase last week, rising by 1,000 to 218,000 applications, which was less than analysts had forecast. This marks the first rise in seven weeks, yet layoffs continue to remain at historically low levels, indicating businesses are largely retaining staff despite economic uncertainties. The four-week average of claims, a less volatile measure, actually fell by 3,500 to 221,000, suggesting overall stability in the labor market. The total number of Americans collecting unemployment benefits remained unchanged at 1.95 million. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Homeowners seeking affordable borrowing options can leverage their home equity through Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) or home equity loans, which currently offer significantly lower interest rates than alternatives like personal loans or credit cards. As of July 31, 2025, average HELOC rates are 8.26%, while 5-year home equity loans average 8.25%, with rates expected to decline further with federal rate cuts.

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way to save money with competitive interest rates that can currently outpace inflation, providing a valuable option for investors. As of July 30, 2025, while national average CD yields are lower, top high-yield CDs offer rates significantly higher, with some 6-month and 1-year terms reaching 4.45% APY. The article advises looking at online banks for better rates due to lower overheads and considering a "CD laddering" strategy to capitalize on potentially higher short-term rates while saving long-term.

          <p>Ofcom, the UK's communications regulator, has launched formal investigations into four companies operating 34 pornographic websites for alleged non-compliance with new age verification requirements. These rules, part of the Online Safety Act, aim to prevent children from accessing harmful adult content. The targeted sites collectively attract over nine million monthly visitors. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle welcomed the probes, emphasizing the law's role in child safety, while acknowledging public backlash and a petition against the Act. Ofcom maintains the measures are crucial for making the internet safer, despite concerns about privacy and potential circumvention via VPNs.</p>

          <p>Hotel tycoon Surinder Arora's Arora Group has submitted an alternative proposal for Heathrow Airport's expansion, rivaling the airport owners' plan. The "Heathrow West" proposal suggests a shorter 2,800-meter third runway, which would avoid the costly and disruptive diversion of the M25 motorway, aiming for full operation by 2035 with a cost estimate under £25 billion. This marks the first time two competing bids for a third runway are on the table. While Arora emphasizes reduced risk and cost, environmental groups and local residents remain concerned about increased emissions, air pollution, and potential rehoming needs.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its diabetes drug Mounjaro showed heart health benefits in a late-stage trial, directly comparing favorably to its older treatment, Trulicity. Mounjaro met the study's primary goal by not being inferior to Trulicity in treating Type 2 diabetes patients with established cardiovascular disease, and also demonstrated a 16% lower all-cause mortality rate and greater kidney protection. Despite a slight dip in Eli Lilly's shares, clinicians view the results, particularly the mortality reduction, as clinically significant. The company plans to submit this data to regulators, potentially expanding Mounjaro's approval and further solidifying its market position.</p>

          <p>A new world record has been confirmed for the longest lightning flash ever identified, stretching 515 miles (829km) across the US Great Plains on October 22, 2017. This extraordinary event, documented using advanced space-based mapping from a geostationary operational environmental satellite, significantly surpasses the previous record. Scientists note that such long-distance flashes underscore the importance of seeking shelter during thunderstorms, as lightning can strike far from the parent storm. This scientific advancement in observation technology allows for a deeper understanding of extreme weather phenomena, pushing the boundaries of meteorological study.</p>
