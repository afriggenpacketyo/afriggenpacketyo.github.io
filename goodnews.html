          <p>The White House announced that a trade deal has been reached with China after two days of negotiations in Switzerland, although China has yet to confirm the agreement. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated that the deal would help resolve the national emergency caused by the trade deficit. However, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent offered a more tempered assessment, noting that "substantial progress" had been made but stopping short of touting a full deal. This follows President Trump's recent announcement of a trade deal with the United Kingdom.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is preparing to accept a luxury jet from the royal family of Qatar, which he will use as Air Force One.

This lavish gift is likely to raise questions from legal scholars and experts surrounding the legality of the move.</p>
