          <p>One of Big Bear's bald eaglets, Sunny, has taken its first flight from the nest, marking a significant milestone for the famed eagle parents, Jackie and Shadow. The eaglet jumped off a branch and flew away, while its sibling, Gizmo, remained in the nest. Experts anticipate Sunny will return to the nest soon, as young eagles often do after their initial flight. Both eaglets, determined to be female, will remain in the area for one to three months before venturing out on their own, and they will likely be in and out of the nest during this time.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily halting its plan to garnish Social Security benefits for individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. The Department of Education stated that this decision aims to protect Social Security recipients who rely on fixed incomes. This policy change provides older student borrowers with additional time to address their defaulted loans and avoid benefit reductions. The federal government possesses significant collection powers, including the ability to seize tax refunds, paychecks, and Social Security benefits to recover defaulted student loan debt.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has pardoned two south Florida shark divers, Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr., who were convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a giant grouper from a fisherman's longline in 2020. The divers believed the fishing line was illegal and reported the incident to state wildlife officials. Federal prosecutors charged them with theft, arguing the line belonged to a licensed fisherman. The pardons erase their felony convictions, restoring their rights to vote, own firearms, and travel freely outside the U.S.</p>
