          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that current negotiations for a peace deal between Israel and Hamas represent the closest the parties have come to securing the release of all hostages in Gaza. He outlined a two-phase plan, with the immediate focus on the logistical challenges of the hostage exchange, which he stressed must happen quickly. However, Rubio cautioned that numerous pitfalls remain, and the second phase—establishing a permanent, terror-free governance structure in Gaza—will be even more difficult to achieve. He emphasized that Hamas cannot be part of any long-term solution.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed actor Daniel Day-Lewis has clarified that he never intended to fully retire, but rather chose to step away from one type of work to focus on another, including making fiddles. He reveals his impulse to return to acting was largely inspired by his son, Ronan Day-Lewis, becoming a filmmaker. The two collaborated on Ronan's directorial debut, "Anemone," which the elder Day-Lewis co-wrote and stars in. In the interview, he also reflects on his immersive preparation methods and the difficult childhood experiences at boarding school that shaped his life's work.</p>

Danish striker Mikael Uhre scored the decisive goal, capping a remarkable season for the team under coach Bradley Carnell, who only took charge in January. This achievement marks a significant turnaround for the club, which failed to make the MLS Cup playoffs last season, and secures them the top seed entering the postseason.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force is actively developing and testing AI-piloted drones, such as the XQ-58, to fly alongside human pilots in combat scenarios at Eglin Air Force Base. This "Top Gun AI" initiative aims to leverage artificial intelligence for complex tasks, rapid data processing, and taking on high-risk missions, potentially revolutionizing air combat tactics. The program is viewed as a necessary response to the growing military capabilities of adversaries like China, with plans to eventually deploy up to 1,000 such aircraft.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples research argues that the number one cause of fights is not money or sex, but rather the tone of voice used during conversations. The article explains that nonverbal cues like a sigh, an eye-roll, or a sharp edge can make simple statements feel like accusations, carrying more emotional weight than the words themselves. To de-escalate tension, the author suggests practical communication strategies for both partners, such as self-correction, direct requests for a calmer tone, and using "reset phrases" to interrupt a negative cycle.</p>

This straightforward, no-cost rule is aimed at protecting sleep, which she describes as absolutely crucial for the physical and mental health of developing brains. Lack of sleep is linked to numerous negative outcomes, from depression to illness, and removing devices can help ensure kids get the rest they need for cognitive development and emotional regulation.</p>

          <p>A JPMorgan report advises Americans to move away from the arbitrary $1 million retirement savings goal, suggesting more realistic targets based on an income-replacement model. For a household earning $90,000 annually, a target of $700,000 would likely be sufficient to maintain their lifestyle, relying partly on Social Security benefits. However, the analysis notes that households earning over $125,000 would probably need a seven-figure sum, and it cautions that potential future cuts to Social Security could require all savers to aim higher.
