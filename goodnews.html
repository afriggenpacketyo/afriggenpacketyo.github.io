          <p>The Supreme Court ruled 7-2 against the Trump administration, granting a request from Venezuelan nationals to block their removal from the United States under the Alien Enemies Act. The court stated that the Trump administration had not provided the detainees enough time or resources to challenge their deportations. The ruling bars the removal of the men, alleged to be members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, pending a new decision from a lower federal appellate court. The court acknowledged the Venezuelans' interests are "particularly weighty."</p>

Slaton recounted how she survived on wild leeks and snowmelt and had to splint her leg after a fall. She was able to use her GPS to find directions to a Starbucks, but the route was blocked by an avalanche. The owner of Vermilion Valley Resort found her in a cabin, which she said saved her life after enduring the 13th heavy snowstorm.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's "big, beautiful" tax bill has stalled in the House of Representatives due to Republican infighting over budget cuts. The bill, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, failed to advance through the House budget committee. Key disagreements include the extent of budget cuts, particularly to Medicaid, and the proposed tripling of a local tax deduction. Some Republicans want steeper cuts to avoid increasing the national debt, while others oppose cuts to Medicaid, fearing it would harm lower-income constituents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new CDC study estimates that hundreds of lives could be saved annually through increased use of life jackets and better pool fencing. The study found that 51 drowning deaths could have been prevented by better pool fencing, and 297 could have been prevented by victims wearing a life jacket during boating accidents. The study was one of the last produced by some of the agency's injury prevention experts before they were eliminated by layoffs. This adds up to thousands of dollars in medical spending and an economic cost to the country of $4.5 billion.</p>

          <p>Man City boss Pep Guardiola has voiced his unhappiness with the scheduling of the Bournemouth game after the FA Cup final. Guardiola suggested his side have been chosen to play FA Cup semi-finals on a Saturday so often because broadcasters feel there are "more followers" for the Sunday game, adding, "They are tired to see us." It is why Guardiola thinks there should have been a greater willingness to nudge back City's game after the demands of a cup final.</p>
