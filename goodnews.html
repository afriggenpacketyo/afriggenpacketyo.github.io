          <p>Hollywood studios are increasingly shifting film production to the UK due to generous tax incentives, lower labor costs, and centralized national funding. This BBC article explores how the UK's Film Tax Relief, offering a 25% tax rebate, has attracted major US film studios and streaming giants, leading to a significant increase in UK production spending. Blockbusters like 'Jurassic World: Dominion' have saved millions by filming in the UK, while cities like Glasgow and Liverpool have served as stand-ins for American locations. The article also touches on potential impacts of proposed US tariffs on foreign-made films, highlighting the complex interplay of economics and culture in the film industry.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 that failed to reach Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. This New York Times article explains that the spacecraft has been adrift in space for 53 years and is now spiraling back towards Earth. While the exact location of re-entry is unknown, scientists predict it will occur between 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south latitude. The spacecraft is equipped with a heat shield, increasing the likelihood that some parts will survive the re-entry, but the risk of injuries on the ground is considered low.</p>
