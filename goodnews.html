          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump spent the second day of his visit to Scotland on the golf course at his Turnberry resort amidst showery weather. The visit, which includes a significant security operation, precedes high-stakes trade talks with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Trump is also scheduled to meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney to discuss trade tariffs and other international issues, including the conflict in Gaza. The trip will also see the official opening of a new golf course at his Aberdeenshire estate before he returns to Washington.</p>

          <h2>Massive Zirconium Discovery in China Could Impact Global Hypersonics and Tech Industries</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 06:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A super-large zirconium deposit has been discovered in a terrestrial basin in China, a first of its kind for the nation. Preliminary assessments estimate the deposit contains two million tonnes of zirconium dioxide, a quantity that would increase China's current total reserve of the mineral by fivefold. Zirconium alloys are critical for advanced technological applications due to their exceptional resistance to heat and corrosion. This discovery could have significant implications for China's strategic industries, particularly in the manufacturing of components for hypersonic vehicles like scramjet combustion chambers and nose cones.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread concern over President Trump's threatened tariffs, U.S. stock markets like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have recently surged to record highs, creating a puzzling economic picture. This resilience is attributed to a stronger-than-expected economy, a solid labor market, and corporate profits that have held up better than initially feared. Furthermore, some investors are operating on the belief that the president's ultimate actions on tariffs will be less severe than his initial threats. However, analysts caution that significant risks remain, as the full economic impact of existing and potential tariffs has not yet been realized. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's 'The Late Show' by Paramount-owned CBS, prominent comedians have pushed back, asserting their independence. Jon Stewart used 'The Daily Show' to deliver a blistering monologue against corporate self-censorship, while 'South Park' launched its new season with a sharp satire targeting President Trump, Christian nationalism, and Paramount itself. This wave of comedic defiance demonstrates that satirists can respond directly and immediately to perceived corporate or political pressure. Their actions highlight a powerful method of maintaining audience trust and showing they will not be intimidated by business or political interests.</p>

This marks a shift from previous dialogues held during the first Trump term, which often occurred in the negotiating countries themselves. The use of neutral European venues like Geneva, London, and now Stockholm suggests a move towards creating a more level playing field for the world's two largest economies as they attempt to de-escalate their trade war.

          <p>Captain Bruno Fernandes demonstrated his crucial value to Manchester United by scoring two goals in their 2-1 pre-season victory over West Ham in New Jersey. Despite the club's heavy investment in new attacking players, it was Fernandes who made the difference, converting a penalty in the fifth minute and adding a second goal from outside the box shortly after halftime. West Ham's Jarrod Bowen scored a consolation goal, but United held on for the win in their opening match of the Premier League Summer Series. The performance reaffirmed the Portuguese midfielder's importance to the team's offensive strategy ahead of the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing reforms to planning and licensing rules in England and Wales aimed at protecting pubs and music venues from noise complaints, which often threaten their existence. Under the new plan, developers building new properties near existing venues would be required to soundproof the buildings. The changes also aim to fast-track permissions for new businesses and promote al fresco dining to help reverse the steady decline of the pub industry. While Labour supports the move to reduce red tape, the Conservatives argue that the government's tax policies are the primary cause of the hospitality industry's struggles.</p>

          <p>Ghanaian President John Mahama has introduced a major policy initiative to create a "24-hour economy," aiming to transform the nation from an import-based economy to one of self-sufficiency. The plan involves key industries operating in three eight-hour shifts daily, a move projected to create 1.7 million new jobs and significantly boost GDP. However, the ambitious project faces significant hurdles, including the need for an estimated $4 billion in funding, which is a challenge given Ghana's existing debt. Economists and observers note that success will depend on securing private sector buy-in and addressing infrastructure deficits, such as the country's currently unstable power supply.</p>
