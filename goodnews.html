          <p>The Indiana Pacers defeated the New York Knicks 114-109 in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals, taking a 2-0 series lead. Pascal Siakam led the Pacers with a playoff career-high 39 points, supported by Myles Turner's 16 points and Tyrese Haliburton's near triple-double. Despite Jalen Brunson's 36 points and 11 assists for the Knicks, the Pacers' strong fourth-quarter performance and effective bench play secured the victory, marking their sixth consecutive playoff road win. The Knicks struggled with turnovers and defensive communication, facing a daunting task to reverse the series on the road.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England will establish specialist mental health crisis centers across the country to alleviate pressure on accident and emergency departments. These centers will be open to walk-in patients and referrals from GPs and police, staffed with specialists to treat individuals in acute mental distress. The goal is to provide appropriate care in a calm environment, avoiding long waits in A&E. While NHS England hails this as a pioneering model, critics emphasize the need for proper funding and rigorous testing before national rollout, citing concerns about separating physical and mental health problems.</p>

          <p>The European Union's trade chief has emphasized the need for a trade deal with the United States based on mutual respect rather than threats, following President Trump's suggestion of imposing 50% tariffs on EU goods. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic stated the EU's commitment to a deal beneficial to both sides. European governments have warned that higher tariffs would be detrimental, advocating for negotiations as the sustainable way forward. The EU remains one of Washington's largest trading partners, with significant goods exchanged annually.</p>

          <p>Businesses are increasingly using artificial intelligence to manage the impact of global trade turbulence and tariffs. Tech firms are deploying AI to visualize supply chains and understand how they are affected by reciprocal tariffs. Salesforce developed an AI agent that processes changes for 20,000 product categories in the U.S. customs system, enabling businesses to make faster decisions on adjustments to their global supply chains. While AI is a powerful tool, experts caution that it is not a silver bullet and its success depends on the quality of data it accesses.</p>

          <p>More and more young Japanese workers are "quiet quitting," prioritizing work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. A study found that 45% of Japanese workers admit to doing the bare minimum, with employees in their 20s being the most likely to adopt this approach. Many young people have seen their parents sacrifice their personal lives for their companies and are choosing a different path. They seek more "me time" and believe that their contribution is appropriate for the pay they receive, leading to a shift in attitudes toward work in Japan.</p>

          <h2>Japanese Supermarkets Offer Foreign Rice Amid Record High Prices</h2>

          <p>Supermarket operators in Japan are increasing sales of cheaper, foreign-grown rice to provide consumers with more affordable options amid rising prices and concerns about shortages. Aeon Co. will begin selling California-sourced rice on June 6, which is about 15 percent cheaper than the average price of Japanese-grown rice. Other retailers like Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co. have also seen solid demand for rice from California and Taiwan. The decision reflects consumer interest as prices of domestic rice have nearly doubled in the past year.</p>
