          <p>The ticket marketplace StubHub is proceeding with its initial public offering, aiming to raise up to $851 million with shares priced between $22 and $25. This move could value the company at as much as $9.2 billion. The IPO follows previous delays in 2024 and earlier in 2025 due to market volatility, but the company is now moving forward amid a recent rebound in the IPO market. StubHub, which plans to trade on the NYSE under the symbol "STUB," reported a 10% revenue growth in the first quarter but also a widening net loss. (not investment advice)</p>

The company's stock has seen a remarkable 210% increase year-to-date, recovering from a 2022 downturn and reflecting strong market performance since its 2021 IPO.

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has outlined a fast-tracked timeline to elect a new deputy leader following the departure of Angela Rayner, with a winner to be announced on October 25. Former deputy leader Baroness Harriet Harman has suggested the replacement should be a woman from outside London to complement Sir Keir Starmer's leadership and broaden the party's reach. The contest is seen by some as a pivotal moment to discuss the party's internal direction and balance, with several high-profile figures, including Dame Emily Thornberry, considering a bid for the position.</p>

          <p>A total lunar eclipse this week produced a spectacular "blood moon," visible to skywatchers across Asia, Australia, Europe, and Africa. This celestial phenomenon occurs when the Earth passes directly between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow on the lunar surface. The moon takes on a reddish hue because the only sunlight reaching it is filtered through Earth's atmosphere, which scatters blue light. Photos from around the globe captured the stunning event, which serves as a reminder of the awe-inspiring astronomical displays observable from our planet. The next total lunar eclipse will be visible in the Americas in March.</p>

The club has now accepted the regulations, which are designed to ensure that commercial and sponsorship deals with companies linked to club owners are set at fair market value, as valid and binding. The agreement concludes a dispute that began after a majority of top-flight clubs voted to approve amendments to the APT rules in November 2024, a move that Manchester City had initially opposed and legally contested.</p>

          <p>With high inflation and interest rates continuing to strain household finances, financial experts are advising consumers to adopt disciplined strategies to curb credit card spending. Key recommendations include creating a detailed seasonal budget, using debit or cash for everyday purchases to create emotional distance from spending, and removing saved card information from online shopping accounts to prevent impulse buys. Experts also suggest setting up transaction alerts and avoiding "buy now, pay later" services, which can obscure the true extent of one's debt. These habits are crucial for avoiding the accumulation of high-interest debt. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece depicts a judge in a wig and robe striking a protester on the ground, with blood splattering from the impact. The artist claimed the work through an Instagram post, his typical method of authentication. The mural's appearance, just days after mass arrests at a protest, is consistent with Banksy's history of creating politically charged and anti-establishment art.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a communication expert, the key to being highly likable is not about being overly agreeable but about consistently making others feel seen and valued. This is achieved through small, genuine habits such as remembering minor details about people, giving credit freely to others for their ideas, and responding to everyone regardless of their status. Other crucial habits include admitting when you are wrong, which builds trust, and making time for brief, informal conversations that humanize interactions. These behaviors signal warmth, attentiveness, and respect, fostering stronger personal and professional relationships.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team faces a key selection decision for their World Cup quarter-final against Scotland, as star full-back Ellie Kildunne is unavailable due to concussion symptoms. Head coach John Mitchell must choose between the less experienced specialist Emma Sing and the versatile, seasoned utility back Helena Rowland. While Sing offers strong goal-kicking, Rowland's polished performance off the bench against Australia and her experience in high-stakes matches may give her the edge. The decision is critical as the Red Roses enter the knockout stage of the tournament with no room for error.</p>

          <p>While artificial intelligence has caused some disruption, its overall impact on the broader labor market has been relatively small so far, according to an economist from the job site Indeed. Recent job market weakness is attributed more to general economic uncertainty than to the widespread adoption of AI technologies. Although some companies, particularly in the tech sector, have announced layoffs to pursue AI initiatives, these trends have not yet significantly affected other major industries. Experts suggest that employers may be more inclined to retrain existing workers with AI skills rather than implement mass replacements. (not investment advice)</p>

From Johnny Unitas to Patrick Mahomes, the quarterback has become a figure of national fascination, yet the qualities that define greatness remain mysterious even to those who achieve it. Despite the multi-million dollar industry dedicated to scouting and developing talent, predicting success is notoriously difficult.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to popular belief among service members, winning a large lottery jackpot like the Powerball does not result in an automatic discharge from the military. Enlistment contracts remain in effect regardless of a soldier's financial status, and while a voluntary separation can be requested, it is not guaranteed and depends on the needs of the service. Other common myths, such as specific sailors or guardsmen being instantly discharged after winning, are largely unfounded. Similarly, the idea that high-ranking officers need special secretary-level approval to leave is also incorrect, as their resignation or retirement follows standard, albeit more complex, procedures.</p>
