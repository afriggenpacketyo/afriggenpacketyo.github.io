          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced his decision to remove all 17 members of the CDC's vaccine advisory committee, the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP), to restore public trust in vaccine science. Kennedy emphasized the need for unbiased science and transparency in the committee's recommendations, stating that the committee will no longer function as a rubber stamp for industry profit agendas. The move comes after the Biden administration appointed all 17 sitting ACIP members, with 13 of those appointments occurring in 2024, which Kennedy believes necessitates a clean sweep to reestablish public confidence in vaccine science. Kennedy aims to prioritize public health and evidence-based medicine in the ACIP's future operations. The goal is to ensure the public trusts the recommendations made by health agencies regarding vaccines. </p>

          <p>The dream of homeownership is fading for many Americans as the percentage of housing sales to first-time homebuyers has significantly decreased, reflecting challenges such as high home prices, low inventory, and rising mortgage rates. The typical first-time purchaser is older than in the past, with an average age of 38, indicating that people are entering the market later in life due to financial constraints. Americans who are unable to buy their first homes miss out on the opportunity to build wealth through homeownership. Factors such as high rent costs, credit card debt, and student loan payments make it difficult for people to save for a down payment, further hindering their ability to enter the housing market. </p>

          <p>A New York judge has dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, his former co-star in 'It Ends With Us'. Lively had previously filed a lawsuit against Baldoni and his Wayfarer Studios, alleging sexual harassment on set and retaliation for bringing those complaints. Baldoni's suit claimed Lively stole the film from him and promoted a false narrative of sexual assault and a smear campaign. The judge ruled that Baldoni had not adequately alleged extortion or proved defamation, leading to the dismissal of the case, while allowing Baldoni to amend and refile allegations related to contract interference. </p>

          <h2>Topgolf Callaway Stock Surges After Director Buys $2 Million Worth of Shares</h2>

          <p>Topgolf Callaway Brands stock jumped nearly 15% after director Adebayo Ogunlesi purchased about $2.5 million worth of shares last week. The purchase by Ogunlesi, a founding partner and CEO of Global Infrastructure Partners, is seen as a vote of confidence in the company. This move comes after a difficult period for Topgolf Callaway, with shares down 6% in 2025 and more than 50% over the past year. Ogunlesi now serves on BlackRock's board after the acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners by BlackRock last year, and he also joined the OpenAI board in January. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Indian Coast Guard rescued crew members from a burning Singapore-flagged cargo ship, Wan Hai 503, approximately 144 kilometers off the coast of Kerala in southern India. The crew reported an explosion followed by a fire onboard, prompting them to abandon ship and take to life rafts. Four vessels were deployed to rescue the crew, but four crew members are still unaccounted for, and a search operation is underway. One of the rescued sailors is reported to have sustained serious injuries, while the cause of the explosion remains unclear. </p>
