          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a new $1.6 billion stake in the embattled health insurer UnitedHealth, a move that surprised markets due to the insurer's recent struggles. The investment, disclosed in a regulatory filing, aligns with Buffett's history of value investing in companies facing temporary difficulties. UnitedHealth's stock, which had been down nearly 50% for the year amid a Justice Department investigation and leadership changes, surged following the news. This acquisition was part of several recent portfolio adjustments by Berkshire, including new stakes in homebuilders and a reduction in its Apple holdings. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates have seen a significant decline, with the average 30-year fixed rate falling to 6.58%, a substantial drop from the near 8% peak in late 2023. This trend, driven by weakening economic data and its effect on 10-year Treasury yields, is creating favorable conditions for homeowners to refinance their loans. Experts suggest that individuals with mortgage rates above 6% or 7% could see considerable savings, though they should consider closing costs and how long they plan to stay in their homes. The decrease has already spurred an increase in refinance applications to their highest level in four weeks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has introduced mandatory safety regulations for lithium-ion power banks, requiring them to obtain a China Compulsory Certification (3C) to be produced, sold, or distributed in the country. This move follows a series of fire incidents linked to faulty products, which contributed to the downfall of a major power bank brand. While not an outright ban on uncertified devices already in circulation, their use on public transport, such as airplanes, is already prohibited. The new rule aims to enforce quality and safety standards in a market where they were previously not compulsory, addressing significant safety concerns.</p>

          <p>The CLEAR airport security program, which offers expedited identity verification using biometrics, is now available to international travelers from the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. This expansion allows citizens from these countries to apply for a CLEAR+ membership, giving them access to separate, faster security lanes at 59 U.S. airports. The service, which costs $209 per year, allows members to verify their identity with their eyes or fingers instead of manual document checks. This marks a significant expansion for the company, which plans to add more eligible countries later in the year.</p>

          <p>While California increasingly relies on high-tech solutions like AI-monitored cameras and satellites for early wildfire detection, Orange County is utilizing a decidedly low-tech approach: a volunteer-based fire watch program. During red flag warnings, over 300 trained volunteers are dispatched to high-risk areas to watch for ignitions and educate the public on fire prevention. This human-centric system is seen by some experts as a crucial and cost-effective strategy, particularly in coastal Southern California where human activity causes most fires. The program's value lies in its ability to prevent fires from starting, a capability that technology alone cannot replicate.</p>

          <p>The modern ambition to colonize Mars, championed by figures like Elon Musk, is rooted in a long history of cultural and scientific fascination with the Red Planet. This obsession gained significant momentum in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, largely due to a mistranslation of an Italian astronomer's observations, leading to a widespread belief in Martian-built canals. This "fake news" fueled a craze, with prominent figures like Nikola Tesla and Alexander Graham Bell convinced of intelligent Martian life. Though later disproven by space probes, this early enthusiasm inspired generations and helped lay the groundwork for today's space exploration efforts.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has formally requested that the prime minister appoint members of his party as peers to the House of Lords. In a letter to Sir Keir Starmer, Farage argued that the current composition of the upper chamber is a "democratic disparity," as his party has no representation despite significant electoral support. He pointed out that other parties with fewer MPs and votes have peers, while Reform UK, with four MPs and millions of votes, does not. A Downing Street spokesperson responded that appointments follow established conventions, while critics noted Farage's previous calls to abolish the chamber.</p>

          <p>A research team from Tsinghua University in China has developed a new algorithm that promises to overcome a 40-year-old speed limit in computer science. The breakthrough addresses the "single-source shortest-paths" problem, which involves finding the most efficient route in a network. For decades, the standard method was limited by a necessary sorting step. The new approach, which won a Best Paper Award at a major symposium, bypasses this sorting process by focusing only on the shortest distances between the most critical points, significantly reducing calculation time and offering a more efficient solution to this fundamental challenge.</p>

          <p>In a recently detailed speech, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for the solid and swift implementation of policies designed to support the country's private sector. He vowed to guarantee a level playing field, protect entrepreneurs' legal rights, and solve persistent challenges like overdue payments from government entities. Xi stressed that policies from the party's Central Committee must be carried out "without ambiguity, delay, or compromise." This public show of support aims to reassure private businesses and address their reports of receiving limited tangible benefits from previous relief measures, signaling a push for more concrete and equitable assistance.</p>

          <p>Two easyJet airplanes were involved in a minor ground incident at Manchester Airport when their wings clipped each other while taxiing on the airfield. The collision prompted an immediate and brief suspension of operations at the airport while the aircraft were assessed. Officials confirmed that both planes were able to taxi back to a stand under their own power, and airport operations resumed after a few minutes. No injuries were reported among passengers or crew as a result of the incident. Authorities are investigating the circumstances that led to the collision.</p>

          <h2>Legal Experts Question if Trump Could Replicate DC Police Takeover in Other US Cities</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's federal takeover of the Washington D.C. police, questions have arisen about whether he could legally repeat this action in other cities he has criticized for crime. Legal experts suggest it would be far more difficult, as D.C.'s unique status as a federal district grants the president authority he does not have in states. State governors command their own National Guard units, and federal law, like the Posse Comitatus Act, generally prohibits the use of military for domestic law enforcement. While Trump has previously deployed federal agents to cities, his authority to do so is limited and faces legal challenges.</p>
