          <p>SpaceX has launched its 33rd cargo mission to the International Space Station, sending a Dragon capsule with over 2.5 tons of supplies, science equipment, and station hardware. The mission is also carrying a special add-on propulsion system, known as a boost kit, designed to help the station maintain its altitude, a task predominantly handled by Russian spacecraft. This capability is significant as it enhances NASA's operational control over the station's orbit. The cargo includes various scientific experiments, such as a 3D metal printer and a study on nerve regrowth, continuing the nearly 25 years of continuous human research aboard the orbiting laboratory.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle manufacturer Lucid Motors has signed a significant deal to supply at least 20,000 of its Gravity SUVs to Uber for a new luxury robotaxi service. The vehicles will be equipped with Level 4 self-driving systems from Nuro, with production expected to begin by late 2026. As part of the agreement, Uber will make a $300 million equity investment in Lucid, providing a welcome boost to the automaker's finances. This partnership is seen as a major opportunity for Lucid to increase its production volume and expose its high-end electric vehicle technology to a wider audience of potential customers.

Built on an old utility trailer over one month, the home includes essentials like heating and air conditioning, a tilting loft bed, a compact kitchen with a mini-fridge, and a portable toilet with an outdoor shower. The entire structure is powered by solar panels on the roof, making it completely off-grid capable. Kelly, who has stayed in the house during a snowstorm, sees it as a proof of concept that creative design can make even minimal square footage a functional living space.</p>

          <p>A recent concert by 90s R&B star Ginuwine at SeaWorld San Diego has drawn attention to the theme park's unexpectedly viral summer music series, which has featured artists like Soulja Boy and the Ying Yang Twins. The unusual pairing of nostalgic hip-hop and R&B acts with the family-oriented aquatic park has sparked confusion and amusement online. Despite the unconventional venue, Ginuwine's performance was reportedly a success, with the artist delivering a graceful and engaging show for a diverse audience. The concert series is seen by some as an attempt by SeaWorld to rebrand and attract new demographics following criticism from animal rights advocates.</p>

          <p>SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk in 2002, has grown from a fledgling startup to a dominant force valued at around $400 billion, making it critical to U.S. access to space. The company's success was significantly bolstered by crucial NASA contracts for cargo and astronaut transport to the International Space Station, which saved it from early bankruptcy. Today, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule are NASA's primary vehicles for these missions, and its Starlink satellite network is vital for global internet access and national security. The company's low-cost approach has revolutionized the industry, creating a new ecosystem of companies with access to space.</p>

          <p>A pair of coyotes, nicknamed Romeo and Juliet, have become established residents of New York's Central Park, fascinating local photographers and wildlife experts. Their presence is part of a broader trend of coyotes expanding eastward across North America and adapting to urban environments, with an estimated 20 living in New York City. While some residents fear the animals, scientists and advocates emphasize that they rarely attack humans and are adept at avoiding them. In response to their growing numbers, the city has launched initiatives to promote safe coexistence, encouraging people to observe the animals from a distance and keep pets leashed.</p>

          <p>A new type of uncrewed surface vessel (USV), or drone boat, has been spotted during a rehearsal for China's upcoming Victory Day military parade in Beijing. Images circulating online show a large, stealth-designed vessel with angled surfaces and a faceted hull, likely intended to reduce its radar and acoustic signatures. The boat, which is estimated to be over 15 meters long, was painted in Chinese navy camouflage and appeared to have a cockpit, suggesting it could also be operated by a crew. The appearance of this advanced USV indicates progress in China's development of autonomous naval capabilities.</p>

          <p>Despite trial data that initially underwhelmed investors, analysts believe Eli Lilly's oral obesity pill, orforglipron, remains a strong potential competitor to Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide. While Lilly's pill showed slightly less weight loss in trials, it holds key advantages: as a small-molecule drug, it is easier to manufacture at scale and does not require the dietary restrictions associated with Novo Nordisk's peptide-based medication. These factors could allow for a lower price point and better global supply, positioning orforglipron to capture a significant share of the lucrative market for convenient weight loss treatments, which is expected to reach $95 billion by 2030.</p>

          <p>A new meme, the "performative male," is trending on TikTok and has inspired public contests where young men imitate an archetype known for a curated, alternative aesthetic. This persona is characterized by tastes like matcha, feminist literature, and indie music, often seen as an attempt to appeal to progressive women. The trend humorously satirizes men who embody this "soft" intellectual style, but it also touches on a deeper skepticism about authenticity in modern dating. The term joins a lexicon of suspicious masculine figures, reflecting a broader cultural conversation about whether such gender presentations are genuine or merely a strategic performance.</p>

          <p>A first-time Tesla owner shared an honest one-year review, noting that while his savings on gasoline were a modest $334, the real financial benefit came from reduced maintenance costs. He contrasted the $1,432 spent on charging his EV with the tens of thousands he had spent on repairs for his previous gasoline-powered car over several years. After 15,000 miles, his only maintenance expense for the Tesla was $600 for two new tires. The owner concluded that the long-term savings from avoiding frequent and costly repairs on traditional combustion engines represent a significant advantage of electric vehicle ownership.</p>
