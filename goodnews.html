          <p>The UK government has successfully recovered nearly £500 million in fraud over the past year, with over a third related to pandemic-era schemes, utilizing a new artificial intelligence tool. This AI tool, named the Fraud Risk Assessment Accelerator, was developed by the Cabinet Office to identify weaknesses in policies and prevent exploitation, now set to be licensed internationally to countries like the US and Australia. While civil liberties campaigners have raised concerns about AI's potential for bias in government use, ministers highlight the significant savings will be reinvested into public services. The initiative aims to "fraud-proof" future policies and protect public funds from scammers.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has unveiled an ambitious $850 billion infrastructure expansion, partnering with Oracle, Nvidia, and SoftBank, to meet soaring AI demand. This massive buildout, equivalent to 17 nuclear plants, raises concerns about a potential bubble and the enormous electricity requirements, which Altman addresses by emphasizing the necessity for supercomputing facilities. Critics also point to a circular financing model among partners, yet Altman believes the long-term societal value of AI will be gigantic, acknowledging that investment cycles involve both gains and losses. OpenAI's strategy includes exploring new hardware devices and securing energy sources like nuclear power to fuel this unprecedented technological revolution.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered a stellar performance in his final regular-season pitching start, shutting out the Arizona Diamondbacks over six innings and showcasing a fastball topping 101.2 mph. This dominant outing signals his readiness for his first career postseason pitching appearance, successfully completing his recovery from a second Tommy John surgery. However, the Dodgers' bullpen tragically squandered a 4-0 lead, ultimately losing 5-4 in a walk-off, highlighting significant concerns about their relief pitching depth heading into the playoffs. The team now faces critical decisions on how to optimally deploy their $700-million superstar in the upcoming wild-card series.</p>

          <h2>Datong's Successful Flood Response Offers Lessons for China's Urban Resilience</h2>

          <p>Datong, a city in China's Shanxi province, successfully averted disaster during severe northern floods, largely thanks to infrastructure improvements initiated over 15 years ago by former mayor Geng Yanbo. His project to widen the city's main waterway and reinforce its banks, initially seen as wasteful, proved crucial in managing almost 20 hours of upstream flood discharges. This case study demonstrates the long-term value of investing in urban resilience and disaster prevention, which also serves as an economic stimulus. Beijing has recently allocated an additional 1 trillion yuan for similar reconstruction and prevention efforts, recognizing the importance of such foresight.</p>

          <p>Australia's national broadcaster, ABC, has been ordered to pay A$150,000 in penalties to presenter Antoinette Lattouf for unlawfully sacking her over a social media post about the war in Gaza. The Federal Court found ABC succumbed to lobbying from pro-Israel groups, dismissing Lattouf without proper cause or opportunity to defend herself. This decision follows an earlier A$70,000 damages award and highlights concerns over media independence and support for culturally diverse employees. The court emphasized the need for substantial penalties to ensure the ABC learns from its "unacceptable" conduct and prevents future appeasement of lobby groups.</p>

          <p>Democrat Adelita Grijalva has won a special election in Arizona's 7th Congressional District, securing the seat left vacant by her late father and further narrowing the Republican's already razor-thin House majority. Grijalva's victory was widely expected in the left-leaning, Hispanic-majority district, where Democrats enjoy a nearly two-to-one voter registration advantage. Her campaign centered on opposing President Trump's policies and advocating for the release of Jeffrey Epstein's files. This win reduces the GOP's House majority to 219-214, with two other Democratic-leaning seats still vacant, underscoring the dynamic and closely contested political landscape in the United States.</p>

          <p>USC's football team faces considerable uncertainty regarding the availability of key players, star wideout Ja’Kobi Lane and starting left tackle Elijah Paige, as they approach a critical stretch of their conference schedule. Lane, recovering from an upper body injury, returned to practice but his game-day status remains murky, with coach Lincoln Riley awaiting the official Big Ten availability report. Paige's early exit from a recent game necessitated a significant reshuffling of the offensive line, highlighting depth concerns. While these injuries could impact USC's performance, the team's offense impressively demonstrated resilience in their last outing, accumulating 517 yards without Lane.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a significant shift in his position on the war in Ukraine, stating that Kyiv can "win all of Ukraine back in its original form" with European and NATO support. This declaration, made on Truth Social after talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, contrasts with his previous suggestions that Ukraine might need to cede territory. Trump attributed his change of mind to a deeper understanding of the military and economic situation, calling Russia a "paper tiger." Zelenskyy hailed this as a "big shift" and a positive signal of continued US support, potentially including more weapons and air defenses.</p>

          <p>Health experts worldwide, including the European Medicines Agency, the UK's MHRA, and Australian medical authorities, have strongly rejected claims by President Trump and Robert F.

These international bodies, along with the WHO, state there is "no new evidence" or "no causal link" supported by robust scientific data. They reaffirm that paracetamol remains a safe and important option for pregnant women to treat pain or fever. Spanish Health Minister Mónica García specifically criticized Trump for spreading misinformation, urging reliance on health authorities.</p>
