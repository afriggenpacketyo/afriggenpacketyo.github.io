          <p>Tesla has awarded CEO Elon Musk a new pay package consisting of shares worth approximately $29 billion. This interim award is contingent on the outcome of a legal battle over his previous $56 billion compensation plan, which was voided by a Delaware court. The new award would be forfeited if the original, larger package is ultimately upheld. The move comes as Tesla faces challenges, including a recent weak earnings report and declining automotive revenue.</p>

Trump praised the company's new advertising campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney, calling it the "hottest ad out there." The endorsement reversed a recent slump in the company's stock, which had faced criticism that the campaign was out of touch. The company has been grappling with broader financial challenges, including slow sales and a volatile macroeconomic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

In one instance, NORAD aircraft fired flares to get the pilot's attention before safely escorting the plane out of the area.

          <p>The European Union has announced a six-month suspension of its planned retaliatory tariffs against the United States, which were scheduled to take effect this week. The decision is intended to allow for further trade negotiations following a recent agreement between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump. The move is seen as a concession aimed at de-escalating trade tensions and restoring stability for businesses. The original deal involved new U.S. tariffs on European goods and commitments from the EU to purchase more U.S. energy.</p>

          <p>Experts are forecasting that interest rates for certificates of deposit (CDs) will likely remain stable through August, following the Federal Reserve's decision to hold its key rate steady. While an uptick in inflation has created uncertainty about future rate cuts, some banks have already begun slightly lowering their CD rates in anticipation of cuts later in the year. Financial advisors suggest that short-term CDs currently offer more competitive rates than long-term ones. Savers are encouraged to research different banks to find the best available rates before committing their funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers have identified a bacterial infection as the cause of a devastating disease that has killed over five billion sea stars along North America's Pacific coast since 2013. The study pinpoints the bacteria *Vibrio pectenicida* as the culprit behind the gruesome sea star wasting disease. The epidemic has severely impacted over 20 species, particularly the sunflower sea star, leading to ecological imbalances like the explosion of sea urchin populations and the destruction of kelp forests. This discovery provides hope for developing interventions to help restore the crucial sea star populations.</p>

          <h2>Complex Transfer Dynamics Emerge as Liverpool Targets Newcastle's Isak</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 10:56:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool is reportedly pursuing Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak, a move that could be financially facilitated by the potential sale of their own striker, Darwin Nunez, to the Saudi Pro League. An interesting wrinkle is that both Newcastle and Al-Hilal, the Saudi club interested in Nunez, are majority-owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF). This has raised questions about whether PIF would effectively be helping one of its clubs (Liverpool) acquire a star player from another (Newcastle). The interconnected ownership adds a complex layer to the negotiations.</p>

          <p>India has won the fifth Test against England in a dramatic and emotional finale at The Oval, securing a narrow six-run victory to level the series 2-2.

The match featured a heroic effort from England's Chris Woakes, who batted despite a dislocated shoulder. Ultimately, India's bowlers, led by Mohammed Siraj, held their nerve to clinch the win in one of the most intense Test matches in recent memory.</p>

The 26-year-old is set to finalize personal terms and undergo a medical to complete the transfer. Dewsbury-Hall had initially been hesitant to leave Chelsea, where he was part of a successful squad. However, Chelsea was open to the sale as they look to balance their finances after significant spending, including the initial £30 million they paid to acquire him from Leicester City in 2024.</p>

          <p>Millions of UK consumers who purchased a car using financing over the last 18 years could be eligible for compensation due to hidden commission charges. A recent Supreme Court ruling found that the failure by dealers to properly disclose these commissions could be deemed unfair and unlawful in certain cases. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is establishing a compensation scheme, with payments expected to begin in 2026. For now, consumers are advised to wait for the official scheme rather than using claims companies, and can write to their lender to gather information. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a defamation lawsuit filed by Devin Nunes, CEO of Trump Media, against NBCUniversal. The suit concerned comments made by MSNBC host Rachel Maddow in 2021 about Nunes's handling of a package from a suspected Russian agent. The judge ruled that Nunes failed to provide clear and convincing evidence that Maddow acted with "actual malice" or had a high degree of awareness that her statements were probably false. Nunes had claimed Maddow knowingly lied when she said he refused to turn the package over to the FBI.</p>
