          <p>In response to falling beef prices and strong competition from imports, the Chinese government has introduced a new plan to support its domestic cattle industry. The policy, announced by the nation's top economic planner, aims to increase local beef production and promote consumption by establishing a quality-grading system for domestic products. Officials noted that Chinese diets are often deficient in high-quality proteins, indicating significant potential for growth in consumption. The move is part of a broader strategy to strengthen key agricultural sectors and enhance the appeal of domestic farm goods against a backdrop of increasing foreign competition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. border agents have been directed to cease deportations under President Trump's asylum ban, following a federal appeals court order that partially limited the policy. The directive, reported by CBS News, instructs Customs and Border Protection officials to process migrants under existing U.S. immigration law rather than the sweeping ban. This development comes after the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the administration cannot use the ban to completely suspend humanitarian protections for asylum seekers. The original ban, which was challenged by the ACLU, is a central part of the Trump administration's broader crackdown on immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>

          <p>Australia will acquire 11 advanced Mogami-class frigates from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in a deal valued at approximately $6.5 billion. The agreement marks the largest defense-industry partnership ever between the two nations and is Japan's first major warship export since before World War II. Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles described the stealthy, next-generation vessels as the best capability for Australia's needs. This purchase is a key part of Australia's military restructuring aimed at developing long-range strike capabilities in response to China's military expansion in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) will pay $1.7 million to settle a lawsuit from 45 California counties alleging the company improperly disposed of hazardous materials. The lawsuit, stemming from a multi-year investigation, claimed that UPS discarded corrosive, ignitable, and toxic waste into regular trash bins, which were then sent to landfills not equipped to handle such materials. As part of the settlement, UPS has implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs across its California facilities. The company cooperated with the investigation and stated that environmental care and safety are its highest priorities.</p>

Barkley, who was among several high-profile sports figures invited, stated that he and his family decided it was in his best interest not to accept due to his busy schedule. The council is being reestablished as part of an executive order that also brought back the Presidential Fitness Test for schools. Barkley noted his respect for the office of the president and mentioned he has previously golfed with both Trump and former President Barack Obama.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged over 20% after President Trump endorsed the company's controversial advertising campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump praised the ad as the "HOTTEST" out there and encouraged his followers to support the brand. The campaign had previously drawn criticism from some who interpreted its wordplay on "genes" and "jeans" as aligning with white nationalist messaging, an accusation the company denies. The president's endorsement and the subsequent stock rally highlight the significant market impact of both social media controversy and political commentary.</p>

          <p>A hiker was rescued by a helicopter crew after falling 25 feet from the top of Big Falls in the San Bernardino Mountains and landing in a rocky pool below. The injured man's screams were heard by someone who called 911, prompting a rapid response from the San Bernardino County Fire and Sheriff's Departments. A paramedic was lowered to the victim, who was then secured in a rescue basket and hoisted to safety before being transported to a trauma center. Officials noted that falls are a common occurrence at the popular but dangerous location, where signs warning of the risks are often ignored by visitors.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 20:21:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society reveals a significant increase in early-stage colon cancer diagnoses among people aged 45-49, directly linked to a rise in screenings for this age group. Following recommendations to lower the screening age to 45, screening rates for this demographic jumped 62% between 2019 and 2023. This led to a sharp 12% annual increase in the incidence of early-stage colorectal cancer from 2019 to 2022. While researchers call the findings promising news for early detection, they caution that screening rates among younger adults remain suboptimal and inequitable across different insurance and education levels.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that the stock market's strong rebound on Monday was driven by the impressive earnings reports from the "Magnificent Seven" technology companies. After a downturn late last week fueled by a weak labor report, the major indexes surged, with Cramer attributing the resilience to the financial strength of Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, and Tesla. He highlighted flawless performance from Microsoft and strong results across Alphabet's divisions, suggesting these cash-rich, diversified tech giants are fundamentally sound. This performance has seemingly overshadowed broader economic concerns, such as potential Federal Reserve actions or political turmoil. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New, stricter gun licensing laws have taken effect in the United Kingdom, bringing a sense of hope to campaigners like Emma Ambler, whose twin sister and two nieces were murdered in 2020 with a legally held weapon. The updated regulations require two character references for shotgun certificate applications and mandate that police investigate domestic abuse signs and an applicant's history of dishonesty. These changes were prompted by several high-profile shootings and are intended to prevent unsuitable individuals from accessing firearms. Ambler has been a prominent advocate for these reforms, stating the changes represent a meaningful step towards preventing similar tragedies.</p>

Bonta claimed a return of over $33,000 for every dollar spent, with the majority of savings coming from a successful lawsuit that blocked an attempt to freeze federal funding. The state has filed 37 lawsuits against the administration on issues ranging from healthcare and education funding to environmental regulations and voting rights. Governor Gavin Newsom affirmed his support, promising Bonta would have all necessary resources to continue the legal fights. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Chinese province of Hainan is positioning itself to attract more medical tourists, following South Korea's decision to eliminate value-added tax refunds for cosmetic surgery for foreigners. Hainan's government has released a plan to draw over 1.5 million domestic medical tourists annually by 2027, a significant increase from the current 400,000. The strategy also includes approving new medical products for the domestic market and introducing at least 40 innovative international drugs and devices each year. This push aims to capture a larger share of the lucrative medical tourism market as a key regional competitor loses a significant financial incentive.</p>

          <p>New guidance for the UK's National Health Service recommends that patients coming off obesity drugs like Wegovy and Mounjaro receive structured support for at least a year to prevent weight regain. Health assessment body NICE issued the advice, warning that weight management is a long-term process and that patients often regain a significant portion of lost weight after stopping treatment. The guidance encourages a focus on building sustainable behavioral habits, self-monitoring, and utilizing support systems. An estimated 1.5 million people in the UK are on these weight loss jabs, which are prescribed alongside diet and exercise programs.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order creating a White House task force to oversee preparations for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The task force will focus on critical areas such as security, transportation, and visa processing for the global event. This initiative follows the passage of legislation that secured $1 billion in federal funding for the Games' security and planning. The move is seen as a key step in coordinating the massive logistical and security efforts required, though it is unclear how it will affect ongoing negotiations between the city of Los Angeles and the LA28 organizing committee over service costs.</p>
