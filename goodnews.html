          <p>Meta is expanding its artificial intelligence offerings by launching 'Business AI,' a digital assistant designed for companies to use on their own websites and across Meta's platforms. The tool aims to provide customers with personalized product recommendations and streamline purchasing through chat interactions. While the assistant will be free for businesses to integrate into their Meta ads, there will be a fee for its use on external company websites, such as those powered by Shopify. This initiative represents a significant push by Meta to monetize its substantial investments in generative AI beyond its traditional advertising model.</p>

          <p>McLaren driver and current Formula 1 championship leader Oscar Piastri stated that his difficult weekend at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix taught him valuable lessons about risk management. Piastri crashed during practice, qualifying, and the main race in Baku, allowing his teammate Lando Norris and Red Bull's Max Verstappen to close the gap in the title race. Heading into the Singapore Grand Prix, Piastri emphasized that while the experience was a reminder of how quickly things can change, he does not plan to make revolutionary changes to his driving style. He believes focusing on the strategies that have worked well throughout the season is the key to maintaining his championship lead.</p>

          <h2>Researchers Claim 'Very Strong' Evidence Suggests Amelia Earhart's Plane Found in Pacific Lagoon</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from Purdue University is preparing an expedition to a remote Pacific island to investigate a submerged object they believe is Amelia Earhart's lost aircraft. The object, identified through satellite imagery in a lagoon on Nikumaroro island, has been visible in photos since 1938, a year after Earhart's disappearance. The theory posits that Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan landed on the island and were marooned. If the expedition successfully identifies the wreckage as Earhart's Electra 10E plane, the university hopes to recover it, fulfilling her original plan to return the aircraft to Purdue after her world flight.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's recent order to declassify records related to Amelia Earhart, the narrative surrounding her 1937 disappearance remains dominated by conspiracy theories rather than facts. This article argues that the most credible evidence points to a tragic but straightforward accident where Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan ran out of fuel and crashed into the Pacific. The enduring myths of her being a spy or being captured were largely fueled by her husband for financial gain and later repurposed for wartime propaganda and Cold War-era fears. The author contends that focusing on these fictions obscures her true legacy as a pioneering aviator and advocate for women.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has announced a deal to purchase OxyChem, the petrochemical division of Occidental Petroleum, for $9.7 billion in cash. This marks Berkshire's largest acquisition since 2022 and utilizes a portion of its massive cash reserves. Berkshire already holds a significant 28.2% stake in Occidental. Occidental's CEO, Vicki Hollub, stated that the proceeds from the sale will be used primarily to pay down debt, which will in turn allow the company to resume its stock buyback program. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Investors Should Overcome Low-Price Bias When Seeking High-Growth Stocks</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Investors often mistakenly believe that a low-priced stock has more potential for growth than a higher-priced one, a phenomenon known as 'low-price bias.' This article argues that focusing on a stock's nominal price is misguided and that underlying fundamentals and valuation are far more critical indicators of potential returns. Using the example of choosing between International Paper at under $40 and Nvidia at nearly $500 in late 2023, the article illustrates how the higher-priced growth stock delivered vastly superior returns. The key takeaway is that true value is determined by a company's growth outlook, not its share price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Unity Day, celebrated annually on October 3rd, commemorates the formal reunification of East and West Germany in 1990. The date was chosen over November 9th, the day the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, because the latter is also the anniversary of the tragic 1938 Nazi pogroms. While an official festival is hosted by a different federal state each year, the day is generally observed quietly by most Germans. Despite three decades of political unity, recent polls suggest a persistent divide in perceptions and economic conditions between the former East and West, indicating that the process of growing together is still ongoing.</p>

          <p>EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic has stated that a trade agreement aimed at reducing friction on agricultural goods between Britain and the European Union could be implemented in less than a year with sufficient political will. The deal, agreed upon in principle in May, is designed to reduce paperwork and border checks for plant and animal products. A representative from retailer Marks & Spencer highlighted the urgency of implementation, citing ongoing complexities and costs for its operations in Ireland post-Brexit. Sefcovic expressed confidence that negotiations could proceed quickly now that trust between the two sides has been rebuilt.</p>

          <p>Vlad Tenev, CEO of Robinhood, believes the tokenization of real-world assets like stocks and real estate is an inevitable 'freight train' that will transform the entire financial system. Speaking at a conference, he predicted that most major markets will establish a regulatory framework for tokenized assets within the next five years. Tenev highlighted Robinhood's offering of tokenized U.S. stocks in Europe as an early example of this trend, suggesting it will become the standard way for international investors to gain exposure to U.S. markets. He anticipates that traditional finance and cryptocurrency will eventually merge completely as the advantages of blockchain technology become more widely adopted.</p>

          <p>The legacy of primatologist Jane Goodall, who passed away at 91, extends beyond her groundbreaking research on chimpanzees to her unwavering advocacy for animal rights. Goodall used her scientific stature to challenge the ethical basis of humanity's treatment of animals, vocally opposing factory farming and invasive animal experimentation. Her stance often placed her at odds with the mainstream scientific community, which has historically been resistant to the animal rights movement. By aligning with groups like PETA and serving on the board of the Nonhuman Rights Project, Goodall translated her scientific findings on animal intelligence into a moral imperative for empathy and action.</p>

          <p>Tesla announced a 7% year-over-year increase in vehicle deliveries for the third quarter of 2025, with a total of 497,099 units. The rise in sales was likely boosted by U.S. buyers rushing to purchase vehicles before a key federal tax credit expired at the end of September. However, production for the quarter saw a slight decline compared to the previous year. The company's performance was hampered by a sales slump in Europe, attributed to competition and consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk. Tesla also reported significant growth in its energy storage business, deploying 12.5 GWh of its battery products.</p>

          <p>A Dutch F-35 stealth fighter has been seen with a new drone-shaped kill marking on its fuselage, commemorating a recent air-to-air engagement over NATO airspace. The jet was involved in shooting down multiple Russian one-way attack drones that had breached Polish airspace in September. This incident marked the first time a NATO aircraft has downed a Russian aircraft of any kind within the alliance's territory since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The event highlights the ongoing tensions and Russia's testing of NATO's air defense capabilities along its eastern flank, prompting increased military readiness in the region.</p>
