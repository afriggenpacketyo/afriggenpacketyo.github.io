          <p>Sovereignty secured victory over Journalism in the 157th Belmont Stakes at Saratoga Springs, New York, marking a repeat of the Kentucky Derby's top two finishers. Sovereignty, with 2-to-1 odds, is the first horse to win the Derby, skip the Preakness, and then win the Belmont; Junior Alvarado, Sovereignty's jockey, had previously faced a fine and suspension for his Derby performance. The Belmont took place at Saratoga Race Course due to renovations at Belmont Park, shortening the race to 1 1/4 miles. Journalism, the Preakness winner, finished second, making it the only horse to compete in all three Triple Crown races this year. The victory underscores Sovereignty's dominance in major horse racing events. </p>

          <p>Inconsistent baggage rules among budget airlines have led to passenger frustration and prompted the EU to consider standardizing carry-on sizes. The EU is proposing a guaranteed free personal item size for EU airlines, aiming to clarify existing regulations and reduce airport disputes. Consumer groups argue that the proposal doesn't go far enough, as it doesn't address charges for overhead cabin bags. The article highlights the ongoing debate between airlines seeking to maintain low fares and passengers seeking clearer, more consistent baggage policies. </p>

          <p>UK doctors are testing "poo pills," containing freeze-dried faeces from healthy donors, to combat superbug infections. The stool samples are packed with beneficial bacteria that can potentially replace drug-resistant superbugs in the gut. Early data suggests this approach could help tackle infections resistant to antibiotics, which cause numerous deaths annually. The focus is on the bowels, a significant reservoir of antibiotic resistance, and the pills aim to reduce superbugs to levels that don't cause problems. </p>
