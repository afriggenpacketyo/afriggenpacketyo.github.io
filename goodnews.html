        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House passed a tax bill that includes changes to the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), raising the cap to $40,000 for incomes under $500,000. This provision, enacted via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, previously had a $10,000 limit, and the new cap would phase out over $500,000. The SALT cap and income phaseout would increase annually by 1% from 2026 through 2033. The revised text would also reduce itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, which could reduce the benefit of the higher SALT cap.</p>

          <p>The Republican-led House narrowly passed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," advancing President Donald Trump's tax and immigration agenda after weeks of internal GOP conflict.

Trump celebrated the bill's passage, highlighting provisions such as "No Tax on Tips and No Tax on Overtime" and tax deductions for American-made vehicles.

          <p>A pause on tariffs on Chinese goods has led to increased import orders from Asia, but retailers are still concerned about potential shortages. The CNBC Supply Chain Survey indicates that while some stalled orders have resumed, they are insufficient to eliminate retail shortage risks. Retailers report that even with reduced tariffs, import taxes remain high, and some freight was abandoned due to costs. This could lead to lower inventory, fewer product selections, and higher prices for consumers, with uncertainty remaining in business decision-making.</p>

          <p>Republicans in the House passed President Donald Trump's tax bill, but it faces a complex path through the Senate. The bill includes amendments designed to win over both moderates and conservatives, such as moving up the timeline for Medicaid work requirements and increasing the cap on SALT deductions to $40,000 for taxpayers reporting less than $500,000 in income. Democrats are vehemently opposed to the bill's cuts to the social safety net, while analysts worry about the potential for exploding federal deficits and weaker long-term fiscal health.

          <p>Nike is set to increase prices on some trainers and clothing in the U.S. starting in June, following a similar warning from Adidas. The sportswear giant cited "price adjustments" as the reason, although U.S. tariffs on goods from Asia, where Nike manufactures most of its products, are a contributing factor. While the U.S. has paused higher "reciprocal" tariffs, a base levy of 10% remains in place. The price increases will primarily affect shoes costing over $100, with clothing and equipment also seeing price hikes.</p>

          <p>Amidst political transitions and trade tensions, Alberta, a conservative Western province, is considering a referendum on seceding from Canada. Premier Danielle Smith is seeking leverage to renegotiate Alberta's relationship with the federal government, primarily to unshackle the province's oil industry from climate change regulations. The move is driven by long-standing grievances over Alberta's place in Canada's federal system and its vast oil-and-gas resources. While the likelihood of secession is slim, the referendum push is angering Indigenous people and posing a challenge for new Prime Minister Mark Carney.</p>

The report has generated pushback from Republicans and the agriculture industry over concerns about the focus on agricultural chemicals.

          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally, reaching a new record high above $111,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership and corporate adoption. Positive momentum, optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers are contributing factors. Bitcoin's price rise is occurring despite a drop in U.S. equities, potentially indicating investors are looking for alternative stores of value. Pro-crypto policies from the Trump administration and the Senate's advancement of crypto legislation have also supported the market. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a bitcoin skeptic, has also said that the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A workplace expert argues that being good at small talk is an important skill for bosses to have. Employees value bosses who make them feel like they matter at work, which can be achieved through personal conversations. Employees feel like they matter when someone truly sees them, hears them, is there for them, and reminds them that they're needed. Meaningful interactions can build trust and improve workplace rapport.</p>

          <p>Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi is challenging Apple's iPhone with a new phone featuring an advanced chip and a lower price point.

Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun claims the company's new Xring O1 chip outperforms Apple's A18 Pro on several technical metrics, including heat management during gaming. Lei stated that this performance should not be seen as an attempt to pressure Apple but as an indicator of Xiaomi's efforts to develop a comparable processor.</p>
