          <p>The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency has officially identified the remains of U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Willis R. Hall, who was killed in action in Laos during the Vietnam War. Hall was one of 11 servicemen who died when their remote radio site on a mountain peak was attacked by commandos on March 11, 1968. His remains were discovered during joint recovery operations on the mountain earlier this year. Using anthropological and DNA analysis, scientists confirmed his identity, bringing closure to his family nearly six decades after his death. He is scheduled to be buried in Kansas this September.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has intensified its AI talent acquisition by hiring approximately two dozen employees from Google's DeepMind research lab in recent months. This includes high-profile figures like Amar Subramanya, a former vice president of engineering for Google's Gemini assistant, who has joined Microsoft AI. This trend of poaching top talent highlights the fierce competition among tech giants to dominate the artificial intelligence landscape. The new hires will join Microsoft's consumer AI division, led by DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, which focuses on developing the Copilot assistant and enhancing the Bing search engine amid a broader industry push for AI expertise.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As employees return to offices, companies are increasingly using anonymous body heat sensors to understand and optimize workspace utilization. Startups like Butlr, a spinoff from MIT Media Lab, provide technology that tracks occupancy, foot traffic, and interaction patterns without using cameras, thus ensuring privacy. This data helps businesses make informed decisions on office layouts, hybrid work schedules, energy consumption, and even lease negotiations. The trend is driven by a desire to make physical workspaces more productive, collaborative, and cost-effective, especially as the costs for office upgrades and retrofits continue to rise in the post-pandemic era.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has confirmed that high-level trade talks with China will continue in Stockholm next week, signaling a potential extension of the current pause on tariff hikes. Bessent will meet with his Chinese counterparts for a third round of discussions aimed at resolving the ongoing trade dispute between the world's two largest economies. Relations have shown signs of improvement since President Trump and President Xi Jinping spoke in June, with both sides reporting progress. The negotiations are critical as they work to avert a return to the triple-digit tariff levels that were imposed earlier in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Food Giants Capitalize on Surging Consumer Demand for High-Protein Products</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 12:18:55 EDT</div>

          <p>Major food companies like General Mills, PepsiCo, and Kraft Heinz are increasingly focusing on high-protein products to meet growing consumer demand. A recent survey found that 44% of U.S. consumers want to increase their protein intake, driving brands to launch new protein-fortified cereals, snacks, and even ice cream. Companies are also rebranding existing products to highlight their protein content. This trend is fueled by social media influencers, celebrity endorsements, and the rising use of new weight-loss drugs, whose users often seek out high-protein foods. This strategic shift reflects a significant and potentially lucrative change in American dietary habits.</p>

          <p>At the prestigious International Mathematical Olympiad, human students once again proved superior to artificial intelligence, with five young participants achieving perfect scores. However, for the first time, AI models from Google and OpenAI earned gold-medal level scores, solving five out of six complex problems. Google's Gemini and an experimental OpenAI model both scored 35 out of 42 points, a significant improvement from previous years. While humans still hold the top spots, the rapid advancement of AI's mathematical reasoning capabilities marks a major milestone. This progress suggests that the gap between human and machine problem-solving abilities is closing quickly.</p>

          <p>Students in the Los Angeles Unified School District have achieved record-high test scores in math and English, surpassing pre-pandemic levels for the first time. After two consecutive years of strong gains, the results are seen as solid evidence of successful instructional recovery efforts, according to Superintendent Alberto Carvalho. While significant achievement gaps persist for Black and Latino students, scores rose across all tested grades and demographic groups. Experts describe the gains as impressive, attributing the success to effective use of pandemic relief funds for tutoring, targeted support, and other academic initiatives in the nation's second-largest school system.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has conducted a significant reshuffle of her shadow cabinet, appointing former foreign and home secretary Sir James Cleverly as the new shadow housing secretary.

Other key changes include Kevin Hollinrake becoming the new Conservative Party chairman and Stuart Andrew moving to the health brief. The reshuffle aims to advance the party's policy renewal and present a unified front, though it comes at a time when the Conservatives are struggling in opinion polls eight months into Badenoch's leadership.</p>

          <p>A four-year-old child is recovering after being attacked by a mountain lion during a family hike in Washington's Olympic National Park. The child's father has been hailed as a hero for pulling the minor from the animal's jaws on a popular trail. Following the incident, the child was airlifted to a Seattle trauma center and has since been discharged. Park officials later located and euthanized the collared cougar responsible for the attack, stating there is no ongoing danger to visitors. Such attacks on humans are extremely rare, with only a few dozen documented in the state over the last century.</p>

One story focused on Brian Flynn, a man who became a rare double living organ donor by donating a kidney to a teacher's brother and later part of his liver to a four-year-old boy. The other highlighted Rachel Bee, a teenager diagnosed with Crohn's disease who used her experience in infusion centers to invent a special sweatshirt with zippered sleeves for patients. Bee has now turned her idea into a growing business, demonstrating how personal adversity can be transformed into a passion for helping others.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola has announced it will introduce a version of its classic soda made with cane sugar to the U.S. market later this year. The move comes just days after President Donald Trump posted on social media that he had spoken with the company about making the switch, stating that the cane sugar version, popular in Mexico, "is just better." While the U.S. version has used high-fructose corn syrup since the 1980s, the company said the new product will complement its existing line and reflect consumer interest in differentiated experiences. The announcement highlights an unusual intersection of presidential preference and corporate product strategy.</p>

          <h2>Explainer: Understanding Grace Periods for Credit Card Payments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 11:26:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies the concept of grace periods for credit card payments, which are often misunderstood by consumers. Most credit cards offer a grace period on new purchases, allowing cardholders to avoid interest if they pay their balance in full by the due date. However, this protection typically disappears if a balance is carried over from the previous month. Crucially, there is no legally required grace period for late payments; once the due date passes, cardholders risk immediate late fees, penalty APRs, and damage to their credit score. The article advises contacting the issuer immediately if a payment will be late to potentially mitigate these consequences. (not investment advice)</p>
