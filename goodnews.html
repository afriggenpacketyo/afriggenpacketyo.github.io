          <p>The NFL has officially approved Julia Koch's acquisition of a 10% stake in the New York Giants, establishing a record valuation for an NFL team sale at $10.3 billion. The league also sanctioned two other minority stake sales involving the New England Patriots and the San Francisco 49ers. These transactions reflect the soaring value of NFL franchises, driven by expectations of lucrative new media rights deals and the recent introduction of private equity investment into the league. The deals required approval from at least three-quarters of the league's owners.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 2025 NFL draft class is off to a historic start, with rookies setting records for total yards and touchdowns through the first seven weeks of the season. Offensive skill players in particular, such as receiver Emeka Egbuka and tight end Tyler Warren, are making an immediate impact, partly attributed to being better prepared for the professional level. The article highlights how some rookies are rejuvenating their teams, like quarterback Jaxson Dart with the New York Giants. While top picks like Cam Ward are still finding their footing, the overall performance of the class suggests a significant influx of ready-to-play talent.</p>

          <p>A council in south-west London has cancelled a £150 fine given to a woman for pouring the last of her coffee down a street drain. The woman explained she was trying to act responsibly by not spilling the liquid on the bus she was about to board. After the story gained significant media attention, Richmond-Upon-Thames Council reversed its decision, stating the contravention was "minor" and an appeal would likely have succeeded. The incident has sparked a public conversation about the clarity of local bylaws, as the woman and many others were unaware that pouring liquid into a gully was an offense.</p>

          <p>In a rare interview, basketball legend Michael Jordan revealed that he has not picked up a basketball in years and felt immense pressure when asked to shoot a single free throw for a homeowner's grandchildren. He admitted to being more nervous for that shot than he had been in years, due to the high expectations set by his legacy. Jordan explained that he now prioritizes spending his time with family, something he missed during his career. While he misses the competition of the game, he is content with his current life and his new role as a contributor for NBC's NBA coverage.</p>

          <p>GE Vernova's CEO, Scott Strazik, revealed he has been in discussions with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman about the immense power requirements needed to fuel the growth of artificial intelligence. The talks highlight the critical challenge of power scarcity for hyperscale data centers, which presents a significant business opportunity for energy infrastructure companies like GE Vernova. The company has seen a surge in orders from major tech firms, with electrical equipment orders from hyperscalers expected to nearly double this year compared to last. The collaboration underscores the foundational link between the energy sector and the future development of AI technology. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newly appointed Nottingham Forest manager Sean Dyche has stated that his primary focus is on securing wins, asserting that an effective playing style is more important than adhering to a particular football "fashion." His appointment follows the short, unsuccessful tenure of Ange Postecoglou, who was brought in to implement a more expansive, attacking approach. Dyche, whose direct style has been criticized in the past, argues that the goal is simply to play "effective football" to stabilize the club's situation. Forest is currently in the Premier League's relegation zone after a difficult start to the season.</p>

Bad Bunny has been an outspoken critic of Trump and his policies. The commissioner expressed confidence that the performance will be a "great show" and a "united moment" for the hundreds of millions of viewers.</p>

          <p>The National Hockey League has entered into a multi-year licensing deal with prediction markets Kalshi and Polymarket, marking a first for a major U.S. sports league. The agreement gives the platforms access to official NHL data and logos, while the league gains customer protections and brand exposure. Prediction markets, which allow users to trade on the outcomes of various events, are regulated by the CFTC but face pushback from some who view them as unregulated gambling. The NHL sees the partnership as an opportunity to engage a new audience beyond traditional sports betting.</p>

          <p>A coordinated police operation targeting suspected county lines drug networks has resulted in the arrest of eight people across Yorkshire, the North East, and Warwickshire. The raids, which were the culmination of extensive intelligence work, involved multiple police forces. Authorities seized over £100,000 in cash, along with quantities of class A and B drugs and mobile phones believed to be used in the supply chain. County lines networks are a major focus for UK law enforcement, as they often involve the exploitation of vulnerable individuals to transport and sell drugs from urban centers to more rural areas.</p>

          <p>SEC Chair Paul Atkins has stated that the agency remains vigilant in monitoring financial markets for manipulative behavior, even with most of its operations sidelined by the government shutdown. Atkins noted that the SEC can still deploy essential staff and has already halted trading on eight foreign companies showing signs of "ramp and dump" schemes. His comments came as the stock of Beyond Meat experienced a massive, unexplained surge in trading, characteristic of speculative meme-stock activity.

          <p>Australia secured a six-wicket victory over England in their Women's World Cup match, overcoming an early batting collapse to successfully chase down England's total of 244. After slipping to 68-4, a commanding 180-run partnership between Annabel Sutherland (98) and Ash Gardner (104) guided the defending champions to the win with more than nine overs remaining. For England, Tammy Beaumont top-scored with 78, but the middle order struggled to build momentum against a disciplined Australian bowling attack. The result served as another demonstration of Australia's formidable depth and resilience.</p>
