        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage demand from homebuyers has increased for the second consecutive week, driven by an increase in available houses for sale. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, total mortgage application volume rose by 1.1% compared to the previous week, although the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increased to 6.86%. Applications for home purchases rose by 2% for the week and were 18% higher than the previous year, indicating renewed interest despite economic uncertainty and concerns over tariffs. This increase in home inventory is supporting more transactions, particularly government purchase applications, which saw a significant gain.</p>

          <p>A recent resources deal between the U.S. and Ukraine is expected to pave the way for more "minerals for muscle" agreements, where minerals and geopolitics intersect. The agreement aims to strengthen economic ties, aid Ukraine's reconstruction, and establish the country as a strategic mineral supplier to the U.S. Experts suggest this deal could be the first of many, with potential agreements between the U.S. and countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, some analysts are skeptical about a widespread adoption of this model, citing resource nationalism as a countervailing trend. </p>

          <p>Senator Raphael Warnock has released a report criticizing Republican proposals to implement work requirements for Medicaid eligibility, arguing that these requirements would reduce healthcare coverage for hardworking Americans. Warnock contends that these rules, which he calls "work reporting requirements," do not incentivize work but rather create bureaucratic hurdles that prevent eligible individuals from accessing care. He argues that providing healthcare without such requirements would encourage people to work and strengthen the economy. A Republican House budget resolution includes substantial spending cuts to Medicaid, with work requirements among the eligibility policies being considered.</p>

          <p>Japan's health ministry plans to eliminate out-of-pocket payments for childbirth, potentially starting in April 2026, to address the country's declining birthrate. The proposed policy involves fully covering expenses for normal deliveries under the public medical insurance system. Currently, normal childbirth is not covered by insurance, leading to varying costs across prefectures. While the government provides a lump-sum payment of 500,000 yen, delivery costs often exceed this amount. This move aims to standardize costs nationwide but raises concerns among obstetricians about potential financial strain on medical institutions.</p>

          <p>Recent market volatility is causing concern for college savers who may have seen their 529 college savings plans diminish in value. Financial experts advise checking asset allocations and assessing risk appetite, with age-based portfolios typically becoming more conservative as college nears. While de-risking a portion of the portfolio into cash equivalents can provide protection, experts caution against shifting the entire balance to cash. Strategies include using income or savings outside the 529 to cover immediate expenses and reimbursing later, allowing more time for market recovery. (not investment advice)</p>
