          <p>Agatha Christie has been digitally resurrected to teach an online writing course for BBC Maestro, using AI to create her likeness based on her writings and archival interviews. This has stirred a debate about the ethics of using AI to recreate deceased figures, particularly regarding consent and the potential for misrepresentation. While Christie's family estate has approved the project and insists that only her own words will be used, some ethicists argue that it is still a form of deepfake, as Christie herself cannot consent to the course or its content. The article explores the balance between honoring an artist's legacy and the ethical implications of using AI to simulate their presence.</p>
