        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite inflation concerns, there are several ways to save money on your summer vacation this year. Flight and hotel costs are down compared to last year, presenting opportunities for deals. However, ride-share fares and entertainment expenses have increased, so setting a budget for dining out and activities is crucial to avoid overspending. Consider using credit card points and airline rewards to further reduce travel costs and remain flexible with travel dates and destinations to maximize savings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NFL's spring league meetings in Minnesota concluded with the "tush push," a signature play of the Philadelphia Eagles, remaining legal. A proposal by the Green Bay Packers to ban the play failed to reach the required 75% majority, with the Eagles and nine other teams voting against the ban. The "tush push," also known as "The Brotherly Shove," involves pushing the quarterback forward on short-yardage situations, and the Eagles have been exceptionally successful with it. The Packers argued for the ban citing player safety and pace of play, but the NFL has not reported any injuries related to the play.</p>

          <p>This review discusses Tash Aw's new novel, "The South," the first in a planned quartet following the Lim family. Set in 1997 Malaysia amidst the Asian financial crisis, the story centers on 16-year-old Jay Lim's holiday break spent on his mother's inherited land. The novel explores the growing affection between Jay and another boy, Chuan, while also examining the lives of other characters. Aw skillfully allows much to remain unknown, creating a nuanced and expansive narrative.</p>
          <p>70/100</p>
