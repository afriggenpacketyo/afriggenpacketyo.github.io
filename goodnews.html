          <p>Investment firm Carlyle is partnering with the Oracle Red Bull Racing Formula 1 team in a strategic move to increase brand awareness among high-net-worth and retail investors. The deal will feature Carlyle's branding on the team's cars, driver kits, and garage, reflecting a broader trend of private market firms leveraging popular sports to reach new audiences. As Formula 1's popularity soars, sponsorship revenue has become a significant income stream for teams, with financial services being the second-largest contributing sector. Carlyle aims to capitalize on this exposure to fuel growth in its wealth management division.</p>

          <p>Following Angela Rayner's resignation, the contest to become the next deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party is underway, with several prominent figures announcing their candidacy. Candidates include Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, who is seen as a unifying figure, and left-wing MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy, who is calling for a change in the party's direction. Other potential contenders like Lucy Powell and Emily Thornberry are also expected to join the race. Candidates have a short window to secure the necessary nominations from MPs before the decision is put to a vote of the party membership in October.</p>

          <p>Chinese state-owned Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC) has announced an aggressive expansion plan for Europe, targeting a 17-fold increase in electric car sales over the next two years. The company aims to sell at least 50,000 units annually by 2027, intensifying competition for established European automakers like BMW and Mercedes. This move is part of a broader trend of Chinese EV manufacturers, such as BYD and Xpeng, making significant inroads into the European market.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Michael Clune, author of the heroin addiction memoir "White Out," has written a new novel titled "Pan," which delves into the subjective and terrifying experience of adolescent panic attacks. The book's protagonist, Nicholas, navigates high school in the 1990s while besieged by anxiety that he comes to interpret not as a medical condition but as an encounter with the mischievous Greek god, Pan. The review praises Clune's uncanny ability to capture the visceral feeling of a panic attack, describing the novel as a blend of coming-of-age story and philosophical inquiry. It's a narrative that seeks to transform the horror of anxiety into a quest for higher meaning.</p>

          <p>Ethiopia has officially inaugurated the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), Africa's largest hydroelectric project, located on the Blue Nile. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed used the ceremony to insist the $5 billion dam is not a threat to downstream neighbors Egypt and Sudan, who have long feared for their water security. Abiy framed the dam, which was funded almost entirely by Ethiopia, as a monumental achievement for the country and a symbol of black empowerment. The project is central to Ethiopia's economic ambitions, aiming to significantly boost electricity production for domestic use and for export to neighboring countries.</p>

          <p>A 500-pound unexploded bomb from World War II was discovered during construction work in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, leading to widespread evacuations on Tuesday. The emergency measures affected several downtown blocks and required the shutdown of a major bridge and public transportation during rush hour. The bomb was found near the site of a former oil refinery that was a target for Allied bombing raids in 1944. The discovery of unexploded wartime ordnance remains a recurring issue across Europe, frequently necessitating large-scale public safety operations.</p>

Postecoglou, who was dismissed by Tottenham at the end of last season after winning the Europa League, was seen arriving at Forest's training ground.

          <p>While the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has fallen to its lowest level in nearly a year, it remains significantly higher than the historic lows seen during the pandemic. Financial experts advise that prospective homebuyers can take steps to secure a more favorable rate. Key strategies include improving one's credit score by paying bills on time and keeping debt low, as a higher FICO score directly translates to better loan terms. Additionally, providing a larger down payment and considering alternatives to a 30-year fixed loan, such as an adjustable-rate mortgage, can also result in significant savings.

          <p>In an interview, former Spelman College president Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses the surge in applications to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) during the Trump era. She attributes this trend to Black students seeking affirming communities "where their history isn't being erased," especially as political movements aim to restrict discussions on race and social justice. While this increased interest is a positive development for HBCUs, it also presents challenges, as many applicants require financial aid that these institutions, despite lower tuition, struggle to fully provide due to more limited resources.</p>
