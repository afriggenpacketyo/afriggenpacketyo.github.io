          <p>Germany is facing growing concern about societal polarization and the rise of the far-right AfD party, which the domestic intelligence service has classified as "confirmed right-wing extremist." The AfD has challenged this classification in court, leading to a suspension of its use. The article explores the debate on how to deal with the AfD, including the possibility of a ban, and examines the media's role in reporting on the party. It also discusses the need for politicians to counter the AfD's narrative with a successful model of democracy and to address issues such as migration and climate protection.</p>
