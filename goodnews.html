          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Zohran Mamdani, a state Assembly member, declared victory after a strong showing in the first round, leading former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who conceded earlier. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, gained momentum through social media and enthusiasm among younger voters, campaigning on a progressive, economy-focused platform. Cuomo, seeking a political comeback after resigning the governorship, conceded the primary but indicated he might consider an independent run in November. The race will proceed to a ranked-choice count since no candidate reached the 50% threshold, with comprehensive results expected on July 15. Optimism is high for Mamdani's supporters, but the general election remains uncertain with incumbent Mayor Eric Adams running as an independent. </p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang called for international collaboration on trade, cautioning against turning trade into a political or security issue amid rising tariffs and barriers. Speaking at the World Economic Forum's annual conference in China, Li emphasized that globalization is irreversible and that engaging in the international economy is a way of reshaping the rules and order. He urged countries to keep to the "right" path but did not comment specifically on U.S. trade tensions or the Israel-Iran conflict.

Despite progress on defense spending, Trump cast doubt on the U.S. commitment to NATO's mutual defense clause, though U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker sought to reassure allies.</p>

          <p>A Chinese-led study proposes creating an interconnected global solar-wind energy network to meet the world's energy demands by 2050. The study suggests that this network could produce three times the amount of power needed at a lower cost than independent regional systems. Researchers emphasize that such a system would need to navigate geopolitical boundaries and crises. Successful global interconnection could improve energy efficiency, ease the economic burden of decarbonization, and be resilient against conflict and climate extremes.</p>

          <p>Two young bears, Mish and Lucy, escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon wildlife park and consumed a week's supply of honey before falling asleep. The park reported that the bears posed no threat to the public, and visitors were escorted to a secure building as a precaution. The experienced keeping team used recall training to encourage the bears back into their enclosure without intervention. An investigation is underway to determine how the animals escaped, with the park acknowledging an "operational error."</p>

          <p>The UK's Climate Change Committee reports progress in the adoption of electric cars and heat pumps, but notes that these numbers need to increase further to meet climate goals. The committee emphasizes the need for the government to ensure that households benefit from the switch to cleaner technologies through lower bills. While electric car sales have nearly doubled in the past two years, heat pump sales remain below target. The committee also highlights the need to make electricity cheaper to incentivize the adoption of these technologies.</p>
