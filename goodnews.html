          <p>The NJ Transit strike has concluded after the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) approved a tentative agreement, ending a three-day work stoppage that impacted hundreds of thousands of commuters. Full train service is set to resume on Tuesday, May 20, following inspections of train cars and tracks. The agreement, described as fair and fiscally responsible, includes work rule concessions that will offset the cost of wage increases. The strike, which began due to disputes over pay and cost of living, had disrupted travel between New Jersey, New York City, and Philadelphia. </p>

          <p>A senior Asian economist suggests that China's yuan has the potential to compete with the U.S. dollar as a global currency if Beijing liberalizes convertibility and access for foreign investors. The economist, Hoe Ee Khor, argues that the U.S. dollar's dominance is waning and that the yuan could serve as a viable alternative. To achieve this, China needs to deepen its financial markets and improve access to yuan-denominated assets for foreigners. Convertibility remains a key concern for investors outside the mainland. </p>
