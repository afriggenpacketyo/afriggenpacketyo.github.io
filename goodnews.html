          <h2>California Governor Proposes Pause to Immigrant Healthcare Expansion Amid Budget Deficit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 21:00:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed pausing the enrollment of more low-income immigrants without legal status for state-funded healthcare benefits in 2026 due to a $12 billion budget deficit. This decision is driven by higher-than-expected program costs and economic uncertainty from federal tariff policies. While the freeze does not affect those already enrolled, new applicants will be ineligible for Medi-Cal starting in 2026. Additionally, starting in 2027, adults with 'unsatisfactory immigration status' on Medi-Cal will have to pay a $100 monthly premium. Newsom's office estimates these changes will save the state $5.4 billion by 2028-2029.</p>

          <p>A South Los Angeles couple, Gustavo Torres and Kiara Jaime-Flores, are facing federal charges for allegedly using their car to try to impede and pursue federal immigration agents serving search warrants. The charges stem from an incident in February when the couple allegedly blocked the agents' vehicles and followed them aggressively. Jaime-Flores admitted that she and Torres opposed the immigration agent‚Äôs activities, and a photo found on her phone showed a message urging others to join the fight against immigration officials. Torres admitted to blocking the vehicles and driving aggressively around them, expressing regret for his actions.</p>

          <p>After Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced, paving the way for their possible release after more than three decades in prison, their lawyer noted how much the world has changed since their initial trial in the 1990s. The Menendez brothers, who were convicted of murdering their parents, had their case reconsidered due to legislative reforms aimed at reducing prison overcrowding. Their defense invoked the criminal justice policies of the 1990s and argued that under today‚Äôs mores the brothers merited a second chance. The case has been influenced by changes in popular culture, social media campaigns, and evolving attitudes towards sexual abuse.</p>

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States fell by nearly 30,000 last year, signaling progress against the opioid crisis. Experts attribute the decline to changes in the illicit drug supply and greater access to treatment and naloxone. Despite the positive trend, the Trump administration is proposing cuts to federal health programs, including those addressing the drug crisis.
