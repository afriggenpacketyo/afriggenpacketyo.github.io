          <p>India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), maintained its policy rate at 5.5% on Wednesday, aligning with economists' expectations, as inflation moderated significantly in the first quarter. Governor Sanjay Malhotra noted that while inflation cooled, growth could decelerate in the second half of the financial year due to global trade uncertainties. Despite August inflation undershooting the RBI's target band, the central bank opted against an interest rate cut, even as the U.S. imposed additional tariffs on Indian exports. The Indian government has reduced goods and services tax on several items to spur domestic demand ahead of the festive season and mitigate tariff impacts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers quickly asserted their postseason dominance, securing a decisive 10-5 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in Game 1 of their wild-card series. Shohei Ohtani launched a leadoff home run, immediately setting an aggressive offensive tone, as the Dodgers ultimately matched a franchise postseason record with five home runs. Starting pitcher Blake Snell delivered a superb performance, going seven innings and allowing only two runs, effectively stifling the Reds' offense. While the bullpen experienced a brief, unsettling moment in the eighth inning, the team ultimately held on for the win, demonstrating their readiness and strong momentum as they aim to swiftly advance towards another World Series title.</p>

          <p>Young Americans are increasingly opting for skilled trades like electricians and plumbers, driven by high college tuition costs and the growing threat of artificial intelligence to white-collar jobs. Many Gen Zers are concerned about student loan debt and prioritize jobs that are difficult to automate, seeing more security in manual trades than in fields like software development or accounting. This shift challenges decades of emphasis on college diplomas, as the unemployment rate for recent college graduates rises, while non-college-educated workers in the same age group experience a smaller increase. The article highlights a changing perception of blue-collar work as a viable and secure career path.</p>

          <p>Despite a U.S. government shutdown, the 74 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits will continue to get their monthly checks, as these payments are covered by mandatory, pre-approved spending. However, the Social Security Administration's (SSA) customer services may face disruptions due to potential furloughs of nearly 90% of its workforce. Services such as benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and replacement Medicare cards could be halted. Additionally, the annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) could be delayed if the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index data, typically released in October, is impacted by the shutdown.</p>

A’ja Wilson led the charge with 35 points, while Jackie Young delivered career playoff highs of 32 points and 10 assists, marking a historic achievement as the first teammates to each score over 30 points in a WNBA playoff game. Chelsea Gray contributed significantly with eight of her 17 points in overtime, cementing the win for Las Vegas. Despite the short-handed Fever pushing the game to extra time, even after losing a star guard to injury and a key center to foul trouble, the Aces' late-game surge proved decisive.</p>

This subsidiary manages 38 gas pipelines and two export terminals in the UAE. The investment, whose value was undisclosed, signifies KKR's commitment to expanding its presence and partnerships across the Middle East, citing the region's strong fundamentals and attractive opportunities. David Petraeus, KKR partner and chairman of KKR Global Institute and KKR Middle East, emphasized the strategic importance of this move.

          <p>China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) has agreed to a US$1.4 billion deal to rehabilitate and upgrade the Tazara Railway, a critical 1,860km line connecting Zambia’s Copperbelt to Tanzania’s Dar es Salaam port. The investment, comprising an initial US$1.1 billion and a further US$238 million reinvestment, aims to boost the railway's capacity, which is currently far below its potential. This strategic move provides China with a vital alternative route for copper and cobalt shipments to the Indian Ocean, positioning Tazara ahead of competing US-backed and Japan-supported corridors in Africa, and includes significant additions to rolling stock.

          <p>The U.S. State Department, representing the United States, conveyed congratulations to the people of China on the 76th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. The message, released on September 30, extended wishes for "health, happiness, prosperity and peace" in the coming year. This year's prompt delivery of congratulations stands in notable contrast to the previous year, when then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken's message was posted after the official National Day, a delay that occurred amidst elevated tensions between the two global powers. The timely nature of this diplomatic gesture could suggest a subtle effort to maintain or improve bilateral relations.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge in Nevada ruled that Sigal Chattah, a Trump-appointed federal prosecutor, is not legally serving as acting U.S. attorney, leading to her disqualification from supervising several criminal cases. Chattah's initial 120-day temporary appointment as interim U.S. attorney was circumvented when the Justice Department reassigned her to a different position, enabling her to continue leading the office. The judge sided with criminal defendants who contended this maneuver violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, which mandates that such vacancies be filled by the first assistant U.S. attorney. This decision represents the second instance where a judge has partially sidelined a Trump administration prosecutor, raising questions about appointment procedures.</p>

          <p>Bear 32 Chunk has been crowned the champion of Katmai National Park and Preserve's "biggest Fat Bear Week yet," securing victory in the annual bracket-style competition with an impressive 96,350 votes. Despite enduring a broken jaw for most of the season, Chunk, widely recognized as "the most dominant brown bear on the river," captivated voters with his extraordinary ability to accumulate significant weight in preparation for winter hibernation. This year's contest garnered over 1.5 million public votes, a new record, celebrating the bears' crucial survival efforts. Chunk's triumph notably dethroned two-time champion 128 Grazer, whose cub, 128 Jr., simultaneously won the fattest cub competition, adding a compelling "royal family" dynamic to the park's beloved ursine narrative.</p>
